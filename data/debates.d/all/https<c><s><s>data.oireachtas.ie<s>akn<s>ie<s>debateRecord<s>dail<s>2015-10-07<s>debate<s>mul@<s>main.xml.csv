He mentioned repeatedly the figure of €5,000. It appears as if there could be a 25% shortfall in the expenditure on the first tranche of the scheme. The Minister announced a second tranche of the scheme but he has cut that back severely. Is he satisfied he will achieve his target of reaching 50,000 farmers at an average payment of €5,000? I presume he will increase the number to 60,000 if the average payment is less than that figure. Will he advise why there are these cutbacks so early in the scheme which will hurt farmers?
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	1	First, there are no cutbacks early in the scheme. Second, we always said the maximum payment for GLAS was €5,000, or €7,000 for GLAS+. We also said that we thought the average payment would be very close to the maximum payment of €5,000 because the majority of farmers would be able to draw down the full amount. Let us be accurate about what was said rather than trying to change things. The first tranche of GLAS has proved to be hugely successful, attracting nearly 27,000 applicants in all. Applications were received from every single county and virtually every action was selected at some stage. On the basis of the interest shown to date, I have no doubt that GLAS will succeed in attracting the 50,000 applications projected over the lifetime of the scheme. We have a projected figure of about €250 million of expenditure per year when the full 50,000 applicants are in the scheme, but we always said this would have to happen on a phased basis. Farming organisations bought into that at the time. We have 27,000 applications now. We will open applications for tranche two next week, which will take into another 10,000. Therefore, we will have roughly 36,000 farmers in GLAS by next year, with the second tranche starting from 1 January. We will then progress after that to move up to the full 50,000 applicants when we can afford to do it. Nobody was suggesting or expecting that we would have the full 50,000 applicants in the scheme in the first year. That would be totally unrealistic. I expect that the first approvals for GLAS will issue next week or very shortly thereafter. On the basis of the expected intake, expenditure this year on GLAS will be €20 million. Preparations for the discussions on 2016 Estimate for next year are under way and we will hear much more about that next week.

Will he further confirm that those payments will issue by Christmas-----

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	7	Okay.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	8	There seem to be confusing messages on that. Will those farmers be paid by Christmas? The Minister seems to be indicating they will. Where there are prime work plans and where commonages are not yet prepared and may not be prepared for some considerable time, will those farmers get paid with effect from 1 October this year and will they get paid by Christmas this year? The IFA has sought funding of €250 million next year for 50,000 GLAS and agri-environment options scheme, AEOS, participants in 2016. Will the Minister confirm whether €250 million will be provided for GLAS and AEOS next year?
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	9	We want to pay out on GLAS for the last three months of this year - October, November and December - which is what we said we would do and which we are seeking to deliver. We are also seeking to take in as many new applicants under tranche 2 as we can. We have put a figure of 10,000 on that. We will not have 50,000 farmers in GLAS next year, rather we will have about 36,000 in it.That is always what I said I would do and I have been totally consistent in this regard. When people asked initially about the maximum number of people to come into GLAS, many people were talking about 15,000 or 20,000 farmers. We have taken in 27,000 farmers and are now about to take in another 10,000. Of course, farming organisations have a job to do in lobbying me to try to get as many farmers into GLAS as they can, and I respect that. I will deliver as many as I can, but we have to operate within budgets that are growing year on year. Agriculture will have an increasing budget every year between now and 2020. We have secured that and delivered it in terms of the rural development programme. However, all the farming organisations that have been involved in this discussion know that we cannot do it overnight, so we will build up to it. Next year, we will have 36,000 while the following year we will take in another tranche to bring it up as soon as we can to the full 50,000 and spend the full €250 million on GLAS that is envisaged as soon as that can be afforded.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	11	We will sort it out, yes.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	12	-----the Minister will have 50,000 farmers and there will be a total gross expenditure of €250 million. As the Minister knows, the later people join GLAS, the bigger the proportion of the payment that will not fall under this rural development programme. It will fall into the next RDP, but the commitment in the RDP is for €1.25 billion. In fact, it is €1.4 billion for environmental schemes in total but €1.25 billion for GLAS within this RDP. I understand that part of that GLAS payment is rural environment protection scheme and AEOS spillover from the previous RDP. The first question, which is quite simple, is whether we will spend €250 million between REPS and AEOS. The second question is whether contracts will be backdated to 1 October to enable this payment to be made, as the Minister said, for October, November and December. Third, will the Minister pay for commonage measures even where those commonage plans have not been completed by the end of the year or may only be completed through three or four weeks? It is a very slow process walking all these commonages and preparing reports.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	13	I call on the Minister to conclude.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	14	I am delivering what I said I would deliver, which is to increase incrementally and as quickly as we can the numbers coming into GLAS to get expenditure up to the maximum we have committed to under the scheme. We are getting there faster than I think most people predicted, but it cannot happen overnight and everybody understands that. There is a particular challenge with putting commonage GLAS in place, something the Deputy and I have spoken about many times. That is why we are showing significant flexibility in giving time to get full sign-off on those GLAS plans. There will be plenty of time to get that finished. In the meantime, farmers will be paid as long as they have committed to adherence to that plan, even before it is fully finalised and signed off. The commitment they are making in commonage areas will ensure they get early receipt of their GLAS payment, which is about as flexible as we could possibly be. A huge number of commonage farmers are now part of the GLAS commonage project. It has been very successful as anyone would have to accept. When one looks at what is being committed to now in terms of some of the headline outcomes from GLAS, they are hugely successful. They include hectarage covered as well as commitments to hedgerows, native trees, orchards and stone walling. Some 90,000 bird boxes and 80,000 bat boxes are to be erected in addition to protecting 3,000 archaeological monuments and planting 8,000 hectares of wild bird cover. GLAS is about delivering sustainable outcomes across farmland in rural Ireland and paying farmers properly to do that. We will have 50,000 farmers as part of that scheme within the next few years. There will be a cross-section across all farming activities, but in particular there will be a very strong cohort of commonage farmers.

The Minister was also investigating whether the activity was being facilitated by a senior milk producer. In reply to a question that I tabled on 22 September 2015, the Minister initially stated that he was getting the Chief State Solicitor to investigate the matter. In his reply to me, the Minister said, "Having regard to an opinion from the Chief State Solicitor’s Office, and having considered all of the facts, the recommendation from my Department is that on balance, a prosecution is not warranted in this instance." Will the Minister explain the opinion from the Chief State Solicitor and why no prosecution is taking place in this case?
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	16	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. My Department has carried out an investigation into allegations that milk collections from a milk supplier were credited to another milk supplier and that this was being facilitated by the milk purchaser concerned. Having received the report on the investigation, I instructed that a number of corrective actions be undertaken by all parties concerned, including the reallocation of milk to the original supplier and the payment of the superlevy fine by the supplier concerned. All such corrective actions were completed within the relevant milk quota year, and the end-of-year annual declaration for the milk producers concerned reflected the adjusted and correct position. In addition to requiring the above actions, I also instructed that the relevant papers be sent to the Chief State Solicitor's office for advice on whether offences had been committed and, if so, the possibility and likelihood of a successful prosecution. The Chief State Solicitor's office subsequently appointed a prosecuting counsel to examine the facts of the case and this counsel’s report was forwarded to my Department. My Department subsequently met the senior counsel to discuss the report. Having regard to counsel’s opinion and to all the circumstances in this case, my Department recommended that a prosecution should not be pursued and I accepted this recommendation. In making its recommendation, my Department took a number of matters into account, including the likelihood of a successful prosecution given the details of the case and the standard of proof required, the fact there was no financial gain for any of the parties concerned, the fact the parties’ obligations under the milk quota regulations had ultimately been met, that all superlevies due were paid in full and, most important, that there was no financial loss to other farmers, the Exchequer or to the EU. My Department is completing a full compliance verification audit of the processor concerned.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	17	I do not understand how a milk producer 110 miles away from Clongowes Wood supplied Clongowes Wood with 500,000 litres of milk which in turn supplied Glanbia and the outcome of all this was that no prosecution took place. What is quite clear to me is that there was sleight of hand with 500,000 litres of milk being transferred 110 miles to Clongowes Wood which in turn sold that milk to Glanbia. The architects of this were a manager in Clongowes Wood and a manager in Glanbia. It is only when this came to light through John Mooney in The Sunday Times newspaper that an investigation was initiated. The investigation lasted 15 months, from June 2014 to September 2015. It is clear that here was an attempt to commit fraud which was successful until it was brought to light and an investigation took place. The Minister has not clarified whether the Chief State Solicitor said that a prosecution should have taken place. We do not know that.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	18	I was also concerned about this case.As soon as I heard about it, we initiated an investigation straight away. There were multiple interviews, some of them taken under caution. The matter was taken extremely seriously by my Department. The investigation has not been going on for 14 or 15 months. We had a very intensive investigation initially, as soon as we heard about this case. We needed to get to the bottom of it and we did get to the bottom of what was happening. When we completed our investigation, we sent the file then to the Office of the Chief State Solicitor. I instructed that the case would go to the Chief State Solicitor's office because I wanted an opinion from outside the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine as I felt the case merited that. The Chief State Solicitor's office asked a senior counsel to look at the matter. A report was made to us and we had a meeting on the back of that in the Department. I must go on the basis of the legal advice and recommendations I get. Having said that, we did not leave it at that. Actions have been taken on the back of this and superlevies have been paid. We have undertaken a full audit and got a full report from the processor concerned in terms of how this could have happened and to ensure it cannot happen again. A lot has taken place in a very firm way. This should not have happened. I was very unhappy that it did happen and I made that view very strongly known to everybody concerned. We had a full investigation on what happened, who was involved and how it could have happened. We also referred the matter to the Chief State Solicitor's office for it to take a look at it. From our perspective, we have taken the matter as seriously as we could have and we have taken the appropriate action on the basis of the legal advice received.

The levies that were repaid were retrospective and were only paid when the individual was caught out. It is a classic case of a fraudulent attempt to get away with more than €300,000 worth of milk, some 5.5 million litres. It is more than a year since I first raised the matter. In fairness, I have been corresponding with the Minister through parliamentary questions and by other means. In June of this year, the Minister had still not heard back from the Chief State Solicitor's office. In response to another parliamentary question on 22 September, I learned that the Minister had received a reply from the Chief State Solicitor's office. There was a reference to "having regard to his opinion". What was the opinion of the Chief State Solicitor's office? Did the office suggest proceeding with a prosecution? The situation is that somebody on the board of a major processing company in this country was a party to a fraud involving €300,000. It is very damaging for the entire industry that people would be allowed to get away with that.

We interviewed people under caution without notice. We took a very serious view of what we understood to be the situation. The investigation happened straight away. The investigation has not taken 14 months; it took place straight away and was concluded within weeks but we then handed over the file to the Chief State Solicitor's office who looked at it from a legal perspective, which is a different perspective, and asked that the office would come back to us with a recommendation as to whether we were likely to secure a prosecution. I had to make a decision on the basis of that advice.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	23	Who made the decision?

I have taken legal advice on the basis of the Chief State Solicitor's legal advice as to whether we were likely to succeed in taking a prosecution and I have taken my decision on the back of that. It is that straightforward.
#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	25	The question relates to the report of the Joint Sub-Committee on Fisheries on promoting sustainable rural coastal and island communities and the recommendations in that regard concerning heritage licences. Could the Minister indicate what progress has been made on the implementation of the recommendations in the report?
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	26	The recommendation to which the Deputy refers requests that the Government examines the feasibility of heritage licences to be issued by the Department for rural coastal and island communities. The intended objective of such licences is, according to the report, to optimally facilitate traditional fishing practices in conjunction with the establishment of a producer organisation representing vessels under a certain length overall, LOA, in these designated areas. With regard to representation for the rural coastal and island fishing communities, in May 2014 I announced the establishment of innovative consultative structures to bring Ireland’s inshore fishing communities into discussions on the future of Ireland’s seafood industry. In recognition of the need to take a different approach to communicating with Ireland’s small-scale coastal fishermen in view of the very low level of professional trade representation for this part of the industry, both regional and national structures have been put in place. The newly established National Inshore Fisheries Forum, NIFF, and Regional Inshore Fisheries Forums, RIFFs, provide areas for inshore fishermen to develop proposals on inshore fisheries management, including compliance and data gathering. The inshore forums are representative of the “under 12 m” fishing fleet, the fishing boats of less than 12 m overall length and their focus is on fisheries management in the coastal waters within six nautical miles. To date, the four NIFF meetings have led to very constructive two-way conversations on issues of mutual concern, industry priorities, emerging policies and initiatives. As a result of the successful discussions with the forum, I have included NIFF members on the quota management advisory committee, the industry science fisheries partnership and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, EMFF operational programme monitoring committee. That gives the inshore sector a role in making recommendations on the allocation of Ireland’s quotas, on data collection and scientific research and, perhaps most importantly, on how funding is utilised. The NIFF is taking the industry lead in setting priorities for the policy development for the inshore sector and recommendations from the NIFF are taken very seriously by me. If there is a view among the inshore fishing industry that we should go down such a route to try to create special licensing and conditions around the inshore fleet, we will look at that and discuss it. We are already discussing a whole series of practical things we can do to help the sector, including the development of artisan fisheries, restricting recreational potting, for example, which has been a matter of concern for years and is now being acted on for the first time, or the measure suggested by the Deputy. We will examine the matter in detail but it must be in the context of a discussion with the overall fishing industry to make sure that it will work within the context of the Common Fisheries Policy.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	27	I ask Members to please keep an eye on the clock. We are way over time.
#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	28	The question was really not about the NIFF or the RIFFs. The joint sub-committee compiled a report. It will be two years' in January since the report was published. The committee heard from a wide range of inshore fishing interests and recommendations were made by an all-party committee of the Oireachtas. It seems to me that no discussion has been taking place within the Department. One of the recommendations called for by the inshore and island fishermen was that the committee would recommend the issuing of heritage licences, which it did. Almost two years later the Department has not done anything to examine the matter. It seems that the recommendation has not even been suggested by the Department to the inshore fisheries body to examine how the system could be developed and whether it would be feasible. Given the fact that an all-party Oireachtas committee report has recommended the approach, the Department should take it seriously.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	29	The Department does take it seriously. It takes equally seriously the relationship it has developed with the inshore sector. There have been four meetings to date, all of which I have attended. We now have an opportunity to discuss a whole range of issues. Many of the recommendations in the Oireachtas committee's report have been acted upon and more will be acted upon. In regard to Oireachtas committee reports generally, in terms of how a Department responds to them, this one scores pretty well. There are restrictions and regulations within which we have to operate. Any new licensing system must be consistent with the new Common Fisheries Policy regulations. The Deputy asked that the Department of rural, coastal and island communities make a decision on that, but no such Department exists. I am the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. We will look at this, but only in the context of what is practical and real and within the parameters of the regulations within which I must operate.
#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	30	As I understand it, the Common Fisheries Policy allows member states, in developing policy in this area, to give preference to coastal and rural communities and small fisheries communities. It is up to each member state to develop that policy under the Common Fisheries Policy. As inshore fisheries is not covered by the Common Fisheries Policy, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has the discretion to examine this and to devise a policy in that regard. The Minister stated that what I am looking for is the creation of a new licensing regime. Surely the remit of the Department includes the development and protection of fishermen and rural communities. The committee's recommendation that the Department examine this issue is mild, but two years down the road it is not being actively examined.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	31	Two years down the road, it is being actively examined. That is what the Department is doing in terms of recreational fisheries, for example. We are changing that structure. We are introducing limits that will be imposed on recreational fishermen so that we can create more space for commercial fishermen. We are also expanding our V-notching programme and we have increased the compensation payments that fishermen get for putting back lobsters to improve breeding performance and so on. The Department has been working on multiple measures in terms of increasing funding and increasing the conversation, including with inshore fishermen, on policy development, budgetary decisions and quota allocation decisions in a way that they have never before been included. There has never been more interaction on a policy or funding level between the inshore sector and the Government than there is now. It would be helpful for the Deputy to recognise that.

I am seeking from the Minister information on how this money is to be disbursed, if national co-financing will be provided and when payments will be made.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	33	The Deputy's questions are fair. A package worth €500 million has been secured, which is a really good delivery by Commissioner Hogan, because the expectation was that the package would be a lot less. Approximately €420 million of the funding will be spent on what are called national envelopes to enable a positive impact within countries on the income of dairy and pig farmers. Ireland's allocation is just under €14 million. There is a facility through which, if we want, we can match that funding with Exchequer funding. My Department is in discussions on the matter with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. We need approval to provide matching funding, because to facilitate that we would have to change our Estimates. Those discussions have not yet concluded. We had a good discussion with all of the stakeholders at the first dairy forum meeting, which took place last week. The recommendation from farming organisations was that we consider the introduction of a flat payment for farmers, which would positively discriminate in favour of smaller farmers in terms of payments. Macra na Feirme made clear that it would like to see some level of top-up or priority for younger farmers, who may be more indebted because they are trying to grow their businesses, and may be under more pressure than dairy farmers who have been around longer. I agree with those recommendations. The Department's proposals in this regard have not yet been finalised but will be based on those principles. I do not propose to pay farmers on the basis of the amount of milk they produce and, therefore, give larger farmers more money. I do not think that is where the need is. In terms of the final outcome, I think most farmers, regardless of size, will receive similar payments. We may consider giving a top-up to young farmers to encourage them, which is something I have been consistently trying to do. We will work towards getting the payments out as soon as possible. I am certain they will be made within the next six weeks.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	34	I thank the Minister for the information provided at the end of his reply, which is most useful because, as he will be aware, farmers want their payments now. Will the Minister confirm whether these direct payments will be paid to pig and dairy farmers or to dairy farmers only? Also, in the context of a top-up for our farmers, is that top-up likely to be in the region of 20%? Am I correct that the payment, unless matched with Exchequer funding, will be approximately €800 per farmer? People are anxious to know the likely amount they will receive.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	35	It is true that farmers want to be paid as soon as possible from a cashflow point of view. On 16 October, a 75% advance payment on single farm payments will be made, which will amount to €750 million in payments to farmers, €250 million more than would normally be given out at that time of year. This is one of a number of measures to help farmers in terms of cashflow. There will be a lot of money coming farmers' way in the next few weeks. In terms of this particular package, I do not want to give the Deputy an exact figure because no decision has been made yet on the likely top-up amount for young farmers. While I would like to give a top-up, it may not amount to a 20% or 25% top-up.  On pig farmers, I am not sure we will take the same approach to pig farmers as we do to dairy farmers. I need to speak to the industry to understand what they want. The only conversation we have had to date has been with the dairy sector in terms of how it would like money to be paid out. We want to get that done quickly. I agree that pig farmers are also under pressure, but they are under a different structure from dairy farmers in that many of them run large operations and as such are much bigger, and also, there are not as many of them as there are dairy farmers. We need to sit down and discuss with pig farmers how they would like us to spend the limited resources available for them.  The amount of money cannot be confirmed until a final decision on whether the Exchequer will provide matching funding has been made.

I accept that the Exchequer funding issue is still up in the air. On Exchequer funding and the Minister's ability to get this money for the dairy sector, the sheep sector is also under huge pressure. The grassland scheme has been withdrawn from that sector. Perhaps the Minister, when seeking funding for the dairy sector, will also seek funding for a direct payment scheme for sheep farmers, which, as he will be aware, is being sought on behalf of that sector by the farming organisations such as the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers' Association and the Irish Farmers' Association. Will the Minister ask the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for an equivalent amount of money to be paid on a pro rata basis to sheep farmers?
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	37	This is populist stuff that the Deputy knows is not possible. There is no additional package for sheep farmers. What we are talking about is a fund provided by Europe of €500 million to support the dairy and pigmeat sectors because they have particular pricing problems this year. The price of lamb has not collapsed this year. I know sheep farmers are under pressure, which is why we made a decision as part of the new Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, to decouple the sheep grassland scheme. In order to protect that €17 million or so, we decoupled it and added it directly to single farm payments to make sure they could hold on to it.

We will do that through targeted agricultural modernisation schemes, TAMS and single farm payments in terms of redistribution, where sheep farmers are the big winners. We also did it when we decoupled and added to a sheep farmer's single farm payment what he would previously have been getting under the sheep grassland scheme. Deputy Ó Cuív knows what the rural development programme, RDP, looks like now. He also knows that if we are going to change or introduce a new scheme that has not been provided for in it, we would need formally to change the RDP with the Commission. That takes time. There is no plan to introduce a separate headage payment type scheme, which seems to be what the Deputy is looking for. If he was in my position he would not be able to do it either.

There are a lot of rumours about the percentage of farmers who have withdrawn and the numbers withdrawing on a daily basis. There is certainly much confusion and maybe dissatisfaction. Could the Minister clarify this, please?
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	58	Beef accounts for 35% of the gross output of the agriculture sector. Beef exports in 2014 amounted to 524,000 tonnes, worth €2.27 billion. The suckler herd is a critical component of this industry. The beef data and genomics programme, BDGP, is a response to these challenges and opportunities, and particularly to the challenges associated with improved breeding performance, including for maternal traits such as cow fertility, and the very onerous requirements to reduce the percentage of Ireland’s greenhouse gas emissions which comes from the agriculture sector. Improving the genetics of the suckler herd can make a positive contribution in both of these areas while also improving the economic viability of suckler farming. The BDGP provides targeted support to suckler farmers. It builds on the success of the State’s investment of over €9 million in the beef data programme in each of 2013 and 2014 and on the success of the pilot beef genomics scheme, which involved investment of around €23 million last year. The scheme was launched on 5 May last as part of Ireland’s rural development programme, RDP, and involves funding of some €300 million over six years. Scheme participants will receive a payment of €142.50 for the first 6.66 hectares and €120 for each hectare thereafter, up to a maximum payable hectarage. That is the equivalent of about €95 per cow for the first number of animals. In return for this payment, participants will be required to undertake six actions, some of which will be well known to suckler farmers through their participation in previous schemes. In recent weeks, the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation has issued every scheme applicant with detailed reports of the current status of animals in their herds. Participants will receive similar information about the scheme and their individual herd on an ongoing basis. This is in addition to a training programme which will be rolled out over the next 12 months. I have also announced a series of information meetings for participating farmers which will commence next week. It is clear from the large number of applications received for the BDGP that farmers recognise the benefits this scheme can deliver locally and nationally. Just under 30,000 farmers applied to join the scheme and the number of those who have since exited the scheme, equivalent to about 5% of applicants, is more or less in line with previous suckler-based schemes run by my Department. The figures as requested are set out in the table which the Deputy will get, if he does not have it. The table outlines per county the number of applicants and the numbers of farmers who have withdrawn. The counties that have the most applicants obviously have the most withdrawals, as one would expect. The predictions some were making that huge numbers would withdraw from the scheme simply have not come true.

I thank the Minister for his reply. I think initially he was hoping 35,000 people would join the scheme. By 5 June around 30,000 applicants had applied. I have seen figures suggesting ten people a day were withdrawing from the scheme. Other people were saying 700 farmers had withdrawn previously. Earlier this month the Department said there was a 2% withdrawal rate. Is the Minister now saying it is 5%?

When people are very worried and confused and do not have enough information, rumours can start and that is how people start to withdraw. It is very important that those information meetings take place. All of us who are involved in politics would like to make sure people get the best out of that programme. The Minister needs to clarify much of the information.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	63	Let me just be clear. When we launched the scheme we probably should have had more information meetings earlier. I accept that. I attended a number of the meetings myself. While there were a lot of people who were concerned about elements of the scheme, I do not think those concerns were well founded in many cases. We have managed to clarify a lot of those things. I have written to everybody in the scheme outlining the scheme, its requirements, how it is going to work and how we are going to help farmers to make sure it works for them. We will spend about €44 million or €45 million on the scheme this year. One of the commitments I gave to all farming organisations was that we would get a lot of payments out this year on the schemes. We now have a lot of farmers looking to come in to the scheme who did not decide to enter it at the start but are now reassured by the messages that have gone out. They want to be part of the scheme and cannot get in. There are also some farmers deciding that maybe it is not for them. That is fine too; it happens with every scheme.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	65	There is no mass exodus here. I would like to reassure farmers that this is a really good scheme. In ten or 15 years it will prove to be one of the most innovative schemes that has ever been introduced in any European country in terms of upgrading the genetics of a herd and providing farmers with more and more accurate scientific information about better breeding programmes. It is a huge income support for beef farmers. Most importantly, it will improve the quality of our herd which means cattle will grow faster and have better conformation and fertility rates. They will make more money for farmers and will produce fewer emissions in their lifetimes.

I think most farmers would now agree that the qualification criteria and benchmarks they have to meet on that journey are very achievable in the timescale that has been outlined. In fact, the vast majority of farmers are already where they would need to be by about 2018.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	68	The Minister said that a number of farmers are trying to get into the scheme now and cannot. Is that because the closing date is gone? Can they get in next year?
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	69	We will take a look at that. I obviously want to spend the full amount of money that we have allocated for the scheme over the six years. We now need to consider whether we can afford to take more farmers in, how we could do that, who the farmers are and whether we should prioritise younger farmers or new entrants.That is a decision we will make next year when we see how much money we are spending. I want as many suckler beef farmers in this scheme as we can get because it is a really good scheme and I want to ensure we spend the full €300 million on the scheme over its lifetime. We will figure out how best to do that and we will obviously discuss that with farming organisations to ensure they are comfortable with it.

There is concern over whether the options for hedgerow planting and low input permanent pasture will remain the same.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	71	I thank the Deputy for asking the question because it gives me the opportunity to clarify a number of matters. I know Deputy Ó Cuív asked the question earlier. For the second tranche of GLAS, which I intend to launch next week, I have revisited the various actions that will be available to farmers in the light of the substantial progress made to date. GLAS differs from previous schemes in that it adopts a very targeted approach to meeting its environmental objectives and the RDP includes a provision for review and reassessment after the first tranche. Not all the actions which have met or exceeded targets require to be adjusted, given that the associated spend is in many cases relatively easily accommodated in within the total budget.  However, given the very high uptake of low input permanent pasture, it is proposed to adjust the provision of this action under the next tranche. It will still be possible to take up to 10 ha of either low input permanent pasture or traditional hay meadow as before, but the low input permanent pasture component will be limited to 5 ha. The average application for low input permanent pasture so far has been about 7.5 ha, so we will reduce that slightly. While this means that we will still see permanent pasture coming into GLAS, I hope it will encourage more farmers to take the hay meadow option, which is well behind target, and which delivers the same payment per hectare.  I am proposing to suspend the planting of new hedgerows for the second tranche, along with the planting of traditional orchards. Both actions have met their targets for the entire RDP, and there are concerns about the availability of planting stock. I will, however, review this in the third tranche. Most of the concern I have heard is about the planting of hedgerows.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	73	Under the first tranche, so far 8 million plants have been ordered. Our contacts with the forestry service and relevant nurseries indicate they will have serious difficulty supplying even the quantity of planting stock in the timeframe required for the tranche one applicants.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	75	We are changing the hedgerow option for practical reasons. First, we have already met the target for that item for the whole of GLAS in tranche one. Second, our industry has real problems even with our current commitments as opposed to opening an entire new tranche on it. In other words, to solve this problem we would need to import huge volumes of trees, which is a disease risk and a concern so we are taking a practical approach here. From an environmental point of view, we have already met and surpassed our targets on this. Our nurseries have reached capacity and are already stretched to deliver on tranche one.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	76	I thank the Minister.

#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	78	I will come back to the Minister.

Similar to the issue with the low input permanent pasture, his main approach here is based on the fact that the uptake is high. There is no reason to change the low input permanent pasture. Unfortunately, the impact will be that, particularly for smaller farmers in my county of Donegal, many farmers who under tranche one were able to achieve the full €5,000 payment under this environmental scheme will now only be able to achieve €3,000 largely because the Minister is removing the low input permanent pasture measure. In many ways GLAS has been a disappointment to some farmers in that it was not what was expected. However, the Minister is making this change without any prior notification affecting farmers who have been waiting for tranche two for various reasons, some of which relate to the confusion the Minister caused over the commonage issue, which affected 40% of farmers in County Donegal. Initially he wanted 80% to sign up to a commonage grazing plan. The plan then became 50% and now it is a guideline.

Many farmers delayed their applications until tranche two because they had to divide up parcels. Entire parcels had to be entered into certain measures, for example, the low input permanent pasture measure.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	84	I thank the Deputy. I call the Minister.

They have many options available to them and they need to look at the list in terms of what suits their farming structures and apply them. The Deputy said that many commonage farmers were confused and therefore waited for the second tranche. Low input permanent pasture has nothing to do with that.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	89	They will be coming under a commonage GLAS plan if they are commonage farmers. As we are spending EU money - a lot of it - as well as Exchequer money, we have an obligation to ensure that we set targets at the start of the scheme outlining what we want done for the money. If in the first tranche we are getting a significant amount of one measure done and not much in the other areas, we need to try to rebalance. The farming organisations have strongly welcomed the changes making it easier to get into the scheme for farmers in an SAC or if they have rare birds, for example, a hen harrier. It is now easier for those in that category to get into GLAS and increase their payments.

However, he is now saying that because the low input permanent pasture has met the quota, he is obliged to change it. The reality is that the Minister has a choice in this. Many farmers do not have other options which might be available to them given the circumstances of their individual farms. Many of them depended on the low input permanent pasture option. Many were also depending on the hedgerow option and because the Minister has now without notice removed that, many of those farmers-----

I do not accept that farmers do not have alternatives. I think, quite frankly, that the Deputy is taking the lazy option, in terms of what he is saying.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	114	We are trying to offer every farmer options in terms of GLAS, but we are also trying to ensure that we get appropriate value for money in terms of environmental outcomes. The tranches will change slightly to make sure that we continue to deliver the correct outcomes. That is all that is happening. There is still an option for low-income permanent pasture. The average application for that is just over 7 ha, and we are now making it 5 ha. It is a slight adjustment and farmers should be able to adjust to that.

Can the Minister clarify whether that money is also available to individual farmers? The second element is the possibility of a measure under the rural development programme. Perhaps the Minister could outline his position on that. Many farmers thought they would get access to EIB money.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	116	My Department has been exploring new and more competitive sources of funding for Irish agriculture and will continue to do so in the context of evolving market requirements. For example, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, which includes the European Investment Bank, EIB, as one of its funding partners, has recently announced a new agriculture investment loans product. This credit is available at favourable terms for investments by agricultural SMEs involved in primary agricultural production, the processing of agricultural products or the marketing of agricultural products. The features of these products compared with those currently on the market are lower interest rates, loan amounts of up to €5 million and increased repayment flexibility. Of the almost €45 million in loans approved and drawn down by SMEs between March and the end of June from the SBCI, a third has been accessed by the agricultural sector. Things are already happening. As to the EIB itself, earlier this year, the European Commission and the EIB presented a model guarantee instrument for agriculture, developed within the framework of their memorandum of understanding on co-operation in agriculture and rural development within the EU. The model instrument aims to help to ease access to finance for farmers and other rural businesses. Member states and regions can adapt and use this model to set up financial instruments funded by their rural development programmes, RDPs under the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, EAFRD. Financial instruments can take the form of loans, guarantee funds or equity investments. The funding for any such financial instruments would have to draw on Ireland’s existing RDP allocation of EAFRD funding as well as national Exchequer funding. It is also possible to incorporate funding from other sources for such instruments.  In our RDP we have made a commitment to examining the potential for the use of financial instruments. However, the inclusion of financial instruments by way of a modification to the RDP is required by EU regulation to be based on an ex ante evaluation which must assess the existence of a market failure, the potential for added value, the resources required to implement a proposed financial instrument and the proposed strategic approach to financial instruments. In other words, it is possible but work is required.

The Minister's reply, which is similar to one I received yesterday, refers specifically to SMEs. Can the money be accessed by individual farmers for ordinary farming business or is it limited to SMEs, as we understand them? If one was to avail of the second fund, would the RDP have to be adjusted and the funding for existing RDPs reduced? Would it be a question of robbing Peter and paying Paul? Has the Minister commissioned the ex ante report? From what he said, I understand he would have to do that before making progress with the European Union. I have three specific questions, and perhaps this time I could get specific answers rather than the Minister rambling all around the world, not answering questions and wasting time.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	118	I gave the Deputy fairly specific answers, but the problem is that a lot of the time he does not like the answers.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	119	The Minister never gives us answers. He was there for two minutes, but never actually answered the question.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	120	The truth is that the solutions we are putting in place are not those the Deputy would put in place, which would, by and large, be to the detriment of agriculture. The kind of innovative thinking we are now talking about with the EIB is not the kind of thing on which the Deputy would have focused. My understanding is that primary food producers and SMEs, including farmers, can access the SBCI money. I met Ulster Bank and Bank of Ireland at CEO level yesterday to discuss some of the things they are doing in this area and I will meet AIB tomorrow. In terms of the RDP, we have a set amount of money we can spend, namely, just under €4 billion. The EIB is trying to complement that spend. People who are using grant aid to upgrade their farmyards, for example, should be able to borrow the balance from competitive funds that can be put in place to do that. If we can show there is market failure in certain areas, in other words, that farmers or the agricultural industry cannot get competitive finance in the normal way or we can show that there is the potential for added value to an investment in a certain area, and if that is consistent with EU policy, which is always a test for EIB investment, we should be able to draw down money to do that. Such money would probably come through the existing banking system, as is the case with the SBCI, or perhaps through new financial models for farmers. That is yet to be put in place. 
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	121	One thing I learned was that when civil servants write replies they tend to be quite careful with the wording. The Minister's reply uses the phrase "SMEs" twice. Individual farmers are not normally referred to as SMEs. Could the Minister find out in the next two days whether farmers can access funding from the SBCI and write to me and other Opposition spokespersons with the information? The reply he gave to my question seems to be at variance with what he just said. My second question was whether the Minister has started on the ex ante report, because I understand it is the first step on the road and if it is not done we cannot go anywhere. It was a very specific question. Has he commissioned the ex ante  report? It is no good discussing EIB funds and their fantastic benefits unless we take the first step on the road. To say that money is available at competitive rates from the banks here, when the variable rates are crazy compared to what is available in Europe, shows that the Government has failed to deal with variable rates.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	126	I think so, but I can confirm that for the Deputy. As usual, he sees a conspiracy around every corner.On the second issue, the wording of the rural development programme being submitted to the Commission includes a provision to draw down EIB money, but we will need to follow through with a more exact commitment to do this. This is the type of ex ante evaluation that the Deputy is speaking about.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	128	I agree with the Deputy on one thing, which I made clear last night: the interest rates charged to farmers in Ireland - and agriculture represents a very large percentage of the loan book in all three of our pillar banks that lend to agriculture - are not as competitive as they should be. If we could get EIB funding into Ireland, we may be able to force this down through competition, which is the most likely way to get a significant reaction.

There is a concern that farmers who have sheep and cattle will gravitate towards the cattle groups, and sheep farming could be undermined because of this.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	130	This is an issue. At present, the rule is that a farmer can be in only one discussion group, because otherwise he or she will receive a double payment. A discussion group involves peer discussions and strategic talk, with advisers and farmers speaking to each other about how to improve their businesses. It also involves visits to farms to develop plans to improve practice. If a farmer is in more than one discussion group, he or she will receive multiple plans on the same farm and will be paid for all of them. We are trying to get as many farmers into discussion groups as we can, and if we have a lot of farmers in two discussion groups because they happen to have a sheep operation and a beef operation, we will keep other people out. We are looking at ways to have a practical outcome that would allow farmers interested in improving beef and sheep practices, or other multiple mixed farming activities, to benefit from being in more than one discussion group in terms of upgrading their facilities or their business. We are looking at how we can facilitate this within the rules. I do not want to pay farmers twice and keep other farmers out of discussion groups who might like to be in them. There are also issues regarding whether a father and son could be in two different discussion groups. They may already be in existing discussion groups which are now becoming formal discussion groups. We certainly do not want people to have to leave a discussion group model that may have been working very well over recent years and which may not have been paid. There are some practical implementation issues in terms of the roll-out of the knowledge transfer groups, but they are sensible practical things that we are trying to overcome with the farming organisations, and I think we will be able to come up with sensible conclusions on this.
#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	131	I can see the difficulty the Minister has with double payments. Perhaps a sliding scale could be used. If a farmer has sheep and cattle and is in a cattle discussion group, the measures recommended in a farm improvement plan might be slightly different for the sheep element of the farming activity. There should be a way to get around this. When does the Minister expect to reach a conclusion in deciding whether it can be facilitated?
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	132	It is an ongoing conversation in the Department. Many farmers have said to me that they only want to be paid once but they would like to go into two discussion groups if possible because they want to make sure they are plugged into the latest knowledge on sheep as well as beef. This is not an unreasonable request. At present we are figuring out how to accommodate this with regard to paying the advisers and facilitators if farmers turn up who are not being paid for that discussion group. What is interesting is the appetite to be in discussion groups and the fact that farmers want to be in more than one because they have more than one operation and are asking how this can be facilitated. It is not necessarily about being paid for both; it is about getting the knowledge from both, and we are trying to facilitate this. It is a priority at present because we will roll out more discussion groups later in the autumn.

#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	134	I move amendment No. 2:In page 7, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following:
"Amendment of section 46(1) of Act of 2004
9 Section 46(1) of the Act of 2004 is amended by the substitution of the following paragraph for paragraph (a):"(a) (i) notify any registrar in writing in a form for the time being standing approved by an tArd-Chláraitheoir of their intention to marry —(I) not less than 3 months prior to the date on which the marriage is to be solemnised, or(II) at any time prior to the date on which the marriage is to be solemnised where the parties to the intended marriage are parties to a subsisting civil partnership with each other and have previously either complied with section 59B(1)(a) in respect of that civil partnership or been exempted from such compliance by order of the Circuit Court or the High Court under section 59B(2),or(ii) are granted an exemption from the application of subparagraph (i)(I) under section 47 and give a copy of the court order granting the exemption to any registrar before the date aforesaid,".I signalled this amendment on Committee Stage. Its purpose is to remove the requirement for civil partners who have registered a civil partnership in Ireland to give three months' notice when seeking to marry one another. The amendment is to reduce any unnecessary administrative burden on civil partners wishing to marry. When the Civil Registration Act 2004 was being debated the purpose of the notice period was explained as giving a couple sufficient time to consider the magnitude of the step they were taking in deciding to marry. In the case of civil partners who have registered a civil partnership here, they will already have complied with an equivalent requirement before registering their civil partnership or received a court exemption from it. In addition, from a purely practical perspective, they will have established their identities for the registrar and provided the evidence that is normally needed by the registrar when establishing whether a couple can marry.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	135	I welcome the amendment tabled by the Minister. Couples who have entered into civil partnerships have already paid a civil partnership fee to the celebrant or State, which was the equivalent of the fee paid when celebrating a marriage in a marriage registry office.I note the Government has made a decision that a reduced fee will be payable for those couples who are civil partners and who now want to celebrate a marriage. I suggest to the Minister that there should be no fee payable. No heterosexual couple which has celebrated a marriage in a registry office, for example, and paid the fee would have to pay the fee a second time. It is not the fault of couples party to civil partnership that they are placed in a position now where if they wish to be formally recognised as married, they must effectively be party to a second ceremony. I know people welcome the fact that they can get married and the relationship they have will be recognised as a marital relationship but in the unusual circumstances that arise, there is no justification for those who entered into civil partnerships having to pay a second fee to the State for the privilege of having to marry. I welcome the decision for a reduced fee but I urge that there be no fee. I can see no reason for a fee and the reduced fee, as I understand it, is a relatively small amount. I believe it is €50 but I am sure the Minister can clarify that. In the context of the funds that the Exchequer may need, the fee is generally an irrelevance. It would be a good and appropriate gesture in recognising the enormous and beneficial change that we are bringing about if the fee in its entirety was waived.
#JerryButtimer	unknown-#JerryButtimer-party	unknown-#JerryButtimer-dob	unknown-#JerryButtimer-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	136	I agree with Deputy Shatter's suggestion. I welcome the amendment and the reduced fee. We can consider this in the context of from where we have come. Civil partnership, as the State allowed it, was the only legal recognition that men and women of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, LGBT, community could get but because of the vote of the people, we are no longer being locked out. We are being included. As Deputy Shatter has correctly said, a fee was paid by people entering civil partnership. We have also changed the way in which registrars can celebrate marriages, such as the venue. I am not quite sure how much it would cost the State to waive the fee and I understand fees must be paid. The number of people already in a civil partnership is not staggeringly high and it would be a great gesture from our State to say to those people who before 2015 could only go to a certain point and were locked out of marriage, but now, because of the will of the people, they are included. It would be a great gesture to people already in civil partnerships. This is an idea that may not be possible because of administrative fees but it would send a powerful message. One might argue that we are being a bit pedantic. Deputy Shatter used the word "unusual" but there was a uniqueness in civil partnership and what we are doing now. This would be a great gesture, if it can be done, so we should look at doing it.

I am delighted that two of my colleagues brought it up. As we all know, the only option open to LGBT couples up until now has been civil partnership. That was through no fault of their own, as other speakers have pointed out. If civil marriage had been open to LGBT people in the past, most of them would have embraced that option. Given that the opportunity was not open, and in light of the spirit of the law, if it is possible to acknowledge this issue, it would be greatly appreciated. I support the investigation of the option. It would be in the spirit of the matter, recognising the huge outpouring of happiness and joy that we saw in this country when the referendum was overwhelmingly passed. The people we represent in the rest of society would echo our comments. If it is possible for the Minister to examine Deputy Shatter's proposal, I and many others outside the Chamber would most certainly support the opportunity to look at it.

I have certainly had no feedback from anybody in that regard. A number of people suggested a reduced fee in view of the costs already incurred by couples. Deputy Shatter also suggested a reduced fee. We have examined the issue and I got some legal advice to ensure there were no issues relating to it. We have decided to reduce the fee by 75%. The amount is very low, reflecting the Government's desire to support civil partners wishing to marry. My main concern is to move this legislation through the Dáil and Seanad as quickly as possible. I do not want to delay it in any way. This is an issue that will be dealt with by the Department of Social Protection, as it comes under civil registration. I will take some further advice on it but right now the decision has been made and noted by the Government to reduce the fee to €50. That has been welcomed by everybody, as has the amendment I introduced today making the three-month period unnecessary.

However, it would be an appropriate and right gesture for the State to make in the circumstances of the enactment of the legislation. It would recognise the fact that everybody should be treated equally. If nothing else, it is symbolic, saying to a couple which has entered into civil partnership that they will not be charged something extra over and above what a heterosexual couple in a registry office may have had to pay in the past few years to have the formal status of marriage attached to the relationship.

“Amendment of section 5 of Act of 2010
12. The Act of 2010 is amended by the substitution of the following section for section 5:“5. (1) The Minister may, by order, declare that a class of legal relationship entered into by two parties is entitled to be recognised as a civil partnership if under the law of the jurisdiction in which the legal relationship was entered into—(a) the relationship is exclusive in nature,(b) the relationship is permanent unless the parties dissolve it through the courts,(c) the relationship has been registered under the law of that jurisdiction, and(d) the rights and obligations attendant on the relationship are, in the opinion of the Minister, sufficient to indicate that the relationship would be treated comparably to a civil partnership.(2) An order under subsection (1) entitles and obliges the parties to the legal relationship to be treated as civil partners under the law of the State from the later of—(a) the day which is 21 days after the date on which the order is made,and(b) the day on which the relationship was registered under the law of the jurisdiction in which it was entered into.(3) Where an order is made under subsection (1), a dissolution of a legal relationship under the law of the jurisdiction in which it was entered into, or under the law of any other jurisdiction in respect of which a class of legal relationship has been declared by an order made under that subsection to be entitled to be recognised as a civil partnership, shall be recognised as a dissolution and deemed to be a dissolution under section 110, and any former parties to such a relationship shall not be treated as civil partners under the law of the State from the later of—(a) the day which is 21 days after the date on which the order is made,and(b) the day on which the dissolution became effective under the law of the relevant jurisdiction.(4) Every order made by the Minister under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the order is passed by either such House within the next 21 days on which that House has sat after the order is laid before it, the order shall be annulled accordingly but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done under it.".".I suppose this has been discussed in some detail on Second Stage, when I raised it, and on Committee Stage, when I indicated that I would put down amendments. I did not get to press the first amendment. The Minister argues that the advice from the Attorney General's office is that we must get rid of the institution of civil partnership. I find that hard to accept but that is the advice. What I find much harder to accept is the fact that advice that nobody in this House will ever see is effectively used to clobber debate. I am sure that if I called the Attorney General and asked her for advice as a Member of this House, she would ask me what I was doing as she does not offer advice to the House or Members. She advises the Government and I accept that. If it is supposed to be unconstitutional, so be it. The Constitution does not state that the Government shall control and dominate this House and that it shall make legislation for this State. That is why we have a State and what 1916 was about.That is what 1921 was about: the power for a legislature elected by the people of Ireland to make law for Ireland, not a Government to make law by decree. I do not see many amendments other than those proposed by Ministers being accepted in here. Why not just rule by decree? Why bother with the facade of parliamentary democracy, where we have a Committee Stage on which committees do not debate very much? Some Ministers have taken amendments, but by and large the practice is no different to previous Governments. There is no great reform or empowerment of the Dáil. In fact, I have nothing to compare it to, because I was not here before, but I am told there was probably greater control exercised by the Government over this Dáil than has been the case in the past. If the Minister says the Attorney General says it is unconstitutional, so be it, but that is civil partnership as it existed up to now. Why not open it up? Why not open it up to people who are not homosexual or to people who live together in a committed relationship that is not of a sexual or intimate nature in a family unit and who want the protection of the law? I doubt very much that the Attorney General has said that would be unconstitutional or that it would be competitive to marriage. I doubt she has even been asked, but I do not know. We will never know. However, I do know that debate in this Chamber is consistently being stifled by so-called advice from the Attorney General. Sometimes I notice that it changes. Deputy Michael McGrath had a Bill at one point that went from being potentially unconstitutional to unconstitutional in the space of about an hour, as the heat got turned up in Leaders' Questions, or something like that. I have a concern about this tendency to stifle debate. On this amendment specifically, the Minister says the advice is that it would be an unconstitutional attack on the institution of marriage if people were to continue to be able to have a civil partnership. She also says it would be unconstitutional to recognise foreign civil partnerships, because that, too, would be an attack on the institution of marriage. There is a logic in that. However, the Minister's legislation, if I understand it correctly, proposes to continue to recognise civil partnerships for six months. If the Constitution is to be interpreted so literally that we are going to defend from attack the institution of marriage, and if allowing people to engage in a civil partnership or recognising a civil partnership is an attack on the institution of marriage, then recognising it for six months is still an attack. The Constitution does not say, "We will protect the institution of marriage from attacks lasting longer than six months". It is about attacks, full stop. I question the logic of the Bill in that regard. I really question why it is an attack on marriage to retain civil partnership on the books, but I question the logic of continuing to recognise it for six months. There are, of course, people who will continue to engage in civil partnerships abroad. We live in the European Union. France and the Netherlands are two countries in the EU where civil partnership exists and I expect people will continue to migrate between France, the Netherlands and Ireland, as long as the European Union exists, which I hope will be for the foreseeable future. On that basis, I ask the Minister to consider the amendment, which would continue to recognise civil partnerships, not just between homosexual couples, but civil partnerships more broadly.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	144	This is a useful amendment because it gives us an opportunity to discuss an issue of some importance. I was not able to participate in the Second Stage debate, because it coincided with the Jewish fast of Yom Kippur, so I had no opportunity to raise this issue previously, but I did raise it in an article some time ago. As everybody knows, I welcome the fact that the referendum was successful and that we have this legislation before the House and I sought for many years to bring about this possibility. The difficulty I see arising from the legislation as it is now before the House relates specifically to gay couples who have entered into the equivalent of our civil partnership in other states, who will, for the time being, continue to reside in other states that do not allow same sex marriage, and who will, for the best of reasons, enter into civil partnerships in the future. There are states within the European Union that do not allow same sex marriage, some of which are very seriously opposed to it, and there are states of importance outside the European Union that do not allow same sex marriage. Citizens from those states visit this country, come here lawfully to work and bring their partners with them. I will mention two countries very briefly. One is Germany, which does not at present allow same sex marriage, but allows civil partnership. The second is Australia, which may in the foreseeable future change under the new Prime Minister. It does not allow same sex marriage either. I see no reason and no constitutional difficulty of any description in this State continuing to recognise civil partnerships that are celebrated in other states subsequent to this legislation coming into force and attaching to those civil partnerships the same status that we currently attach to civil partnerships celebrated outside the State. I do not see that giving rise to constitutional difficulties of any description. It is a legislative matter. It is by way of this State recognising a status conferred lawfully by another state on a couple and, where that status is different to the status of marriage, accepting that it attracts to it all of the same rights and obligations as attach to civil partnerships currently in this State. I do not see that as a difficulty or as a constitutional issue. I am taking what Deputy McNamara is saying on this, because I am not a member of the justice committee, so I did not participate in the committee discussions. I do not see how recognising civil partnership in that form could, in any legal shape, be regarded as "an attack on marriage". It may be that the Minister is not saying that. I do not know. To say that to recognise foreign civil partnerships and to attach a status to them similar to the current status of Irish civil partnerships is an attack on marriage is equivalent to saying that the legislation we enacted in this State in 2010, which allowed for civil partnerships, was unconstitutional and was an attack on marriage. There is no logic in this and there is no constitutional principle in it. This is a common-sense issue. If a couple who have entered a civil partnership come to work and live in this State, under the European Union rules they have a right to freedom of movement and the right to establish here. For example, we have many German nationals who are living in Ireland, working for multinational companies at present, and we have others who do not work for multinational companies but who simply come to live and work here because they have chosen Ireland as a country of residence. If a German national in 2016 comes with his or her partner to live in Ireland, having in 2016 celebrated a civil partnership in Germany, why should we say we do not recognise that relationship, we do not recognise it as having any status and will not grant it any of the rights and obligations that we would grant that relationship under the law as it is at the moment? It makes no sense. It makes no legal sense, no constitutional sense and no human sense. This issue should be addressed. It is not going to be addressed on Report Stage, quite clearly. An appropriate amendment could be tabled in the Seanad. I do not imagine there is any major political opposition on any side of this House to any such change. I do not imagine there is any objection from the general public. My plea is that we deal with this with a degree of additional insight into the human situations people find themselves in.There are many Irish young people who in the past few years chose - some had no choice - to go to countries such as Australia to establish residence and work there. It may well be that there are some Irish citizens who are parties to the Australian version of civil partnership celebrated in Australia who may in the coming years return home here. They may not immediately marry. There could be all sorts of reasons one would not immediately marry. Let us take that human situation of two Irish citizens who have entered into a civil partnership in Australia, one of whom, for example, is seriously ill, and decide to come back to Ireland so that one of them can live his or her last few days on this earth in Ireland. Are we to say, for example, that the surviving civil partner will have no inheritance rights unless, in a situation of medical emergency, a marriage had been celebrated upon their return to Ireland? The one thing I know, as someone who worked in the area of family law over the years, is that there are such diversity of possible human predicaments that arise. None of us can predict them, but there will be a circumstance which will give rise to great injustice and public outcry in a year, two years, three years or four years if we do not deal with this on a common sense basis. This is not complex. Like the Minister, I am anxious that this legislation goes through rapidly which is why I did what I could to highlight this issue some weeks ago. I just do not understand why we are not addressing it and I hope we can.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	145	The proposed amendments have a number of aims. One is to preserve civil partnership. The second is to open civil partnership to opposite-sex couples and non-conjugal couples such as cohabiting family members or friends. The third is to widen the scope of the redress scheme provided in Part 15 of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010 so that it also encompasses non-conjugal couples. I want to address these matters which were subject to significant consideration in the preparation of the Bill. As the House will be aware, the rights and obligations of civil partnership are broadly comparable with those of marriage, although civil partners do not have the additional constitutional recognition and protections that spouses have. This means that allowing civil partnerships to continue as an alternative to marriage is fraught, as I stated on Committee Stage and previously, with constitutional difficulties. When the constitutional interpretation was that same-sex couples could not marry, there was a clear justification for setting up the statutory scheme of civil partnership. It enabled same-sex couples to enter a formal and recognised relationship with each other, to take on extensive rights and obligations in relation to each other, and to have strong legal protections and benefits in that relationship. Those rights, obligations, benefits and protections correlated closely with those afforded to spouses in a marriage. The constitutional context has now changed following the vote. In the wake of the referendum and after the passage of this Bill, same-sex couples will be able to marry each other. This means that the rationale that was there for providing civil partnership for same-sex couples is falling away. Deputy McNamara talks about that six-month period. That is no more than discontinuing the situation in an orderly way and I think courts would recognise that. The policy the Government has adopted in the Marriage Bill based on extensive and careful analysis and legal advice is that civil partnership will be discontinued in an orderly way. The advice I have is that to consider maintaining access to civil partnership creates an unacceptable risk that the statutory scheme would become constitutionally non-compliant. There is, therefore, a risk that a constitutional challenge to its continuation would be successful and civil partnership could be struck down. This could have serious consequences for current civil partners. That is a consideration as well, regarding a threat to the rights, obligations and protections of civil partnership. That is the constitutional context that, I have been advised, has to be taken into account. Neither would it be appropriate to downgrade civil partnership in order to make its continuation less constitutionally risky. This is because the consequences for civil partners would be significant. They have a reasonable expectation that their rights, protections and obligations will continue in force unless and until they dissolve the relationship, should that happen. To take up another element of Deputy McNamara's proposals, the intention of his amendments is that civil partnership would also be available to non-conjugal couples such as siblings or friends living together in the long term. It is worth noting that being in a civil partnership is an impediment to marriage. This would probably be seen as an unacceptable infringement on the right to marry set out in the European Convention on Human Rights. Also, there is little evidence of a demand for civil partnership in this particular circumstance for these couples. I remind the House, as Deputy McNamara will be well aware, that siblings are already in a preferred category in terms of succession rights, and, similarly, where two persons live together and one of them leaves a shared home to the other, the survivor may benefit from favourable treatment. Obviously, there is that situation which is set out in the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003. Finally, Deputy McNamara suggests an extension of the redress scheme set out in Part 15 of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010. The Deputy's proposal is intended to enable couples, such as family members or friends living together, to have access to the remedy set out in Part 15. A person would in certain circumstances be able to apply for maintenance or for a property or pension adjustment order from his or her friend or family members with whom he or she had been living, but there is not that much evidence that people want this. There has not been substantial consultation in this area since 2006 when both the Law Reform Commission and my Department separately held consultation on what rights and obligations should be extended to cohabitants. The Law Reform Commission observed importantly in the wider sense in relation to cohabitation that "It would be difficult, however, to devise a scheme that would apply to all these relationships. It would assume that a single rationale could be uniformly applied to such diverse situations." The Working Group on Domestic Partnership also stated: "In view of the dearth of submissions made, the Working Group found it difficult to consider in any depth the nature of the diverse relationships in this category and the options for and consequences of according legal recognition." In the absence of any major developments or evidence of demand for greater access to that redress scheme, I take the view that it is not appropriate to accept these amendments. The scope of the Bill is specifically limited to the measures that are necessary to enable same-sex couples to marry, not to wider law reform in the sphere of personal relations that Deputy McNamara describes. I think the Deputy would accept that this is outside. These are broader issues that arise in relation to these issues which have been considered by both the constitutional law group and the working group. The Deputy can see the complexity of the issues from the short piece that I quoted. I repeat the point in terms of my legal advice that continuing civil partnership for couples in Ireland creates constitutional difficulties. Deputy McNamara describes that as conservative advice. It is the advice that the Government has taken. It is the advice that we have been given which I respect. There are particular constitutional issues, as the House well knows, that arise in Ireland that must be taken into account. We have got this important change through by going out to the people by way of referendum and that is the way one brings about such change. Recognising foreign registered partnerships is an equality issue as it would make an option available to couples who have registered partnerships abroad that will not be available to Irish resident couples.Other changes would have to take place for it to happen. We do not recognise opposite-sex registered partnerships, and arrangements are being proposed for same-sex couples. There are varying complexities to the issue and it is not simple in that constitutional issues come into play. I would not want to risk anything here. It is very important. The people have very clearly expressed their will regarding the contents of the Bill and everybody in the House wants us to move the legislation forward quickly. This is the advice I have received and I am putting it to the House.
#MichaelMcNamara	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-party	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	146	I congratulate the Minister and her Department on the speed with which they are moving the Bill forward and the fact the voice of the people in so far as it related to facilitating same-sex marriage is being heeded and enacted. The Minister said it is only what is required to introduce same-sex marriage. Is it necessary to remove the institution of civil partnership? The Minister said there has not been a public consultation on the matter since 2006. Why are we removing this institution without a public consultation? The people voted in favour of equality, not to confine family relations that enjoy legal protection to marriage alone. The Minister mentioned the downgrading of the protections of civil partnership to make it constitutional. Nowhere in my amendments have I suggested downgrading the protections. I would not propose it and would find such a suggestion hard to accept. There would be rights that would be enjoyed by non-conjugal couples, not accidentally by two mates who happen to live together but by two people who voluntarily and knowingly entered into a civil partnership. One would not accidentally find oneself subject to a maintenance order in respect of a friend with whom one had lived during college and for a few months afterwards. This is not what is proposed. It would be for people who voluntarily enter into a civil partnership. The Minister justified the six-month issue as an orderly discontinuance or an orderly wind-down. While I do not accept that recognising civil partnerships from abroad is an attack, if it is, an orderly wind-down of an attack is still an attack for six months. There is a lack of logic in the Bill in this regard. Either we can recognise civil partnerships, which we can and should, or we cannot. If we cannot, to do so for six months is unconstitutional. I thank the Minister for responding to the points I raised.

#MichaelMcNamara	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-party	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	148	I move amendment No. 5:In page 12, between lines 17 and 18, to insert the following:
“Amendment of section 54 of Act of 2004
21. Section 54 of the Act of 2004 is amended by substituting the following subsection for subsection (1):“(1) A body, Commissioner for Oaths or Peace Commissioner may apply to an tArd-Chláraitheoir—(a) in case the body is the Executive, for the registration of a registrar named in the application who is employed by the Executive and is aged 18 years or more,(b) in case the body is a religious body, for the registration of a member named in the application who is aged 18 years or more, and(c) in case the body is a secular body, for the registration of a member named in the application who is aged 18 years or more.”.”.The amendment relates to the practicalities of getting married, not what is and is not constitutional. There is a long waiting list to get married for heterosexual couples, who are the only ones who can get married. It is difficult to get a place, and no matter how long one waits, one cannot get a registrar to perform a marriage on a Saturday, Sunday or even 5 p.m. on a Friday. It is limited. If one wants to get married at a time of one's choosing, one had better have a religious marriage. Freedom of religion is a cornerstone of our Constitution. As a Roman Catholic, I have the right to be married in a Roman Catholic church if the church allows me to do so. One of the key aspects of freedom of religion is freedom from religion. If I am not a member of a religious group, I should still have a right to be married. However, it is severely curtailed, not by law but by the practicalities of getting married. It must be Monday to Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. in a registry office. We recently introduced an amendment to allow humanist marriages. Although it is not a religion, humanism is a belief structure or concept, not a secular structure. I greatly welcome the fact the House will soon pass a Bill that will enable gay couples to get married. Already, straight couples cannot get married when they want to and there is a very long waiting list. Added to this will be the number of gay couples who will, it is hoped, want to get married. We believe a large number wish to get married, and even if there is only one, it is still very important because it is equality. The practical question is whether they will be able to get married. Resources are probably insufficient. I wrote to the Minister previously and was told it was a resources issue, which I accept. If it is, maybe we should consider alternatives. Given that we respect religions equally, we allow members of religious organisations equally to solemnise marriages. Is there a particular reason people such as commissioners for oaths, notaries public or peace commissioners could not apply to solemnise marriages? I am not suggesting all the formalities of giving notice, attending the registry office to produce documentation and identification, and satisfying the registrar that it is not a sham marriage should not continue. Those civil protections exist no matter who solemnises a marriage and no matter where, be it a mosque, Roman Catholic church or synagogue, and I do not propose to alter them. Given there are not enough registrars in Ireland to marry the people who want to get married now, much less those who will want to get married after the Bill has passed, maybe we should consider allowing commissioners for oaths, peace commissioners, notaries public or some secular figures in society to solemnise marriages. I am not saying they should all be allowed to solemnise marriages at the stroke of a pen but that they should be allowed to apply to the registrar to be registered to solemnise marriages. Statutory instruments could be introduced to ensure they had the requisite training and abilities to do so. I urge the Minister to consider this practical problem.

I do not necessarily agree with him on who can perform the ceremony. The appropriate person is the registrar. I met the registrar in Cork and her ceremonies, whether marriages or civil partnerships, are among the most moving ceremonies one could attend. She takes time and care and personalises each ceremony to an extent that would bowl one over. The Deputy is right that there is an issue with waiting times. It is a resources issue. Marriages can be solemnised Monday to Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. One of our best initiatives was to change the venue restrictions.Deputy McNamara is from County Clare, where there are some fine outdoor venues. In my case, there are venues like Charles Fort, Elizabeth Fort and Christchurch in Cork county and city.

It is absolutely beautiful. It is an old church. The Acting Chairman, Deputy Keating, sings in a choir and is a musician. The atmosphere at this wonderful venue was befitting of the occasion. We changed the ceremony venue from being in the registry office. I would like to speak about the context of what we have done as a country and as a State. We have extended the right to marry to all of us. As I said earlier, we are no longer locked out. The Saturday issue that has been mentioned means that in some cases, people have to go to the registry office during the week to get married, or in the past civil partnered, on their own with their witnesses before having their public celebrations on the Saturday. This brings me back to the point that has been made about hotels. I am not flying the flag for the hotel industry. I am talking about the actual ceremony. For the couple involved, it is probably the most important day of their lives. We need to be creative in the context of this amendment. I am not quite sure I would be happy to provide for peace commissioners to take on this role. I mean no disrespect to any of the peace commissioners I know, one of whom is my father, when I say that. I think the registrar is the person in question. Deputy McNamara has raised a very valid point that needs to be responded to. He has spoken about freedom from religion. I know the Catholic Church has its own rules and regulations. We still have the view, which we expressed during the campaign, that it is not about being able to get married in a church. The Church of Ireland has a different view in some cases. One of the most extraordinary exponents of the referendum was Bishop Colton in Cork. Would it not be great if he or others could do this? That is a different argument. I think we need to see whether we can expand on the argument that Deputy McNamara has presented.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	160	Deputy McNamara is raising a very important issue, as he often does. We rarely get an opportunity to discuss the issue he has raised in this House. Just as weddings are happy occasions, the enactment of this legislation will be a very happy occasion. I wish to use Deputy McNamara's amendment to tease out a particular issue, which I have found to be a source of personal irritation for many years. I know many people who have sought to marry have found it to be a cause of irritation too. It has been mentioned by Deputies McNamara and Buttimer. Many years ago, when the civil registry office was effectively located in a solicitors' firm in Kildare Street, civil marriages in Dublin were celebrated there by a Mr. Downey with great solemnity and aplomb. All of this was subsequently taken over, in effect, by the former Eastern Health Board. I do not understand why this bureaucratic administrative requirement is not being questioned. It seems it will always be done in this way because it has always been done in this way. I think it is right that we should question why a civil marriage should have to be celebrated between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. from Monday to Friday, simply because they are the work hours of the officials who are employed by the State or a State agency. I understand that no one wants to pay them overtime for working outside their working hours of 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday to Friday. Has anyone ever suggested that they might work from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. from Tuesday to Saturday? Maybe some of them would welcome that and there would be no extra charge to the State. There are many people who would like to celebrate their wedding on a Saturday or a Sunday. Getting married is a very special occasion. Most people who are getting married, or whose friends are getting married, do not object to taking a day off work, but it presents as a difficulty for some people. It can present as a difficulty for people who are flying in from abroad for weddings. Many people, particularly those who are having civil marriage ceremonies, would like to marry on a Saturday or a Sunday. The only group through which that can be done at the moment is the Humanist Association of Ireland. It is fantastic that the humanists can celebrate ceremonies. I understand they are now celebrating wedding ceremonies for large numbers of people who are not members of the Humanist Association of Ireland. This does not fall within the Minister's remit, but it is relevant to the discussion and the amendment. I cannot for the life of me see why we are so structured and inflexible. It is just assumed that one can never celebrate a marriage ceremony earlier than 9 a.m. on a Monday or later than 5 p.m. on a Friday, and not at all on a Saturday or Sunday unless it is a religiously celebrated ceremony or the Humanist Association of Ireland has a vacancy and is able to celebrate one's ceremony. That may be months away because of the demand being experienced by the humanists. This is an administrative issue. It is not about legislation. It is simply about whether we can rearrange the bureaucracy. It may well be that those who are currently celebrating marriages would be delighted to do this. Maybe they would have no difficulty at all with it. For all sorts of domestic reasons, it might suit them to work on a Saturday and not on a Monday. I have no idea. I simply do not know. It should not be beyond the realms of human ingenuity at Government or HSE level to ensure we have a more flexible arrangement. It may well be that a few more officials could be trained to celebrate marriage ceremonies. Maybe some people would be very happy to do this at the weekend, or early in the morning. It may not be an enormous financial imposition on the State. We all visit myriad of countries outside this State. I have not done a survey of how many European countries, or countries beyond the EU, allow one to celebrate one's civil ceremony on a Saturday or a Sunday, but I would be aware that the number is quite considerable. We are in some sort of marital celebratory ceremony straitjacket that has been bestowed on us by an administrative bureaucracy that nobody questions. I sometimes get into trouble for asking questions, but this is not a question of great complexity. Why should we continue to do this in the way we have been doing it? I believe the public would welcome the availability of civil registrars who would celebrate marriages on Saturdays and Sundays and after 5 p.m. during the summer months. Why does it stop at 5 p.m. during the summer months? I do not know the answer to that question. Why should a marriage not be celebrated at 7 p.m. on a Friday evening during the summer at some venue where people would like to celebrate it? This would enable guests attending the ceremony to work the day if they so wished. Why are we in this sort of odd bureaucratic straitjacket? It makes no sense. This is of relevance to heterosexual couples, gay couples and all people who are going to marry in the future. Perhaps the Minister could have this conversation with her colleague in government who is responsible for this matter. Maybe there could be some dramatic and simple change that would affect this area and bring us out of the sort of strange straitjacket that we have been in since the 19th or 20th centuries and into a more flexible 21st century model.

However, I want to acknowledge Deputy McNamara's amendment and the previous amendment. I think the issues that have been raised are valid. In the case of this amendment, it strikes me that same-sex couples will not be able to get married outside a registry office. Therefore, as Deputy Shatter has said, they will be hampered by the current office hours, which will restrict them to getting married between Monday and Friday. Obviously, wider options will be available to couples who are able to get married in religious ceremonies.Clearly there is an issue of equality at play here when one set of couples will not have the same options in terms of the day for getting married and having their receptions on the same day. It is a valid issue and perhaps the Minister would consider it ahead of the Seanad debate. Regarding the issue raised earlier, perhaps further consideration could be given to the points made by Deputy Alan Shatter. We would be concerned about the impact on citizens residing here having the status of their relationships recognised by the State. Is there a possibility of the State having an agreement with other states to recognise the status of those relationships? We would like some feedback on the options available.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	162	Clearly the Report Stage debate on this Bill gives an opportunity for Deputies to raise these issues. They were also raised on Committee Stage and at that point I said that I would raise them with the Minister for Social Protection and I have done so. I will relay today's discussion to her again because I believe these are issues for consideration. I do not need to elaborate further on them because they speak for themselves. Deputies have outlined the particular points and the limitations of current arrangements. Clearly various discussions must be had with the relevant people to make these changes, but the points made are valid and there is no question of me arguing against them. That said, the issues raised are not for this Bill. They are issues for the Minister for Social Protection. I have already relayed the Deputies' concerns to her and I am sure she will determine what steps are needed in terms of the practical points made by Deputies. In terms of the other aspect of the Bill, that is, the frameworks for the solemnisation of marriage and who can be a solemniser, the current arrangements are long-standing and were not put in place lightly. The role of solemniser is a serious and responsible one. Deputy Buttimer said that he is not sure he would agree with the changes proposed by Deputy McNamara. The person authorised to act as solemniser is nominated either by the approved religion of which he or she is a member, as the Deputy has said, or the approved secular body as provided for in the Civil Registration (Amendment) Act 2012. Following that Act, bodies must comply with the requirements set down in legislation and solemnisers must have the necessary training. All these issues and any unforeseen consequences which could arise would have to be considered in detail before changes could be countenanced. I do not believe these amendments are for this Bill but this discussion certainly has been worthwhile. The issues raised should be followed up and I will ensure they are.

The Minister is right that we do not technically need a legal change to have marriages carried out on Saturdays and Sundays. In fact, there is not even necessarily a cost to the State involved because the existing Civil Registration Act allows that the cost of a registrar having to go to a venue such as Marlay Park, Blackrock Castle or-----

#MichaelMcNamara	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-party	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	165	Sorry, I forgot which venue the Deputy suggested would be ideal. That cost can be borne and can be expected to be borne by the couple but so too could the cost of having a marriage on a Saturday or Sunday if there is an additional overtime cost. We need flexibility. State services, whether one is talking about the solemnisation of marriage or a bus from A to B, exist for the benefit of the public and not for the benefit of those who provide them. Obviously those who provide the services must be looked after and paid. They are essential to the provision of a good service but fundamentally a State service exists for the benefit of the public and we need to bear that in mind. I am glad that discussions are taking place on the fact that civil marriages cannot currently take place on Saturdays or Sundays. I acknowledge that there is no requirement to change legislation to achieve that and that it can be done under the existing framework if registrars will agree to marry people at weekends. However, if they continue to refuse to do so, then the point made by Deputy Shatter that civil marriages were once carried out in solicitors' offices is valid. There is no particular reason notary publics could not carry them out in the future again if the registrars are determined not to work on Saturdays and Sundays. Ultimately, registrars carry out a State function and it is a very important function provided by the State, that of marrying people. I thank the Minister. I will not press the amendment in light of the constructive discussion we have had but it is an issue that needs to be looked at and not just parked until the next time there is a Bill before the House that happens to be about marriage. A lot needs to be done to ensure the right of gay and straight people to get married in this country becomes real and that they can marry when they want to in this State.

Now that we have almost passed this marriage equality legislation, there may be other changes to marriage that Deputies have in mind. The point made by the Deputy is one we must look at in the context of all the contributions to this debate. How marriage is celebrated and solemnised requires further debate. I know from speaking to registrars about this issue that it may boil down to resources. The Minister said she has already spoken to the Minister for Social Protection. The HSE, the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Justice and Equality are the three organs of State which must move on this. Deputy Shatter is right that it should be possible to have marriages at 3 p.m., 7 p.m., on a Saturday or Sunday or whatever. We have moved on from the old approach to marriage, where it depended on when the priest was available in the case of church marriages or whatever slot was available in the registry office. We must have a wider discussion about how we can perform marriage celebrations for couples. I hope we can be creative and come up with a solution to what is a first world problem on one level, given that the success of the referendum now presents people with the option of getting married which they did not have before. I hope the Departments will have a conversation about how we can change the times available. We have already made changes with regard to venues and can make further changes once the will exists. I know the Minister has the will and I hope the Departments will work together on this issue.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	171	This is a particularly historic day in this Chamber. I will look back, very briefly, if I may. I was very privileged, as Minister for Justice and Equality, to bring to Cabinet the proposal that we hold a referendum to provide for marriage equality. It was an outstanding outcome to that referendum that such a large majority in this State supported change. This is the next historical event, following on from that referendum, with this legislation being passed by this Dáil. The Bill has yet to go through the Seanad but I hope that the desire we all have for this to pass speedily through the Seanad will not prevent the Minister from looking at and addressing in the Seanad the issues discussed today because bringing the Bill back to the Dáil would delay its enactment by no more than a few days. It is very important we get it right and I urge the Minister to look again at the issue of those who enter into civil partnerships abroad after this legislation becomes effective and attach to those civil partnerships the same status that we will continue to attach to civil partnerships that have been celebrated by couples in this State before the legislation has become operative.A myriad of difficulties could arise if we were not to do that, but I will not go into them today. We should celebrate the fact that this legislation has been enacted through the House. It is a major step towards putting flesh on the bones of the decision made in the referendum in that it enables same-sex couples to have the same recognition extended to their loving relationships that those of us who are heterosexual have had the benefit of for so long. Constitutionally we are all equal, and we are all now seen to be equal. There was never any reason for individuals to be discriminated against because of their sexual orientation. There remains one issue that must be addressed and that has yet to come before this Chamber. Crucial change is needed to section 37 of the Employment Equality Act in order that individuals are not discriminated against and do not fear discrimination against them in their employment due to their sexual orientation or the simple fact that they may now avail of the right they have, as a same sex couple, to enter into a same-sex marriage. In April 2014, when I was Minister for Justice and Equality, a report on this issue was provided to my Department. I had asked the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission to look at how we could better balance the provisions in the Employment Equality Act. As I understand it, the Government is proceeding to address the issue. It is important that it be addressed during the lifetime of this Dáil. I am concerned that it not be postponed until a later occasion. I am also concerned, in the context of the employment of certain people such as teachers working in denominationally based schools, that they may fear availing of the freedom extended to them by being entitled to enter into a same-sex marriage and may be concerned as to the consequences with regard to their employment or promotional opportunities if we do not amend section 37 of the Employment Equality Act. I hope the necessary measure will come before the House and will be enacted in the form recommended for change before the House sees an end to its life because of the calling of a general election. I do not have any insight into whether we will see an election on this side or the far side of Christmas. However, there is no particular reason the amendment could not be enacted before we reach the Christmas vacation.

The work of departmental staff in preparing the legislation should be acknowledged. This is an historic and important day in the history of the State. The people have spoken. There are men and women of the Yes Equality campaign in the Gallery. They are civic-minded volunteers who had the courage and bravery to campaign door to door. I commend them on their heroic campaign. I also pay tribute to the former Tánaiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, and the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, who played an instrumental role following the establishment of the Government in ensuring that the Constitutional Convention would debate the issue of marriage equality. The convention's debate on the issue was a seminal moment in the campaign. The Acting Chairman, Deputy Derek Keating, and Deputy Mary Lou McDonald were members of the Constitutional Convention. The weekend of debate in Malahide was one of the memorable and moving moments in the 12-month life of the convention. Those who question the validity of the Constitutional Convention should recall the day in Malahide on which citizens, the convention's non-elected members, reached a decision following a debate characterised by passion and fervour.  Marriage equality is without doubt an issue that has exercised Irish people and people all over the world. As I stated on Second Stage, we are a small nation with a big heart, and that message is beaming across a watching world. For as long as men and women are being persecuted, those of us who enjoy the privilege of having been elected have a duty to provide a voice for those who cannot speak for themselves and to represent them on the world stage.  I commend the Minister on the leadership she has shown on this issue. Some people had the temerity to question the Taoiseach's commitment on this issue. The Taoiseach was not found wanting, and led from the front by embarking on a journey in which he demonstrated that leadership is about people. I commend the Minister, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, who was the director of the Government's referendum campaign. Today is an historic day which makes me proud to be a Member of the Dáil. I commend the work the Government has done with Irish people to show the world that Ireland is a country of freedom in which all citizens are equal. In May of this year, on the eve of the centenary of the 1916 Rising, Irish people rose up and said "Yes" to all.

I acknowledge in particular the members of the Yes Equality campaign present in the Visitors' Gallery and congratulate them on their efforts and the joy they brought to a matter that has had a joyful ending. I also acknowledge the role of the Constitutional Convention in so accurately reflecting the views and feelings of Irish people on a matter of such fundamental equality. We do not regularly get opportunities to congratulate Ministers, but I congratulate the Minister because it is on her watch that the Bill has been successfully navigated through the legislative process, following on from the work of the previous Minister. I thank her for that. This is a moment of joy in the Chamber, one that we should enjoy and relish while we can. Good for us and good for all those in the Gallery.

I celebrate the fact that the House will soon pass legislation that will enable all citizens to marry equally. I also join previous speakers in urging the Minister to pay careful attention to the debate. I campaigned for a "Yes" vote in the referendum on the basis that there is a difference between civil partnership and marriage. The Law Society, for example, released a statement pointing out some 1,000 legal differences between marriage and civil partnership. However, we are abolishing civil partnership for everybody on the basis that marriage and civil partnership are the same, in which case I must ask whether we were all wrong. I do not believe we were wrong. The Bill will move to the Seanad. I ask the Minister to outline to the Upper House the progress made in ensuring people can get married on Saturdays and Sundays, because progress needs to be made on this issue.

We are about to give legal effect to the decision that was taken in the recent referendum. I was delighted to be part of an extremely positive referendum campaign. We must acknowledge and give credit to the Yes Equality team, the men and women and their families and friends who realised what the impact of this decision on their personal lives would be. The warmth, generosity and positivity of the campaign was a sight to behold and it was great to be part of it. I salute the men and women of the Yes Equality campaign for the Trojan efforts they made in knocking on doors to ensure the referendum was passed. I also acknowledge the role played by the Minister and the collective role of Members in the referendum campaign. It was one occasion when members of all parties and none came together and decided what was needed to achieve a true Republic.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	178	This morning we heard the announcement by Irish Water of its new seven-year plan, a key element of which is the decision to lay off between 1,200 and 1,500 people. This comes after the same entity created 700 additional jobs over and above those that were already in local authorities delivering water services and paid bonuses in respect of those 700 positions. It was also confirmed that there will be a flat-rate charge for the next seven years despite the fact the Government decided with Irish Water to spend €550 million on water meters that will, in essence, be redundant for the next seven years and perhaps beyond. It is a colossal waste of public funding. Irish Water has failed the EUROSTAT test when the rationale for setting it up in the first place was to have it off balance sheet. It no longer can be and there are very good reasons for that. Up to half the people have not paid their water charges and the conservation grant will be given to those who do not pay their water charges. By the way, the Government is even screwing up the giving out of the grant, which it cannot do properly. There are thousands of people ringing up and the form is impossible to decipher and follow through. It is people's general taxation which has paid for this. From motor tax alone, €265 million has gone for the establishment and operational costs of Irish Water while next year it will be €316 million. If one takes the full total that has been spent, we are worse off by €800 million. Up to €800 million has been spent on this entity and not an extra cent has been spent on water infrastructure. Less has been spent over the past three years per annum on water infrastructure than was allocated in the previous three years.

Will he set out the status of the flat-rate charge post 2022? Will the conservation grant continue to be paid to those who do not pay their bills? Does the Taoiseach accept that the water meters represent a colossal waste of public money given that they will not be used for the next seven years of the plan or even beyond that?

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	189	The reason is that Deputy Martin's party always supported the concept of contributions for services, including water. Fianna Fáil went to the extent of having a €400 charge in its proposition until it saw the people to Deputy Martin's right shifting ground, after which that party said it did not want water charges, at least not for the present. Now, Fianna Fáil wants to restore the situation that applied before with 31 local authorities. I welcome the Irish Water business plan. It sets out a €5.5 billion investment plan to 2021 so that all of the challenges and difficulties that were apparent for many years can be dealt with. The plan includes, for example, the elimination of all boil-water notices, making safe the supplies that are currently at risk for 940,000 people, ending the practice from 2015 of continuing to pump raw sewage into our rivers, harbours and seas at 44 locations throughout the country, there for all to see, a reduction in the amount of leaks from 49% to under 38%, and an increase in the fresh water capacity for Dublin city in particular where it is currently balanced on a knife edge. The business plan published this morning sets out the structure by which this will be achieved, including making operational savings of €1.1 billion over the period. Irish Water has achieved reductions in numbers because of natural wastage and people retiring. One of the reasons was to reduce the waste or duplication of having 34 separate water authorities which were not of a similar high standard serving the people of the country. I understand that the business plan targets a 7% year-on-year efficiency in the inherited cost base culminating in €1.1 billion in savings, which is the equivalent of a 40% reduction by 2021. Irish Water has set out that it sees a sizeable reduction of up to 1,200 with a primary focus on the operational local authority staff engaged under service level agreements. Irish Water points out that it may be necessary to have a voluntary scheme in the course of those years.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	293	Nine hundred residents of Dublin's Longboat Quay have been instructed to cough up millions of euro for repairs to their homes because they were built without adequate fire safety measures. They have been told that, unless they do so by 1 November, they face eviction. Is the Taoiseach also aware that families that were allocated a block of 62 apartments in Prospect Hill on Dublin's Finglas Road have been told by Dublin City Council that there are health and safety issues with those apartments? The block is one of several on a larger site of more than 500 occupied apartments that may have the same problem. Is the Taoiseach aware of the Riverwalk Court complex in Ratoath, County Meath's version of Longboat Quay? Clearly, these are not isolated cases. Properties bought at considerable expense have been verified in report after report as being substandard and dangerous. How does the Taoiseach intend to reassure residents that unscrupulous property developers and not unfortunate residents will be held responsible for unsafe building work, given the fact that NAMA, local councils and the Government have been aware for years of these health and safety issues? Will the Taoiseach spell out the steps he has taken to deal with this scandalous situation? As to my primary question, will the Taoiseach indicate how many residential developments have been built without adequate safety measures?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	294	No, I cannot give the Deputy that answer, but what I am convinced of is that there are other Longboat Quay situations out there and other Priory Hall situations out there. And all of that has brought absolute wreckage to the careers and the ambitions and the lives of so many people in our country. And it all happened because of a rush to greed, a rush to build indiscriminately without following the conditions and the regulations that were laid down as to proper building standards. I do not know, Deputy Adams, how many other cases around the country were built to an inferior standard. I do not know if there are other apartment blocks out there where traps exist or where fire hazards exist.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	298	I made the point to Deputy McDonald that the Longboat Quay apartments were a combination of a number of entities, and the Minister, Deputy Kelly, met with personnel about this yesterday. This is an example of the worst kind of situation in our country, where people who went off legitimately and got their money to buy their homes or apartments or houses found afterwards that, for reasons beyond their control, these were not what they thought they were. At the end of the day, somebody probably expects the taxpayer to fork out for all of these things. The situation is that responsibility is vested, and was vested, in the regulations and the conditions that were granted when planning permission was granted in the first place. I do not know the answer to Deputy Adams's question, but I will take the places that he has mentioned and ask the Minister, Deputy Kelly, and the authorities to carry out investigations on those places, but I am convinced that there are probably others in other locations around the country where, unfortunately, the same situation actually applies.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	301	I am concerned by the Taoiseach's answer. He stated that he was aware that there were many other Longboat Quay, Prospect Hill and Riverwalk Court developments, but that he could not tell how many. How long has he been aware of this? How long has he known that citizens are living in unsafe accommodation?As the Taoiseach has stated, this clearly is the unacceptable face of the Celtic tiger and of Fianna Fáil light-touch regulation. However, it is not enough for a Taoiseach to engage only in the blame game. Neither Members nor the people who live in these developments need to be told what is the problem. The Taoiseach must tell Members the solution. The Taoiseach may recall that the Mahon report had a key recommendation on the appointment of an independent planning regulator but the Government has not acted on this. Will the Taoiseach support the Sinn Féin Bill published today by an Teachta Brian Stanley to establish an independent planning regulator? In addition, will the Taoiseach tell Members why the Government has not introduced legislation to ensure that surveyors, architects, builders and planners are accountable? On what basis, moral or otherwise, does the Taoiseach expect residents to pick up the tab for what he has described as the unscrupulous behaviour of those developers and others who built these unsafe developments? Does the Taoiseach agree with the Minister, Deputy Kelly, that property tax proceeds should be used? Finally, can he confirm whether there are criminal investigations under way into these matters?

In addition, people had been living in these apartments in cases where they obviously were not safe from the perspective of fire safety certification and all the rest. The Minister has made quite a number of changes to the regulations that apply here and the planning and development (No. 2) Bill, which the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, and the Minister, Deputy Kelly, will bring through the Dáil will deal with the regulatory situation here.

The Minister will move to ensure these kinds of situations do not apply in the future. However, one cannot do this unless one has supervision and a mandatory requirement to comply with conditions of planning that are set out in the first place, adhering to the regulations that are in the planning and development (No. 2) Bill and so on.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	333	If they needed any more proof of the need for a commission of inquiry into the workings of NAMA, Members got it at the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts last Thursday. Deputy McDonald challenged NAMA about redactions in its responses to questions from the Northern Ireland inquiry and in particular, details of Frank Cushnahan's conflict of interest declaration to the agency. NAMA's representatives told the Deputy they could not give them to her and were not even obliged to so do. Answers will not be forthcoming without a commission of inquiry. There have been a great number of questions but there have been absolutely no answers and I still am not convinced the Government wants the answers. Members still do not know why NAMA allowed the Project Eagle process to continue despite the involvement of Tughans and Brown Rudnick, which had been involved in the Pimco deal. Members still do not understand how NAMA could possibly tolerate the idea of selling Project Arrow to Cerberus, which is under criminal investigation in America and Britain. How in God's name can this be the case-----

It has a par value of more than €6 billion and yet NAMA looks to sell it for less than €1 billion. This simply does not make sense and the process should be stopped. If Cerberus is found guilty, what happens with Project Eagle? Will it be null and void? Will the entire process be undone? When Pimco's potential criminal violation was found, did NAMA seek US legal advice? When NAMA found out, did it approach the Garda under section 19 of the Criminal Justice Act?

Did Lazard express views regarding the continued involvement of Brown Rudnick and Tughans or was it satisfied in this regard? Does the Taoiseach have a problem with the fact that Lazard, which ran the process for NAMA, also was involved with the bank that gave the money to Cerberus to buy it? Does the Taoiseach have a problem with that?

The Deputy is aware two investigations are under way in this regard. He is aware of the interest from the United States. The Deputy has made or has been given information that he has brought to the House and he has gone to the Garda, on which I commend him. However, Deputy Wallace also is aware NAMA is responsible, through the Committee of Public Accounts to this House and the Oireachtas. I understand the Deputy has declined to give witness evidence to the aforementioned committee but he should do so. He has information or has been given information: somebody is supplying him with information, which is fair enough. He has used some of that in giving it to the authorities. However, he is making highly specific allegations here and I suggest he should accept an invitation from the Committee of Public Accounts to appear as a witness and give his evidence to the body through which NAMA is accountable to the Oireachtas and have justified the claims he has made or otherwise. I cannot speculate on a court hearing or hearings that are taking place in regard to Cerberus or any other company as to what the outcome of that might be.

I have come into the House and put stuff before the Taoiseach who is ignoring it. What is he going to do about it? He is the leader of this country and he is ignoring serious questions and serious problems I am raising. Why does the Taoiseach not wish to do something about it?

#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	368	At this stage, there is a strong belief that Cerberus was earmarked to get this project hail, rain or snow; that the whole thing was fixed up in order that it would get it. NAMA is involved in that and the agency cannot distance itself. The sales process is not much better then the purchase process.

#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	372	If the Taoiseach wants the answer, he should not bother his barney asking NAMA because it is not going to give it to him, no more than it is giving answers to the PAC. The PAC members admitted last week that they do not have the authority or power to hold NAMA to account. A commission of inquiry is the only way that the Taoiseach will get the answers we need. The people have not been served well by NAMA. It stinks to high heaven and the Taoiseach is involved in the cover-up because he refused to do anything about it.

Deputy Wallace makes the point that Cerberus were earmarked for this project and that this was all fixed up. He makes the point that somebody based here in Dublin was got at. These are pretty serious allegations. He makes the point that I, as Taoiseach, am involved in some kind of cover-up and that this is a situation that can only be resolved by a commission of investigation. He has been to the Garda and to other authorities. I suggest to Deputy Wallace that he elaborate on the information he has given here, and the allegations he makes, in front of the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	387	I explained to the Deputies yesterday that one is dealing with two different jurisdictions here. There are two investigations going on in a different jurisdiction and NAMA have 300 pages of detailed responses on its website. Deputy Wallace says that it is all a cover-up. He says it is fixed up, that people were got at. He needs to elaborate and give the evidence for that kind of information.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	400	There are two proposals to be put to the House. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 42, statements on pre-European Council meeting of 15–16 October, agreed? Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 43, statements on Building on Recovery, agreed to? Agreed. I call Deputy Martin on the Order of Business. 
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	401	Yesterday, we voted through a request from the chairman of the banking inquiry, Deputy Ciarán Lynch, to extend the date for that inquiry to report until the end of January. I then asked the Taoiseach what I thought was a very reasonable question - to confirm if the House was to be dissolved before the end of the year. If a general election is called, the banking inquiry will never report and I believe the House should be apprised of that matter. It is reasonable that the House would have some certainty, having voted on this issue yesterday, as to whether the banking inquiry will report in January unhindered, in other words, that the report of the banking inquiry will not be undermined or prevented by the calling of a general election. It is very reasonable to seek clarity on that and, if necessary, we should have time to discuss it. It could not be more basic than that. Given all the time, effort and money that has been put into the inquiry, it seems extraordinary that the Taoiseach cannot give a straight answer as to whether it will definitively report in January on the basis that there will not be a general election before the end of the year. I would appreciate it, therefore, if the Taoiseach could, in a straightforward and upfront manner, give an answer to that simple and reasonable request. Secondly, last night on Prime Time there were some harrowing stories and presentations by many families and relatives of people who lost their loved ones. In some cases they were murdered or killed. They were very genuine cases. As the Taoiseach knows, an independent panel of barristers was set up by the Minister for Justice and Equality to investigate these particular cases, including that of Mrs. O'Farrell who lost her son in an appalling situation. In another case, the family of Shane Tuohey outlined the circumstances of his death which, they would assert, were not investigated properly by the Garda. What emerged from the programme was deep dissatisfaction with the process to date in terms of the independent panel and the replies that quite a number of the families have received. I do not know whether the Taoiseach has seen the programme, but it would be worth his while watching it.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	402	Other Deputies did not get in yesterday. I am trying to get everybody in, so would the Deputy put his question?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	403	Is the Taoiseach aware of the depth of distress caused and the dissatisfaction articulated about how the independent panel of barristers is going about its work, which the Government oversees? Is the Minister of a mind to make a full report to the House in relation to it? Is the Minister or the Government prepared to set up independent inquiries into a number of these cases?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	404	I am aware of the distress caused in these cases over many years. In fact, some of these cases came directly to the Department of the Taoiseach.This is the only Government that has set up an independent investigation and analysis of all of these cases, over 200 in total. The Minister was very careful to have a person of appropriate experience look at all these cases objectively and communicate with the persons involved or their loved ones. The independent review was not put together as a commission of investigation or a commission of inquiry. Its purpose was to look at the allegations made and to make a determination on whether any further action was needed. It is important to note that it was open to the independent review mechanism to recommend any form of statutory inquiry into cases that it examined. Deputy Martin will be aware, because he gave some of them to me himself, that some of these cases are very complicated and go back over many years. I reiterate that the Garda has fully complied with all requests for information in connection with the cases that were referred to the panel. Any suggestion that the panel did not receive full co-operation and full information is not accurate. The panel has provided recommendations to the Minister in all 320 cases and the Minister has accepted the recommendations of counsel in all cases. In order to ensure the probity and independence of the entire process from start to finish, the Minister for Justice and Equality requested the retired High Court judge, Mr. Justice Murphy, to undertake the task of overseeing the preparation of the letters of notification to ensure that those letters contained a fair and accurate reflection of the panel's recommendation. A total of 152 letters have issued to date. Some cases resulted in recommendations for further action, which the Minister has accepted, including referral to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission and requesting a report from the Garda Commissioner in accordance with section 41(2) of the Act of 2005. The remaining notification letters will continue to issue over the coming weeks. It is understood that a number of these cases will result in significant further action, of which I am not yet aware. It is the intention of the Minister, on the completion of the process, to make a comprehensive statement of all the actions she has decided to take in line with the recommendations from counsel, and that will be discussed here. I referred to the other matter Deputy Martin mentioned yesterday. The Chairman of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis requested extra time from the Dáil to complete his report and the committee's report. The Dáil granted extra time until the end of January. That is normal business and a normal request. The two things that Deputy Martin has raised are entirely separate.

Tá cúpla ceist agam on planning and rent controls legislation, the international protection Bill and the McMahon report ach, ar dtús, ba mhaith liom ceist a chur maidir leis an díospóireacht faoin Tuaisceart. Tá a fhios ag an gCeann Comhairle agus ag an Taoiseach go bhfuil mé ag cur na ceiste seo faoin Tuaisceart go rialta gan focal ar bith le fáil ón Rialtas, go háirithe ag an uair seo nuair atá cainteanna ar siúl i mBéal Feirste faoi na hinstitiúidí atá ann. Ba mhaith liom freagra a fháil ón Taoiseach. I have another question on planning and rent controls. You will note, a Cheann Comhairle, that rents in Dublin are at boom-time levels and that the rent supplement is entirely out of touch with the rents being demanded. The rent supplement budget has been cut by €200 million.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	440	There are also 1,275 children in homeless accommodation. At the weekend, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, an Teachta Kelly, told RTE that emergency legislation would be introduced to speed up planning. This is one of the serial announcements he makes on this issue. When will we see the Government's emergency legislation to tackle homelessness? Has the Government any plans to introduce legislation on rent controls or rent freezes? Last June, the Taoiseach told me he would facilitate a debate on the McMahon report into the direct provision system. I grant that some aspects of this report are welcome, but overall it is a disappointing response to a very difficult humanitarian issue and to a direct provision system that has been widely condemned. We have seen tens of thousands-----
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	441	Sorry, Deputy. This is the Order of Business. It is about promised legislation. There are other Deputies who did not get to speak yesterday because there were votes. Would you please stick to the business before us - that is, the Order of Business, where we deal with the business on the Order Paper? Thank you.

When will the Taoiseach agree to an urgent, full and proper debate on the issue of refugees and on the State's response, including the McMahon report? Will the Government consider extending the humanitarian mission that the Naval Service is involved with beyond December?

A motion on refugees was agreed already. The McMahon report was received. Observations were made by all the relevant Departments on direct provision and so on. They have been received and are being assessed by the Minister. Obviously, there will be an opportunity to debate those here.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	451	In the next number of weeks, I would suggest. Deputy Adams raised the rent supplement issue. I have mentioned on many occasions that the opportunity exists for the Department of Social Protection to deal with each of these cases on an individual basis. However, all of these actions do not deal with the fundamental problem - that is, the supply of accommodation, particularly in this city. I hope to have a Cabinet meeting later this week to deal with a series of measures that will, I hope, address some aspects of the inadequacy of the housing accommodation and supply throughout the country, with particular reference to Dublin. Third, labhair an Teachta Adams faoi dhíospóireacht maidir le cúis an Tuaiscirt. Tá mé toilteanach é sin a chur ar fáil ach tá a fhios ag an Teachta go bhfuil na díospóireachtaí ar siúl ag an bpointe seo. Ní dóigh liom go mbeadh sé oiriúnach díospóireacht a bheith againn faoi na nithe sin ag an am seo nuair nach bhfuil na díospóireachtaí idir na polaiteoirí sa Tuaisceart agus na Rialtais críochnaithe fós. Más gá, tá mé toilteanach an díospóireacht a bheith againn. Táim ag breathnú go géar ar an ábhar seo agus bím ag labhairt leis an Aire Gnóthaí Eachtracha agus Trádála chuile lá faoi.

Has the timeline been established for the passage of the Bill through the House and thereafter in respect of the hospital? I refer to the road transport Bill, which aims to reduce the administration and associated costs of private road transport. Have the heads of the Bill been approved? Will it come before the House during this session? No. 96 is the health (transport support) Bill, which will offer some assistance for children with severe disabilities who cannot access public transport. Has it been approved and is it likely to come before the House at an early date?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	453	No. 96 will probably be taken early next year. A great deal of work has taken place in respect of the Bill. The road transport Bill has not been approved by Government, although work is ongoing on it. A timeline for the national children's hospital was published, which involved planning permission being lodged and onwards. Of course, one can never speculate on the real outcome of that, because other matters might infringe on it. I will send the Deputy an updated timeline as produced by the board from the time it lodged planning permission to the estimated time of completion of the project.

I wish to return to the issue of the Istanbul Convention, about which the Minister has spoken frequently. One wonders, given the current speculation about an early general election, whether the Taoiseach can state emphatically that the Government will sign the Istanbul Convention and bring it into effect. We read in the press that there are suggestions that many Government Departments may require Supplementary Estimates. I refer to Tusla. Throughout the country, family refuges are suffering enormously because of inadequate funding. In my constituency, a project built using heavy capital investment is not fully open - two apartments remain closed because of a lack of funding.

They are a matter for discussion between the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the relevant Ministers, speaking on behalf of their Departments. A number of Supplementary Estimates have been referred to, and obviously health is one of those. No decisions have been made as yet. I will take note of the point he mentioned. On 25 September, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, indicated that he would seek Government approval to sign the Istanbul Convention in the coming weeks. It is a multi-annual action plan with timescales for implementation that was drawn up in consultation with other Government Departments and agencies in regard to implementing the small number of remaining actions required to enable Ireland to ratify the convention. I will update Deputy Ó Fearghaíl on the work that has taken place in respect of the few remaining items.

I understand the export project is back on track and there is great concern and anxiety that we do not have robust legislation to deal with wind energy. Can the Taoiseach confirm to me, having consulted with his colleagues, when the guidelines will be published? The Taoiseach said he would write to me about the tenant purchase scheme and update me as to when it would be published. I refer to the statutory instrument, which has yet to be published by the Department of Justice and Equality, that will facilitate local authorities in dealing with anti-social behaviour. Families living in local authority estates-----

Local authorities have no mechanism to deal with such problems. They are waiting for the statutory instrument to be published by the Department of Justice and Equality. Can the Taoiseach indicate when that will be done in order that local authorities will have a free hand to deal with the issue appropriately?

Such people may not have the money to go to college on their return and are being discriminated against unfairly.

Irish Water has published its seven-year business plan. It stated in a presentation that it would raise €3 billion through borrowing. Clearly, this is unlawful, as the House passed the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013, section 35 of which states that Irish Water can only have a combined debt of €2 billion at any given time. What does the Taoiseach propose to do? Does he propose to ask Irish Water to produce a plan that remains within the law of the State?

My second question concerns a commitment in the programme for Government. The last time I asked the Taoiseach about the matter he said he would refer to the advice of the Attorney General. There is a clear commitment that no retired politician will get a political pension until the national retirement age.

#MichaelMcNamara	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-party	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	544	-----just not while I am on my feet. I think it is a discourtesy. There will be much discussion on the squeezed middle and double taxation, but I have considerable sympathy for one particular group and that is those who in good faith bought a house in a housing development which had planning permission, on which they could legitimately have expected work to have been done properly, that the works would have been supervised, given that we live in a civilised country, and that the estate would have eventually been taken in charge. In many estates throughout the country this is simply not the case. Estates have not been finished and will not be taken in charge. The local authorities are reluctant to do so because they were not the developer and just gave planning permission, but the roads and lights are unfinished and the greens are not maintained. The residents of these estates have very little comeback. On top of this, the Government introduced a local property charge. I have no sympathy for those who do not pay their taxes. The local property charge was introduced to fund local services such as roads, lights, open spaces, sewers and water mains. People who live in these estates pay this charge in good faith and in effect get nothing back because they must pay again on the double to a management committee to provide for this. There are obstacles in law to the local authorities taking these estates in charge. These include that a petition can be initiated or signed by the residents to have an estate which is not properly complete taken in charge, but this can only happen seven years after the planning permission has elapsed. Seven years is a very long time to pay the local property charge and get nothing back. Another obstacle is that local authorities which are not water services authorities cannot take the water mains and sewerage systems in charge. This covers every local authority because no local authority is now a water services authority. All the functions of water service authorities have been transferred to Irish Water. In practice what happens is a local authority engages in a discussion with Irish Water on taking an estate in charge and Irish Water considers the matter over a long and protracted period, as public bodies generally engage in very protracted discussions that take a long time, and it arrives at the conclusion that the water services in the estate are not up to scratch and were not properly done so it will not take it in charge. In particular, Irish Water is refusing to take in charge developer-led sewerage developments which do not go into the main sewage system but have a separate sewage treatment plant for the estate, many of which do not work, and when they do, they are funded by the residents. I am among the Deputies who encourage people to pay their local property and water charges because they have been legitimately introduced by the House, and regardless of whether one agrees with them, they have been introduced. It is very hard when people tell me they bought a house back in 2005 in good faith and paid an awful lot more for it than it is now worth while a fellow down the road bought another house, and in return for his water and local property charges he has the lights and the road outside his house maintained, running water into the house and the sewerage works properly. The people speaking to me are in an estate where the roads and the lights are not finished, the greens are not maintained and the sewerage system does not work and they ask me why should they pay for these. I honestly cannot say such people should pay for these. The people should pay, but the local authorities should take these estates in charge and if they incur costs in fixing these estates for which they gave planning permission - which they may well do and this is why they do not take them in charge - they can, of course, pursue the developer. At present the argument is there is a bond and perhaps residents of the estate should pursue the developer. They cannot do so because they are ordinary citizens who do not have that much money. Local authorities have money and legal departments and are in a position to remedy the situation, which is why I am bringing the legislation before the House.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	549	I welcome the opportunity to address the House on the diverse agenda of the European Council taking place next week in Brussels. Following the events of recent months, which have seen the greatest movement of people to and through Europe since World War II, international and European attention has rightly been focused on the current refugee and migration crisis. An extraordinary European Council was convened on 23 September, which I attended. Building on previous European Council meetings in April and June, this considered both the immediate crisis and some of the broader issues around migration and our collective efforts to deal with them. It agreed on a wide range of issues requiring intense and urgent further work. The European Council will next week continue its work on shaping a comprehensive EU approach on the basis of solidarity and responsibility and recognising the crisis points that exist around our Union. This will involve a further substantial discussion on migration in all its aspects, including follow-up on the points agreed at the previous European Council meetings. The Council will be briefed on the outcomes of the meetings with the Turkish President in Brussels on Monday and tomorrow's high level conference on the western Balkans route. It will also take stock of preparations for the Valletta summit with the African Union in early November. Also on the agenda and further to the June 2015 meeting, the European Council will take stock of discussions to date on the five presidents' report on economic and monetary union, based on work undertaken by the Council and by the Commission. Again following on from the June European Council, where British Prime Minister Cameron outlined his general thinking on EU reform and the UK referendum on EU membership, the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, will inform Heads of State and Government about the state of play of the technical analysis that has been taking place at official level. The president will also set out his intentions for the process ahead. I have asked the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, to address foreign policy issues in his wrap-up statement. Of course, the issue in Syria is directly relevant to the migration crisis. I will, however, now address the other issues on the agenda. I should add that the fact that this statement necessarily has had to be made somewhat earlier than usual means that the draft conclusions have not yet been circulated by President Tusk, nor have the normal preliminary discussions yet taken place in Brussels. The issue of migration and the current refugee crisis has been at the centre of European discussion for a number of months. European Union justice Ministers met twice in September at emergency Councils in Brussels, first to confirm an earlier decision to relocate 40,000 people and then to adopt proposals to relocate a further 120,000 people in need of international protection. This means that a total of 160,000 people seeking asylum will be relocated to other EU member states from Greece, Italy and other states that may be hit by a sudden inflow of nationals of third countries. At the informal European Council meeting on 23 September, progress on taking forward the various elements of a comprehensive approach to migration, which were broadly agreed at our meetings in April and June, was examined. Outcomes included a commitment of some €1 billion in budgetary assistance to agencies such as the UNHCR and the World Food Programme, as well as renewed diplomatic efforts to resolve the crises in Syria and Libya. Strengthening the protection of the EU's borders and better arrangements to process arriving asylum seekers in front-line countries were also discussed. Ireland has consistently called for solidarity, both externally and internally, in shaping the EU's responses to the migration issue. We have aimed in our approach to be both compassionate and practical, seeking to alleviate suffering, as well as tackling root causes. I note that Ireland has been making an important contribution on a number of fronts to ongoing efforts to tackle the crisis. The Government has agreed that it will accept in the region of 4,000 asylum seekers and refugees overall under resettlement and relocation programmes. This is well in excess of any notional "quota" that we might have been attributed by the European Commission. This includes 520 refugees who we have offered to resettle from refugee camps. Some of these have now started arriving in Ireland. The decisions to relocate 600 people from Italy and Greece under the initial Commission proposal and a further approximately 1,850 under the subsequent Commission proposal were, of course, subject to Oireachtas approval. This has now been received and the European Commission was duly notified on Monday, 5 October, of Ireland's intention to join the two measures. The remaining 1,030 people will be taken on resettlement or on relocation, with the final breakdown between these two categories still under consideration. We have deployed a naval vessel and full crew in the Mediterranean since June, initially the LE Eithne, then LE Niamh and now the LE Samuel Beckett, to assist our Italian colleagues in their international humanitarian search and rescue efforts there. Since May, our naval vessels have rescued 7,639 people. We are extremely proud of their outstanding endeavours in very difficult circumstances, and I know that everyone in the House and the Irish people as a whole are united in their admiration and appreciation. Why would that not be the case, given our history of coffin ships off Canada and the United States? Importantly, we provide other supports to areas particularly affected by instability and conflict. For example, a total of €41 million will have been provided by the end of 2015 towards assisting those displaced as a result of the Syrian crisis, including through participation in a regional development and protection programme in the Middle East. We have also provided almost €36 million in humanitarian funding to Somalia over the past number of years. Furthermore, at the start of September, we committed to doubling our annual contribution to the World Food Programme from €10 million to €20 million per annum for the next three years. All of these measures have been supported by a swift response at home, led by the Department of Justice and Equality, to put measures in place that will facilitate the arrival of refugees to Ireland and offer a welcome safe haven for those seeking international protection. The announcement on 10 September of the establishment of the Irish refugee protection programme and particularly the efforts of a new interdepartmental task force chaired by the Department of Justice and Equality are important steps in the Government’s contribution to long-term sustainable solutions to this crisis. An important part of Ireland’s response to the migration crisis is our participation in forthcoming high level meetings with a specific regional focus, both of which were also discussed at the extraordinary European Council meeting on 23 September. The first meeting, the western Balkans conference, takes place in Luxembourg tomorrow and will be attended by Ministers dealing with migration issues. This will immediately follow the scheduled meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council tomorrow and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Frances Fitzgerald, will attend on behalf of Ireland. The western Balkans conference is expected to agree a declaration emphasising the need for solidarity and a collective response to what is a common challenge. In this context, Turkish President Erdogan’s visit to Brussels earlier this week, when he held talks with the presidents of the European Parliament, European Council and European Commission - Presidents Schulz, Tusk and Juncker - is significant. Turkey hosts over 2.2 million people from Syria and Iraq, so it must play an important part in addressing the crisis. President Juncker and President Erdogan at their meeting discussed a draft plan for strengthening co-operation between the EU and Turkey in responding to the migration crisis. This plan constitutes an important part of the ongoing political dialogue between the EU and Turkey, building on but going beyond the accession framework. It focuses on supporting refugees and their host communities in Turkey on the one hand and stepping up co-operation in combating irregular migration on the other. The Commission and President Erdogan agreed to take forward work on the plan quickly. There will be continuing indepth consideration of the issue as it affects Turkey and other partners at the western Balkans conference tomorrow and of course, following that, at the European Council itself. The conference declaration is expected to identify five key common actions, including support for host governments and communities in Syria’s immediate neighbourhood, primarily Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey; support to affected transit countries; co-operation in the fight against people-smuggling and associated organised crime; addressing the root causes of forced displacement; and working with countries of origin. We are hopeful that the conference will contribute to making progress in dealing with this very complex and difficult issue. A second meeting, bringing together EU leaders and our African counterparts, as well as representatives of multilateral organisations in the region, will take place in Valletta, Malta, on 11 and 12 November. This summit was identified by EU leaders at our April Council as a valuable opportunity to increase engagement with our African partners.The purpose of the summit is to focus on the external relations dimension of migration policy and to find the appropriate tools to address both current and future migratory challenges. The conference will seek to build on existing co-operation frameworks with African partners, many of which are countries of origin and transit, in order to address migration challenges to our mutual benefit. It is proposed to issue two documents from the Valletta summit, a political declaration and an action plan with areas of action. Arrangements for the Valletta summit, including the preparation of these outcome documents, are ongoing across my Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Justice and Equality. At the upcoming European Council, Heads of State and Government will give further consideration to the report entitled Completing Europe’s Economic and Monetary Union, which was published by the presidents of the Euro Summit, the ECB, the Eurogroup, the European Parliament and the Commission on 22 June. This is known as the report of the five presidents. At the June European Council, the report was noted and referred back to Council for "rapid examination". It will be recalled that, building on measures implemented in recent years to make economic and monetary union, EMU, more stable and resilient, the report proposes a two-stage approach to further reform. The first is a short-term stage focused on boosting competitiveness, maintaining responsible fiscal policies and completing banking union, while the second is a longer-term stage which could involve more significant changes to the EU’s economic and institutional architecture. Following discussions by finance Ministers at the informal ECOFIN in September and by social and employment Ministers at EPSCO on 5 October, the Commission is expected to present some definite proposals for stage one in the coming weeks. These are likely to include an in-depth review of the so-called six-pack and two-pack, which set out detailed fiscal rules in the framework of the Stability and Growth Pact, some reorganisation of the European semester, and a proposal for unified external representation of the euro area at international financial institutions. Subsequent proposals are expected to focus on completing the banking union. Ways to strengthen the euro area’s focus on competitiveness issues and its ability to take an overview of its fiscal position are also being considered. There has also been discussion of ways to strengthen the social dimension of the euro area. In general terms, Ireland is pragmatic and realistic about what can be achieved. As we see it, economic governance within EMU has been subject to major changes in recent years. The effects of these changes still have to be fully worked through, particularly at national level, where a considerable European dimension has been introduced into the framing of budgets. Our stated position has been that work must continue on fully implementing the current economic governance framework, rather than engaging in significant further initiatives. Our focus has to be on practical measures for driving economic growth and the EU's ability to deliver for its citizens. However, we welcome the focus of the proposed short-term measures in stage one, particularly the completion of banking union and acceleration of the capital markets union, CMU, with the CMU action plan, which was launched by the Commission on 30 September. As for the medium to longer term, as the debate on future options becomes more concrete, which it may not be for some time, we will continue to engage fully with partners and the institutions on the basis of our own national analysis. I welcome the recent hearings by the Joint Committee on European Affairs on the future of EMU, which represent a useful contribution to widening debate here. Finally, I will just say a word on the issue of the United Kingdom’s membership of the European Union. Firstly, I understand that President Tusk intends to update Heads of State and Government at the Council on the state of play of the technical work that has been under way in Brussels between British and EU officials since the June European Council. I look forward to hearing from President Tusk and to finding out how he sees the process advancing in the weeks ahead. There is an expectation that the UK Prime Minister, David Cameron, will present his latest thinking on the issues he has identified at some stage after the European Council meeting, and the hope is that this will lead to a phase of more detailed discussion. The arrangements for taking forward that detailed discussion are not yet clear, but there is likely to be further consideration by Heads of State and Government at the European Council meeting in December. I set out the position of the Government at some length in answer to questions in the House last week. However, I would like to take this opportunity again to stress that the place of the United Kingdom in the European Union is of real national importance for Ireland, and this issue is a strategic priority for the Government. I have made clear to Mr. Cameron in my discussions with him how much value we attach to the fact that both of our countries are members of the European Union. We are therefore watching developments very closely. Officials in my Department, our permanent representation in Brussels and our embassy in London are in very regular contact with British and other colleagues. We will be open and pragmatic when it comes to sensible proposals to improve the EU and make it better able to meet the needs of its citizens, and also to address specific UK concerns, although of course we will be fully conscious both of our own national interests and of the views of other member states. We will work with the British Government and all our EU partners to find a consensual basis for the UK’s continued membership of our Union. I look forward to learning more about progress next week and, of course, to reporting to the House afterwards. The European Council will, therefore, address a number of important issues. I expect that, in keeping with the urgency and complexity of the situation, migration will dominate proceedings, but the discussions of EMU and the UK will also be of considerable interest for the longer term. I look forward now to hearing Deputies’ comments and perspectives.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	550	When this Dáil first met, four and a half years ago, there was cross-party agreement that we would put European issues at the heart of our discussions. We all agreed that pan-EU matters had become too important for Ireland to be left as an afterthought. Unfortunately, the reality is that things have actually got worse. There has, on occasion, been more time scheduled for speeches, but the level of serious engagement with European issues has got worse. Ultimately, our Government or Parliament has not engaged properly with the major issues facing Europe today. As the Government enters its final days, it has no stated policy on the reform of the Union. It is content with banal generalities with regard to the UK's position. It has accepted policies on banking union and fiscal controls which leave untouched key causes of the recession. It has been playing catch-up on the refugee crisis, only starting to engage once the scale of public outrage became clear. Deputies have lost count of the number of times the Taoiseach has come in here to say that everything is in hand and the crisis is being addressed. Yet Europe continues to stumble from crisis to crisis. The failure of the Taoiseach and his colleagues to act before a situation reaches boiling point continues to define their behaviour. Today's debate is actually the first time in four months that we have been allowed to discuss Europe. The Taoiseach refused to report to the Dáil on two previous meetings of leaders even though we requested that time be scheduled. In his contribution the Taoiseach has again spoken at length and said little of substance. The one thing Ireland and Europe desperately need is to end the lack of ambition and energy which characterises how the Taoiseach and other leaders approach every issue. For the last two years, I and my colleague Deputy Brendan Smith have repeatedly raised the humanitarian disaster that has emerged in Syria. The mass movement of refugees to Europe is no surprise to anyone who has been paying attention to what is one of the largest refugee crises for over 50 years. At the root of the crisis is a dictatorship that chose to wage war on its own people rather than concede democratic rights. The early support the Assad regime received from some other countries and the Hezbollah movement was decisive in stopping its collapse and leading to a dramatic radicalisation. The conflict has developed into a many-fronted civil war, with the ISIS grouping representing a barbaric new element. More than 12 million people have been displaced and they are overwhelmingly to be found in neighbouring countries. The people - up to a million of them - who have risked their lives in an effort to reach Europe are not refugees by choice. They are fleeing intolerable conditions. They are denied even the most basic right of being able to live safely and to look after their families. Massive camps with only basic facilities, no schools, no work and no hope are the reality for millions who have fled to Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. There comes a point at which endurance can go no further and that is why we have seen the pressures of recent months. They do not want to be refugees; they want to live peacefully in their own land, and because this is not possible, we have a moral obligation to help them.The failure by the international community to respond to the refugee crisis quickly and comprehensively is why so many have now come to Europe. In the summits of June and September as well as in the agenda for next week's summit, there continues to be a strategy of trying to find a way of doing as little as possible to muddle through. The frankly xenophobic comments of certain leaders were a disgrace. This is no time to pander to the extremists who want to spread fear. It is a time to assert the primacy of the values which we should share as Europeans. I welcome the fact that there has been a broad humanitarian consensus in Irish society and we must all work to protect this. I welcome the Government's eventual agreement to a significant resettlement plan and for the principle that all countries should accept a share of the task. What has yet to happen is for a plan to be outlined which is proportionate to the challenge. There is no comprehensive plan and there is no real commitment to helping countries which face disproportionate pressures. This is an unprecedented emergency. The European Union and its member states cannot address it if every proposal has to be dealt with through existing resources, and yet so far every initiative is to be funded through the reallocation of existing funds which mostly involves diverting money from other urgent humanitarian tasks. This zero-sum approach cannot continue. A dramatic increase in funding is required for these actions. First, and most important, is to give hope to the millions living in camps. They need decent facilities and access to education and some work. Their main desire is to return home and until this is possible, they need our help. Second, we must recognise the particular needs of member states which are facing the greatest pressures. All of the evidence is that their capacities are stretched to or beyond breaking point. Basic solidarity requires that they be helped. Finally, each member state needs to genuinely welcome those who have fled a conflict which has been relentless and bloody. The Defence Forces have continued to play an honourable and effective role in the Mediterranean. We should be proud of them and the great tradition of Óglaigh na hÉireann in serving the State and humanitarian causes throughout the world. Next week leaders will discuss the programme for the special regional summit in Valletta. As currently drafted, there is no indication of genuine urgency or ambition. In relation to the conflict in, and increasingly around, Syria there have been very disturbing developments in recent months. The Kurdish forces have played a positive role in confronting IS. The decision of the Turkish Government to hinder Iraqi and Syrian Kurdish forces and to re-launch a full-scale conflict with the PKK is serving no one's interests. There is an urgent need for an intervention to try to end this escalation. The imminent Turkish election may well be playing a role, but we need to do everything possible to support a return to the peace process once it is over. The decision of Russia to put troops into Syria and to begin daily bombings has been directed at the sole aim of protecting the Assad regime. The majority of attacks appear to have been against the more moderate opposition, including Kurdish forces, and have been well away from the areas dominated by ISIS. There is no scenario in which Assad will be able to bring peace to his country. The conflict began because of his efforts to crush moderate opposition and it escalated because of his brutality, including using chemical weapons against his own people. From the very beginning, and at a point where the conflict was solely an internal Syrian affair, Russia has blocked any international effort to support a transition in the country. Separately, there have been indications that Russia is de-escalating the conflict in eastern Ukraine, and this is to be welcomed. What it does not yet show is a willingness of Russia to end its occupation and partition of Ukraine. Its imperialist agenda against a former subject state remains in place. So too does its efforts to find and use what Lenin once called "useful idiots" in Europe who will defend Russia no matter what it does, particularly through deploying false comparisons and demands to remove any consequences for Russia of its actions. Parties on the extreme right and extreme left remain active advocates for lifting sanctions against Putin's Government. There have been signs in recent days of a push by some major businesses to get back into the Russian market. Our Government should join with those who are demanding that there be no restoration of normal relations as long as Russia continues its policy of occupation and partition. The summit is due to have a further discussion concerning reforms to economic and monetary union. There are, in fact, no genuine reforms being proposed. None of the already identified causes of the recession is to be tackled. The banking union covers only a fraction of the industry at the core of the meltdown. There is no shared deposit guarantee system and moves are already in place to limit the oversight of banks which pose systemic risks. There are not even proposals for a fiscal union which would allow for regions under the most pressure to receive help at times of greatest need. All we have is a set of controls relating to deficits and debt. While the specific targets set in these controls may be reasonable, and they are appropriate for Ireland, they are entirely inappropriate in many situations. They preclude stimulus spending in cases where this can be afforded. They also preclude the type of policies which helped other countries to more quickly and robustly exit the recession. The threat of deflation is again present and the only thing standing in the way of a new recession is an ECB programme, which has been opposed by Germany and which has been referred to the Court of Justice. The Taoiseach's refusal even to argue for a set of real reforms to EMU is representative of a policy which has emphasised photo opportunities and pats on the head over genuine substance. The summit is also due to hear further details about British proposals for the renegotiation of parts of its membership of the Union. The rhetoric at this week's Tory party conference has been far beyond anything which Ireland should be willing to accept. The absence of the moderating influence of the Liberal Democrats from the Cameron Administration is clearly having an impact. Most strikingly, United Kingdom Ministers have begun deploying arguments which were directly refuted by the independent review of EU policies carried out in the past few years. The basic drift of their demands is to seek a protection of all of the benefits of membership in relation to markets but to undermine all social elements of membership. United Kingdom membership of the Union is something which Ireland has a major interest in, but this must not mean that we will pay any price to make it continue. It is long since passed the time when the Government should put on the record its basic response to the Tory demands. This should be an issue in the election, whenever the cycle of spin runs out and the Taoiseach decides to end the permanent campaign which has defined his approach to government. The basic model of the European Union which we signed up to is one which sees economic and social progress as inseparable objectives. We did not only sign up for a free market; we signed up for a free market which gave a guarantee of fair competition based on decent working conditions and protections. The British have not been able to demonstrate the negative impact of laws against discrimination, bad working conditions and exploitative contracts. These form the core of what a modern decent society should have in place. We must reject any push to enable a rush to the bottom. Equally, we should oppose any proposals concerning restrictions of social supports. This has the potential to undermine the position of hundreds of thousands of Irish citizens and at a minimum, we should demand a legal commitment from Britain that the rights of the Irish people will not be changed. This has particular implications for mobility on this island and the reduction of current rights from their current iron-clad basis is something we will absolutely oppose.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	551	I wish to share time with Deputy Crowe. At the outset, I congratulate and praise the work of the crew of the LE Samuel Beckett which rescued 430 refugees who were in trouble in the Mediterranean Sea this weekend. This is the third Irish vessel to carry out search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean and, collectively, they have rescued 7,639 people. The brave crews of these ships are a great credit to the Irish people.I am disappointed the Taoiseach has not taken the opportunity to tell the Dáil whether the rescue operation will continue beyond December. A row has erupted over allowances to be paid to Naval Service personnel in the Mediterranean. Gerry Rooney of PDFORRA has said members of the Naval Service who volunteered for this dangerous mission feel they have been duped and are being ignored given the refusal to pay them the same rate as troops involved in UN peace missions on land. I am sure the Taoiseach agrees these Naval Service personnel carry out their duties to a very high standard and to international acclaim and are entitled to be properly paid for their crucially important work. The EU’s collective response to the refugee crisis, the most serious refugee crisis since the Second World War, has been weak and has exposed major rifts between member states. While Germany and Sweden’s response has been laudable, countries such as Hungary are criminalising refugees and others are doing the bare minimum. My colleague and Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness, has confirmed that the first Syrians selected under a resettlement scheme will arrive in the North before December. While the scheme will begin with a modest number, more will arrive in the future on a phased basis and I welcome this initial and progressive step. Ní fhaca muid a leithéid de seo riamh agus tá daoine ag fulaingt go géar. Caithfimid níos mó a dhéanamh ná mar atáimid á dhéanamh anois. I hope the Taoiseach will argue for a humane and moral approach to the refugee crisis at the European Council meeting and that he will stand up to the European governments which are seeking to criminalise refugees. The European Council meeting will also focus on the negotiations surrounding the British in-out referendum on the EU. Sinn Féin believes a British withdrawal from the EU would represent a major political and economic challenge for the island of Ireland. Such a development could hinder the process of democratic transformation in the North. A Brexit could lead to the prospect of a reinforced partition, with the potential for customs checkpoints, trading tariffs and adverse knock-on effects for all-island economic activity and co-operation on a cross-Border basis. Citizens in the North could also see the loss of Common Agricultural Policy and Common Fisheries Policy payments. They could also suffer the loss of EU Structural Funds which have been central to small and medium enterprise development, community regeneration and government programmes. As well as the dreadful economic, social and political implications, the proposed referendum is profoundly undemocratic. The referendum, as it is planned, will allow the views of English voters to dictate the future relationship of the North - and therefore Ireland as a whole - with the EU. I look to the Taoiseach to raise these concerns at the European Council meeting and inform other European leaders about how serious and damaging a Brexit would be for this island. Last week, while in New York, I met the Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, whom I congratulated on his very successful election campaign. I briefed him on the current political situation in Ireland and he outlined the next challenges facing the people of Greece. Much of our conversation focused on the two big issues in Europe, namely, debt and refugees. The geographic location of Greece has meant it has had to contend with a major influx of refugees fleeing conflict and persecution in the Middle East. Dealing with the issue in the midst of major economic and financial difficulties has clearly tested the Greek state and the Greek people who have shown great generosity and resilience. While international attention has shifted to Syria and the refugee crisis, the need for debt relief has not gone away. There was a Eurogroup meeting last Monday, and Greece hopes to open negotiations on debt relief by the end of the year. The Taoiseach's position and that of his Minister for Finance of no debt relief but crippling austerity for Greece is impossible to justify on economic grounds. It is a cynical political position aimed at covering for the Taoiseach's own failure to achieve or even request debt relief for the citizens of this State. Everyone knows Greece cannot repay its debt. Failing to recognise it merely stores up an even more serious crisis down the road. If the Taoiseach's interests stretch beyond his electoral fortunes, he must, in discussion with his EU counterparts, support the IMF's call for significant debt relief for Greece and for Ireland. An ndéanfaidh an Taoiseach é seo?
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	552	As my colleague, Deputy Adams, and the Taoiseach have pointed out, Europe is facing its most major refugee crisis since the Second World War. The matter will be the primary issue at the European Council meeting. Will the Taoiseach ensure any national spending on the refugee crisis by EU member states is excluded from debt and deficit calculations? I ask the Taoiseach to bring this positive message to the table. While I welcome that the Government has agreed to accept 4,000 refugees, I am concerned about the lack of accurate detail and information surrounding the relocation. A cohort of 520 will arrive in Ireland already classified as refugees. However, the other 3,500 will come to Ireland under the Irish refugee protection programme and will instead seek refugee status when they arrive. Will they be forced into the disgraceful direct provision system or a similar programme with a different name? This is everyone's concern. Given that direct provision has failed many people, we do not want people to go through the process. Irish officials are expected to travel to Italy later this month to help select the first intake of almost 2,500 people due to arrive under the EU resettlement programmes. Most are likely to be Syrian, Iraqi and Eritrean nationals. How will they be selected? What are the criteria? I am also very concerned about the possibility of expelling refugees who arrive in the EU if they have arrived from what the EU is now calling safe third countries. This could see refugees sent back to Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon where they face inhumane conditions, crippling poverty and possible human rights violations. People have referred to the positive role our Naval Service is playing and I join in the praise and urge that Ireland continue these life-saving missions. While the weather will become worse over the winter, the conflict in Syria continues to become more violent and brutal, which means more people will risk their lives to reach what they perceive as safety in Europe. I have received breaking news that the EU is planning to fast-track the deportation of refugees fleeing Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and others if their asylum applications have failed. Leaks have suggested the proposals will include threats to withdraw aid, trade deals and visa arrangements if countries refuse to take back refugees. If there is substance to these leaks, it is a very significant step. The proposals also envisage EU states detaining thousands of people to prevent them from absconding to avoid deportation. We have this image in our heads. Is the Taoiseach aware of this and what is Ireland's position? I urge the Taoiseach to ensure Ireland strongly opposes this move which is wrong and will involve major potential human rights violations. In recent days, renewed clashes have broken out in occupied east Jerusalem leaving several dead and tensions heightened to an unprecedented level. Will the Taoiseach raise this important issue at the European Council meeting? Every day we hear about another violation of Palestinian fundamental rights, another violent clash on a holy site or, increasingly, another fatality in the region. Over the weekend, three young Palestinians were killed, one of whom was a 13 year old boy still in his school uniform.In the last week, over 500 Palestinians have been wounded, 200 of them with live bullets. This is the context for the ongoing illegal occupation of Palestine. The brutal repression, the intensification of illegal settlement and the collective punishment and humiliation of the Palestinian civil population are adding to the heightened tension. The illegal ban on Palestinians entering the old city of Jerusalem has to stop immediately, as does the blanket restriction on Palestinians, Christians and Muslims trying to access their holy sites in Jerusalem. People of all faiths must be free to worship unconditionally. The fig leaf of security should not be used to bar one from one's church. The downhill path of trying to present an occupation as a religious conflict is extremely dangerous and should be stopped at its heels. Israeli religious discrimination, coupled with an alarming increase in Israeli settler violence, is made worse by the total impunity with which Israel acts. The international community cannot stand idly by as the occupying power and settler militias continue their violent crimes against the Palestinian people. The international community and the EU must act immediately and responsibly to insist on respect for international law without exception. Even though the state of Palestine has repeatedly appealed for international protection, the EU continues to provide Israel with favourable political agreements. I think that goes against the views of populations right across Europe and certainly against the view of the Irish people. There are real fears that this latest violence will lead to a third intifada. I ask the Taoiseach to call on the EU to act urgently and decisively to alleviate the immense suffering of the Palestinian people. The labelling and banning of all illegal settlement goods is a positive step that Europe could introduce. The recognition of Palestine is another step that this country could take, bearing in mind that it is the collective view of this House, as agreed by Deputies of all parties and none. I suggest that this is something the Irish people would broadly support. There is huge support out there for this. I propose that the Irish Government take the next step by recognising the state of Palestine.

I have seldom seen as little opposition in Europe to the militarisation of the Middle East and beyond. All of them seem almost to have bought into the philosophy that this is the way things are done now. France and Britain were initially pretty reluctant to take in refugees. Obviously, they and many others, including ourselves, have been shamed into it by Germany at this stage. They actually want to bomb Syria now, as if that is going to improve things. It is bad enough that the Russians have started. The whole thing is getting worse. They are all engaged in mindless nonsense. The devastation is incredible. George Monbiot described it accurately in The Guardian today:There are no simple solutions to the chaos and complexities western firepower has helped to unleash, though a good start would be to stop making them worse. But a vast intelligence and military establishment that no president since Jimmy Carter has sought to control, the tremendous profits to be made by weapons companies and military contractors, portrayals of these conflicts in the media that serve only to confuse and bamboozle: they all help to ensure that armed escalation, however pointless and counter-productive, appears unstoppable.He also refers to NATO's description of the bombing of the hospital in Kunduz:"The strike may have resulted in collateral damage to a nearby medical facility." This is how an anonymous Nato spokesperson described Saturday’s disaster in Afghanistan. Let's translate it into English. "We bombed a hospital, killing 22 people." But "people", "hospital" and "bomb", let alone "we": all such words are banned from Nato's lexicon.The plane came back repeatedly to bomb the people trying to escape from the building. We are sitting at the table with these people. We have troops from our Defence Forces over there. Seven Irish defence personnel are working with these fellows in Afghanistan. What is wrong with us? This is a war crime. We have been told that the Americans are going to do an internal investigation. I suggest that is like getting the fox to investigate a raid on the chicken house. Can the Minister of State and his colleagues start calling the truth the truth and challenging war crime when they see it?

#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	557	A quote from Rosa Luxemburg, when she wrote about the atrocities in the German Revolution, is very apt in light of the migration crisis that has been unfolding on Europe's borders: "Usually a corpse is a silent, unhandsome thing, but sometimes dead bodies speak louder than trumpets and shine brighter than torches." The harrowing images of three year old Aylan Kurdi washed up on a beach and of the scores of bodies found suffocated in the back of a truck in Austria have served as a torch for people across Europe. There has been a massive outpouring of solidarity with those who are fleeing war and poverty in Syria and other parts of the world, including Afghanistan, the Middle East and north Africa. Recent events have highlighted the bloody, tragic reality of fortress Europe. Over the past 20 years, some 20,000 people have died trying to enter Europe. This year alone, more than 2,500 migrants are believed to have been drowned. The European powers have a responsibility for this. They are not just the charitable benefactors here. They are responsible for it. They are responsible for the racist policies of fortress Europe. They are responsible for the Europe-based arms industry profiting to the tune of billions from the conflict in Syria. They are responsible for stoking up the conflict in Syria by supporting air strikes and pumping arms into the country. Their support for the invasion of Iraq led to the creation and formation of ISIS and the massive instability across the region. I invite Deputies to look at the conclusions from the last Council and at the plans for the Valletta conference in November, both of which focus on having the north African states act as a buffer against migration and plans to increase EU intervention in north Africa and the Sahara region, including so-called initiatives in the field of law enforcement. This is no solution. If we sink the boats of people traffickers, migrants will be driven into even more perilous and desperate measures to try to make it to Europe. They will take more risks and more of them will die. I suggest that further backing for the EU strategy for the Sahel will not work, as it is a thinly veiled support for increased imperialist intervention in the region and the backing of French imperialism in particular. Military intervention is driving the refugee crisis. Approximately 85% of the migrants who arrive in Greece come from Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq and Somalia, all of which have seen Western military intervention. Any solution must be based on ending imperialist interventions, upholding the right of people to asylum and following the lead that has been shown by people across Europe. I refer to the outpouring of solidarity we have seen in response to the mass movement of refugees and their allies. There is need to tear down the fences, break down the racist borders, bring down the racist fortress that is Europe and fight for a decent life for everybody. In this State, that should involve immediately abolishing direct provision and giving people the right to work.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	558	If ever there was a time for those who have any conscience or any care for human beings to receive a wake-up call, now is that time. The actions of the big powers - the Western powers and Russia - have led to the disintegration of the societies of the vast majority of the war-torn countries from which 12 million people have been displaced and the subsequent unleashing of the worst refugee crisis we have seen since the Second World War. Is it not time for people to speak the truth about why this is happening and to respond with compassion and humanity?The European Union, which is making noises about being humane and compassionate, is playing a double game. Over 12 million people have been displaced, but we are talking about only taking in 160,000. There are 2 million refugees in Turkey alone, with millions more in Lebanon and Jordan; that is okay for them, but we can only take 160,000. It is pathetic. At the same time, we talk about strengthening border controls and making it more difficult for people to get into the EU. That hypocrisy has to stop, as does the hypocrisy of refusing to speak out about what the big powers are doing in fuelling this situation in the first place. If we are serious, we must do something about the arms industry. Given that no-one else is doing it, will the Government ask why Britain and the United States are financing Saudi Arabia? Why are we not imposing punitive taxes and stopping the arms trade, which is fuelling this situation? Somebody has to say this.  I will move on briefly to the issue of Palestine, a long-term example of exactly the same issue. Israel is a state that is involved in illegal occupation and in horrific, ongoing, systematic, deliberate and unashamed attacks on people's human and civil rights, but we are still doing business with it. We allow it to have an embassy here. We go to conferences and summits and do not say, "This is unacceptable." When will some sort of moral conscience inform the foreign policy of this and other countries? When are we going to say that this has to stop? When are we going to stop pretending these guys are normal when in fact they are warmongers, tyrants and despots who are slaughtering people? They should not be part of the international community of nations until they stop this kind of behaviour. It is long past time these things were said, and it would be nice if this country, with its history, began to say them.

The conclusion one comes to every time one reads a speech from a Minister or the Taoiseach is that Ireland is a passenger on the European train and that we do not really count. I wonder sometimes what happens when the Irish delegation arrives. Perhaps the Minister of State can tell us. Does Mrs. Merkel turn around and say, "God, we had better listen to these guys. These guys are boat rockers - they are going to make us stand up and think"? Quite the opposite, it appears. One could excuse the utterly cowardly attitude, with the anonymous, voiceless Irish delegation saying nothing that would rock the boat, at a time when we were in extraordinary debt to Europe and dependent upon it for everyday funding. Now, however, we are apparently out of the European doghouse and are prospering. We are the poster boy of Europe, but we are still refusing to take a lead on any issue at all. I ask the Minister of State to point out to the House one example in which Ireland has said "This is wrong and we must do the following" - an example of Ireland taking a position of leadership at the European table. What one sees in Europe at the moment is the management of a series of crises. We had the crisis in Greece, at which time we disgraced ourselves by hiding behind the big powers while we watched Greece falter in a sea of debt. Now Europe and Ireland are pretending that the Greek situation is resolved, but this particular problem is going to come back to bite us time and again because of the attitude that has been taken. As Deputy Adams has said, the debt is still there and it is enormous and unpayable, but no-one is facing up to that. Ireland is relieved that the Greeks have not embarrassed us by actually getting a massive default, which would have made us look utterly stupid. Crisis management in other areas was responded to by the Taoiseach in his speech today with the assertion that Ireland's attitude in each instance - to the Greek, migrant and UK crises - is one of being "pragmatic." Pragmatic is an old Fianna Fáil word and means that one is not guided by any principles but by "whatever you're having yourself" on the day. That is the one characteristic that runs through the Irish attitude to all of these crises.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	560	The picture conjured up by Deputy Ross of the Irish delegation going cap in hand and doffing the cap to the European establishment is one that we can all visualise. It is a tragedy and a particular disgrace against the backdrop of what is going on in Europe at the moment, with a refugee crisis to which the European response has been too little, too late. That response has ignored the reality that it is not Europe that has a migrant crisis but the migrants who have a problem with Europe and with the military interventions by this Government's allies and friends in the United States. Those interventions are one of the key reasons for the large number of refugees. The Minister of State would do well at that meeting to remind his European counterparts of that fact. He should also recognise, within that, Ireland's role and complicity by allowing the US military to continue to use Shannon Airport as a "virtual forward airbase" for its forces, as described by Dr. Tom Clonan. This Government wants a pat on the back for accepting 4,000 refugees, and I am glad that we are accepting them. I note that the Minister for Justice and Equality said last week that the refugees would not be put into the direct provision system, clearly acknowledging that the Government could not humiliate itself by allowing refugees and war victims from Syria to be put up in a few caravans in Mosney. That would not look too good. It would help if the Government focused on the fact that there are people living in such conditions now, and that reality must be addressed too. If Europe wants to go forward it must look at where it came from. The Minister of State might ask his European colleagues what they thought would happen when they started channelling money away from helping people and into building walls and fences. They cut the Mare Nostrum programme and replaced it with Operation Triton, which to a large extent is about border control and not about humanitarian refugee support. I welcome the fact that the programme has been somewhat reformed, but the reality is that most European expenditure is going on border controls and not on assisting migrants. That is not the way forward. Will the Minister of State make those points at the meeting? Will he also support the calls for an independent investigation into the war crime that happened in the Médecins sans Frontières hospital in Afghanistan? Will the Minister of State call for an investigation into that incident, in which 22 people, including three children, were butchered? People were burned in their beds in that atrocity. What position will the Minister of State take on it? Maybe that is something on which he will take a lead for a change.

#DaraMurphy	unknown-#DaraMurphy-party	unknown-#DaraMurphy-dob	unknown-#DaraMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	563	That said, there have been some very productive observations from other members of the Opposition. As the Taoiseach has mentioned, I will address some of the external relations and foreign policy issues that might arise for discussion at the meeting next week. However, I must note that with the imminent publication of our budget, this House is carrying out a slightly earlier than usual consideration of the European Council agenda. It has not yet been clarified which foreign policy issues will be dealt with by the Heads of State and Government. That said, the focus of the European Council agenda is, of course, on migration and the instability which persists, particularly in Europe's southern neighbourhood. There is also a suggestion that there will be some discussion of Syria, Iraq and Libya. I wish to emphasise, as the Taoiseach did earlier, that an important part of the Irish and European Union response to the migration crisis is working with countries of both origin and transit and attempting to deal with the root causes of the huge migratory flows that we are currently witnessing. In this regard, the European Council will discuss the two upcoming international conferences which are of most relevance - that is, the conference on the eastern Mediterranean-western Balkans route, which takes place in Luxembourg tomorrow, and the Valletta summit, which will take place on 11 and 12 November. The western Balkans conference is expected to agree a declaration emphasising the need for solidarity and an action plan.The action plan will address support for host governments and communities in Syria's immediate neighbourhood, primarily Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey, support to affected transit countries, co-operation in the fight against people smuggling and associated organised crime, addressing the root causes of forced displacement, and working with the countries of origin. The Valletta summit of European Union leaders and their African counterparts, along with multilateral organisations, will focus on the external relations dimensions of migration policy. The Valletta conference will seek to build on existing co-operation frameworks and issue two documents, namely, a political declaration and an action plan.  The ending of the Syrian conflict is essential to stabilising the Middle East, stopping the spread of radical terrorism and addressing the humanitarian and security crises which are afflicting the Syrian people and neighbouring countries. Ireland and the European Union remain strongly supportive of the efforts of the current United Nations envoy, Mr. Staffan de Mistura, to bring the conflict towards a close. Ireland's position, which has been restated on many occasions, is that a political solution remains the only basis for resolving the crisis in Syria and Iraq. We have consistently called for all regional and international stakeholders with influence over the parties to the conflict to give their support to the ongoing efforts of the United Nations to find a peaceful solution to this tragic conflict.  The position in Libya remains one of grave concern. Outbreaks of violence continue and large swathes of the country remain under the control of militant groups, including Islamic State. Peace talks led by the UN special representative, Mr. Bernardino León, have come to an advanced and critical stage, with a final agreement between all parties drafted and awaiting a decision. Ireland fully supports the European Union and United Nations in encouraging all parties to accept the agreement and move forward towards the formation of a government of national accord. We stand ready to work with the European Union to support Libya in any way we can.  At this relatively early stage, it is not yet clear how exactly the Heads of State and Government will divide their time among the issues on next week's Council agenda. However, it is to be expected that the conclusions to be adopted will bring some focus, in particular, the necessary impetus for further essential work to be advanced.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	565	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this matter today. From my conversations with the Minister in recent days, I know she is fully up to date with the funding shortfall currently being experienced by St. Mary's national school in Drumlish. I thank her for the commitment I received that she would be happy to meet the school principal at some stage next week to discuss the issue in greater detail. The number of pupils in St. Mary's has steadily increased in recent years and the school has an enrolment of 209 pupils for the 2015-2016 academic year. The Minister of State will agree that this is an exception to the current trend in Ireland and a clear testament to the vibrant community in the Drumlish area. It is particularly people like the principal, Ms Deirdre Coffey, former principal, the late Ms Elizabeth Brady, and the staff who have spearheaded the expansion and growth of the school in recent years. Meanwhile, the local community, children, parents, staff and board of management have a long tradition of fund-raising for the school when it has needed financial assistance. However, on this occasion the financial assistance required is a bridge too far for the local community. The total grant aid allocated by the Department currently is approximately €1,200 per square metre whereas total building costs are in the order of €1,500 per square metre. As such, the school is currently falling short by €62,948. As the Minister of State can imagine, this is a substantial gap for a small rural school to try to close. At every stage of the process, the school and board of management have followed the procedures and guidelines set down by the Department and, in total, the school is set to receive €330,400 while total building costs are set at €393,348. This leaves a total shortfall of €62,948. If an outstanding grant of €23,500 is not approved, the shortfall will increase to €86,448. Yesterday, I received a reply to a number of parliamentary questions I asked regarding the securing of extra funding for St. Mary's. I was informed that it was open to the school authority to apply for additional funding but that, to date, no application had been received. While this is true, the school was in touch with the Department last week to raise the issue of the shortfall and it has asked for guidance on the matter. As of today, it has not received a reply. While departmental officials have been extremely helpful with the school at all times, some guidance from officials on how to apply for extra funding is needed. It is to be hoped this will be forthcoming. I look forward to funding coming forward because this is a very rural school that is doing well with increasing numbers. It is important to ensure it is fully supported by the Department. The Government has supported a large number of schools in the midlands and we are opening three new ones in my constituency in the next week.

#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	568	Listening to my constituency colleague, I might wonder what the point is in raising this Topical Issue if everything has been resolved, as nothing could be further from the truth. I met the board of management, the teachers and some parents a week ago. Like their children, they are worried about and confused by what is happening. There is a serious shortfall in the funding provided for an extension at St. Mary's school. Deputy Bannon is right that the school's numbers have exploded from 145 pupils in 2007 to 209 this year. The school applied through the devolved grant system, met the full terms and conditions in a voluntary capacity and relieved the pressure on the Department by putting the project out to tender itself. Given the size of the extension, the additional classrooms and the extra support room, the school has incurred an additional cost due to the new building regulations, but the Government has not allocated enough money, only providing approximately €1,200 per square metre at a time when building costs amount to €1,500 per square metre. The fire officer who carried out the inspection identified a number of deficiencies in the current building. That it must be upgraded is only right and proper, but this work should be done when extensive renovations are being conducted. The school chose the cheapest options in the construction and architect tender processes, but it has still found itself with a shortfall of almost €80,000. It is a DEIS school that serves many economically disadvantaged families. It cannot afford to meet the shortfall if the Government does not step up to the mark and make additional funding available. I welcome the Minister's statement today that she will meet a deputation of the school's principal and some members of its board of management. That is positive, but the principal and board do not want to come to Dáil Éireann for a day trip. They want to come here next week to find out that the Government has made the necessary funding available in order that the board and parents will not be left to make up the €80,000 shortfall.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	569	I thank the Deputies for raising this matter. In recent weeks, Deputy Bannon was in contact with the Minister and me in this regard. It is important we bring clarity to the situation. If there is any confusion, we will try to put it to bed. I will offer a formal answer, after which we can go through the details. This debate gives me the opportunity to outline to the House the current position regarding the building project that is under way at St. Mary's national school in Drumlish, County Longford. In January 2014, the school submitted an application to my Department's planning and building unit for two new 80 sq. m mainstream classrooms and a resource room to cater for increased enrolments. In March 2014, following an assessment of the school's application, the school authority received sanction for a devolved grant under my Department's 2014 additional accommodation scheme to build two additional mainstream classrooms and an additional resource room. The grant was sanctioned on condition that the school authority utilise the grant to build a permanent, stand-alone structure. Devolved grants allow school authorities the means to address their accommodation and building priorities with a guaranteed amount of funding and give them day-to-day control of their building projects. It is a central tenet of the devolved scheme that responsibility for the management of a project, including cost control, timing of tendering and construction, rests with the school authority. In September 2014, the school authority submitted an application for additional funding for a replacement boiler and an upgrade of its fire alarm system, emergency lighting and main electrical board. Additional funding was sanctioned for the costs associated with the boiler replacement and upgrade of the main electrical board. The costs in respect of the upgrade of the fire alarm system and emergency lighting were not approved, however, as these works were being carried out in the existing school building and were outside the scope of the approved project. The planning and building unit was informed that building works commenced on site in August and the first instalment of the approved grant was paid to the school authority in early September 2015. If the level of funding provided by the Department is not sufficient to cover the cost of the approved works, it is open to the school authority to apply for additional funding, which is a common practice. However, if works are being carried out over and above the approved works, the cost of these must be met by the school authority. The management authority of St. Mary's national school recently informed the planning and building unit that there was a shortfall in funding. In the coming days, the school will be requested to explain the reasons for this shortfall. On receipt of that information, my Department will be in a position to consider the request for additional funding. Obviously, there will be a time lag after the information comes forward. The process must be followed. A school submits the reasons for the increased costs and backs them up with evidence, after which time a decision can be made.

When a small rural school faces a shortfall of €62,000, something is wrong with the system. As construction has started at the school and is moving along steadily, time is against the school and the community in Drumlish. It is important that we bridge the gap of €62,000 and secure the extension. I welcome the Minister of State's remarks to the effect that, if the level of funding provided by the Department is not sufficient to cover the cost of the approved works, it will be open to the school authority to apply for additional funding. I have every confidence in the Minister of State that the request will be considered favourably. I have dealt with a large number of schools in terms of funding shortfalls and so on.

I do not doubt that the same will be the case with St. Mary's school in Drumlish. I thank the Minister of State for taking this debate. St. Mary's is an example of a rural school that is doing well and surviving in tough times. It should be held up as an example of how rural schools should be run. We should do everything in our power to support rural schools. I attended a rural school and have been proud of the rural school network.

#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	590	What is important is that the Minister of State has acknowledged that the central tenet of the devolved scheme is that schools are responsible for the management of their projects, including cost control, timing of tendering, and so on. The board of management of St. Mary's adhered to the letter of the law in this regard, on which it should be complimented. The problem is that the funding that has been allocated on a square footage basis is inadequate. The school has been in constant contact with the building unit in Tullamore seeking additional funds. I do not want to play politics with this matter. St. Mary's is a school in a DEIS area and cannot afford to meet the shortfall. I am not making this up. That there is a shortfall of almost €80,000 is a fact. If money is not made available, it will be left to parents, staff and the greater Drumlish area to make up the shortfall. This cannot happen.Members must ensure this scheme, administered through the Department of Education and Skills, is fit for purpose, by which I mean the money allocated must meet the building costs. At present, €1,200 per square metre is being allocated, whereas building costs are coming in at €1,500 per square metre. As the two do not add up, the Department must revisit it. Moreover, in this particular instance the school has been in contact informally with the Department's school building unit in Tullamore and it must ensure that when the formal application is received, it is dealt with in a fast, efficient and, most importantly, positive manner to relieve the current anxiety in Drumlish.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	591	I again thank both Deputies. To be clear, the Department's building and planning unit has proven itself to be fit for purpose in recent years. It has responded quite well and has a clear mission, which is to spend taxpayers' money correctly, wisely, fairly and equitably nationwide. Consequently, as the Deputy will appreciate, there must be a formal process. The unit has proved itself - I believe all Members have dealt with quite a number of cases over the years - and it can respond in the correct manner. The Deputy has indicated that the board of management has done the job correctly, with a good record and so on, and once a good record is in place and the school can prove that there has been a budget overrun and the reason for it, the Department and this unit always have shown the ability to do the job properly when a decision is to be made. However, Deputy Troy must appreciate that there must be a process. He is correct that there can sometimes be a timing difference between the allocation of money and the subsequent cost of building, but that must be shown clearly for the approved project. To be clear, I refer to the project that was approved; as the Deputy will appreciate, additional works are different. Hopefully this matter will be dealt with quite quickly. Information is going back and forth and the formal process is on the way but, in fairness, it is the unit's job to assess this matter and to deal with it properly. It will be helped if, as the Deputy noted, the board has done an excellent job in managing the devolved grant scheme. That scheme works well and has delivered many school projects in counties Meath, Westmeath and Longford and everywhere else. It is a successful approach that works well. Most schools speak highly of it, and this is how it should be kept. The unit will respond accordingly to the information provided.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	592	It is regrettable that the Minister of State's senior colleague is not present, given her proximity to the University of Limerick as a representative for the Limerick region. In any event, the Minister of State will be aware that allegations were brought to my attention in 2012 pertaining to alleged improper payments at the University of Limerick. At the time, I brought that matter to the Committee of Public Accounts and it went through a process. Unfortunately, Members do not have sight of what that process was back in 2012. However, a number of other whistleblowers have now come into the public domain and have made a number of allegations similar to those brought to my attention in 2012. These similar allegations were reported recently in the Limerick Leader and widely by other media outlets. There is much commonality between all these allegations, but one common theme to emerge is that many people who raised their heads and queried certain payments at the University of Limerick were asked to leave. Many of them were paid off and removed from their jobs. In addition, many of them were asked to sign confidentiality agreements and agree to not speak about their experiences. This is quite serious, given the number of people who now have come forward into the public domain. In addition, other people whom I know and to whom I have spoken have not come forward. These are people of the highest integrity who have professional qualifications and are part of professional associations. Their integrity is beyond question and they also have come forward. The alarm bells are ringing, and Members must sit up and take note in this regard. On foot of this, the University of Limerick has now issued High Court proceedings against the Limerick Leader newspaper, which is quite unprecedented, and against its editor, Mr. Alan English, personally. I have a serious issue with this action, because a State-funded institution is using taxpayers' money in an attempt to gag a newspaper and its editor, which are pursuing matters in the public interest that are in the public domain. In his reply, the Minister of State might address a couple of issues on behalf of his senior Minister. Is the Higher Education Authority the competent authority to hold an investigation into this affair? I ask because the Minister of State's senior line Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, stated this week that she would support the intention to have an external examination of this issue and that the reputation of the University of Limerick was hugely important. All Members agree with that and wish to see it protected. She stated that what was needed was someone independent to investigate all the allegations. Is the Higher Education Authority the competent authority to investigate this matter independently, given that it has been involved in it from 2012 right up to the present? Second, if the Minister of State does not agree that the Higher Education Authority is the competent authority, will he or his senior Minister appoint an independent competent authority to review and investigate this matter and report to the Minister independently? There are issues pertaining to social welfare and to the Revenue Commissioners, for example, that must be investigated.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	595	While I have great respect for the Minister of State personally, I deplore the fact that the Minister is not present in the Chamber to answer personally on a matter that relates directly to her own constituency. In addition to the cases brought to the attention of Deputy Niall Collins, a number of different individuals have approached me and essentially have told me the same story, whereby people who raised their heads and raised issues about certain payments in particular were literally hounded out. This has happened in several cases that have been brought to my personal attention. It reflects a disturbing pattern of behaviour, and all the investigations that have taken place - that is, the internal university investigations into the circumstances surrounding the situation in which people ultimately were obliged to leave - show a distinct and patent lack of independence. While there are several matters about which I could talk today, one interesting aspect is that in both cases which are in the public domain at present, the university has made an offer to settle on the basis that the two people involved should resign from the university and collect two years' salary by way of payment. That payment of two years' salary involves taxpayers' money, but in both cases the university's so-called and allegedly independent investigator found that the two people had acted maliciously. Why would one pay two years' worth of taxpayers' money to somebody whom one's own investigator, who was meant to be independent, found to have acted maliciously? This matter must be investigated properly and the investigation must be both independent and perceived to be independent. I also ask the Minister of State what he thinks of the actions of the University of Limerick in resorting to the heavy machinery of the law by employing a high-profile firm of solicitors at what I am sure is great expense to the taxpayer to sue the Limerick Leader, which, like all provincial newspapers, is hardly awash with funds. This proposed High Court action will place a serious strain on an organisation which I am sure is already struggling. In addition, the university's intention to sue the editor personally looks like a deliberate attempt to gag discussion of the matter, put it underground and prevent any discussion in the public domain. The Minister for Education and Skills knows better than anyone else that the Limerick Leader is the main print medium for both the city and county of Limerick, which she and I represent, and has been so for more than a century. While I do not agree with everything the Limerick Leader or its editor says, the Minister of State will appreciate that a free press is essential in a properly functioning democracy. I ask the Minister of State to communicate immediately to the Minister for Education and Skills that Members expect her to contact the university and to ask it, as Minister, to call off these legal bloodhounds.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	596	I would like to thank the Deputies for raising this issue. It is certainly a matter of concern to my senior Minister, but she cannot be in two places at the same time so I am answering this matter on her behalf. In early 2012, a former employee of the University of Limerick informed a public representative, who in turn informed the Committee of Public Accounts, of alleged irregular practices in the finance department of the University, her attempts to rectify them and how she had been dealt with by the university. The issues were referred by the Committee of Public Accounts to the Secretary General of my Department and, at his request, the HEA sought the response of the university. The university informed the HEA that it was engaging with the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the issues and had provided all related correspondence to that office. The president of the university also wrote to the Committee of Public Accounts stating that the university was satisfied that it had dealt fully with the allegations made by its former employee as follows:The University refutes in the strongest possible terms these allegations. The University has at all times paid expenses in accordance with its Travel and Subsistence Policy and is satisfied that the controls in place ensure that payments are reimbursed in accordance with Policy.The letter goes on to say that the university was in correspondence with the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the matter, and continues: The University is subject to rigorous auditing on an on-going basis. This includes external audit, internal audit and oversight by the Governing Authority's Audit and Risk Management Committee. The area of expenses is generally reviewed annually as part of the annual audit. A recent report to the Governing Authority Audit and Risk Management Committee by the University's external auditors confirmed that there were no weaknesses identified in relation to the controls in place regarding expenses. In June this year, two employees of the university, who were employed in the finance department, requested of my Department to make a disclosure under the protected disclosures legislation. They were directed to the CEO of the Higher Education Authority, as that person is a prescribed recipient under the legislation. The CEO, Mr. Boland, met with the employees on 5 May 2015. An agreed minute of that meeting was provided to the president of the university for his observations. It is important to say that at the meeting no specific allegations were made of financial irregularities in the university. However, the employees outlined a series of events which they considered amounted to bullying and victimisation of them by management and colleagues in the university. They stated their view that this arose because of their questioning of what they saw as irregular practices in the finance department. The employees in question have not, to date, set out specific allegations, pleading a lack of confidence in the university to properly inquire into them. The university, in response to the HEA, refuted the claims made by its employees. It stated that the allegations of bullying and victimisation were not substantiated, and that the employees had refused to co-operate with various inquiries and had been found by one inquiry to have made malicious claims. Both employees are now subject to disciplinary proceedings. More recently, the former employee has contacted the HEA repeating her initial allegations. At her request, Mr. Boland met with her last evening. The Department has concerns on a number of levels. First, in the case of the employees and the former employee, they continue to feel victimised for having, as they see it, challenged irregular practices. Second, as the university is an important institution regionally and nationally and the current controversies are potentially damaging to its good reputation, as the Deputies have said, they need to be dealt with comprehensively and conclusively as soon as possible. Third, the demands of public accountability are such that the truth of any allegation of misconduct in a higher education institution needs to be established beyond reasonable doubt. Having regard to these considerations, the HEA, in consultation with my Department and the university, will now put in place a process of review. The precise terms of reference will be established within the next few days. However, I stress that the review will be independent of the university's processes and will cover how the initial inquiry into the allegations of irregular payments and the allegations of victimisation and bullying were dealt with by the university. A final report will be concluded by the end of November. If that is not possible, an interim report will be provided.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	597	I thank the Minister of State for his reply. It is fair to say that we are moving in the right direction concerning this matter, and I want to acknowledge that. The Minister of State has indicated that he intends to establish a review. It is important that, in the first instance, this review should not rule out any wider investigation if it concludes that such is required and merited. The imminent report, whether it is a full or interim one, should be referred to the Minister for Education and Skills, not to the Higher Education Authority or the Department. I await the terms of reference with interest, because they will have to be broad enough to include the whistleblowers to whom both Deputy O'Dea and I have spoken. Their allegations and stories are not in the public domain. They will also have to be afforded an opportunity to speak in confidence to the review panel. That is critical, because there are more people out there who are saying the same thing. They cannot all be wrong. The Minister did not address the request made by Deputy O'Dea and myself about the High Court proceedings against the Limerick Leader and against Mr. Alan English. That is a critical point, because taxpayers' money is being used to gag a provincial newspaper and a newspaper editor personally. Jobs could potentially be at stake. By the way, the University of Limerick has issued the proceedings. It is a corporate body, not an individual, acting against a newspaper. It is a big State-funded university against an organisation that is providing a lot of jobs, which is an important point. I ask the Minister of State and the senior Minister to call on the University of Limerick to withdraw its High Court proceedings.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	598	I thank the Minister of State for his reply. I want to get clarification on one point. He states that there will be a review of the circumstances surrounding this specific case. However, a number of other people have come to public representatives such as myself and Deputy Niall Collins making similar complaints. Will the investigation be able to take evidence from those people, in view of the fact that they have already been forced by the university to sign confidentiality clauses concerning settlements that were made at the time of termination of their employment? It is critical that their story should also be heard so that the total context will be available to the independent investigator. Second, will the Minister of State ask the Minister for Education and Skills to request, or tell, the University of Limerick to withdraw the legal proceedings against both the Limerick Leader and the editor, Mr. Alan English? The proceedings are both inappropriate and excessive.  Third, can the Minister of State give us an assurance that the employment of the two employees in question in this particular case, who are currently suspended, will not be terminated before the conclusion of these proceedings?
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	599	The full terms of reference will be available in the next couple of days. I can have them sent on to the Deputies. I presume the terms of reference will be wide in order to cover all this. The Department, the HEA and all involved are anxious that this be dealt with fully and conclusively. There is no point in having a review that does not cover all the concerns and alleged wrongdoings, so those will be dealt with as well. My understanding is that only one person signed a confidentiality clause and that person has come forward with more allegations, so I presume there will be space there to deal with them as well.

#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	601	I was only aware of one. The Deputy will appreciate that I do not have all the information on the full case. I can check for him, however, and will get that confirmed. The hope is that this review will deal with all this one way or the other. That is why it will be dealt with quite quickly. As regards the Deputy's concern that the review may prevent a further investigation, I do not think it will. Naturally, however, we cannot prejudge what it will come out with, but I presume the review will make recommendations. It is the right process to deal with the matter first of all.  As regards the Deputy's other question, under the protected disclosures legislation of 2014, the HEA is the right channel to go through, in conjunction with the Minister, the Department and the university. I will confirm that for the Deputy.  On the question of the High Court proceedings, it is my own view that it is always best to avoid these where at all possible, but it is not in my gift to lecture anybody on what they should or should not do. However, I will certainly raise the matter, and express the Deputies' views, with both the Minister and the Department.

#CiaraConway	unknown-#CiaraConway-party	unknown-#CiaraConway-dob	unknown-#CiaraConway-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	604	I want to highlight an issue that is putting undue strain on people who are already faced with stressful times, particularly where their health is concerned. Unfortunately, there is not a family or home in the country that has not been touched by cancer. A particular problem has come to my attention but, in order to be helpful, I also have a solution. I hope the simple answer to the difficulty that people are experiencing will be taken on board and, more importantly, will be implemented. The issue has to do with the turnaround concerning decisions on medical cards, as well as the pain and financial strain that have been caused by the delay involved.Over recent months I have had a number of very worried and sick people have come to my office in Dungarvan in County Waterford seeking help with their medical cards. Naturally, these people are extremely worried and stressed about their diagnosis and the treatment they are facing. I am sad to report that while they were focusing on getting treatment and trying to get better, our medical card system was adding to their stress. This is simply not good enough. I will illustrate the point by way of example. Recently, a lady came to me who had received a serious cancer diagnosis in June. Straight away she applied for her medical card. By the time she had contacted me it was September and there was no decision on her card. Only this morning I received from Kieran Healy, head of customer services at the HSE, a response to a parliamentary question on this issue. The reply clearly states that the application processing team works to a 15-day working day turnaround time for complete applications. That is clearly not the case. More upsetting, I spoke to the lady who had been waiting from June to September, by which time there was no decision on her medical card. In that time she had incurred bills of in excess of €500 in the pharmacy and was also facing a very expensive bill for four chemotherapy treatments. I know of another case where a sick man applied for a card in August and as of today, 7 October, it has not even been sent for initial assessment. That lapse is far more than 15 days. The response I received to a parliamentary question is simply not good enough. The applications for a medical card need to be screened initially for serious illnesses such as cancer. These applications should be taken from the pile and fast-tracked. There should be a quick initial scan of applications and the relevant applications should be prioritised for means. The HSE should ensure these are done within 15 days. It is as simple as that. I realise the Minister of State knows that people facing serious illnesses have enough to worry about. They should not have to worry about the cost of chemotherapy or drugs as well. They should be focusing on getting well and should not have to go to Deputies or ring helplines to get something to which they are entitled.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	605	A woman came into my clinic in Ballinasloe recently. She had been diagnosed with cancer. I sympathised with her not because she had been diagnosed with cancer or because herself and her family were going to have to go through that challenge over the coming months but because of the horrendous experience she is going to have to go through to be granted a medical card. I welcome the report by the Irish Cancer Society because it exposes two issues, the first of which is the failure to recognise properly the medical expenses in the assessment of medical card applications for illnesses such as cancer. It is not a means assessment; it is a mean assessment. The average spend per month for a cancer patient is €862 while the average income loss is €1,400. However, the allowances provided under the medical card system for health expenses, prescribed medicines and appliances and hospital charges come to the princely sum of €62.65 per week. This means the figure of €459.49 per week in costs and income lost, as identified by the Irish Cancer Society, is being ignored in the current medical card assessment. Regardless, even to get recognition from the medical card section for the €62.65 per week, patients on chemotherapy will literally have to sweat blood and tears. The majority of these cases will be granted a medical card at the end of the process, but that is months down the road. It seems that the main policy is to try to wear people down in order that they simply throw in the towel and do not pursue it to the bitter end. I welcome the report and I welcome that the Minister of State with responsibility for rural affairs is replying to the issue in the House today because the report exposes the active discrimination within the medical card section against people who are sick and residing in rural areas. The report highlights that the average cost for travel expenses per week is €66.23. This is not only for cancer but also relates to other medical conditions requiring frequent attendance at regional centres. The provision for transport under the medical card assessment comes under health expenses. I have seldom seen a case where an application gets anything more than €15, that is, one quarter of the real cost identified by the Irish Cancer Society. We have developed centres of excellence, particularly for cancer, and they are all welcome. For someone in my county who has to travel to Galway for a hospital appointment, the cost comes to €150. We do not have public transport to facilitate such people in getting to the appointment and back again on the same day. As a result, these people must pay for a taxi. The HSE will not assist with this cost and the Department of Social Protection will not assist in the matter either. These people have to fork out the money from their own pockets. If a person is unfortunate enough to come from Arigna, for example, it will cost him €200 to get to the hospital appointment in the first place. No recognition is being given to that fact by the medical card section.
#AnnPhelan	unknown-#AnnPhelan-party	unknown-#AnnPhelan-dob	unknown-#AnnPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	606	I thank the Deputies for raising these important matters. At the outset, I am keen to acknowledge the work and effort of health staff that has resulted in Ireland's cancer survival rate improving consistently in recent decades. I have no doubt the national cancer strategy steering group set up to advise on developing a new national cancer strategy for 2016 to 2025 will build on positive developments. We do not have a universal eligibility system for primary and community health services. I maintain the view that until we have universal health care and everyone is entitled to health care, we will always have anomalies and injustices. There will always be someone who is a little above the means threshold, who does not have the prescribed disease or whose condition is not sufficiently severe. As a result, these individuals will not meet the assessment criteria. The Deputies will be aware of the publication of the report of the expert panel on medical need for medical card eligibility and the medical card process review, known as the Keane report. One key recommendation was that a person's means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card. The panel concluded that it would not be feasible, desirable or ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order as a means of determining medical card eligibility. The findings of the expert panel raise questions for us as legislators about the approach of basing eligibility for health services on having a particular disease or special assessment arrangements for one disease or another. The HSE is ensuring a more integrated and sensitive processing of medical card applications. This involves greater exchange of information between the central assessment office and the local health offices on people's medical circumstances and needs. We can see the results of these improvements. The number of discretionary medical cards in circulation has increased by approximately 76%, from 52,000 in mid-2014 to almost 93,000 at the beginning of September this year. Under the General Medical Services scheme, eligibility is granted from the date a complete application has been assessed and a decision is made by the HSE in accordance with the legislation and the national assessment guidelines. The HSE makes every effort to make timely decisions. The HSE has a target to process 90% of properly completed claims within the 15-day period to which Deputy Conway referred. The current turnaround is over 98%. This ensures a short lead time between applications being submitted and a decision being made on the eligibility of the applicant. I imagine the Deputies will appreciate in light of the legislation that applications must be supported with a range of documentation, as outlined on the application forms. It has to be acknowledged that the processing time for incomplete applications is dependent on the furnishing of the required supporting documentation. Discretion continues to be an integral part of the medical card assessment process. If an applicant's means are above the financial thresholds, as set out in the national guidelines, the HSE routinely examines for indications of medical or social circumstances that might result in undue financial hardship in arranging medical card services and, exercising discretion, may grant eligibility for a medical card on this basis. I am aware the HSE routinely affords applicants the opportunity to furnish additional supporting information and documentation to take account fully of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses.
#CiaraConway	unknown-#CiaraConway-party	unknown-#CiaraConway-dob	unknown-#CiaraConway-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	607	I thank the Minister of State. Nobody is disputing that there are issues in terms of what we as legislators decide to do regarding changes to legislation on eligibility criteria other than means, but I referred to cancer patients who are entitled to medical cards because of their means and are still waiting in excess of the 15 day turnaround period. I received a response today from Mr. Kieran Healy, head of customer services in the HSE. It is not happening.  I was able to lift the telephone in my office in September and within two days a card was issued. The woman concerned had built up a large bill in her local pharmacy and had received a large bill from the treating hospital for her chemotherapy. Pharmacists are under the illusion that medical cards are backdated, but they are not. It is something we as a Government need to tackle. The date of the initial application for social welfare payments is the date from which the card is sanctioned. I am not referring to people who do not have an entitlement to a card, but rather those who are entitled to one.  In the two cases I outlined, in a response the HSE referred to 98% turnover and stated that 90% of people have their applications completed within 15 days. I must know of the two unluckiest people in Dungarvan, County Waterford. They are just two cases of the many I could highlight to the Minister of State. We need to consider backdating the initial application date of a medical card. People who are entitled to a card and who are trying to tackle, conquer and overcome cancer should not have their burden added to because of additional financial pressures resulting from bills from hospitals and local pharmacists.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	608	The problem with cancer patients and the 15 day loophole the HSE uses is that the medical card section in Finglas is involved in what is called a three card trick. Even though it has direct access to Revenue and social welfare and can get information at the touch of a button, it deliberately forces sick patients to go to local tax offices to get printouts of their last tax liabilities and to go into social welfare offices to get printouts of their social welfare payments. Such a policy delays processing applications and saves the medical card section money. The report of the medical card eligibility group recommended that we should not base medical cards on particular medical conditions. However, the subsequent Minister announced that every child in the country diagnosed with cancer would get a medical card. I ask the Minister of State to lift that age barrier. Regardless of age, if someone is diagnosed with cancer they should get a medical card. I refer to the rural discrimination that is taking place across the board regarding medical cards, and not just for cancer patients and the chronically ill. I want the Minister of State to address this issue. A patient in Galway city is receiving treatment in Dublin and was given medical expenses of €14.45 a week less than a patient living beside him in Galway city who receives treatment in University Hospital Galway. The reality is that even though there is a lack of public transport in rural Ireland, the HSE is deliberately ignoring transport costs when making medical assessments. This practice is taking place across the county and the reality is that the HSE is actively discriminating against those living in rural Ireland who are sick and cannot travel from provincial towns to regional centres.
#AnnPhelan	unknown-#AnnPhelan-party	unknown-#AnnPhelan-dob	unknown-#AnnPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	609	I assure the Deputy that we have already taken the initiative on rural transport and are working with the HSE and the NTA on the parts of rural Ireland where people experience difficulties in trying to travel to hospital appointments. We will be able to develop cost savings through such an initiative.  On foot of the Keane report, the HSE established a clinical advisory group to develop clinical oversight and guidance for the operation of a more compassionate and trusted medical card system. The group includes patients' representatives and is continuing its work on the development of guidance on assessing medical card applications involving significant medical conditions. In the context of that work, the group made an interim recommendation, as Deputy Naughten stated, to award medical cards to all children under the age of 18 years with a diagnosis of cancer for a period of five years. This decision was accepted by the HSE director general.  The existing assessment system is complex because it tries to ensure that a wide range of personal circumstances can be taken into account. We are still committed to further improving the existing system and the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General will be central to this in the immediate future. In the medium term, I believe that we should focus on the strategic goal of universal health care, which will benefit everybody.

I am not sure if the Minister, Deputy Reilly, is familiar with the site. It is ideally located beside the hospital and Garda station. It is anonymous and is surrounded by a supportive community. The difficulty is that Respond!, which is a voluntary agency, has said it cannot afford to fund the refuge for women and children fleeing domestic violence. Respond! has bankrolled the refuge for the past three and a half years without any financial support from the State. The refuge caters for nine families and has housed 71 women and 96 children, at a cost of €350,000 per annum. Respond! undertook responsibility for it for three years. Without the service women and children may have to return to potentially dangerous environments. I have heard that agencies, including Tusla, accept that Respond! has identified a definite need to care for women and children in such circumstances.  We know that there is a need for these types of refuges. If it closes, where do the women go? We know that if, for instance, they go to the sexual assault unit in the local hospital the Garda usually refer them to the refuge. It has a large catchment area, but it is not just women from Tallaght or the wider area who use the service. Women from different counties may use it, depending on their safety. Clients may move from different refuges.  It is doing its job and working well. If it closes, it means we are moving backwards. What will replace it if it closes? We need to open more refuges rather than close them. It is a question of money. I raised this issue during the debate on homelessness because it is part of that chain. People leave the family home because of domestic violence or sexual assault. We know what eventually forces women to leave the family home - it is usually the women who have to leave and the abusive partner stays behind. There is a safety aspect. What can the Minister do about this matter?It is not a huge amount of money. The Minister's colleague, the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, has said the homelessness issue is not a matter of resources and I am glad to hear it. This is part of that chain because when they leave the home they become homeless. The added difficulty is if the gardaí have somebody in the local hospital who has been attacked or abused they normally look for somewhere for the family to go. We know in Dublin that hostel accommodation is full at night time and there is the same difficulty with hotels, so where do they go? Usually the gardaí put them in the station, which is okay for an hour or two or, at a push, overnight. Where do the families go? If we take this huge important piece of infrastructure out of the system what will replace it? I eagerly look forward to the Minister's reply.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	615	I thank Deputy Crowe for raising this issue and I welcome the opportunity to clarify the position on the funding of domestic violence services by Tusla, the Child and Family Agency. I am aware of this issue as Deputy Pat Rabbitte has raised it with me on a number of occasions. It is my understanding that the Cuan Álainn centre was established independently of the State and opened in 2012. It is funded by Respond! Housing Association. Tusla, the Child and Family Agency allocates available funding for domestic violence to emergency refuge accommodation services and community-based domestic violence supports. It does not fund Cuan Álainn. I understand that the Cuan Álainn centre provides second stage accommodation for women and children who have experienced domestic violence and who may already have been in emergency accommodation. The facility does not operate as a front-line emergency domestic violence service, rather it provides step down or transitional accommodation to support transition into a permanent settled home. This can include survivors of domestic violence who are transitioning from emergency services to a new, permanent home. Departmental officials and Tusla recently met Respond!, at the housing association's request, to discuss the current situation in Cuan Álainn. Respond! advised that it was not in a position to continue funding for the centre. The Department sought additional information from Respond!, including information on the housing association's overall financial situation. The most recent information provided indicated that Respond!, which is made up of two companies, was in good overall financial health. I hope the matter can be satisfactorily resolved, by allowing sufficient time for all avenues to be explored by the relevant parties. This will need to include discussion with other parties, including the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government as it would appear that these families have pressing housing needs. In this regard, I hope that a meeting with Respond! can be arranged shortly. Tusla will continue to work closely with service providers to ensure that women and children fleeing domestic abuse receive all necessary emergency support. The position in respect of the Cuan Álainn service is being kept under review.

I would argue, and anyone with half a brain would agree, that it certainly is. It is proposed to close the service on 18 December. As the Minister knows, 25 December is Christmas, and the statistics over the years show this is a time of huge pressure on families when a lot of domestic violence breaks out. The Minister stated he hopes it can be satisfactorily resolved by allowing sufficient time for all avenues to be explored by the relevant parties. This is grand, but it is kicking the can down the road. I was hoping to hear from the Minister today that some mechanism or avenue of funding would keep this vital service open. I began by saying it is in an ideal location and fits the criteria. Whether it is secondary to emergency housing, it is part of the chain and the next step is housing. It is a vital part of what we need to do as a society and if it is not being done by the State it should be. We should not rely on voluntary housing organisations or religious organisations for these vital services but unfortunately we do, whether in education, special needs or other areas. We push the problem onto someone else. I do not know whether the Minister can say anything positive to the staff working in the centre or, more importantly, to those who use the centre. The big question is where to put these families and where they go next. There is also the next tranche of families and children who are trying to get into the system. Where will they go if we do not have this vital piece of infrastructure?
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	617	I thank the Deputy. Obviously our concern is for the families who reside there and need the service. Clearly, there is a need for the State to provide services of this nature and to do so in a planned and organised fashion. It is very welcome that Respond! as a housing agency does this independently without regard to the State, and it is also very commendable that it has funded it, but we need to have a proper organised handover if it is going to cease to fund it. It is not as if the organisation is bereft of funds, that it is overdrawn in the bank or that its capital is expended and it is extended. This is not the case. Its board is quite entitled to make the decision that, having established and funded this, it feels it is not core to its work and that it would like to cease funding it, but there is an onus on it to sit down and speak to us about how it can be handed over in an orderly fashion to allow the Department and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to determine how best to continue funding to support women and families who have been the subject of domestic violence and abuse and how to transition from the emergency situation, as Respond! has done by providing the service, into a more permanent solution and permanent home, which clearly involves the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government also. It is not my intention that the service should fall between two stools, and I look forward to meeting Respond! to determine putting in place an orderly transition for the funding of this organisation. It is not fair to the families concerned to have them looking at 18 December, the week before Christmas, with the threat of having the roof over their heads removed.

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	629	As we finished yesterday, I commended the Minister of State on commending the local community in the docklands area. I brought to his attention the demise of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, DDDA, and I commented on how the Minister of State had given a very benign account of why all of that happened. It happened nonetheless and we are where we are now. It is extremely important that we get this legislation right. When we commend the community and talk about building and developing a vibrant community, we should mean it and our words should amount to more than rhetoric, so that the communities in question benefit. I am conscious that there are essentially two strands in the docklands communities: those who would be considered to be there for generations and people who have moved to the area to raise families, live and make their lives. The Minister of State noted the anticipated swelling of numbers in the area and it is very important that we get that integration right. The communities and families for whom the docklands have always been home should still feel at home in a place that has changed very radically over the past number of years, and which will undoubtedly change again. The objective, in other words, must be to achieve positive change all around. I am very disappointed there is no statutory basis for social gain. The experience set out in the Minister of State's initial statement, although I do not deny the positive aspects, is a little misty-eyed and not exactly a full telling of what happened in the docklands area. It is important, while recognising what has happened, that we should not have an inflated sense of the social dividend for those communities and families. For example, we can consider social housing. As the Minister of State knows, I represent the north side of the docklands area. I can tell him that we have lists the length of his and my two arms and beyond for local families seeking to be accommodated. The phenomenon of overcrowding is huge in these communities and some of the accommodation is of poor quality. The local authority, despite a Dublin docklands area plan, has not been in a position to provide even basic maintenance in many cases. The Minister of State cited the Docklands Housing Trust and I acknowledge that initiative. Nevertheless, trying to pretend that it or the totality of the social and affordable units afforded in the docklands over the years is anything close to what was required or that which would represent a real social dividend is to live in cloud cuckoo land. That simply did not happen. In regard to the educational dividend, the Minister of State was quite right to point out bursaries, scholarships and opportunities, many of which were pursued through the National College of Ireland. I acknowledge them here today. It is also important to record that a new primary school was promised to St. Laurence O'Toole school on Sheriff Street but that never materialised. That was a cause of considerable local anger and although various plans were put forward, the long and short of it is that it did not happen. Other primary school facilities in the docklands area and up to East Wall have gained in some small measure from the largesse, generosity and creativity of the DDDA but it is nothing like what could be possible. We need to be ambitious when we speak about social dividend, and it must amount to more than just flouncing or initiatives to take the bad look from what might seem to be very aggressive commercial development; in essence, giving the crumbs from the table to the local communities. We need a far more integrated sense and approach than that, which is why the social dividend and gain must have a basis in law. It should be written in the legislation, and I have no doubt we will return to this on Committee Stage. The Minister of State instanced the issue of employment and - not unfairly - pointed to the potential that will unquestionably arise for new jobs that would be well paid, good quality, high tech and high spec. That is what we want to see. The Minister of State indicated that local people will have an advantage in respect of employment opportunities and that must become the reality. He referenced specifically local employment clauses and I am glad he did so but they were in place, as the Minister of State is probably aware, in the last dispensation. If the Minister of State went to the docklands to ask people what they made of that element of the plan and what it delivered for the community, they would say they are hard-pressed to find somebody who accessed employment regardless of a local employment clause. They would probably go on to say that where employment was secured, it was only in very specific types of functions. All work is noble, dignified and good but if we are to speak about a meaningful local employment clause, it must mean that local kids, students, women and men have a real opportunity to get diverse opportunities for good quality work. The bottom line is that the local employment clause should be based in law. Both the Minister of State and I are aware of the legal issues with respect to domestic and European law in how that clause is couched; that is to keep ourselves on the right side, legally speaking. However, it can be done. If the Government is serious about local employment opportunities and a local employment clause, it will appear in the legislation. If that does not happen, many people will view any commitment to local employment in a very jaundiced way, and I could not blame them for doing so. The consultative forum to be established is detailed in the legislation. It is envisaged very much in an advisory capacity but it could and should be more than that. Of course, consultation with local stakeholders, whether they are from business and the local community or residents, is always a good and healthy exercise. We can consider the scale of development envisaged, which the Minister of State described as profound and transformational. That is the right kind of language to use in this respect. In these circumstances, however, and given that there is a fast-tracked planning application under the strategic development zone, the consultative committee must be in a position to give more than advice. It must be in a place where it can take decisions that can be delivered. Although it would be fair to say that many of the experiences for docklanders in participating in DDDA forums was positive and pleasant at times, there has been an ongoing and residual criticism that much of that process was tokenistic and at times bore the hallmarks of a talking shop. That is not good enough. For the consultative forum to have teeth, mean something and make a difference, it must be more than advisory in nature.This is something we will return to and which I hope the Government will remedy in the legislation. On the issue of planning, the 22 hectares subject to the strategic development zone and the involvement of NAMA in that has been set out. Provision is made, for instance, for section 25 certificates to allow completion of developments that are substantially commenced but not completed. That is a sensible thing to do. It is possibly in the area of planning that the biggest hole exists in this legislation. I will set it out for the Minister of State as clearly as I can. Longboat Quay is not unique in respect of the fire hazards the residents face. Full culpability for that rests with the developer in question. I acknowledge that there are questions to be asked of the other agencies in terms of oversight and certification, but in the final analysis, the developer in question is the person with whom responsibility lies. Longboat Quay is not unique. The Taoiseach acknowledged that in the House this morning. It is not unique in the context of the docklands area either. There are many other developments which were thrown up, which remain shoddy and where residents face considerable difficulties in terms of their quality of living. Some of those hazards relate to fire safety while others do not, but all are a consequence of shoddy workmanship, greed, haste and indifference. I have cited Bernard McNamara several times. As the Minister of State is probably aware, I am looking to speak to him and if the Minister of State has any influence there, he might help me. It should also be said that McNamara is not the only developer who has left residents in the lurch. There are others and many of them went through the NAMA process. In many cases their businesses have been dissolved and they are no longer trading. We might see those same individuals back in business and we may very well - I believe we will - see them making applications to build again in the docklands area. They will have the facility of the fast-track planning process and so on. We cannot countenance a situation in which any developer who has short-changed residents, people who bought homes in good faith, would simply be allowed to apply for planning permission, secure permission and go right ahead and build all over again without making good the shoddy work they carried out previously. The issue of compliance has to be at the heart of this. The question is how we sort that out legislatively. That is as much a question for the Minister of State as an observation. I cannot imagine how the State or this legislation could allow Bernard McNamara or anybody else to go back into the docklands in a new guise and build again. I accept that developers have to build and things have to be built. That is not my issue. It is unacceptable that they would be allowed to motor on and that the State would not demand that they would make good the shoddy work they left behind them. That is a matter of basic common sense. If we could achieve that within this legislation, that would be a very good day's work. If we do not, we are at least partially responsible for letting these developers off the hook. That would not be good enough. We have bailed out the banks and had to suffer the phenomenon of NAMA. These developers have been bailed out not once but twice. They are not going to be bailed out a third time for not bothering to comply with building regulations with which they were fully conversant and the standards of which they were fully aware. In their haste and under the nose of the previous authority, they disregarded all of the above and now residents or taxpayers may face the prospect of paying that bill. That, to my way of thinking, is not going to happen. I ask-----

Thank you. I have made my point on that and I look forward to an exchange on that issue on Committee Stage. I was very taken with the last piece of the Minister of State's speech last night:The regeneration of the area will lead to a more appealing cityscape, a more pleasant living space and increased prosperity for all. Within the context of the Dublin city development plan, it will play a pivotal role in the improving economic position for the capital and the country as a whole.That is a very ambitious set of objectives. I share those and support the Minister of State in pursuing them. However, if he is serious about them, he will not just listen to but take on board the points I have raised and he will revisit this legislation and work with us on these benches to ensure the legislation is fit for purpose and fit to deliver those worthy ambitions.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	634	Tá an Bille seo teicniúil. Cuireann sé deireadh leis an Dublin Docklands Development Authority agus aistríonn sé gach rud go Comhairle Cathrach Bhaile Átha Cliath. I welcome the opportunity to discuss this Bill on Second Stage and will take this opportunity to raise a number of issues with the Minister of State. This Bill proposes the dissolution of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, DDDA, and the transfer of rights and functions to Dublin City Council. Section 7 deals with the transfer of functions from the authority to Dublin City Council. Has the Minister of State considered the legal implications in moving all functions from the DDDA to the council, specifically in respect of the current desperate situation in Longboat Quay? Tonight, more than 600 residents in just short of 298 apartments face evacuation from their homes if they cannot collectively find the €4 million required to resolve fire safety defects. Each resident is currently facing a personal cost of €18,000 to conduct the necessary work to ensure the safety of their home. The work needed includes the installation of "an adequate smoke ventilation system" for the lobbies and communal stairs, fire separation between apartments, upgrading of fire doors and the installation of fire-stopping materials in utility services. The developer, Bernard McNamara, built the complex in 2006 at the peak of the Celtic tiger. His company, Gendsong, went into receivership not long after that. As a result, the properties remain with the DDDA, which also owns a number of apartments in the complex. To date, the DDDA has invested €1 million in contracting fire wardens and upgrading the fire alarms system. In its supposed attempt to address this situation, the DDDA offered to put €2.75 million towards the necessary works, which the residents rightly refused. Why should they have to foot a single penny of this colossal bill? Today, Dublin City Council's chief executive said the council has nowhere to put residents as the homeless crisis deepens. Does this honestly come as a surprise to the Government when there are 130,000 applications on the housing list and almost 180 people sleeping on the streets every night in addition to 1,500 children in hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation? The situation facing the docklands residents is further proof, as if any were needed, that the homeless crisis has gained unprecedented momentum due to failures of this Government and is now worsening by the day.Direct and decisive action is needed in addressing this issue before more citizens find themselves in the same situation as many thousands have done, with little light at the end of the tunnel. It is clear from the experience of Priory Hall in 2011 that poor building regulations and little oversight resulted in developers, insurance companies and builders doing their utmost to shirk all responsibility and accountability. No consideration was given to residents who bought or rent these properties and all this is evidence of the worst kind of capitalism. To date, Priory Hall has cost the city council €27 million. Will the Minister of State confirm or give a commitment that the Department or the local authority which has assumed new responsibilities will absorb the cost of these necessary works at Longboat Quay? The nightmare situation facing the docklands residents threatens to replicate itself throughout the country as I have no doubt news of other substandard properties will emerge in the near future. While the Minister of State has acknowledged the likelihood of more affected properties, such as a development in County Kildare, or Prospect Hill in Finglas, which we are hearing about, he has attempted to dodge the core issue of regulation by blaming the policy of previous Governments for current deficiencies in building standards. Such deflections are becoming all too habitual as the Minister of State continues to pass blame for the housing emergency while ignoring the devastating realities of the homelessness crisis. This week a Minister claimed the Government had introduced legislation demanding better building regulation. Not surprisingly, this claim was directly countered by the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland, which warned that the regulations do not provide adequate oversight of development and will not ensure this does not happen in the future. It seems I have to make the point that the Government must hold developers to account because the Government is operating in a permanent blind spot when it comes to holding the appropriate persons to account. We call for the implementation of regulations as per the recommendations of the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland in conjunction with introduction of legislation to ensure developers are held responsible for any failing on their part to correspond to standards and regulations set out by the authorities. Local community groups, residents' associations and businesses play a vital role in shaping the places in which they live and work. Part 5 provides for the establishment of a consultative forum on a statutory basis to allow for the input of relevant parties into any future planning by the local authority in the docklands. I welcome this and reiterate the importance of community participation in the planning process as it is essential to the establishment of a suitable and harmonious residential environment. It is essential, therefore, that the structures that comprised the consultative form previously be maintained. We welcome the deepening of the consultation process between the city council and the aforementioned community stakeholders. Will the Minister of State outline whether employees of the DDDA have received any guarantees about redundancies, whether compulsory or voluntary? Will employees be transferred to Dublin City Council and, if so, on what terms? Will pensions be honoured? Are there any outstanding debts that the taxpayer and the city council will have to take up? Will the Minister of State confirm that the Castleforbes apartments, which have been left lying idle for six or seven years and do not comply with building standard regulations, were bought by Dublin City Council from the DDDA for a very large sum? The docklands is a modern residential, office and business hub and area that has been transformed into one of the most vibrant parts of the city. It is an example of what can be done to what was once a run-down area. Will the Minister of State confirm whether there is a cost to this transfer and, if so, what is it? I believe that future regeneration plans for the area are probably being transferred into the best hands, and where they should be, with Dublin City Council, but it is important that we all keep an eye on this and that Dublin City Council is held to account in the future as well.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	635	I wish to share time with Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan. Even though we are talking specifically about the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, the responsibility for which is moving back to the city council, this Bill is about development, which includes housing, and there are probably more plans to put more of the high-end business element in the area than housing. It is interesting that NAMA is going to get involved in the area. Normally, it bundles the assets together and sells them to foreign funds at a cheap price, but now it is going to start investing in developments. It seems to be driven towards partnerships with the private sector to provide office space for some of these large American companies that are moving in of late to the residential and office markets in particular. There is no doubt housing is a serious problem. Obviously, no one is separating this from what has happened in Longboat Quay. We have been here before with Priory Hall and other developments and I reckon we will be here again. It is not going to go away all of a sudden. A lot of stuff was put together over a number of years that left a lot to be desired. There are a few main problems with housing at present and I have been disappointed that some serious problems have not been addressed in the housing area. Deputy McDonald referred to the fact a builder could build badly and seem to have no problem in getting planning permission to do the same again, and that is something that is worth looking at. The builder in question has obviously gone bankrupt, he has come out of the system and he is a new individual now. I understand how bankruptcy works and I understand that it is not possible for the Taoiseach to ring Bernard McNamara because Mr. McNamara is not the entity he was before he got bankruptcy and the system allowed him back into the fold with a clean slate. However, the Government needs to look at the idea that if a builder does not carry out his work in a manner that meets the building regulations and the planning rules, there has to be a mechanism - legislation needs to be brought in - to stop that from happening again. If a builder or developer fails to fulfil his or her obligations in this area, while I am not saying one should lock him or her up and throw away the key, he or she should never get a project of that nature and size again. That is a flaw in the system. Right now, there is no obligation on a developer to retain competent design professionals to design a building or a competent contractor to build it. This is something that could be looked at as well. Having a system so loose is not a good idea and it should be tightened up. There should be an onus on a developer to retain persons of a certain proven professional standard who have not blotted their copybook. One of our biggest problems, to which I heard the Taoiseach refer a couple of times in the past fortnight, is the idea that developments should have been inspected.Sadly, the Government has refrained from reintroducing proper inspection. We all know that if we want everybody to do good work, we need to inspect it, and we need independent inspection, not self-certification. In the past, this was performed by the clerk of works, who insisted on inspecting work at all levels. The clerk of works was on site, was deemed competent enough to inspect the work and could monitor everything that was done. The system was worth its weight in gold. While it was a cost to the State, it was very valuable and worth the money. If the State argues that it does not have the money to do it, the money for the clerk of works should be incorporated into the levy. The clerk of works should be on site from the start of the job to the finish and should reach a certain level of competence. This could all be done. If it must be done, the Government should implement the levy in order to cover the cost. It is not rocket science. The new regulations the Government has implemented place all the responsibility on the architect. It does not make sense on a building site. I have made the point several times that the architect cannot possibly be there all the time and will not be paid to have somebody there all the time on his or her behalf. An architect does not know everything about building and is not trained to. There are many different aspects to it. The clerk of works had a good general background in different aspects of construction. Independent, local authority inspection is a must if the Government wants good building work to be done. I disagree with the idea of relying on the architect and his or her insurance to cover everything. It makes no sense. The engineer designs the structure of pillars, beams and columns that holds the building together. The architect makes decisions about space, environmental impact, image and the final look while the engineer ensures the building keeps together. The engineer takes the architect's drawings, determines how to make the building stand up and stay up and ensures it does not cause problems. One cannot expect the architect to know everything about engineering, no more than one could expect an engineer to know everything about architecture. It is unfair. Subcontractors come in. Many of the buildings built during the past 20 years have a structural steel frame, and how it is put together is vital. The person who puts it there must sign off and certify that he or she has done it properly and must have the insurance to cover the work in case anything goes wrong. If he or she does not have the insurance before starting, he or she should not get the job. He or she must be able to stand over the work and have the insurance to pay for problems in case the work is not right. This applies to other areas. If I go to a site and put a roof on a building, I should have to sign a certificate to state I have done it right and in accordance with regulation, I have not broken any rules and my workmanship is up to standard. I must also have insurance. If I were to go bankrupt or out of business the following week, my insurance must remain in place for approximately ten years after I leave the site and get the completion notice. If this means a bond process, I should have to pay for a bond before putting the roof on. If a roof leaks because I did not do it right, it causes major problems throughout the building for other subcontractors involved. If there is no insurance or bond to ensure the roofer pays for his or her responsibility for not doing the work properly, where is the logic? It does not make sense. The architect does not know whether a roof was put on properly. The architect has a roof in the drawings and can examine it at the end to ensure it is the roof he or she designed. While the architect can certify that it is the roof he or she designed, there are other questions. Was it done right? Will it keep the water out? Could the wind lift it? Is it held down properly? Wind is a major factor; roofs have blown off. The roofer must have insurance in place to cover any possible problems. There is a major debate over Longboat Quay and who should pay for remediation of the problems there. Had the local authority done its job properly, it would have found out that things were not done right. In defence of the local authority, it is not getting paid and does not have the personnel or capability to inspect everything. The local authority admits it inspects approximately 15% of built work. However, all built work should be inspected. The new regulation has improved the manner in which drawings and designs are inspected in the early stages and at the start, and this is good. However, it ignores the built work to a great degree, and the Government should address this. It is a major problem and it is possible to address it. It is not rocket science. The Government must listen to the people in the industry. While all the problems are soluble, we have been ignoring them for too long because certain people have had vested interests in neglecting to address them. I am not saying the Government had a vested interest in not addressing them. I am not sure where the advice on the new building regulations came from. However, they are not good and they must be revisited. We are talking about housing quality. I will move on to the lack of housing and the difficulty so many people on low incomes have accessing housing. They are not disconnected. Until some Government allows the local authorities to start building State housing again, the problems will prevail. We allowed much of our social housing to be sold to the occupants. After living in them for a certain time, many of these people sold the houses to private bodies which rented them out to people who could not afford a house but received rent supplement. We have paid €15 billion in rent supplement over ten or 15 years. It is a frightening figure. It does not make sense. The lack of social housing is driving up the demand for other houses and in the past, the fact that we built social housing helped in this area. We must build social housing again, and in far greater numbers than the Government is planning. The Government's plans are too reliant on the private sector. While not everybody likes the idea of returning to building State housing, it is a must. We will continue to have a housing crisis until we change our attitude towards it. We have to do it; it is imperative.We have an added problem now with people who do not own their houses and cannot get on the property ladder. I am not saying everyone should be able to get on the property ladder, as I do not believe they should. I think it is just too expensive for some people. It is a stone around their necks. It is too burdensome. Rent is now becoming a serious problem because we have seen so much rental property moving into investment funds. NAMA and the banks have sold huge tracts of apartments, houses and development lands to US investment funds that are actually forming a cartel in the rental market. I know rents. I have spoken about this issue a couple of times now. Rent keeps going up. I know apartments that were getting €900 a month. I built the apartments in question, which are in Dominick Street. The foreign investment funds that own them are now looking for €1,500 a month. I believe they will get such rents because there is such a scarcity of rental property. It is a massive problem. A small group of players now have significant control of the rental market. There is an idea that the problems in the rental market and the need to provide homes to people can be dealt with through the rent supplement system, but that is not really workable because it is too expensive for the State in the absence of regulations to deal with rent. I have not seen much of an appetite in the Government for rent control. I am a bit puzzled by its failure to look at the European models. It keeps getting worse and it will be difficult to backtrack on it. There is an absolute need for some control or regulation to be brought into this whole area. Some people say that landlords will leave the business if rent controls are introduced. That did not happen in Europe, however. When rent control settles down, it actually leads to certainty for the landlord as well. Landlords are entitled to rights. We should probably look at cases in which landlords are not being fairly treated by troublesome tenants. Landlords have to be given reasonable powers to deal with such cases. I am not anti-landlord. I have been a landlord. There is a serious lack of regulation in this whole area. The Minister of State does not need me to tell him that a lack of regulation has been problematic in many areas. The current housing crisis is strongly linked to the lack of regulation in many areas. The whole construction industry is highly problematic. I do not see those problems being addressed. The Government needs to sit down with stakeholders and the different people who work in this problematic industry, which has substantial problems. Those problems will continue until they are addressed. They need to be addressed in here by means of legislation. They are capable of being addressed. It is bordering on a kind of free-for-all. We had arguments about land banking when we discussed a previous Bill. The legislation that has been introduced has not really dealt with land banking, which is absolutely at the root of all of this. The legislation in question is not going to deal with land banking. Who has bought up the big tracts of land that went into NAMA after the banks went into receivership? Most of them have been bought by big US investment funds. These guys are going to control most of what is built in this town over the next couple of years. If one looks at the applications that are being made for planning permission, and who is making those applications, one will learn that most of the entities that are applying are vulture funds. These guys are interested in rent in Dublin because it is so lucrative that it is hard to beat. It is amazing that a two-bedroom apartment could cost between €1,200 and €1,500 a month. I have made the point in this House previously that a two-bedroom apartment in Turin makes between €300 and €400 a month. There is not much point in the vulture funds going there. They will come here because we are unregulated and it is a free-for-all.

He suggested that since the inception in 1997 of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, DDDA, "what was once a derelict part of the city has been transformed into a vibrant neighbourhood and progressive economic area, housing some of the most prestigious international and domestic companies". The use of the word "prestigious" is rather ironic, given that on Private Members' business last night and tonight we are debating the aggressive tax planning and profit-shifting of multinationals, some of which may be the prestigious companies mentioned by the Minister of State last night. Regardless of the accuracy of the reference to prestigious international companies, I take issue with the suggestion that until 1997 the docklands were a derelict part of the city. I was born in a docklands community and I continue to live in such a community. Many members of my family were born in the docklands and continue to live in a neighbouring docklands community. Those communities - I refer to the north side of the docklands - were always vibrant. It is certainly not true that they were not vibrant until the DDDA came into existence. As some of the new communities that have been created on foot of the DDDA housing developments are gated communities, it is very difficult for them to engage with the local communities on issues. I accept that the docks themselves were derelict. The Minister of State recognised last night that it was once an active working port. However, containerisation had a devastating effect, with the loss of many jobs, including jobs in the allied industries. Successive Governments made little or no attempt to provide alternative employment. That dereliction and destruction was allowed to continue year after year. I recently had a look back at the aspect of the 1982 Tony Gregory deal that related to the port and the docks. It was very far-sighted and innovative. I know it seems strange to be talking about acres, but the plan suggested that six acres be provided for office accommodation, ten acres for local authority housing, eight acres for industrial development and three acres for leisure and recreational purposes, although that did not happen. If only they had got it right then, we might have been spared so many of the difficulties that arose afterwards. It is another one of those cases of "if only". When the DDDA was established in 1997, housing and leisure and recreation were certainly not priorities. That is another point that was acknowledged by the Minister of State last night. However, he suggested that "substantial community gain" was associated with the redevelopment of the docklands. While there was some community gain, I am doubtful about his use of the word "substantial". It certainly was not substantial when it came to housing the long-established communities in the local area. There is absolutely no doubt that the DDDA was tainted. Tony Gregory was aware of this. He was well ahead of others in spotting the crucial conflicts of interest in the membership of the board of the DDDA. Some of the board members were associated with Anglo Irish Bank, which was funding the largest development in all of the north docklands. The members of the board granted planning permission for this development in the first place. How could local community interests be protected in such an environment? The reality was that the developers had absolutely no regard for the communities. In the cases of some small communities, all the developers thought they had to do was come along with some kind of sweetener or brown envelope to entice the people of those communities to ride off into the sunset. The issues with the developers that the communities had to deal with at the time of the DDDA included shadowing due to the height of developments and the blocking out of natural light. Areas that were once quiet enclaves for families were subjected to endless and excessive noise and dust and over-the-top working hours which breached the rules on working hours. Those involved worked through the night at times. Work took place at 6 o'clock on Sunday mornings. There was subsidence of houses and cracks appeared on gable walls. Communities had to engage in constant battles as they tried to deal with endless building sites. The cherry on the cake was the derelict monstrosity that was supposed to become the headquarters of Anglo Irish Bank. While the redevelopment of the docklands was successful in certain respects, such as with regard to business and finance, we can see that there are major issues today. Social and economic regeneration did not apply to everyone. Communities have felt excluded and isolated in the face of the towering grey and glass structures that surround them. When one walks down through the docklands today, one can see a 20 ft. fence separating the development at Custom House Quay from Mariners Port in North Wall. That is just one small example.I acknowledge that there have been physical improvements to the quays as well as to the cultural, recreational and educational life of the area through the Convention Centre, the Jeanie Johnston, the Famine Memorial, the restaurants, the National College of Ireland and so forth. I also want to acknowledge the work of Dublin Port Authority and the way in which it supports and engages with the docklands communities. It is very proactive in opening up the port to water-based activities and community groups. I have a number of questions for the Minister of State. There are DDDA legacy issues relating to planning. Community gain lost out in the current structures and there was a loss of land in the form of plot 8. This has weakened the community aspect of the plan. What will happen to the section 25 planning certificates, two of which have been activated in the last month? Are there others outstanding and what is their life span? I also have a question about the common areas and green spaces in apartment dwellings. These will come under the control of Dublin City Council but does the council have adequate funding to look after them? We have three planning systems operating in the docklands - Dublin City Council, strategic development zone or SDZ, and section 25 planning certificates. That makes it very difficult for people to engage. It is not just a dual planning system but one with a third string. How are communities' rights protected when two of the systems have no appeals mechanism while the third system has? There have been benefits but what communities really want to see is a real and meaningful engagement with the new body in charge, Dublin City Council. I believe that it probably will be better for local communities and I hope I am not proven wrong on that. I have two items on my wish list. The first relates to boats. I would like to see easier access for boats that travel along the two canals, the Royal and the Grand, to the basin. Something must be done with the Scherzer bridge. Why is it so difficult to get it open? My second wish list item relates to the very dynamic and vibrant Dublin Dockers group that has come together in recent years and gathered artefacts, memorabilia and photographs of the life of the docker. That group needs a space and I know that negotiations are going on with regard to developing a docklands museum. There is great potential there to develop a model similar to the Arigna Mining Experience under which former dockers can give guided tours.  Money was collected per square meter for cultural projects. Has all of that money been spent and is it accounted for? What is the social capital benefit for local communities as the huge capital programmes are planned? Local communities were let down when it came to employment by the DDDA. The Grangegorman Development Agency is much more proactive in this regard. At meetings that I attend, that agency presents the local employment figures from each of the companies working in Grangegorman. We talked about corporate tax last night and will discuss it again tonight. In that context, how much of the 12.5% tax that the businesses in the docklands are paying will go to the local communities? That said, I acknowledge the involvement of some of those businesses with local schools and youth clubs in the area. The Government says that Dublin City Council is best placed to take on the project. I, along with my colleagues, have been to meetings with Dublin City Council about the plans and there are a lot of positives there. However, I am a little dubious when I read phrases like "fast-track planning procedures", especially in the context of the three applications that are in for consideration at the moment. Local communities can only make submissions, for which they have to pay, and they cannot make objections. That is an issue of concern for communities. I hope that Dublin City Council has more of a social conscience than the DDDA and that when it comes to housing, it will keep families in mind and not just the type of apartments that suit those working in the business and financial services sector in the area. In the past, under the DDDA, it was the developers, businesses and property owners who benefitted from the planning schemes and the tax schemes. We must be assured that it will be the communities who will benefit most going forward. Prevention of opportunities for recidivism takes the incentives away from the speculators and the developers. The centenary of the 1916 Rising is approaching and there are great stories from the docklands on its association with the Rising. I look forward to seeing that developed. I bow to the superior knowledge of Deputy Mick Wallace when it comes to building, but even I know that anything built must be rigorously regulated, monitored and inspected. Towards the end of his speech the Minister of State used phrases like "bright future", "handsome rewards", "increased prosperity" and "improving economic position for the capital". I would love to see the words "well-being of the communities" included as well.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	637	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important legislation. The text of the Bill is simple and straightforward and it provides for the dissolution of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority and the transfer of its functions to Dublin City Council. Despite its simplicity, it is very far reaching in its implications. Passage of the Bill will mark the end of a bold experiment to fast-track planning in the docklands by making the DDDA the planning authority for the area. Substantial development took place along the docks in the early years of the authority's existence but with the arrival of the Celtic tiger, its mission statement of social and economic regeneration in equal measure was forgotten. The contradictions in its dual role of development and planning became all too obvious. The joint enterprise purchase of the Irish Glass Bottle site by the DDDA and the developers Bernard McNamara and Derek Quinlan, with money from Anglo Irish Bank, was a financial disaster that beggared the authority to the tune of €52 million. The fire safety problems currently being experienced by the residents of Longboat Quay do not reflect well on the effectiveness of the DDDA in fulfilling its joint role as a planning and development authority. If further apartment blocks are found to be substandard in the quality of their construction and not in compliance with building standards, the DDDA may have serious questions to answer into the future. Perhaps, before this Bill is passed, the Department should reflect on the timing of the dissolution of the authority and consider whether the transfer of its functions and liabilities to Dublin City Council is desirable before a full survey is carried out of properties constructed since 1997 when the DDDA was established. Section 10(1) of the Bill states that "A claim in respect of any loss or injury alleged to have been suffered by any person arising out of the performance before the dissolution day of the functions of the Authority shall, on and after that day, lie against the Council and not against the Authority". All of the liabilities are taken on by Dublin City Council. It might be wise to wait a little while. Last night the Minister of State went through the history of the docklands and provided quite a good description. However, I disagree with some elements of it and will give the Minister of State my own version, as someone who has been a public representative for the area for almost 30 years. The Dublin docklands is an area in the heart of the city with a close relationship to Dublin Port. Traditionally, most working men in the docklands were employed as labourers and carters on the docks and railways. A lot of this work was highly irregular and casual. Many other jobs in the docklands were also dependent on the port. Working conditions were tough and there were often two or three men available for every job. There were few jobs for women, though some earned a living from street trading and from cleaning or domestic service in more prosperous parts of the city. The docks were a focal point of the 1913 Lockout as the casual labourers in the docks had joined the new Irish Transport and General Workers Union. The area was also a focal point during the 1916 Rising. From the 1950s, containerisation and roll-on-roll-off shipping reduced the need for manual labour, storage facilities and large dockside space where cargo could be loaded and unloaded. Thus, more sites became derelict and jobs disappeared. The docks were no longer able to provide employment for a large number of people and the area has never recovered from the devastating impact of this development. Many of the houses built in the docklands during the nineteenth century were of poor quality. Local authority flat complexes were constructed in the North Wall between 1930 and 1952 but were demolished in the 1980s as the Government of the day sought to regenerate the docklands. The population fell by 50% between 1900 and the 1980s. The Urban Renewal Act was passed in 1986 and the Customs House Docks Development Authority, CHDDA, was established to redevelop the docklands. The Dublin Docklands Development Authority, DDDA, replaced the CHDDA in 1997. The DDDA had within its remit an obligation to regenerate the docklands. It was obliged to give effect to social and economic regeneration in equal measure. The mission statement of the DDDA reads as follows: "We will develop the Dublin Docklands into a world-class city quarter - a paragon of sustainable inner city regeneration - one in which the whole community enjoys the highest standards of access to education, employment, housing and social amenity and which delivers a major contribution to the social and economic prosperity of Dublin and the whole of Ireland."Little of the promised social regeneration took place, however. The north docklands area has an indigenous community that continues to be among the most deprived in the country. This community is located cheek by jowl with a new, affluent community and there is very little interaction between the two communities. Education levels in much of the docklands are extremely low and multi-generational unemployment is a problem. The increase in the population in recent years and the decline in derelict sites in the docklands do not reflect a lifting of all boats but, rather, a widening gulf between the indigenous community and the new residents who inhabit the new developments. The Pobal Haase-Pratschke or HP deprivation index for 2006 and 2011 reveals the stark dichotomy between the new affluent communities and the neglected indigenous community. The index for primary education levels shows similar stark contrasts. While thousands of construction workers were employed on the docklands projects and a 20% local labour clause was provided for in the master plan, the developers avoided local labour by parachuting their external workforce into temporary rented accommodation in the North Wall and East Wall areas and claimed that this constituted local employment. The commitment to provide social housing on the north side of the River Liffey was reneged on, as was the commitment to provide €7 million to build a new primary school for the children of the North Wall. While the Dublin Docklands Development Authority provided a community gain fund, it failed utterly to fulfil its social obligation to the community in a systematic way. At the same time, expensive residential complexes and much sought after office blocks created a new skyline along the River Liffey, north and south. Effectively, the DDDA created a disparate two-tier docklands society, despite 30 years of urban renewal in the area in the sense that it followed on from the work of the Custom House Docks Development Authority which was established in 1987. The best part of three decades has been spent on urban renewal that was supposed to be, in equal measure, social and economic in nature but which has been entirely one-sided with the focus on economic development. Nobody speaks well of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority in the old working class docklands area. In 2011, when the new coalition Government assumed office, the Dublin Docklands Development Authority was in terminal decline and operating in transition mode. In 2013, when plans were set in motion to establish a new phase of development on the docklands, it became clear that the DDDA did not have the credibility to carry out the work and a decision was taken to transfer its functions to Dublin City Council through this dissolution Bill. The new development plans encompassed an area of 66 ha on either side of the River Liffey, that is, the North Lotts and Grand Canal Dock. A strategic development zone was identified and approved by the local authority for fast-track development, which it is estimated will create 23,000 jobs, a not insignificant number. NAMA controls 75% of the assets in the SDZ area and is the facilitator of the development. With a projected investment of €2 billion, NAMA has a critical role in the SDZ. I suggest this may well provide the template for future disposals by NAMA of its debts and the development of its assets. Rather than selling off its assets, it should engage in development in the areas where they are located.  On social regeneration, a large number of stakeholders in the docklands came together in January 2015. They were determined that the failure of the DDDA to deliver on the social regeneration of the docklands should not be repeated under the new dispensation. In consultation with NAMA and Dublin City Council, they met to explore the possibilities for the docklands communities that would be created by the new SDZ developments. A plan was drawn up that would provide employment and apprenticeships locally, develop local businesses, invest in local education and training at every level, and make provision for social housing, local arts, crafts and sports. It was considered essential that the essence of the docklands, namely, the history of the docks and its dockers and the confluence of the canal, river and sea, be preserved and presented to the world by the creation of a docklands heritage and historical trail to rival in importance the Wild Atlantic Way. This time, social regeneration must continue alongside economic regeneration to create an integrated, vibrant docklands community as opposed to a two-tier community, which has been the case thus far. The SDZ is the last opportunity for proper docklands regeneration to take place. It is necessary, therefore, that the new dissolution Bill states clearly that the central purpose of the SDZ is to effect the social and economic regeneration of the docklands and that Dublin City Council and NAMA should work together to achieve that outcome. The legislation does not include a statement presenting a vision or purpose for the strategic development zone. A DDDA master plan statement expressed a vision of equal social and economic regeneration. However, this was disregarded by the developers and DDDA board. Such a statement of intent should be provided in the legislation to create a backdrop against which the development of the SDZ can commence. Dublin City Council, as the planning authority for the SDZ, is the responsible party and must play the key role in the regeneration process. The city council can place conditions on planning applications that would make provision for ensuring that the SDZ and surrounding areas are developed as a living, vibrant heartland of the city. It is not doing so and planning applications are being granted without any attempt being made to provide an overall strategic vision or with planning conditions attached that could ensure integrated development in the strategic development zone. A potential alignment with future planning applications will be required so as to provide space for education, training, housing, sports, arts, heritage and culture for the docklands and its community, as detailed in the current plan. This will require the planning authority to present an overall vision of the SDZ project to ensure individual development projects are woven into a coherent regeneration framework and linked to the wider docklands area. NAMA, with its control of 75% of the assets in the area that constitutes the strategic development zone, should work in partnership with Dublin City Council to facilitate the regeneration process. It should also work with Departments and other State authorities on specific projects and the provision or acquisition of sites or floor space. The National College of Ireland needs space to expand its burgeoning educational activity, which is beneficial to the entire docklands community, from the child care level to the postgraduate level. This should be recognised, identified and built into the SDZ plans before all the space is gobbled up by individual development projects. Second, the community stakeholders have identified the present headquarters of the DDDA, which was the old Isle of Man ferry ticket and berthing office and departure area, as a suitable location for community facilities. An additional floor would make it a building of considerable capacity. It is ideally located at the entrance to the docklands across from the iconic CHQ building and could include a one-stop shop for the docklands. It could provide an interpretative centre for the abundant history and heritage of the docklands, housing some of the amazing artefacts, equipment, memorabilia and photographs that are still extant. It could also serve as the starting point for the Dublin docklands heritage trail and provide facilities for arts and crafts, reflecting the rich musical, theatrical and writing traditions in the docklands. The building could also provide a centre for local employment, placement as well as training services and catering and restaurant facilities for the local and business community. None of this has been taken on board by any of the players in the docklands. On the consultative forum, Part 5 of the dissolution Bill provides for the establishment of a docklands consultative forum to advise the city council "in relation to the formulation, development, monitoring and review of the Council's policy relating to the performance of the functions of the Council in so far as they relate to the docklands area." The forum will consist of 21 members plus a chairperson drawn from community, educational and business organisations and local councillors. It reflects the representative structure that was in place under the old DDDA, which was totally ineffective in holding the authority to account. While the forum is a fine democratic structure, it will never be more than a talking shop because it has a consultative role, which means it will be allowed to speak but no one will be required to listen. A totally different body is required to effect delivery of the social and economic regeneration of the docklands. A specific new statutory oversight and implementation structure is needed to monitor and drive the social regeneration of the docklands. The new structure must have teeth and targets. It should liaise with Dublin City Council and NAMA while remaining independent of both, and should be answerable only to the Minister and the Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	638	I am glad to have the opportunity to outline to the House the capital investment framework, Building on Recovery, which represents an Exchequer spend of €27 billion over the next six years. The longer six-year timeframe for the plan will facilitate the delivery of a greater number of projects and programmes. Key investments will be made in transport, education, health and enterprise, including a new metro link between the city centre and Dublin Airport and Swords, a number of new road projects, a renewed and increased commitment to flood risk management, the relocation of both Dublin maternity hospitals as well as Limerick Regional Maternity Hospital, construction of the national children's hospital, installation of wireless networks in all schools, the removal of remaining prefabs at schools and investment in the enterprise regional building programme. In every part of the country, these investments will boost our competitiveness, create jobs and upgrade our social infrastructure. If we add investment from the wider semi-state sector and off-balance-sheet mechanisms such as public private partnerships, total State investment will amount to €42 billion in new and existing infrastructure over the period, which is an average of 3.5% of GNP per annum. The House will recall that the capital plan announced in 2011 contained necessary reductions in expenditure which reflected the fiscal position we were then in. As recent Exchequer figures have shown, those difficult but necessary decisions are beginning to pay off. Of the €42 billion worth of investment set out in the new programme, €27 billion will be invested through direct Exchequer spending. This represents a significant increase of some €10 billion over the previous five-year plan. Decisions to allocate Exchequer funding were made following a lengthy review process, which included input from stakeholders at the national economic dialogue which we began this year. The dialogue process was a most worthy discussion over two days. The analysis identified capacity constraints, infrastructural bottlenecks and areas where demand pressures were building. It informed the investment decisions contained in this framework to direct funding where it is most needed while maximising the economic and social return to the taxpayer. The investment framework marks the beginning of a return to normal levels of investment. In order to sustain growth, we must invest, but we must also do so in the right way. We will make affordable, sustainable investments that boost the productive capacity of the economy, improve public services and lay the foundations for future growth. It is intended to have a mid-term review of the plan, which will allow for a refreshing of the priorities and allocations, if appropriate, within the updated fiscal context at the time. The plan is not a departure from the prudent management of the public finances that has been the hallmark of this Government. Rather, it is an affirmation of that approach. The fiscal rules enshrined in both national and European law ensure that increases in expenditure reflect the underlying strength of our economy.  Building on Recovery is entirely consistent with this approach. There is no doubt that the economy is now in a sustained recovery. All the data so far this year have been encouraging. Consumer spending has been strong in 2015, with retail sales up by almost 10% year on year in July. Car sales were up by almost 7% over the same period. Investment is also growing, with both building construction and machinery and equipment spending on a rising path. Recovery in the construction sector continued in July, with the purchasing managers' index for the sector recording its 23rd successive month of growth. In fact, with the inclusion of the August figure, there have been 24 consecutive months of growth. These encouraging macroeconomic data are mirrored in total taxation receipts, which are up 9.8% to August, year on year. The Department of Finance published its macroeconomic forecasts in April, in which GDP was expected to expand by 4% in 2015 and 3.8% in 2016. As can be seen from recent independent forecasts, the Department's forecasts may be a little behind the curve right now, and I expect they will be updated in the Budget Statement next Tuesday. Investment decisions must take account of future needs as well as meeting current demands.  Demand for extra funding and investment is high, but decisions about how and where we spend our resources are not taken lightly. I have introduced a requirement that all capital programmes and projects with a value greater than €100 million will require Government approval prior to commencement. Further, and in line with long-standing practice, all projects and programmes to be delivered under this Exchequer capital investment framework are subject to the provisions of the public spending code, including the provisions in relation to the need for appraisal and value for money. Projects are also subject, of course, to planning guidelines and requirements, including environmental impacts assessments as appropriate. The new capital programme supports the Government's number one priority, which is getting people back to work. An estimated 45,000 construction jobs will be directly supported as a result of the Exchequer plan. The Government has also committed to spending €3 billion to support business and innovation through our enterprise agencies over the duration of the plan. The IDA, Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland support 320,000 jobs in this country. We will continue to support these agencies by providing funding for grants, equity investments and innovation supports. In order to grow, businesses need fast, efficient transport networks. In the decade up to 2008, Ireland addressed many of the infrastructural deficits that had been constraining growth. I acknowledge that large-scale investments were made in our road network, public transport links and airports. As Europe's fastest-growing and most dynamic economy today, it is essential that we preserve our competitiveness by building on those investments. In recognition of the fact that large transport projects have long lead-in times, the Government will provide a seven-year capital envelope to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. A total of €10 billion will be available to the Department over the period. By 2022, we will have doubled the level of annual investment in the transport area to €2 billion per annum. The largest single project will be a new metro and light rail link in Dublin. Based on the outcome of the recent Fingal and north Dublin transport study, the National Transport Authority has recommended that a revised metro project be selected as the appropriate public transport project to address the transport needs of the Swords and Dublin Airport to city centre corridor. The plan is to have a metro link in operation by 2026 to 2027 along a route for which travel demand is forecast to grow by almost 40% by 2033 and where the current and potential future levels of car dependency are unsustainable. The proportion of our citizens aged over 65 is, thankfully, increasing, which poses challenges to our health care system. To meet these challenges, there will be a large-scale investment in health care facilities for the duration of the plan. By 2021, €600 million will be spent annually to upgrade our hospitals, residential homes and health infrastructure.This level of funding restores capital expenditure in health to its previous peak. The capital framework provides funding for the relocation of the Dublin maternity hospitals, which we announced, and Limerick maternity hospital. Under the plan, an additional €300 million will be invested in upgrading residential facilities around the country to meet Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, standards. These facilities will not only provide an excellent standard of care and recovery, but also ease the pressure on hospitals and improve efficiencies across the system. Our young and growing population will allow us to sustain our recovery over the next decade and beyond, but we must ensure that public infrastructure is in place to support young families. Nowhere is this more evident than in education. Between 2012 and 2014, which were the most difficult of times, the Government built more than 84 new schools and 55 large-scale school extensions. The capital investment framework continues that commitment. We will spend more than €3 billion in the next six years investing in our children's future by building new schools and upgrading existing ones. These new and upgraded buildings will be fit for the 21st century. The capital plan provides €400 million for the installation of wireless networks in all schools, investment in IT hardware and a programme to replace the remaining prefabs in schools. Many of the record number of pupils due to complete school in the coming years will inevitably attend college. We must plan and invest for this as well. A total of €350 million will be invested in third level infrastructure, including a new €200 million public-private partnership, PPP, investment in the institutes of technology sector. As the House will know, An Garda Síochána is embarked on a programme of substantial reform. A critical priority for the Government is to support this process of reform through increased expenditure on Garda information technology. We want to remove any impediment to the development of a modern, state-of-the-art police force. To support that goal in the six years to come, we will invest more than €330 million in Garda ICT systems and technologies and €46 million on new and upgraded Garda vehicles. The Government is committed to ensuring that our economic infrastructure is available in all regions. Investment in ICT is critical to our national economy. Recently, the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources agreed the national broadband strategy. The plan will utilise significant private sector investment and be supported by investment from the Exchequer. It will ensure that every business and household has access to high-speed broadband to help connect communities, spread growth and support local business. Given the pressing need to recommence a house building programme to meet urgent housing needs, additional allocations to support social housing were announced as part of last year's budget. Through direct Exchequer spending and local government investment, approximately €3 billion will be provided for the social housing strategy. The Government remains committed to using every available source of funding to address the shortage of social and affordable housing. The Government is also aware that we have obligations to behave responsibly not only in respect of fiscal sustainability, which we have proven, but also in terms of environmental sustainability. We need to protect and maintain our environment and habitats not just for today, but for future generations. We cannot ignore the impact of climate change and, as a country, we have a responsibility to play our part in reducing reliance on fossil fuels. We also have legally binding renewable energy targets and €444 million will be spent on energy efficiency and renewable energy programmes during the period of the capital plan. However, the effects of climate change are already visible in towns and villages across Ireland. To protect vulnerable communities, the Government has prioritised the introduction of a new flood risk management programme. By 2021, spending on this programme will have reached €100 million per annum. As we approach the centenary of the 1916 Rising, it is appropriate that we complete all planned works on our important heritage sites and provide additional funding for commemoration projects. Under the capital framework, an additional €31 million will be provided next year for these works. A new PPP programme valued at €500 million will be developed in the justice, education and health sectors. This programme will build on recent successes, utilise the significant level of expertise that we have developed in this area and leverage Ireland's positive position among national and international investors. To coincide with this PPP programme, the Government will introduce a PPP investment policy framework. The framework will limit expenditure on PPPs to a stated percentage of annual capital spending and provide transparency and clarity to ensure that the long-term interests of the taxpayer are protected. The Government will provide a responsible, affordable and sustainable way forward. By working together, State and industry will deliver modern, strategic infrastructure that will build on the economic recovery and allow it to continue. I thank the House for its attention.

He was positively purring when he delivered some of the macroeconomic statistics. I do not know whether it was a dress rehearsal for next Tuesday. There are a number of issues with the plan. It should be viewed in the context of a lack of deliverable dates for many of its projects. This points to a failure to reform the delivery of large-scale projects. I do not mean this in a party political way, but our public service operates in a silo fashion, with one Department deciding one project while another Department is in charge of the regulations for delivering and planning that project, leading to projects not proceeding. It could be 11 years before a ticket is sold on the metro north. If we want to be a modern European economy with a capital city that strives to be one of the best not just in Europe, but in the world, surely we must be able to deliver such a transport system in less than 11 years. The plan was announced with a great deal of fanfare and publicity, but alongside the announcement we lost the Web Summit. This was a statement on Dublin's lack of capacity to deliver on large events. Those behind the Web Summit want to move it around and it is a private company, but we must examine the concerns that were highlighted last year about, for example, Wi-Fi and hotel accommodation, which factor into this plan and its ambitions. In 2008, before the onset of the crisis, €9 billion per year was invested in capital projects. While the Minister has acknowledged this, capital expenditure will only have reached approximately half of that level by 2019. Amid the fanfare and the spin, there are many gaps. I do not know whether we have weeks or months left in this House. Does even the Minister know? Regardless, proper respect for democracy and debate could be shown by having every line committee examine the plan and, within its priorities-----

The civil servants who are in charge of prioritising and not prioritising projects within the plan should appear before each committee to justify that selection. I do not know whether we can do that in the course of this Dáil. Perhaps we cannot, in which case it should be the first item on the agenda for the next bunch of committees. If there is to be a mid-term review of the plan's projects, we need to review the manner in which we deliver the plan. Last week, I noticed that Apple's welcome decision to locate in Athenry had become subject to a planning appeal. That is normal and is people's right, but it will take An Bord Pleanála at least six months to decide on the matter. The board's track record on smaller projects has seen the process extend to nine or 12 months. We will delay a project that was hard fought for by the good people in IDA Ireland, was located in the regions to everyone's surprise and was badly needed. It will go into the quagmire of our planning system. Have we not learned lessons from previous plans? Surely there should be an overall infrastructural body to take charge of and deliver these plans. Instead of delay upon delay, we would then get a plan that had dates and delivery targets for specific projects. This plan contains many projects that were not delivered in the Government's previous plan for various reasons - for example, budgets, or, more importantly, a lack of progress. Were the Minister a finalist in tonight's "The Great British Bake Off," he would be criticised for reheating what was previously baked and lose marks. There are an awful lot of soggy bottoms in this plan. Many of them are due to problems with the Government and its lack of ambition, but others are due to system problems that, if not acted upon, will plague this plan and haunt its delivery in the same way they did with other plans. The plan's employment statistics are ambitious. Everyone wants people to work, and I note the plan seeks to create 45,000 construction jobs. That is fantastic, but does the apprenticeship system have the capacity to back that up? Were the Minister to allocate money to SOLAS next week to put in place an apprenticeship programme, how would it be able to get up to that capacity quickly to avoid a situation similar to that which pertained in 2001 and 2002, when the construction rates and the tender amount one was obliged to pay to get construction done ate into the value of the projects? Unless the capacity is available to deliver an apprenticeship programme that is real and relevant to 2015, as opposed to the early 1980s, this plan will not deliver, and it certainly will not deliver 45,000 construction jobs. There is a cadre of people who have skills that need updating, and they should be targeted through employment programmes. They should be given access to these jobs, and the people who wish to learn those skills from school or otherwise should now be given a chance. If this involves the Minister front-loading investment in SOLAS and the institutes of technology to make those programmes available and to produce those skilled people, that should be done, because the labour force then will be available to deliver the plan. I will go through some of the projects. At present, 42% of Ireland's GDP is generated around the environs of this building, in places like Dublin 2 and Dublin 6, and not even in all of Dublin. When one leaves Dublin's city centre, one encounters serious economic black spots that are not witnessing a recovery, and when one leaves Dublin altogether one encounters serious problems. One measure of this plan will be its ability to restore that balance and its ability to give the regions a proper say and a proper role in the country's recovery, as well as a proper chance to exploit its opportunities. However, the plan as laid out does not do this. A plan that leaves out a link road between two key cities, Cork and Limerick, does not say anything about regional development. A plan that cuts the budget for the regional broadband scheme that was announced only a few weeks previously does not do much for a regional broadband economy. As for the road network plan, ironically, my constituency colleague, the Taoiseach, as well as our senior constituency colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, are running to claim credit for the N5, yet the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, has stated that he has no direct involvement in the choosing of the roads. Perhaps the Government needs to get its story right. However, when one considers that €4.4 billion of €6 billion over the next few years has been allocated to maintenance-----

If there is to be a proper regional plan that seeks not to cut Dublin or to make it suffer but to restore and build a balance, one would ask why projects such as the Cork-Limerick route have not been given the go-ahead. This is why senior civil servants must appear before committees - to answer for this and to make the Dáil relevant once again. On public transport, as I stated, the metro north has an 11-year timeframe, and all Members present might have left the Oireachtas by then.

However, the fact it has taken so long to deliver serious public transport plans such as the metro north undermines the plan. While we claim Dublin to be a European and world city, the fact that one still arrives into Dublin Airport and does not have direct rail access into Dublin city undermines our capacity as a country to sell ourselves. As for flood defences, the Minister mentioned all the work that has been done on the flood management plans and so on, but again, it is evident how slow this process is. Serious flood issues arose in Cork in 2010 that are the subject of court cases at present, but there has not yet been much investment in flood management in Cork. While some good work has been done in rural areas, there is much more to do, and the planning is taking a long time. I am aware of this from experience in my native county, where a flood issue arose in Crossmolina in 2007 that only now is being resolved in 2015, which I welcome as part of this plan. In my home town of Ballina, a serious flood issue has not been included in this plan because the Office of Public Works has not got around to drawing up its local flood management plans as yet. On the mid-term review, I stated earlier that the Minister was purring about the fiscal position. However, the Minister must focus his Department on the public service reform side of things and on the system's ability to deliver on a plan such as this. Unless the system of delivery has changed and unless the Minister has reformed the system of delivery, we will get what we have, namely, an à la carte plan with no delivery dates to which Members can hold a Government agency or Department to account, with vague budget figures beside it and with little precision in the budgets pertaining to many projects. This is why, as a Parliament - as an Oireachtas - Members cannot make a proper account of it or hold it to review. Members cannot make a proper judgment on it given the flimsiness of the document presented to them. I note that a date still has not been provided for delivery of the national children's hospital. It has dogged the present Government, as it did previous Governments-----

There were planning issues and many other problems, because there has been no reform. There have been no major changes to the system that delivers, and that is what must happen. IBEC, which is a fan of the Minister's senior party in government, has stated that 90% or 95% of capital expenditure is on maintenance. The tradition will continue within this plan. As for the ambition the Minister claims is contained within this plan, when one goes through the not-very-small print, because the detail therein is so lacking, one finds it is not present. This is not a plan to lead this country into a recovery out of an economic downturn. It is not a plan that shows there is a vision for the country. It is vague and not even aspirational, and if the Minister has the courage of his speech, he will allow the plan to be put before the committees before or after the election and will allow a proper analysis of it, rather than the two-hour set of statements in the Chamber - it is not even a debate - taking place this evening.

It is that time when the Minister blows the dust from his wallet, the rust is scraped from the locks of the Government's treasure chests and the Minister's largesse flows freely, or so he would have Members believe. In 2008, capital expenditure reached its peak at €9 billion, and by the time the Minister came into government in 2011, capital expenditure was at €4.5 billion. Over the term of the present Government it fell steadily, reaching €3.3 billion in 2014. The Government's plan, which pledges €27 billion over six years, envisages an increase from €3.8 billion in 2016 to €5.4 billion in 2021, which leaves one with an average of €4.5 billion per annum. The Government is getting back to the level of expenditure it inherited when it took office, and consequently, in real terms, the Minister is doing no more than restoring-----

One could argue, were one to take into account inflation, changes in population and demographic pressures, that in real terms the figure is less than the level of expenditure the Minister inherited. In any event, it still will leave us second from the bottom of the league in European terms in respect of capital investment. Most people would regard this plan as part of the choreography of general elections. Famously, under the previous Government, the former Taoiseach, Brian Cowen, flanked by John Gormley of the Green Party, announced a massive spending plan to the tune of €40 billion. Does the Minister remember that? Of course it never happened; it was notional and aspirational, much as is this document. The long and the short of it is that it was not delivered.Consideration of a document like this is probably more suited to a committee setting where we can examine each proposition step by step. We should avail of the opportunity to do that. As my time is limited, I want to zero in on one proposition the Minister has made. It is on page 31 under the heading of health care. In it, he sets out a reconfiguration of the investment in maternity services, which is long overdue. He plans to move the Rotunda Hospital out to Connolly Hospital in Blanchardstown. I would like the Minister to provide the cost-benefit analysis and position papers that informed that particular decision. I wonder if such documentation exists. Anybody who knows this particular hospital, which has been crying out for investment for a long time, would know that its medical referral relationship has always been with the Mater hospital. Those of us who know the area - I suspect the Minister himself also knows it - are aware that there is a site adjacent to the Mater hospital which had been earmarked for the children's hospital. The Minister will remember that and he will also know that considerable amounts of taxpayers' moneys were invested - some may argue wasted - in the preparation of that site.  People who have attended or worked in the Rotunda Hospital cannot understand this decision to move it to Blanchardstown. Why on earth would one do that and disrupt those medical relationships, while leaving that site idle? For the purposes of this specific initiative, I would like to see all of the considerations and analyses, including a cost-benefit analysis, that informed a decision to move this maternity hospital to Blanchardstown, which is the constituency both of the Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, and the Tánaiste, Deputy Joan Burton. I have raised that specific issue, but each of the other initiatives contained in the report need to be subjected to that kind of analysis in terms of expenditure, the efficacy of the spend, and the process the Minister went through to produce this document. Surely the politics of a general election do not inform the Minister, and he would not be playing for home advantage as well.
#SandraMcLellan	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-party	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-dob	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	656	Having briefly had the opportunity to read through the infrastructure and capital investment plan, I have noticed what I believe to be a few gaping holes in it. There would appear to be a lack of investment in child care, given the public outcry for better facilities and access in this regard. The sum of €11 million a year in early years and youth projects is a pittance when looked at from an outside perspective and demonstrates a lack of will to invest in the youth of today, especially considering that a large percentage of that allocation is to be put towards the child detention facility in Oberstown. From meeting a number of my constituents in east Cork, along with a number of stakeholders, we are all in agreement that early intervention is the way forward. A proactive approach is needed, rather than the reactive one which this Government seems to support. Substantial investment is needed in the youth work sector. The work that these people carry out is invaluable and they need to be supported in their endeavours. Most of these workers get by with limited resources on a daily basis and still produce results when their hands are effectively tied. They work out of shoddy offices or no offices at all, working directly with the most marginalised and vulnerable young people in the country. With the funding the Minister has outlined to be allocated, how does he propose that these services are ever to become more effective in what is an already hugely strained sector? I welcome the Minister's investment in Tusla, although I believe it falls somewhat short of what is required. Massive resources need to be freed up in order to allow social workers to do the already taxing and difficult work they carry out. The children to social workers ratio is well above recommended levels. In practical terms, this allows social workers to meet with their assigned cases on an infrequent basis and can adversely lead to a breakdown of what was a workable relationship. The reality of what is needed seems to be alien and although these issues are acknowledged in this House time and time again, nothing much ever seems to change. A detachment from reality appears to be consistent across the board and is an all too recurring theme. Access visits between families tend to be conducted in these overworked office spaces, so money should be allocated to provide facilities that are welcoming and which allow these families to meet in a safe and comfortable environment, rather than in a dull and dreary office. I hope that within the Minister's allocated finances, from whatever little will be left, moneys will be ring-fenced to support family resource centres. These centres also do great work in marginalised and disadvantaged areas, but they are struggling at both national and local level. They are grossly understaffed and unable to accommodate and support families that find themselves in situations of consistent poverty. Unfortunately, these numbers are still rising due to the policies prioritised by the Government. There is a significant need for investment in these areas to allow staff to have space to provide for these young people and families. The €136 million being invested in our country's children is merely a token gesture over the course of the five years. It is quite simply a drop in the ocean when analysed and broken down. If the Government is truly serious about child care infrastructure and the aspirations towards a Scandinavian model, why allocate so little? Instead of cutting tax, adequate capital investment should be made available if we are to move forward and fix this in a way that is both sustainable and of benefit to working parents, or those who are hampered in returning to work due to astronomical costs. Refugees are set to enter our country before Christmas. Minimal amounts appear to be allocated to address this matter, including services, their accommodation and other infrastructure. I have major concerns surrounding these areas also and especially the treatment of children who will be entering the country. These children are coming from war-torn countries, often having travelled for weeks on end, all of which could only leave these children with a mass of traumatic experiences. How are we going to cope with these children who need help to overcome their traumatic experiences when we are currently so under-resourced in this sector? More needs to be done in this regard and I call on the Government to revisit seriously and analyse a document that seems to have been compiled with disregard to the reality of ground-level services and amenities.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	657	The capital investment plan introduced by the Government over a week ago, amid much inflated hype, earmarks €27 billion toward a number of areas, including transport and housing, over a six-year period. The plan is plush with style and grand statements, but when we search for the substance and detail there is little to be found. As we draw ever closer to the end of 2015, the spectre of an election looms large, and I have little doubt as to the extent of its influence. For all the contrived statements and press calls, the Government must remember that these issues affect every person in this country. The people are not just an electorate to be courted, but citizens to whom these plans must be delivered. Housing is grossly under addressed in the Minister's document. It takes up just over one page, the majority of which repeats details of another document, the Social Housing Strategy 2020. According to the capital plan, and I quote directly from the text, "The Government believes that everyone should have access to good quality housing suited to their needs at an affordable price and in a sustainable community". Why then has this Government failed comprehensively to tackle the housing emergency in a decisive manner? Through the capital plan the Government aims to put €3 billion towards the Social Housing Strategy 2020, under which the Minister claims he will deliver up to 35,000 units, with an implication that he might not deliver on the full 35,000. It is clear that most of that 35,000 will be delivered from the private sector and will be directed towards the RAS, rent supplement and HAP schemes.  At current estimates, we need over 20,000 houses a year to meet demand. I remind the Government that between 2008 and 2014, State spending on housing fell by €1.6 billion. It started with the previous government and finished with the current one. In 2013, approximately 750 units were built by local authorities and AHBs, with a further 1,200 delivered through leasing arrangements. We are in a crisis and this situation has reached a fundamentally critical stage for far too many people across the country. The Government spinning a skeletal plan in the context of an election does nothing to improve the situation. Regarding transport, we broadly welcome the much-needed investment in the road network, including the €4.4 billion earmarked for road maintenance and upgrades.However, we have concerns about the lack of costings in the capital plan. A total of €1.6 billion is to be spent on new road projects. The Minister listed a broad range throughout the country, almost one for every area. The metro north rail project is essential for a European capital city like Dublin. In principle, we welcome plans to proceed with its development. Plans for a metro in Dublin go all the way back to 2001, when the report entitled A Platform for Change, produced by the Dublin Transportation Office, proposed two metro lines, metro north and metro west. In 2006 the Railway Procurement Agency drew up plans for three potential routes. However, it was March 2007 before RPA started the procurement process, and it was not until 2009 that potential bidders were short-listed. The consideration of other potential projects such as metro north and the DART underground, as well as issues in finalising the route selection, resulted in the deferral of any metro plan for Dublin. Today, 14 years after the idea was originally proposed, the Government has earmarked funding, and construction of the metro north will start in 2021. The project is due for completion in 2026 or 2027. Given the 15-year wait for any real progress, it is difficult to envisage the Government delivering a metro even within this elongated timeline, particularly if the consultation process is to be revisited. I wish to remind the House that €170 million has been spent on the metro north already. It is also disappointing that the A5 has been all but written off in the Government plans. So much for cross-Border projects and co-operation. Our success in public private partnerships is not impressive, and this calls into question the €300 million announced by the Government in housing. We have seen many projects collapse over the years, and PPPs have always been a major problem. Throughout the tenure of this Government, investment in housing and transport has suffered. Between 2012 and 2014, the capital budget for transport amounted to €3.4 billion. I have no doubt those in the Government will congratulate themselves on forward planning, but delivery is the essential component. Otherwise, this plan can be considered little more than electioneering.

#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	659	When I first read the capital plan it reminded me of the film "This is Spinal Tap" in which they talk about turning the volume up to 11. This time the Government has announced a capital plan that is six years long instead of the normal five years. This allowed the Government to announce €27 billion instead of something less than €22 billion. If the purpose of the plan is pre-election propaganda, it may or may not be successful. If the purpose of the plan is to deal with the historically low levels of public and private investment in the economy, then the plan is utterly inadequate. Let us start with the headline figures. Twenty-seven billion euro sounds like a great deal of money, until we compare it to historical long-term average figures for public investment. The historical long-term average figure for public investment in the State is 3.5% of GDP. In 2015 the figure stands at 1.8% of GDP, and with this new magic plan it will be 1.9% of GDP. In money terms, this means the plan represents an increase in public spending next year of €200 million and, in the following years of the plan, increases of €250 million. This is in the context of the Government's plan to cut taxes in the next budget to the tune of €750 million, tax cuts that will skew towards higher earners. The context is private sector investment remaining down by 35% compared to pre-crisis levels and public sector investment having been absolutely slashed. Those are the headline figures When we examine it in more detail, the situation is even worse. Let us consider the phasing of the money. The money is back-loaded - that is to say, more money is spent later on down the road, when the Government may or may not be in power, rather than now. We simply do not know if the Government will be in power next year, never mind six years from now, by which time these big promises of public spending and investment may have been forgotten. In 2016 we will start with €3.8 billion, and this will rise in 2021 to €5.4 billion. This is utterly cynical and makes no economic sense at a time when interest rates are at an all-time low and the State could borrow at this stage to invest. It would be better to invest now in improving our infrastructure and to front-load that investment. The only reason to do it the other way around is cynical electioneering. Let us consider the plan in more detail. There is no new money for housing, despite the emergency - only €3 billion or €500 million per year. Let us consider the categories of investment. More investment is going to areas that are connected to corporate welfare for some big businesses, rather than going into health, education, climate change and housing. The total going on enterprise or corporate welfare is €4.3 billion. Let us consider how money will be spent within the spending categories. Out of the €10 billion being spent on transport, including public private partnerships, more than €6 billion is going on roads and less than €4 billion on public transport. Let us compare that to €874 million on climate change, €430 million of which is going towards adapting to climate change by building flood defences rather than actually trying to stop it. The Government is also planning to invest as much in defence as on climate change. Let us consider the role of public private partnerships. Some €500 million will be spent on new PPP funding, stood over by the Labour Party, in what is a scheme that costs the public more money. It is a more expensive way to deliver infrastructure and is basically about the public sector subsidising private profit. This is not what we need. In fact, it is the opposite of what we need. We need major public investment to deal with all the social problems that exist in our society and create the basis for a sustainable recovery. A key basis for a sustainable recovery will be increased levels of investment in our society. The collapse in investment - between 66% and 70% of private sector investment - was a key driving factor in the dragging down of the economy over an extended period. It is also the only way we will deal with the social problems that exist. For example, the Anti-Austerity Alliance will launch its budget statement in the coming days. The centrepiece of the document is the idea of major public investment to deal with the housing crisis. We estimate that for €10 billion of additional public investment, spread over three years - that is, a little less than €3.5 billion per year - we could build 100,000 homes and effectively clear the housing waiting list, together with the use of vacant properties and the resources of NAMA. In addition, we believe there is a need for further public investment based on creating decent jobs. One estimate suggests that an investment stimulus of €1 billion for one year would create approximately 16,750 jobs. That would represent a net cost of €575 million owing to greater tax revenues as a result of higher GDP. For example, for €2.3 billion we could have 15,000 workers in a major public works programme to replace non-compliant water mains throughout the State, or 10,000 child care workers in publicly owned crèches, or 5,000 special needs assistants, or 10,000 workers to develop Ireland's wind and wave energy to its potential. The problem in the State is not too much public investment but too little, particularly in the context of the crisis in the private sector. This document does nothing to reverse the trend. In fact, it continues a level of stagnation in public investment.

I said to myself that perhaps the devil would be in the detail. Then I heard road jobs being announced and the announcement of the road from Tuam to Gort. I recalled that the work was nearly done, yet the project was announced again. I heard the plans for Moycullen being announced. I was out there recently and that project is very close to being done as well. I am not sure what the reason is for announcing some things several times. Most of the budget for road construction is for maintenance. While I realise that roads need maintenance, the Government failed to take a great opportunity. In 2011 the Government decided to take the west of Ireland out of the TEN-T project. That could have resulted in funding of between 30% and 40% from the European Union, basically free, for core infrastructural projects between two countries. This is a missed opportunity.We see where it has been landed, from Limerick to Dublin to Newry and from Cork to Dublin to Newry, and we wonder why. Most of the clout must be hitting that way. It is welcome that funding of €450 million for nursing homes and the disabled was announced, but the sad reality is that we have asked what is being done a few times and no detail has been given. We hear every Deputy in the House talk about the need for social housing. It has been neglected down through the years. The effort that has been made this year in the counties I represent has been abysmal. We were given figures on what would be done in the last budget and were told billions would be spent. However, all we had were photo sessions with builders' hats on our heads and announcements about houses that were never built. I spoke last week about the €9 billion the credit unions had to help the Government if social housing was required. In a time of need, the credit unions are willing to talk to the Government, but the Government does not seem to want to do so. It can borrow money elsewhere, but it must remember that every bit of interest it pays on moneys borrowed from groups such as the credit unions will be spent in our country, rather than going to a vulture fund or speculator living in another country trying to make money on the backs of the Irish people.  The children's hospital was announced for the fifth or sixth time. A spade has not yet been put into the ground. A previous Deputy referred to other hospital services being put out to Blanchardstown. I do not think anybody thought of people in the north, south, east and west of the country who travel with sick children. It would have been better to keep the hospital nearer to the M50. I travelled from the roundabout on the M50 today and the traffic was chaotic for the entire journey. A person from Cork, Limerick, Donegal, Sligo, Galway or Mayo travelling to St. James's Hospital will find the journey chaotic after travelling for two or three hours. Joined-up thinking is required. Mistakes have been made. At one stage the hospital was to be located in the middle of town and then it was supposed to be in St. James's Hospital. The children's hospital is supposed to be for all the children in the country. We need to make sure that we rethink the project. Successive Governments have promised much and delivered little in terms of broadband. We have abysmal broadband. Everyone says the regions will be helped, but they cannot be helped if they do not have broadband. A broadband package has been announced. I attended a committee today and found out it will be next summer before we get the go-ahead from our masters in Europe to start the project. Rural parts of Ireland need infrastructure, including roads, which is why I have referred to the likes of the TEN-T project. If we want to make sure that we boost tourism in, for the sake of argument, the west of Ireland, and bring in manufacturing jobs, we will need core infrastructural projects. That means broadband and roads. The IDA needs to get its act together and make sure that every announcement does not revolve around the financial centre or similar areas. While we welcome jobs in any part of the country, we need them in other parts of Ireland.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	661	The Government seems to specialise in big and bold, but deceptive, headline announcements when it comes to spending. The latest example of this is the big, bold headline of €27 billion to be spent between now and 2021. Of course, why not have a 20-year plan with an even larger figure, or a 30-year or 50-year plan involving hundreds of billions of euro? It is completely deceptive because it does not tell us how it compares with capital investment when the level of capital investment was at a reasonable level prior to the crash, after which it collapsed. If one makes that comparison, one finds we still are nowhere near the level of public capital investment we had when there was a relatively reasonable public investment plan. Even then it was insufficient, to my mind. At its height, there was public investment of about €9 billion a year. Broken down on a year-by-year basis, the Government's proposal is a fraction of that. As we know, there was chronic under-investment in water infrastructure and social housing, even at the height of the boom when we had lots of money. I could refer to many other areas, such as the chronic under-investment in public transport, even when the money was available to us.  I have mentioned forestry in the House many times. It is pathetic that the State forestry company cannot engage in afforestation even though we know the economic, social and cultural benefits that would derive from a serious public investment programme in forestry. None of that happened, even when we were spending twice or three times what has been proposed in this plan. If one rolls up the figures of public investment over a long period of time, as this announcement does, it sounds great. However, when one breaks it down, one finds it is pathetic. It is well below the levels of public investment we had previously and, quite worryingly, it suggests that even by 2021 we will not have overcome the massive deficit that we now have in public capital investment arising from the crash and the austerity that has been imposed. We will still be well below the levels of public investment that we had prior to the crash, which is a very depressing picture of capital investment plans. I will not discuss all of these areas; rather, I will discuss one in particular in the short time available, namely, housing. We have the rehash of announcements that have been made, whereby the figure of €3 billion has been extended by one year to add a few extra hundred million to it. The vast bulk of this is not real capital spending at all, because about 75% to 80% of the €3 billion support for the housing strategy will go to private landlords under the HAP scheme, which will not deliver. That is not just a prediction, because it has not delivered this year. The delivery promised was 8,400 new units under the HAP scheme, but I understand less than half that number have been delivered. I am not absolutely clear on the figures for the end of the year, but they are not anywhere near what we were promised. We know the figures will not be delivered because landlords are running away from arrangements with local authorities and have no intention of providing social housing when they can charge astronomical levels of rent in the private market. Why the hell would they? The plan is completely flawed and deceptive in the case of housing because it is not real public investment in building council housing, which would actually provide us with housing stock to deal with the housing crisis. It is a guaranteed recipe that the housing crisis will continue to get worse, notwithstanding big, bold announcements and large-sounding figures. The plan completely fails to deal with this emergency situation. If it cannot deal with an emergency, how can we give any credibility to the rest of the plan as actually delivering anything serious in terms of the massive injection of public capital investment we need to get the economy back on the rails?
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	662	I welcome the opportunity to say a few words, and I want to take up a point made by the previous speaker: his criticism of the lack of ambition in the capital programme. The ambition in the capital programme must be related to the relative position of the public finances. It is true to say the public finances have improved, but we are certainly not out of the woods. We still spend €5 billion more than we earn on an annual basis. If we continue to improve the public finances through prudent management it may be possible to add some additional projects in a mid-term review. There is no shortage of items for the shopping list that all of us in the House would like to see included. There are things I would love to have seen in the capital programme that are not in it, but it is grounded in reality related to the relative position of the public finances, and this is something we must bear in mind. It must be remembered this is borrowed money we are investing in critical public infrastructure. The list has been mentioned and includes housing, roads, broadband and hospitals. It is worth bearing in mind that when we came into office we could not borrow money in the marketplace because the interest rates were in excess of 15%. Now we can borrow money at the same interest rate as countries such as the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom. This is because we are considered to be a good bet by people who lend us the money, as they think they will get it back. Perhaps if we continue to prudently manage the public finances, other items can be added in the mid-term review. I want to deal with a couple of issues which are in the capital programme, including the road from the county boundary in my constituency to a point east of Macroom, the Ballyvourney-Macroom N22 improvement. The cost-benefit analysis associated with this is one of the highest for any national road project. It is included in the five-year capital programme, and the critical issue is to get this project to a stage at which construction can begin. It is a long construction process and will take a number of years. We need to get it to a stage at which construction can begin as quickly as possible. The merits of the project speak for themselves. Regrettably, there have been accidents involving pedestrians and cars, including some fatalities. The economic benefit not only to Macroom and its hinterland but to the entire south-west region is inextricably tied up with the project, and I welcome its inclusion. I share the views expressed by Deputy Fitzmaurice on broadband. I do not claim to be an expert on the technology, but as a representative of a rural constituency I have found that when one contacts eir, which we must remember is now a private company, and ask it to make an exchange broadband-enabled, unless it is on Patrick Street or the main street of the big town it is not interested. Of the €275 million included for broadband, which is as critical now to modern-day living as running water or rural electrification was many years ago, would it be possible, without compromising the national broadband plan, to direct some of this funding towards making a host of eir exchanges throughout the country broadband-enabled? The lessons we can learn retrospectively about how Eircom was privatised are myriad, but we must look forward rather than backwards, and perhaps this is something we could look at with a view to improving the service for many thousands of people the length and breadth of the country. Unfortunately, we will be waiting for the main players to arrive at a crossroads to deliver broadband. A consultation process on the national broadband scheme is ongoing, but we need something immediate. I do not know the cost of making the remaining eir exchanges broadband-enabled, so to some extent I am speaking in a vacuum, but I would like it be investigated. It would help improve the service for many people who do not have an acceptable level of service. I want to speak about education, as €3.8 billion is available for investment in primary, secondary and third-level school buildings and universities. It is a great tribute to the Government that at a time of significant challenges in the public finances and a baby boom we were able over recent years to ensure every child had access to classroom space. Many school buildings are long overdue renewal. In particular I want to mention two schools which I hope will be included in the capital projects. One is De La Salle College in Macroom, which is looking for a new school with an autism spectrum disorder, ASD, element in it. Investment has been made in a number of ASD units at primary level in the region, but these children are moving through the education system and it is incumbent on all of us to ensure adequate facilities are available at local level. Unfortunately, at present, many of these children travel 20 or 30 miles to the nearest facility, and it would be appropriate, having availed of ASD units in many of the schools around Macroom, that they have an opportunity to progress to second level with a local ASD unit attached to a new De La Salle College in Macroom. The other school I want to mention - I am conscious that my time is practically up and I do not want to delay Deputy Breen, who I am sure has words of wisdom - is Clondrohid national school. It has multiple prefabricated classrooms and a number of ASD units, including a new temporary ASD classroom for next September. A new school was originally announced by Deputy Micheál Martin back in 1997 when he was Minister, but it still has not happened. The centenary celebrations were in 1996 and the then Minister, Deputy Martin, came down in 1997 and promised a new school, but it still has not been delivered. We need to look forwards, not backwards. Will the Minister for Education and Skills take these two specific schools into account in terms of the capital programme?
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	663	I welcome the opportunity to speak in the debate. Over the past four years, the Government has made significant progress in transforming the economy from the basket case of Europe to the fastest-growing economy in Europe. Maintaining fiscal prudence and stability is critical to the ongoing recovery as we emerge from the recession. This is why the plan is important. It is based on what we can deliver, as other Government speakers have said. We certainly do not want to make the mistakes we made in the past again. Deputy Creed and previous speakers spoke about broadband. Broadband is one of the most important issues facing the country and needs to be delivered to every part of the country. I hope the investment put into broadband will deliver, because it is the future for rural Ireland. We talk about sustaining rural Ireland. The only thing that will sustain rural Ireland is broadband, so that people can work at home in their houses. The other day I heard an auctioneer say the first thing asked by a person who wants to buy a house in the country is whether the area has a broadband service. If there is broadband people will work from home. They will buy houses in the country. It is obviously important for people to live in the country. Their children will go to school. It is critical that we invest in broadband and I hope we have high-speed broadband in every part of Ireland by 2020. Transport is an important part of the plan, and it is important to know there is much work ongoing. In the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's constituency, the N17-N18 Tuam-Gort bypass is making huge and fast progress, and it will open up the entire west of Ireland. It is also creating many jobs at present, and this is extremely important. Most economists who have spoken about the plan have said it will deliver and that it is unlike other plans, particularly the previous Government's plans, with Bertie bowls and things we could not afford. As Deputy Creed said, €3.8 billion will be invested in education, and I welcome the fact that two schools in Ennis have been included. These are the Christian Brothers national school and Scoil Chríost Rí in Cloughleigh. I hope that Sixmilebridge national school can also be included. Huge money has been invested in schools, and this is important. More money is going into health care. Limerick Regional Maternity Hospital is being transferred to the University Hospital Limerick, which is an important factor because experts throughout the world believe it is important to have the two hospitals alongside each other. Today, in my own constituency, over €1.4 million has been allocated by the Office of Public Works to Clare County Council for agricultural land embankments, etc., damaged during the flooding and storms in 2014. That is a significant amount of money going into west Clare. Never before has that kind of money been put into embankments and coastal protection measures for agricultural land by a Government. There is much happening. I have mentioned the health services. There is also the Shannon bridge crossing at Killaloe, which is most welcome. Killaloe has a strong reputation as a tourist town and the current bridge is unable to handle the high volume of traffic going over the bridge to Ballina. The construction of a new crossing will be a major boost for east Clare and particularly for the tourism sector. I hope it will come about as soon as possible. There is much in this plan, and significant investment has been put into hospitals in Clare, including Regina House in Kilrush and Ennistymon community hospital. The Minister will be down on 19 October to lay the foundation stone for phase two at Raheen hospital. The whole of society will benefit from this plan. From an education perspective, new facilities will be provided at primary, secondary and third levels. There will be improved road infrastructure in the country, although there is one project that is not in the plan, which disappoints me - the motorway from Limerick to Cork, which would have completed the loop and linked all of our cities. I hope there might be a change of heart and the project could be included in the plan. It would be very important for the mid-west and south of Ireland. Nevertheless, this is a good plan and, as I mentioned, most economists have welcomed it because they see the possibility of its completion. I have no doubt that the country will be much better off as a result of this. Jobs will be created in the construction phases of the plan. It is realistic, affordable and prioritises what is really needed in our road, rail, health, education and broadband infrastructures. It will make a difference to many communities across the island.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	664	Like previous speakers, I welcome the opportunity to respond to the debate on the capital development programme announced last week. It is a short window in which to speak, but in the main I hope to address the issues for which I have responsibility as Opposition spokesperson on the environment and, specifically, Irish Water and the housing elements. We welcome a development plan such as this, which seeks to prioritise capital investment in our infrastructure for the next five years. One must acknowledge the fact that we are able to do so again and that the Government has completed the necessary one third of the overall adjustment required to stabilise our finances. In parallel to that, a strong dollar and sterling, along with the stabilisation of our wage structure and costs, have assisted our exports and would have helped job creation. Nevertheless, people say on a regular basis that they do not feel or see the recovery and that it appears to be centred in Dublin and the east coast. That is very obvious to many of us, and there should have been a concerted effort in this plan to address that imbalance. I am not sure that has happened. A point was made relating to education. It is amazing that when an election is being spoken about, this Government talks about the great restraint it has shown and the lessons it has learned from the past, yet we see a headline with a quote attributed to the Minister for Finance promising iPads for all school children throughout the country. That is in a time when pupil-teacher ratios need to be adjusted and pressure is being exerted on special needs assistants, capitation grants and small rural schools with two, three or four teachers. There are many issues that must be addressed in education before we go down the road of keeping children's heads in screens all day long. There is much more to education than that, although it is necessary to have broadband and communications support available for education and homes. As previous speakers have indicated, it is an aspect of life that is similar to many other services, and it is only right and proper that there should be a greater effort to make broadband available throughout the country and in rural areas in particular. I hope that pushing this out to 2020 will not be a cop-out and there can be more of a targeted effort to address that imbalance. I have questions relating to my area of responsibility, as I mentioned. Irish Water is mentioned within the capital development plan, with €3.8 billion to €4 billion spent in the area over the next seven years, inclusive of this year. Today, Irish Water issued a plan for the next seven years to 2021, inclusive of this year, in which it indicates that €5.5 billion will be spent. As is usual with every announcement emanating from Irish Water, or from the Government on behalf of or relating to Irish Water, I am puzzled but not surprised. The EUROSTAT tests demonstrated that the model created by the Government, along with the methods behind it, have not stacked up. As much as the Government wanted this off-balance-sheet, it remains firmly on the balance sheet. The costs associated with Irish Water remain firmly in the hands of the taxpayer. There is a hole in the figures, with up to €1.7 billion unaccounted for. This year, for example, €75 million is to be paid in water grants, and there will be €20 million in administration costs and another €40 million for metering. There will be a loss this year, but Irish Water indicated today that it will have €2 billion in residential charge income over the next six years. It is just not possible. The company's figures are based on an 80% compliance rate, but even with that rate it is not possible. Irish Water intends to borrow based on the income stream it has, meaning it will pay far in excess of what the Government and the National Treasury Management Agency are borrowing. The only way to close the gap is to increase residential water charges. It is high time somebody came clean on this sorry mess or eventually realised that the company is going nowhere, so the exercise needs to be brought to a halt and started again. Irish Water will continue to throw good money after bad at the expense of the taxpayer. Despite what we hear in today's spin, less is being spent on the maintenance and servicing of our network this year than was spent in the years of the previous Government. Irish Water would have us believe that it will spend €660 million per year over the next six years, based on figures that do not stack up and without acknowledging administration and salary costs and commitments in various contracts. The company will continue to spend less than the amount spent by the previous Administration under a different regime. This is against a backdrop of an assumption that 1,200 workers will be taken out of Irish Water. Those workers will be taken from the pool of people who were doing the work even before Irish Water came into being. The consultants and those in the higher tiers of management will remain, along with associated bonuses. The company made a so-called commitment to former local authority staff with the service level agreement to 2025, but they are now to be discarded. It is time somebody came clean about this, and perhaps this debate offers an opportunity for the Government to tell us about the gap in the figures and how Irish Water intends to fill it.From my perspective, the Government intends to fill it from people's pockets, whether in the form of general taxation, extra taxation, increased water charges or increased cost to the taxpayer because of the high interest rates they are paying on their borrowings. The other point I want to make about housing is that we have had three separate announcements of the housing construction programme: last November, last March and again last week, down in Heuston Station. They have not built three houses in my county, but they have had three launches of this massive development programme. Then they tagged on another €400 million and put an extra year on it. That is because the commitments they made last November for this year have not been met and the money has not been spent, so it is easy to throw it on the back of this plan. The Government has not delivered on any commitment in respect of the emergency in the housing sector. There has been talk of emergency legislation to fast-track planning in respect of any proposals that are brought forward to meet the current emergency. Another week has gone by with no legislation. The Whips have been meeting and there is no talk of any legislation next week. One begins to wonder whether the Government is going to rush to the country because it cannot meet some of the commitments it has made in recent weeks and is afraid of being exposed on that. Another issue, as I said in the course of debate on this issue in recent weeks, is vacant units and the myth that the Minister and the Taoiseach created by saying money is not an issue in respect of the funding required to put them back in use. That has been contradicted fervently by officials I have spoken to in local authorities. I will use this opportunity to place that contradiction on the record and will ask some member of Government to respond accordingly. The Government has also rubbished figures that have emanated from local authorities in respect of the actual numbers on the waiting list and the number of vacant units throughout the country. To continually ballyrag those people is not addressing the issue at hand, which is what people want. They want to hear the issues at hand acknowledged, appreciated and addressed in real and meaningful ways. That is the immediacy of the problem we find there and into the short and long term, as provided for in this capital spending plan.

Cúig nóiméad an duine.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	666	I will give Deputy McLoughlin three minutes. Like previous speakers, I welcome Building on Recovery: Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2016-2021. As the Minister said, the Government is revising upwards its capital expenditure commitment for the remainder of the decade, and this capital report presents a new €42 billion multi-annual capital investment programme. Over the period 2016 to 2021, the planned investments will cement economic recovery and help to lay the foundations for continued growth and broad-based prosperity for the next decade and beyond. It is very important to have a clear-cut plan, as we now have. I would like to point out some elements of this plan, including the commitment in the plan of €7.5 million for the Kerry sports academy, which is planned for the Institute of Technology in Tralee. Deputy Spring has a similar interest in this project. The Institute of Technology in Tralee is a key driver of economic and social development for County Kerry. It was established in 1977, approved by the then Fine Gael Minister for education, Peter Barry. It has more than 3,000 full-time students, employs 350 staff and provides a financial contribution of about €60 million to the local authority. In March 2014 the institute established a foundation to assist with fundraising for future developments, with the priority project being the Kerry sports academy. The director of the fundraising initiative was a former colleague of mine, Ogie Moran. We played together for a number of years. He has shown tremendous leadership in ensuring that this project will go ahead. The foundation also comprises people such as Dick Spring, the former Minister for Foreign Affairs; Stan McCarthy, CEO of the Kerry Group; Pat O'Leary of Liebherr Container Cranes; Mícheál Ó Muircheartaigh; Oliver Murphy; and Bríd McElligott. It is a very powerful group of people. As we know, the institute has an esteemed international reputation for leadership in inclusion and adapted physical activity and is the only higher education provider globally to be awarded a UNESCO chair. This is testimony to the excellence of the institute's work in including people with disabilities in physical education, sport fitness and recreation. The sports academy is the next capital project to be undertaken under the institute's master development plan. It will allow sportspersons, able and disabled, to enjoy, prepare and compete to the highest standards. The foundation is confident, now that it has been granted 50% funding for the project, that it will be able to raise the remainder of the funds. To date, it has secured about €5 million, of which €1 million is from the institute, €1 million from the GAA, €1 million from the J.P. McManus Benevolent Fund, €1 million from private donations and €650,000 from Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann. Hopefully this project will start in the very near future, and but for this programme it would not have got off the ground. The other project to which I would like to refer briefly is the N22 and its importance to both Kerry and Cork, particularly south Kerry. The business and tourist communities in the south west are very dependent on it for connectivity with Cork and beyond. The Ballyvourney to Macroom section of the N22 is in very poor condition, and is widely recognised as needing immediate improvement. The National Roads Authority and Cork County Council have recognised this, and have successfully taken an improvement scheme through An Bord Pleanála, as well as other measures. I hope, now that it is included in the capital investment programme, that work will commence as soon as possible. All the necessary statutory approvals are in place, compulsory purchase orders have been put on the land, and advance work such as archaeology has been carried out. This could readily be developed under a public private partnership, for example, because it is shovel-ready and would not require any great level of up-front State funding. Before I hand over to Deputy McLoughlin, I must mention that there is a commitment of €275 million for national broadband roll-out. One of the major disadvantages in County Kerry is the absence of high-quality broadband. There is broadband available, but it does not have the same speed and bandwidth as Dublin and other centres of population. We are finding it increasingly difficult to attract industry to Kerry because of the lack of high-quality broadband. It is something we have to improve. Eir has proposals, as does Vodafone with SIRO, but we need to see action as soon as possible. With this provision and the new national broadband programme, I hope it will be rolled out. There is also €430 million in flood risk management. I was very disappointed that the Cashen River was not included, because the Minister has visited it and seen for himself how the system has broken down there. Because of silting, the measures put in place in the early 1950s are no longer effective, resulting in large-scale flooding, with thousands of acres of land being flooded and over 600 homes threatened. I hope this river can be included in the programme in the future.
#TonyMcLoughlin	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-party	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-dob	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	667	I wish to begin by welcoming the Government's new capital investment plan which will ensure that over €27 billion will be spent on vital State infrastructure, including schools, hospitals and roads between 2016 and 2021. This new capital investment plan is affordable and sensible and it is consistent with the Government's plan to eliminate borrowing by 2018. As well as providing improved State infrastructure, the plan will also promote regional economic growth, supporting 45,000 construction jobs over the lifetime of the plan. It is clear to see that the economic decisions taken by this Government have brought us to an important time in our national recovery. We are now, once again, the fastest growing economy in Europe and we are creating over 1,300 new jobs a week. This new capital plan will help to spread this recovery around the country where we know many families have yet to feel its effects. In particular, I am delighted that the provision of €102 million in funding for the upgrade of the N4 in County Sligo and also that the construction of a new €20 million bridge over the Garavogue River in Sligo Town have been included in the plan. When I spoke with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Donohoe, about these two vital projects, I impressed upon them the urgent need to secure funding for them in this plan. I advised them both that these were two vital components of the future economic development of County Sligo. The Acting Chairman, Deputy Twomey, may be aware that the Collooney-to-Castlebaldwin section of the N4 is one of the most deadly strips of road in the country, with 30 tragic fatalities occurring on this section of road over the past two decades. This particular road had been neglected time and again under consecutive Fianna Fáil Governments over the past 20 years. Therefore, I am delighted that despite the constraints on the national finances at present, this Fine Gael-led Government has now delivered funding for this vital piece of road infrastructure to the people of Sligo. The N4 upgrade will be a significant boost to County Sligo and the wider north-west region. Full planning permission has already been secured for the N4 extension and with the funding now in place, plans to build it can proceed immediately. Infrastructure developments such as the N4 will be crucial in attracting inward investment to the region, not to mention increased tourists visiting the county. I reiterate these two particular projects contained in this plan are crucial for the ongoing drive to create jobs in County Sligo. We are making significant progress in fixing our local economy and attracting investment to Sligo at present. The fact that Sligo will receive two of the biggest road infrastructure projects in this plan will benefit these attempts and I look forward to the funding being provided.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	668	I wish to share time with Deputy Ó Caoláin. I will touch on the education aspect, as that is my own portfolio. I will acknowledge that there is significant funding going in between now and 2021 of €3.8 billion. Unfortunately, that will only be able to match the growth in demographics. We will cater for the peak in students which are coming on line. At primary school, we are looking at a peak in 2018 and for post-primary, I think it is 2020. Yesterday when I discussed this issue with the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, I said we need to be looking at education in longer planning terms than merely five and six-year capital programmes. The reason is because everything we are putting into the capital programme currently for education, as I stated, is only meeting the demographics. We have one of the highest pupil-teacher ratios, PTRs, in Europe. All of the evidence would suggest that the smaller the classrooms, the better the educational outcomes and something we need to strive for as a policy is to reduce the PTR, particularly at primary level, and at post-primary level. One of the issues, which the Minister for Education and Skills admitted yesterday, is if we were to plan to reduce the PTR, the Department does not know how many additional spaces it would need and it cannot plan for that eventuality. If one reduces the PTR, coupled with increased demographics, capacity will become an issue. What the Minister is doing in the education capital programme is only standing still. We are only meeting the rise in the number of places that will be demanded. The other area I want to touch on - I only have two minutes - is the flood defences for Cork. I very much welcome the fact that we will see the flood defences for Cork city, particularly Blackpool, commence in 2016 - that is the aim - and the commencing of the phased construction of the flood defences in Cork city in 2017. I am a little concerned at the amount of capital funding we are allocating for it. Much discussion has taken place between the Department, the OPW and Cork City Council and Cork County Council in relation to what is needed as part of the flood defences in Cork. Some of the conservative estimates suggest it will cost between €100 million to €115 million, and yet we are only allocating in total, between now and 2021, €430 million. We are allocating €45 million next year and €45 million the following year, and that is to cover all of the State. Therefore, I have some concerns that we will not have enough funding in place to carry out the necessary works. Having said that, the scheme will take four to five years to complete for Cork city. However, the pressing issue in Cork is really the area of Blackpool, which has flooded several times. There is very little work needed to be done on it. It is in relation to one particular culvert, which needs to be dug up and replaced. That design, I believe, is going to tender shortly. The last area I will touch on is the housing capital budget, which we all have recognised is a significant issue. I am aware that the funds from the sale of Bord Gáis Éireann of in the region of €500 million will be earmarked for voluntary housing schemes but the actual capital investment in housing will not be enough to meet the demand.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	669	The recent announcement by the Government of its capital spending plan amounts to very little, and is extremely unambitious. It is alarming to note that in 2020, even with this plan, we will still have the second lowest capital spend per GDP in Europe. As the Sinn Féin spokesperson on health, I found the particular announcement by the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, and the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, of a 2016-21 health capital allocation of €3.061 billion to be utterly farcical. Much of what is involved has already been signalled, if not already committed to, and there is a relatively small additional sum of €568 million. I noted with interest some trends in capital spending on health over the past number of years and the expected capital spend for the years ahead. The figures I found were: €598 million in 2008, €366 million in 2010, €414 million committed for 2016 and €600 million in 2021. This means that even in nominal terms the spending on the health capital budget will only be the same in 2021 as it was in 2008, 13 years earlier. In real terms, taking inflation into account and adjusted per capita, this represents a significant cut over these years, and over all the years in between, courtesy of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour. According to CSO figures, the population will have grown by 8.3% over that time and if one also assumes average annual inflation of 1.5%, then the real per capita cut to the health capital budget is exactly one third.A litany of events have shown how disorganised our health service is as a result of the Government's policy. Fine Gael and Labour have failed those in the hospital system and this announcement will do little to alleviate the serious problems that exist. The Government is ever quick to use public money to buy a headline and pretend it is solving a problem. This so-called plan contains no mention of additional capacity in the Government's stated intent to "replace, upgrade and refurbish" community based nursing units for older people and accommodation for people with disabilities. Emergency department services have been at crisis point for some time, as regularly highlighted by the trolley watch survey carried out by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO. The trolley crisis is not just an emergency department crisis but a symptom of the malaise that is endemic across the wider health system. It is primarily due to a lack of capacity resulting from the chronic failure by the Government to provide adequate funding to the public health system and there is no reference in this plan to addressing this serious problem. Our health emergency is a crisis of unequal access to a health system which has an overall capacity far short of what is needed. Demand will increase year on year. From the older person languishing on a hospital trolley in an overcrowded accident and emergency department to the young child waiting two years for speech and language therapy, the root problem is undercapacity. The Minister needs to cut out the bluff and secure funds to get patients off lists and into procedures that can both save and enrich lives.
#DominicHannigan	unknown-#DominicHannigan-party	unknown-#DominicHannigan-dob	unknown-#DominicHannigan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	670	I welcome the capital investment plan of €27 billion over the coming years. The plan is possible thanks to the work the Government has done to get the country back on track. Not many years ago, members of the Opposition were crying that the troika should take away its money. Had we done it, we would have no money today to invest in the plan. For people to sit here and criticise the plan because it does not go far enough, after they wanted to tell the troika to go away with its money, is laughable. The plan involves €5 billion every year for the next six years, which equates to approximately €1,000 for every man woman and child for every year of the life of the plan. It is a significant investment which will create many jobs in various sectors which will improve performance across every sector of Irish society, including education, broadband, housing, health and transport. I will focus on transport in my short contribution. I welcome many of the schemes that will get the go-ahead, such as the Laytown to Bettystown link road which as a councillor I pushed for many years. I am glad to see it is in the plan. I am also glad to see the commitment to improved North-South links. We are all aware of the importance of the A5 road. It is also important that the Slane bypass is included, given that the N2 is a very important North-South route. The Slane bypass has been proposed for many decades. It almost came to fruition a number of years ago, but did not get through the planning process. I am glad to see there is a commitment to it. It is needed in terms of road safety and congestion in Slane village. Now that the money is there, the council will come forward and push for a new application to be made so this important piece of infrastructure can be put in place as soon as possible. I am also glad to see the focus in the plan on cost-benefit analysis. It is very important that we get value for money from our €27 billion. In a previous role, I was an investment appraisal manager on capital expenditure schemes, and I know how important it is that we rigorously examine the investment. I am glad to see the new code proposes that appraisals will be carried out on schemes of €20 million in value as opposed to €30 million. I am also glad the Government will be asked to approve any expenditure on schemes over €100 million as opposed to over €250 million. It will give confidence to the many people who are concerned about some of the projects, such as the €2.4 billion metro north scheme. I am concerned, given that insufficient work has been done on the appraisal of the metro north scheme. The Fingal-North Dublin Transport Study - Stage One Appraisal Study, done in November 2014, ten months ago, states on page 79, "Modelling of passenger demand was not feasible at this preliminary appraisal stage". However, conclusions and choices are made on the basis of a rodentine analysis. While I am very concerned about the analysis to date on metro north, I am glad to see that in this plan there will be continuous analysis of the schemes. I am glad to see the plan states that if schemes further down the road do not satisfy cost-benefit analyses, they will be scrapped and the money will be invested elsewhere. The vital thing is that anything we do with this public money gives a decent return to the Irish taxpayer. If the money is better spent elsewhere, in education, broadband or health, we need to ensure it is targeted at the sectors that give the best value for money. I support the plan. I am particularly glad to see the emphasis on effectiveness of spend and the cost-benefit analysis that will be required for smaller schemes. I have no doubt the investment will lead to many new jobs and improved performance across every sector of society.
#ArthurSpring	unknown-#ArthurSpring-party	unknown-#ArthurSpring-dob	unknown-#ArthurSpring-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	671	I welcome the fact the Minister is here. Austerity is finished and prosperity is becoming the new word in budgeting, projections and planning. I take issue with some of the comments, particularly from the Opposition benches. I welcome the fact that we have statements around the capital plan. On the day the Government announced a prudent and purposeful investment of €27 billion to better the State for the people, with no Bertie bowls or follies, the three Opposition party leaders, in their wisdom, could not even bring themselves to discuss it during Leaders' Questions. The Government is to invest €27 billion plus an additional €15 billion, which brings it up to €42 billion. This is an unimaginable feat for a Government that, four and a half years ago, faced into a wind that told us we were the fastest contracting economy in Europe. We are now the fastest growing economy not just in Europe but in the developed world, a far cry from where we started. I will focus on what has been achieved in my area. I thank the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, for being prudent and purposeful in every step he has taken to ensure that issues, topics and plans that were not for the betterment of society have not made it into the plan. The amount of money that will be spent will be large but will be spread across the regions. In my area I thank my fellow Kerryman, Deputy Brendan Griffin, for help around some of the projects. He is an ardent supporter of the Macroom bypass. I also thank my Fine Gael colleague in Cork, Deputy Michael Creed, who also placed a particular emphasis on it. While many would say the Kerry people built the Cork and Kerry mountains to keep the Cork people out, we are building a road to bring them in and out now so that we can get a few tourists from it.I would like to acknowledge that County Kerry has not enjoyed the uplift experienced in counties like Dublin, Galway and Cork in areas like tourism, energy, engineering, agribusiness and micro-enterprises. We need improvements in road and broadband infrastructure. As my colleague, Deputy Hannigan, has mentioned, some €275 million is to be spent on broadband. As she is responsible for rural affairs, I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Ann Phelan, will agree it is wonderful that we will be able to conduct business in a modern fashion as a result of this development. Would she believe it is being done as we speak, at the back of the house we are renting? Our electricity was turned off today for the purposes of putting the cables through. This shows that the plan is being put into action. We have built over 300 schools during our time in government. The growth in our population is greater than that of any other country in Europe. This means we have to build new schools so that children will be able to find schools. This is a core principle of the Labour Party. It is one that we are very happy to be involved in as we go forward. It is correct to plan for what needs to be done over the next five years to develop hospitals, roads and sports capital projects. It is not all about the simplistic infrastructure parts - it is also about people having a standard of life and enjoying football, rugby and hurling clubs and everything that goes with such activities. I wish to mention the extension of the Institute of Technology, Tralee, a project on which I have worked exceptionally hard. I thank the president of the college and his staff who assisted with this project, particularly Dr. Oliver Murphy, Bríd McElligott and Ogie Moran. Over a number of meetings in recent years, they helped me to convey to the Minister, Deputy Howlin, the importance of this facility, which will facilitate the provision of the only UNESCO chair for disabilities in the country. In addition, it will provide a home for CARA in County Kerry and the centre of excellence of Kerry GAA. It will also be a place where Irish culture can be celebrated on Saturday mornings, when 300 or 400 people will be able to come through the Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann facility. We were not in a position to fund projects of this nature over the past number of years, but we are able to do so now. The Minister of State, Deputy Ann Phelan, will hear me waxing lyrical forever and a day about the development of simple infrastructure like cycle ways as part of the development of a better standard of living. Deputies will have heard me talking about the Tralee to Fenit route, which I expect to see developed under this plan. I assume the local authority will be in a position to accept any money that is offered for these purposes on this occasion, unlike the last time it was offered. That will enable this project to be developed for the betterment of everybody who favours projects of this nature. I am sorry I am short on time. There is a great deal in this €42 billion plan. As a House, we should welcome this good news. It is not unambitious; it is prudent and purposeful.

#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	673	It is hardly worth my while speaking for two minutes. I will take this opportunity to say that I take umbrage with some of what has been said by backbenchers on the Government side. I remind them that €30 billion was taken out of this economy and out of people's pockets. That is why we are in a position where things have turned around. After every recession we move into a boom, and after every boom we move into a recession. The role of the Government is to ensure the most vulnerable people are protected regardless of what is happening. The only point I want to make on the capital spending plan is that we have not seen any increase to deal with the humanitarian crisis in housing. It is absolutely incredible that no extra money has been provided. It is very clear that just one in four of the houses that are planned to be built will be social housing. It is evident that 75% of housing will be built by private investors. As a result, I do not think we will see the housing that is needed. We need 130,000 social houses over the next two or three years to try to deal with this issue. In this context, I am reminded of a leaflet that was circulated by Deputy Eric Byrne when he was a member of Dublin City Council. It relates to the crisis that was being faced in the 2008-09 period as we came out of the boom. I agree that there was a crisis at that time. The leaflet mentioned that many people were fortunate enough to own their own homes in Dublin and noted that Deputy Byrne's motion declaring a housing emergency was an attempt to shock the Government into taking action. He has certainly not shocked his own party into taking action to deal with the humanitarian crisis we are now facing. It is a shame that this capital programme is not even attempting to deal with this issue, which is being faced by many people.

#AnnPhelan	unknown-#AnnPhelan-party	unknown-#AnnPhelan-dob	unknown-#AnnPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	677	One of the reasons we are in this crisis is the decision of the Fianna Fáil-Green Party Administration to take responsibility for building away from local authorities. When I was a member of Kilkenny County Council, I spoke out against this at length. My colleagues and I wanted to stop all of the expertise from being taken away from the county councils. We foretold that this would happen if this responsibility was taken from the county councils. We talked about rent regulation. Some of our Fianna Fáil colleagues across the council chamber often said we were anti-development. We called for regulation of the tax incentives for hotels that were being built during the boom and an examination of the effect the new hotels would have on the existing industry. They had an effect on the existing industry. When the crash came, we all suffered. This capital programme should be considered by comparison with what we were at in 2011. Nobody would have believed at that time that we could deliver this programme four and a half years later. I think this capital programme is very much to be welcomed. If people are mealy-mouthed about it, that is entirely their opinion. I think it is a fantastic programme. I suggest that in time, it will be seen as a great and well-delivered programme. As my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, has said, it is a prudent capital programme. Despite the worst economic downturn in the history of the State, we have provided for a huge schools building programme. I think this Government has done a great job. I am looking forward to living in Ireland in the future and availing of all the projects that are contained in this capital programme.

Bíonn an díospóireacht seo againn go rialta sa Teach seo anois, go háirithe ó thaobh an ráta de, ach tá an rún atá os comhair an Tí níos leithne ná seo agus sílim gur rún iontach maith é agus go ndéanann sé ciall. I welcome the debate on this matter and thank the Technical Group for tabling the motion. Although I would not agree with every part of it, it is a good motion and, unlike the Government's delusional amendment, it actually deals with the real world and Ireland's place in it. My party believes it is time for an honest debate on corporation tax in this State. In the past, when I even mentioned the name of a particular company - Apple - I was literally shouted down by Fine Gael Deputies, including by the current Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Dara Murphy. That is the level of maturity this Government has shown and has brought to the debate about our corporation tax regime. That is not good enough. Unfortunately, I see no signs of any progress in the amendment before us. When I first suggested that we move to close the loophole that allowed some companies to be stateless, I was told it could not be done. I produced legislation but was informed it could not be enacted. Months later it was done. In January 2013, when I challenged the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, on the double Irish - one of the many times that I challenged him on it - he told this House:The problem with the so-called "double Irish"
from Ireland's point of view is that it has that name. People think that something we do here gives rise to it. That is not the case. It arises from tax codes elsewhere and the way in which the USA regards certain arrangements. We do not operate any kind of tax haven.That is what the Minister had to say in 2013 but a year later the double Irish was closed down. Clearly, it was not just about the way that the USA regards certain arrangements. We always had the ability to close down the double Irish but the Government did not want to do so. Unlike with the closing down of other tax loopholes, however, companies have been given five years to stop using the double Irish. Compare the treatment for major multinational companies, some with wealth in excess of the wealth of this State, with that of other taxpayers who have been told overnight that they have lost their benefits, supports or tax credits as a result of decisions of this Government on budget day. This is a Government that had to be dragged, kicking and screaming and under international pressure, to change any of our systems. On my request, the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform set up a sub­committee to examine the corporation tax issue and the very low rates that some multinational companies were paying to the State. It seems the Government members appointed to that sub-committee were given a mandate to shut down any discussion on the facts of Ireland's corporation tax regime. Despite the fact that companies which were tax resident in Ireland, particularly Apple, were willingly going before the United States Congress and saying that they had a sweetheart deal - created back in the 1980s - with the tax authorities here, members of the finance committee were unwilling to ask any of the multinational corporations to even come in and have a chat. The Government says it is leading the way but that is a ridiculous statement. The Government has been dragged some of the way and is now claiming that it was a willing traveller on the road. My party supports the current rate of corporation tax but we think it should be a meaningful rate. We do not pretend to ourselves that every company pays it in full. Some do not and pretending that they do is simply foolish. This is about ensuring that profitable companies, some of them the most profitable in the world, pay the appropriate tax at 12.5%. Reading the Government amendment, one would think that this country's reputation as a fair place to do business was not under a shadow. That shadow did not begin under this Government but it seems content to position the country under it for as long as possible. The world is changing, thank God, and is moving with small steps towards a more transparent tax environment. When Deputies in this House raise issues about the fairness of our system, however, they are shouted down. Sinn Féin wants Ireland to compete for foreign direct investment and to benefit from it. The Minister for Finance spoken about the three Rs - rate, reputation and regime. Our rate is not in question and although it does not specifically call for it, I would not support the implication in the motion before us tonight that the rate must increase. Indeed, for many the rate is a red herring. Companies are not paying the full rate because of the different ways they can move or not declare profits and that is the problem. When it comes to the other two Rs, this State has a problem. Our regime has been probed in the USA, Australia and Britain and is now under serious scrutiny by the EU Commission. The shadow in this regard brings our reputation into question too. The Minister points to the changes made under this Government. There have been changes but all of them were made under serious pressure and done in a half-hearted manner. I have referenced a number of them already. Now the Government is introducing the mother of all tax avoidance measures, the knowledge box, thus backtracking on all of the changes that have happened. Knowledge boxes that were introduced in other jurisdictions are currently being examined, questioned and probed by other authorities.  I welcome the OECD report and action plan. I hope there are positive legislative changes in the Finance Bill which will make our system fairer and more transparent. I hope the needs of the developing world are kept central to the international work on this project. I have heard it thrown around in this State by people who know better that the BEPS project is about jealous countries attacking Ireland. That is absurd and I hope the Minister can put on record his view on that matter. As we speak it is understood that the EU Commission is finalising its investigation into a potentially illegal tax arrangement between Apple and this State. That is an incredibly serious allegation. When this investigation was first announced the Minister, with very little credibility, played it down as routine and part of a wider EU investigation but that was never the case. This was always a serious, thorough and specific examination of Ireland's tax dealings. We have had spin and smoke and mirrors but when the final decision is taken, it will be in black and white. The investigation will determine whether this State acted to undermine its own tax base and to facilitate tax avoidance for a specific company. If it finds that Apple avoided taxes unfairly, normally that money would be returned to the State. That is what the law states. However, the Minister for Finance has repeatedly told me he does not want this money. He wants Apple to keep it. This must be a first. I have just come from a meeting of the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform which examined the powers Revenue has to make people who owe tax pay what is due. Yet, when it comes to huge amounts potentially due to the Irish people as a result of this case, we are told that the Government does not want it. That is a crazy position. In the year to date, an additional €1.2 billion has been collected in corporation tax - an increase of 45%. This did not happen because our corporations have recorded 45% increases in profits but because the squeeze is starting to come on them and they are being forced to pay what they should have been paying for years. We now have a hugely indebted country that does not want debt relief and a State that does not want the tax potentially due to it from a company which made massive profits while operating here, a company that has more wealth than the State itself. Meanwhile, the Government cannot find €4 million for the residents at Longboat Quay or for housing for the homeless.  My party is all for a real, mature debate on our corporation tax regime and reputation. We are in favour of an all-Ireland corporation tax rate and want Ireland to be a responsible member of the international community with no cloud hanging over our tax reputation.We are in favour of foreign direct investment and domestic indigenous enterprise and we support the right of the sovereign state to set its tax rate. Nobody understands the importance of economic sovereignty better than my party. Sinn Féin is happy to support the motion, notwithstanding the reservations I have outlined. To the Government, I say it is time to grow up, face this issue head on and forget about schemes based on a nod and a wink. It is time to start building a real industrial policy that is not based on unsustainable loopholes.

Ireland may be an island but it is part of the global economy. Sinn Féin in Northern Ireland is trying to compete with the South in attracting foreign direct investment. While certain members of the Opposition are ignorant of the facts, that is not the case for Deputy Doherty, because he is well aware that Ireland has fully participated in the OECD's BEPS project for some years. He also knows the Government is committed to addressing these issues but that Ireland is not in a position to jump alone. Deputy Doherty may smile at that comment but he knows it to be true. Some aspects of the motion will bring tears of joy to the eyes of officials in Berlin, London and Paris who would love Ireland to be shut down as a location for foreign direct investment, FDI. A unilateral decision to pursue a certain policy that salves the conscience of Deputy Doherty and other Opposition Deputies would end the contribution FDI companies make to the economy. Perhaps his party colleague, Deputy Jonathan O'Brien, would be happy to have the 4,000 workers employed by Apple in Cork lose their jobs in order that he can have a clear conscience when discussing these issues. Perhaps other members of the Opposition would like Intel to close down and move elsewhere, having invested €25 billion in Ireland in the past 20 years. If that is their policy, it is a crazy one.  BEPS will work because it seeks to have all countries move together to eliminate aggressive taxation avoidance. I give Deputy Pearse Doherty credit for no longer confusing the corporation tax rate of 12.5% with the Government's stated policy of eliminating aggressive tax avoidance schemes. That is a step in the right direction from a Deputy who is adept at engaging in spin and taking a selective approach in his contributions. He knows damn well that aggressive tax avoidance cannot be addressed comprehensively unless all countries move together. It was for this reason that the OECD was mandated to examine the issue, and it has worked on BEPS for the past four years. The 15 steps the organisation calls on all countries to take were agreed only last week. Ireland has been actively involved in making the BEPS process work. The Government strongly believes that foreign direct investment has a major role to play in the economy. Not all of the 100,000 jobs that depend on FDI are senior executive positions. Many are held by people providing cleaning, building, transportation, electrical and other services to foreign companies located here. These companies are vital to the economy and very important for growth. It is disingenuous of Deputies to diss foreign direct investment as something we can forego or do not want and blacken the names of specific companies. Deputy Doherty referred to a European Commission investigation into a certain company operating here. As he is aware, Commission investigations into exactly the same types of issue are under way in many other member states. The issues involved are complex. I can barely understand the concept of transfer pricing, for example, but perhaps Deputy Doherty is more of an expert on it than I am. In light of my discussions on BEPS with the OECD in recent years, I accept that transfer pricing can give rise to certain issues. Perhaps I, too, should take a simplistic approach and try to boil this issue down to "us and them" or other countries getting away with things we are unable to do. That is silly talk, however, and I expect more from Deputy Doherty, albeit not from his Opposition colleagues in the Technical Group whose sole argument does not make any sense. Does Deputy Boyd Barrett want Google, Facebook and companies in the International Financial Services Centre to close down with the loss of many jobs? While Google may not be located in his constituency, some of his constituents either work in multinational companies or provide services to them. Does he want them all to leave the country to salve his conscience?

When I decided to seek election to Dáil Eireann in 2013, the country was in a very difficult position, much different from the position it is in now. However, I had confidence in what the Taoiseach, his Ministers and the Government were trying to do. It has been exactly 30 months since the people of County Meath elected me. At the behest of the Opposition, the Dáil does not discuss as often as it should the economy or issues relating to employment for young people or, for that matter, persons of all ages. The two main Opposition parties do not have any credibility on the economy and have, therefore, remained silent on the matter for the most part. The Fianna Fáil Party's economic gambling has caused chaos in people's lives for years. Many people, including friends of mine, have emigrated to the United Kingdom, Australia, the United States and other countries. Sinn Féin's approach has played out in Greece with disastrous consequences for ordinary people. On the other hand, the Government's response to the crisis has worked. We have partnered constructively with many other European Union member states and we are now providing a stable business, employment and investment environment. I compliment the Technical Group on tabling the motion because it is important to discuss national economic policy in the national Parliament. While I do not agree with the left-wing view of the world or share the Technical Group's hatred of multinational employers, I acknowledge that its members have sufficient confidence in their economic policies to table and debate an economic motion in the Dáil. In contrast, the other two main Opposition Parties do not have any confidence in their economic policies.  The motion is very hostile to multinational investment. It accuses the larger foreign direct investment companies and employers of taking advantage of ordinary people in Ireland and across the world and Fine Gael and the Labour Party of encouraging such predator-like behaviour. We must live in the real world. The people I represent in County Meath and those who are seeking employment or wish to retain their jobs or secure better employment also live in the real world and know that countries compete with each other to secure multinational foreign direct investment. The OECD has stated that taxation is at the core of countries' sovereignty and each country is free to design its corporate tax system as is chooses, including by charging the rate it chooses. Until such time as the global model changes and countries work together, it is the duty of the Government of this small island to attract as much employment as possible.  Ireland has only recently emerged from a very difficult economic period and few people have not been affected by the economic downturn. Unemployment is one of the main contributors to inequality, poverty and social discord. When the Government came to power in 2011, more than 420,000 people were unemployed and tens of thousands of others were emigrating, with many more facing the prospect of emigration. This Government had to make tough decisions and these decisions are starting to deliver change. We are moving in the right direction in terms of employment. One of the fastest ways to bring a country out of poverty is to create employment and, more important, to create an environment in which employment can grow. The reason many of my generation in County Meath did not have to emigrate in recent years was that we had companies such as Intel in Leixlip, Alltech in Dunboyne, which employs more than 200 people, and Kingspan in Kingscourt, which employs several hundred people. The responsible and realistic corporation taxation policy pursued by the Government has been a key factor in attracting new companies to County Meath in recent years. These include MDS Global Technologies and SWG, two new companies which will provide 50 jobs at the Kells Enterprise and Technology Centre, and Facebook, which will develop a data centre at Clonee providing 115 jobs. These employment opportunities for people in County Meath would not have been achieved if the Government's responsible investment strategy had been substituted with the policies being proposed by the Opposition. I will close with a point related to rural Ireland and multinational business. Every multinational company in the world is now practising what is known as telecommuting or working from home. This suits companies because hiring remote workers opens the talent pool for companies that would otherwise be confined to hiring people living in the immediate vicinity. Telecommuting also limits absences and generates savings in areas such as office space and electricity and lunch bills.It suits employees who can avoid traffic and fuel costs while child care costs are reduced. However, working from home requires video chats, conference calls, VPN networks and wireless internet so that workers can constantly stay connected. The Government's generous taxation policy for multinational foreign direct investment proves that it is serious about attracting investment, but we must give our own workers the tools to work within that economic model. We really need to start focusing on improving broadband in rural areas in respect of providing employment for thousands of people in Meath and elsewhere in Ireland.
#PeterFitzpatrick	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-party	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-dob	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	684	I welcome the opportunity to take part in this evening's debate. Profit shifting is a global phenomenon and it will require a global approach to find a solution that is fair to everyone. The OECD this month published a range of detailed reports arising from its base erosion and profit shifting project. The overall aim of the project was to prevent double non-taxation which came about as a result of inequalities in international tax rules and also to better align the right to tax with real economic substance and activity on a country-by-country basis. As a Government, we have been supportive of the BEPS project which, it must be noted, aligns with our own tax strategy and we will now play an active part to ensure that the recommendations are implemented. Ireland relies heavily on foreign direct investment. Indeed, in my constituency of Louth, we have secured one in ten of all new jobs brought into Ireland by foreign direct investment. In Dundalk, 450 new jobs have been created by eBay, 400 new jobs in Paypal, 200 new jobs in National Pen, which is also looking to create an additional 60 permanent positions shortly, and 100 in Sales Sense. In mid-Louth, the rate of unemployment has fallen by over 30% while in Drogheda it has fallen by over 24% since March 2011. It has been proven time and time again that the only way out of poverty is full-time employment and making work pay. We must also deal in real facts. Ireland is below the EU average for people who are at risk of poverty. Ireland has the most progressive income tax system in the EU. The top 1% of income earners pay 24% of the total income tax and USC, the top 6% pay 44% and the top 24% pay 80% of all income tax and USC. Middle earners pay above the OECD average in tax but below average wage earners pay substantially less tax than the OECD average. The Opposition and indeed certain sections of the news media would have one believe that the tax revenue received from companies is way below what it should be, but if we deal in real facts we see that tax revenue from companies is almost the same as the OECD average. For example, we take in 8% of total tax revenue through corporation tax compared to the average of 9% in the OECD. The Department of Finance carried out a detailed study and best estimates indicate that the effective corporation tax rate in Ireland since 2003 has been 11%. If we compare that to France, which has an effective corporation tax rate of 7.4%, we can clearly see that Ireland is not abusing its position in relation to corporation tax. It is my firm belief that a low corporation tax rate attracts jobs as can be seen by the fact that IDA Ireland companies in Ireland currently employ over 174,000 people. Fine Gael's economic plan is delivering on its promises. We are replacing all the jobs lost during the recession and are working towards 6% unemployment. We are making work pay through a combination of cuts in tax, a higher minimum wage and more affordable child care. We are protecting Ireland from future shocks by ensuring that we have a surplus in the public finances and reducing the national debt. In this regard, the forthcoming general election will be a choice between stability and progress or instability and chaos. This country needs a Government that can be trusted to secure the recovery, not one that will put it at major risk. The real facts show that this Fine Gael-led Government has been fair in its approach to bringing the country's finances back under control. We have maintained the core welfare rates of jobseeker's benefit, carer's allowance and the State pension. We have removed 410,000 low-paid workers from the dreaded USC and plan to remove even more. We have cut income tax rates for everybody earning less than €70,000 and restored the minimum wage with plans to increase it. While I have concerns about some aspects of the issues raised here this evening, the publication of the final BEPS reports along with our commitment to implement the various findings will go a long way to closing any loopholes that exist. What is most important for us now is to secure the recovery that is currently taking place. The recovery is fragile and not enough people are feeling the benefits yet. We must ensure that everyone in all areas benefits from the recovery. We need political and economic stability. Only a Fine Gael-led Government can provide this.
#AineCollins	unknown-#AineCollins-party	unknown-#AineCollins-dob	unknown-#AineCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	685	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion. It is a very important motion albeit I disagree totally with what the Opposition is saying about corporation tax in Ireland. For an Opposition that believes solely in providing jobs and helping the less well off, I cannot understand why it would bring such a motion before the Chamber. The corporation tax rate of 12.5% is the most transparent in Europe. The effective rate of corporation tax in Ireland is approximately 10.5% and the difference between that the corporation tax of 12.5% is research and innovation, which are crucial for growth. We have been very fortunate in Ireland. I live in a town called Millstreet and we have a company there called Alps. It has been there since Apple originally came to Ireland and set up in Millstreet. Apple moved to Hollyhill in Cork where it now employs more than 3,000 people directly and in excess of 6,000 people indirectly. It is a major driver for the whole region. While people talk about multinationals being attached to cities and not rural Ireland, Alps in Millstreet employs 600 people, which is very significant for an area like ours. All those people live within a 15-mile radius of the town and their employment supports families. They have been very fortunate in that their company has been able to grow during the economic downturn. In fact, most of the multinationals were the backbone of the economic recovery. People forget that they are supporting small businesses because they have suppliers and outsource a great deal of their work. They are very important in their support of transport companies, data analytics and so much more, which we sometimes forget. While it is brave to come to the Chamber and say these big multinationals should pay more tax, people forget that companies like Alps and Apple pay PRSI on every employee, contribute to local community events and help develop skills among people who often go on to set up their own businesses. Those businesses become another growth path for entrepreneurship. Multinationals do not make a decision today to open in Ireland next week. They make that decision three years before it happens. What is important for them is consistency, stability and a guarantee in relation to the 12.5% rate. That is not the only reason they come to Ireland. They come here because of our skills, our English-speaking population and our extremely transparent regulatory system. Recently, we passed a new Companies Act 2014 which is accessible, easier to understand and makes it easy to do business here. Our regulatory system is very transparent as is our tax system. As someone who did a great deal of work in the tax system in a previous career as a tax consultant, I note that it is extremely complex. I commend the Revenue Commissioners who were probably the most progressive arm of the State in the innovation they brought forward in the 1990s. Their technology is superb and I have always found them fair, open and easy to deal with. The motion also refers to accounting standards in Ireland. The accounting and auditing standards in Ireland are the international standards. They are the same as they are around the world and they are very open and effective. The important thing is stability, which is one of the reasons people come here. They want to open and expand here. I am very fortunate in the constituency I represent that Ballincollig is doing extremely well. We have had announcements from eSentire and Asystec, a home-grown Irish data management company. The reason they are there is that we also have the likes of EMC, which is a multinational employing in excess of 3,500 people in the area. These companies affect people who live down the road from me in rural Ireland and who travel in and out. People forget how important that is to the wider economy. It is very easy to make statements like the Opposition has made tonight. One of the great things we have led with is the knowledge box, which is important in relation to stability. The knowledge box will be a great success and increase our tax take from multinationals.Again, it is down to stability and security, as a knowledge box provides people with a guarantee on how to grow and progress when they are planning a number of years ahead. I welcome the opportunity to contribute on this motion. The corporation tax rate is important to our economy, our people and jobs. Having a job, being respected and being able to grow and train are the most socially useful factors for anyone. Multinationals are superb at offering training.
#AnthonyLawlor	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-party	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-dob	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	686	Like others, I welcome the opportunity to contribute on this debate as it is important that we discuss the economy. We do not get many opportunities to do so. Before I was elected in 2011, I was given a brief tour around a major multinational in Leixlip, Intel. I was impressed by the staff, their youth and their quality. I asked one of the managers whether the staff represented the key reason for Intel staying in Leixlip. He told me that they were an important asset, Intel could avail of certain infrastructure in the area and it had the co-operation of the IDA and Kildare County Council, but that the key factor was the settled corporation tax rate of 12.5%. Intel provides 5,000 jobs. In the subsequent four years, it invested €5 billion in the Leixlip plant. If we did not have a 12.5% rate, would that €5 billion have been invested? Shortly after Deputy Enda Kenny became Taoiseach, he attended a meeting in Brussels. A key request made of him, particularly by the then French President, Mr. Sarkozy, was to increase our corporation tax rate because France believed that it gave us an unfair advantage. Little did we know at the time that, when analysed, France's effective tax rate was 7.5%. Our effective rate has proven to be close to 12.4%. If research and development activity is excluded, the rate is approximately 11%. From this perspective, Intel's €5 billion investment was based on the certainty that Ireland would maintain its 12.5% rate. People have referred to multinationals. Deputy Catherine Murphy was with me last week when we opened an Irish multinational's facility in Naas. One reason for its presence was the corporation tax rate. Other areas had battled for it and similarly offered incentives. I was delighted to be present for the facility's opening. Not only were 800 young, progressive people working at the facility, earning high salaries and making PRSI and income tax contributions, but the multinational announced a further 100 people to be employed in 2016 and the future relocation of some of its other facilities to Naas. This is encouraging and is based on our strong resolve to retain our 12.5% corporation tax rate. We must consider global corporations. I welcome the OECD's statement that countries that make profits in countries should pay taxes in those countries. I am referring specifically to African countries. Companies that take advantage of situations in Africa should pay their fair share of tax in African countries because it is important we help developing countries back onto their feet. We must prevent economic migrants from being forced to traverse the Mediterranean Sea in flimsy boats. It should be our objective to set up a tax regime in those countries in order that they might benefit from whatever profits are generated by companies there. While we are sending some assistance in this regard, for example, through the Revenue Commissioners, I hope we can send more to help our African brethren to get the best benefit from those companies that take advantage of their situations. With our knowledge of our effective tax rate of 12.5%, we can instruct African countries in particular in how best to collect taxes from multinationals. I support our strong stance on our corporation tax rate. It sends a clear signal of stability to foreign and Irish multinationals as well as to small Irish indigenous companies. If the Opposition were to get into power, the stability for which most companies look would disappear.

Many of us want a tax system that is fair and equitable. I thank and commend Deputies Maureen O'Sullivan, Joan Collins and Boyd Barrett on introducing this motion as we need to have an honest and open debate on tax justice and the requirement for a society built on social justice. Contrary to what some Deputies have claimed, we are not trying to drive out multinationals. A fair and transparent system must form part of that social justice plan. What is wrong with that? The motion proposes solutions. We need to be brave and consider some of these. Too many have suffered in the past five years, with the weakest often suffering the most. That is unacceptable. The richest and most powerful devise schemes and other stunts to avoid paying tax or to ease the pressure on themselves. There is a growing international consensus that aggressive tax avoidance and evasion by some corporations is a major contributory factor in the staggering increase in global economic inequality. This is what I am concerned with. I am not trying to close down any business or stop foreign investment. We are discussing inequality in broader society. The global trend of increasing economic inequality and poverty is echoed in Ireland. Recently, the Think-tank for Action on Social Change, TASC, estimated that the wealthiest 10% of our population owned 42.3% of all wealth whereas the bottom 50% owned only 12.2%, with a dramatic increase in levels of deprivation, poverty and homelessness in recent years. For example, 750,000 people, including 232,000 children, now live in poverty. This is why we discuss tax. Tax should be about the distribution of wealth in our society. There is a concern that Ireland's low corporation tax rate and company regulatory regime do not support adequate accountability on the part of companies that operate out of Ireland. Many Deputies have friends and family members working in the companies in question, but that does not mean the companies should not pay their fair share of tax. The exchange of information between tax jurisdictions is not automatic. It is also a concern that the recent European Commission investigation into Apple in Ireland revealed a lack of transparency and accountability on the part of Revenue to the people of Ireland.In addition, there is concern that Ireland is part of a network for international corporate tax avoidance and evasion, as demonstrated by the so-called LuxLeaks scandal and the widely criticised "double Irish" tax arrangement. These are the issues in respect of this broader debate. One also hears the suggestion that Ireland has a highly progressive tax system, but of course that word is often distorted. It has a progressive income tax system, but what about the corporate, property and wealth taxes, as well as VAT? Income tax constitutes 41% of the tax system, and the people at the bottom of the tax system pay as much of their income as do those at the top, but one will not hear that point from a lot of people in this debate. There is a 30% rate of indirect taxation, whereby the people in the bottom decile pay 30% of their income in indirect taxes; incidentally, the people in the top decile pay 6% in this regard. Similarly, people in the top decile pay 9% of their income in tax while people in the bottom decile pay 28%. Is that really progressive? Yesterday, Renua had its tax policy launch, at which it advocated less income tax for those who earn more. Where would one get it? It proposed a 23% flat tax, which is completely unacceptable. Most rich people make money from assets, not income, and, as Members are aware, these already are taxed under the capital gains tax regime. My point is that Members must consider the facts and must be careful about ensuring a balance and a fair distribution of taxes. In addition, Members must deal with the reality that the tax issue is a global problem. A global problem requires a global response and, in the case of Ireland, a response right across the European Union. Members have had sight of the BEPS proposals. Will they lead to greater losses of taxation revenue compared to the current amount of $250 billion estimated by the OECD? These are questions to be asked. Reasonable and moderate people are making the point that there is wealth out there. Why do Members seek the wealth? It is because they wish to remove children from poverty. Why do they seek an additional few bob on taxes? It is to do something about the housing crisis. They seek this additional money to get people off trolleys and into real beds in hospitals. Essentially, these are major issues Members should address and from which they should not run away. I again thank my colleagues for tabling this important Private Members' debate but, that said, I always support the concept of supporting Irish small businesses as a priority, as well as supporting foreign direct investment as part of the overall strategy.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	689	I thank Deputies Maureen O'Sullivan, Richard Boyd Barrett and Joan Collins for tabling this Private Members' motion. When the issue of achieving a more equal society is discussed, the focus tends to be on the comparison between what top income earners are paid and those who are paid at lower levels. While this is important, particularly where large multiples are involved, it diverts attention away from the real inequality, the cause of which is more about the accumulation and distribution of assets and wealth. The narrative is destructive because it pitches people who often are earning quite modest incomes against other workers. What has been occurring is that people on the lowest incomes have become poorer, as evinced by the growing number of children who are living in poverty. At the same time, the incomes of a large number of those who are termed middle-class have been hollowed out. Post-crisis Ireland is much more unequal than it was before the crash, which is a disgrace. Should one aspire to a more equal society, and if so, why? According to works such as The Spirit Level, when one considers the evidence, the more equal societies, such as the Nordic countries, produce better societal outcomes and better mental health outcomes and have lower levels of drug use. As for obesity, the term is "The wider the income gap, the wider the waist." These countries have better educational performance and lower crime rates, and the list goes on. The authors of The Spirit Level, Wilkinson and Pickett, wrote the book following 20 years of international research. It is easy to perceive why one would seek a more equal society when it delivers such good outcomes. While there is no doubt that great wealth has been created in Ireland, the problem is how that wealth is distributed. The levels of inequality that were so well demonstrated in the RTE programme recently produced by David McWilliams are not unique to Ireland. During the summer, I re-read Joseph Stiglitz's book, The Price of Inequality, and apart from the people named and the subject country, the pattern was pretty much the same internationally. Professor Joseph Stiglitz won a Nobel Prize in economics and formerly worked for the World Bank as its chief economist. In the book, he details the profound consequences of both the current financial meltdown and the previous decades of neoliberal interventions on the incomes, health and prospects of the 99%, as well as the damage done to values, fairness, trust and civic responsibility. How do the 1% accumulate the wealth? This was graphically described in the aforementioned programme. For example, when one considers NAMA and the IBRC, the Government shortened the time for the disposal of assets. As property values were rising, there was a rush to dispose of the NAMA and IBRC assets. It appears this was a factor in the bundling together of large groups of distressed assets that are being sold below par in what appears to be a fire sale. The result is that a small number of super-wealthy people are being made richer, and they are then free to sell on the same assets for a profit to others who would have paid more for them individually or in small bundles. Moreover, some of them, such as Project Arrow, contain a large quantity of residential properties, some of which are in the right locations to deal with the current housing and homelessness crisis. The Nordic countries offer a good example because they attract a good share of foreign direct investment. They have good, stable economies with good public services, yet they have higher levels of corporate taxation, for example. As to why they attract this investment, it is because they have good public services and good educational attainment. If we take our eye off that ball, the 12.5% rate will not matter if we lack the people who will work in those multinational firms. This is possible unless we invest in third level institutions and right through the education system. Where will this tax come from? I attended a briefing by IBEC recently at which it called for significant investment in third level education while simultaneously highlighting areas in which there is inadequate ability to bring in more taxation. I raised that very point with it - namely, that the key issue is not the rate of 12.5% but the amount some companies are paying in corporation tax. This is the money society needs to invest in infrastructure, be it public transport, housing or education. This is what will sustain us into the future. I believe the key issue is bringing in the full 12.5%, rather than the actual rate of 12.5%.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	690	When I heard that Deputy Boyd Barrett was sponsoring a motion on multinationals, I instinctively thought I could not live with it comfortably. However, having read its text and having noted its moderate tone, I must admit I find it pretty palatable and reasonable. I do not understand why the Government cannot accept it because really, if one considers it in its raw form and strips out much of the verbiage in it, it is a requirement more for transparency than for anything else. Multinationals have a highly chequered history in Ireland. They came here, were very unwelcome and became hate figures in certain circles. They were looked upon as exploiting Irish wealth, riches and assets while taking those assets and profits overseas and leaving a minimum here, or basically pillaging the country for profits overseas. They were also perceived as being particularly anti-trade union and not taking on unionised staff.To this day that remains the model of multinationals. The model of our native industry is very different, with one or two exceptions. There was a clash of cultures which existed here for a long time, but that obviously developed over a period as the multinationals came in and gave an enormous amount of employment to native Irish people who were happy to accept that employment. In some cases they were extraordinarily well paid. They were extremely content and very productive in their work, but they lived in a different world from those who, for instance, worked for semi-State companies. That does not mean that one is necessarily any better than the other, but it meant that we have in our midst after a period of time - encouraged by successive governments - embedded in the economy a different type of culture from which it would be difficult to disengage. We had to accept them and, indeed, I suppose an indication of that was that when multinationals did withdraw, whole communities were destroyed. Employment in towns and villages was decimated and they left a hole which in certain instances has never been filled. They are here to stay under certain circumstances and conditions, and although they are here to stay and are welcome, they are super strong - maybe too strong in terms of economic muscle. We may not love them but we have to accept them. The question that now has to be asked, and Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan and others are asking it, is whether Ireland has become more a tax vehicle for multinationals rather than a home for production or anything else. The indications are that, whereas they are doing an enormous amount of good in giving employment, in making profits and all the spin-off effects, in certain high profile cases they are using Ireland more as a tax vehicle than for anything else. Everybody is familiar with the issue of Apple. Everybody is also familiar with the issue of the double Irish, which the Minister quite rightly abolished last year. Despite this, there are figures that really are quite staggering. I will point out one, for instance, from last year involving Microsoft. These are 2014 figures which I have picked out simply to illustrate the case. That company's cost of sales for the year was €2.8 billion, while administrative expenses were €17.9 billion in Ireland. That is simply ridiculous. I am quoting from The Irish Times which asked a question about it. It said that these administrative figures are most likely royalty and other intellectual property payments made to other Microsoft companies not tax resident in Ireland. I think they are the Netherlands and Luxembourg. It goes on to say that there is no explanatory note about the expenses in the accounts and a request for a comment on the matter had not been responded to at the time of going to press. An administrative expense of €17.9 billion, which is actually an intellectual property payment or a patent royalty payment, is an artificial tax transaction, nothing else. That means that what they are doing, and everybody knows that this is what they are doing, is buying a bit of intellectual property from Bermuda, paying for it out there, leaving the money out there - it never goes back to America - and taking it out of the Irish economy. It is an artificial tax transaction which is entered into their books as something which it really is not. It is down there to avoid tax. Let us be absolutely clear that it is not illegal, but it is a source of income which we should be looking at as potentially one in which we should have a large share. I think the motion is wrong in saying that they should give the Revenue Commissioners powers to do this. If there is tax avoidance going on, the Revenue Commissioners have the power to challenge it. The question is why they are not using it.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	691	I compliment Deputies Maureen O'Sullivan, Joan Collins and Richard Boyd Barrett on tabling this issue for discussion. It gets to the heart of what type of Ireland we want to live in. That is entirely appropriate as we are on the eve of a general election. As Deputy Ross has said, it is not a revolutionary programme. It is a modest proposal against the backdrop of a Government which on nearly every issue tells us that we must comply with Europe, be it on water charges or whatever. However, when it comes to the issue of corporation tax, it is sacrosanct and untouchable. Nobody can dare to ask them to pay even a modest amount of cash. That is the backdrop to this discussion. There is no secret whatsoever about the reality that Dublin has been known as a key tax avoidance centre for multinational companies. The brass plate goes up in the IFSC, with mythical employees and the channelling of profits through Irish subsidiaries to minimise tax liabilities. That is a fact and is not disputed. Last weekend, we even had the example of the now infamous Cerberus which is in prime position to buy up yet more real estate at a knock-down price in the South of Ireland, having done so in the North of Ireland. Its tax figures were revealed at the weekend whereby it carries on this activity through 11 Irish companies. In 2013 and 2014, it had a turnover of €224 million and paid the princely sum of €10,000 in taxation. An average worker on a modest wage has probably paid more in taxation than Cerberus paid in Ireland in that time. That is what we are talking about - the glaring inequality in taxation in this State. The name that Ireland has got for itself means it has undermined regulation and has contributed to the crash. It is utterly shameless. I had the privilege, or misfortune, of watching David McWilliams's television programme on RTE a couple of weeks ago with my daughter who has just gone into fifth year and has started studying economics for the first time. She would already have been subjected to some of the analysis we heard on the other side to the effect that taxation has to be encouraged to bring these companies in to get jobs and all the rest of it. She nearly fell off her seat at the evidence given there of multinational companies whose average profit per employee was $970,000 while average taxation per employee was $25,000. That is an effective rate of 4% when families and workers are paying considerably more. Citizens are meeting the deficit for that. The analysis set out the sharp increase in the proportion of taxes paid by ordinary citizens through social charges, indirect charges on consumption, the property tax and so on. We have to be clear about this. The theory that lower corporation taxes increase the incentive and capacity of business to invest is just not true. There is no evidence to support it. Michael Burke did an excellent contribution to the Notes on the Front blog where he said that according to the OECD, a weighted average of the main corporation taxes applied in member states had fallen progressively over the past 32 years. In 1981, the average rate was 49.1% while in 2012 it was 32.4%. This was in a period of severe economic crisis. Low taxes are not proof against economic crises. We obviously do not have time to develop the points, but ironically the strongest year of Irish growth was 1997, which was six years before the 12.5% corporation tax was brought in. The argument that lower tax rates lead to higher investment has been disproved throughout the entire OECD area which has experienced a decline in growth over the past 30 years. I think it is shameless that we would market this country as a sort of nodding Uncle Tom that bends the rules and doffs the cap to any establishment that would come in and throw us a few bob. Why can we not behave like a sovereign, independent nation? That type of approach is filtering through in all aspects of or economy and not just in terms of taxation. Ryanair's chief executive, Michael O'Leary, has been lauded as somebody who pays his tax here, but in reality he is about the only Ryanair employee who does pay his taxes here.The company has orchestrated a situation whereby all its employees are nominally self-employed and are supposed to be employed in Ireland, even though they work in other countries. They avoid paying tax in those countries and the company can afford to pay them less. That is the reality. We have become famous for low standards and a race to the bottom. I compliment the team for putting through the motion. There needs to be a complete overhaul. Those with the resources need to pay more. They are not doing so, but if we want an equitable and fair society then it has to be done. The rate has more than passed its sell-by date.
#MichaelFitzmaurice	unknown-#MichaelFitzmaurice-party	unknown-#MichaelFitzmaurice-dob	unknown-#MichaelFitzmaurice-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	692	I thank Deputy O'Sullivan, Deputy Boyd Barrett and Deputy Joan Collins for this motion. I have made it clear that the 12.5% corporation tax rate should be left alone because we need to encourage business in the country. However, the rate should be adhered to. There is no good in Irish companies throughout the country trying to survive - they start off and go through the first three years of tough going after the company is set up first - only for multinational companies to come in and get sweetheart deals. Basically that puts them on an unfair footing. We should treat all our people equally. As a country we have concentrated on the multinationals through the years. They are here and there is no point in saying otherwise. We need them at the moment. However, Ireland needs to have a strategy for when something goes wrong. When something goes wrong with a multinational - we have seen it in Limerick and other counties - it is like a bomb hitting an area. The devastation it causes is unbelievable for families, the Government and the entire area and it takes so long to replace those jobs. We need to keep concentrating on Irish companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, to ensure we create as much sustainable employment as possible. The reason is simple. If something goes wrong with a company of ten or 20 people and it does not survive, at least it is far less damaging than 1,000, 2,000 or 3,000 jobs going in one shock announcement. The relevant people in Ireland should always remember one thing. Some multinationals thought they could abscond to other countries. Indeed, the European Union subsidised them to go to the other countries. However, one thing they found out is that our people and the education we have as a country are valuable. We can sell this. If we adhere to the 12.5% corporation tax rate, that is fine, but we see figures such as 2%, 3% or 4%. It is like a corridor of money coming in and going out. Some of the figures we see look good but that does not create jobs. It is simply a paper exercise and paper exercises do not create jobs in this country. Basically, we need manufacturing or something else. Concerning media reports suggest we may be held with a gun to our head by some multinationals on the pharmaceutical side with demands on the price of products in exchange for staying in the country. We have one of the most competitive tax rates in Europe. The 12.5% rate is a good thing but I do not believe in a payback with the implication that we buy the stuff from a given company "or else". We are a gateway and a corridor to Europe for many countries. There is a young population with good education here and we have many things going for us. We need not sell our souls even more in this way. I compliment the Deputies once again for putting this together. As Deputy Ross said, Revenue has the powers to investigate all of this. The door is closing now. Europe has subsidised some companies to leave this country. I understand they gave €50 million to one company to go to another country in Europe and caused devastation in the Limerick area. Now, Europe seems to be closing the door on pulling everyone to a halt. I gather there are question marks over what has gone on in Portugal. There are question marks in many countries and it may be a good thing to have a common denominator. I urge the Minister to ensure, no matter what we do as a nation and no matter how Europe tries to bully and intimidate us, as they have done for many years, that Ireland stands firm on the 12.5% corporation tax rate. We are an island. I believe companies should pay the 12.5% rate but I do not believe a company that comes here should get an advantage over an Irish person who is starting up. I have heard various media reports about people from various countries suggesting that Ireland should look at this, that or the other and I have heard calls to harmonise the tax rate in Europe. We need our identity and we must hold on to that. Regardless of what has to be done, we need to ensure that we are not driven down a road in Europe by having to raise the rate. We need to create even more employment, especially in the countryside.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	693	I thank all Deputies who contributed to the debate on this important subject. We heard a wide range of perspectives and I believe this diversity of views enriches the debate. I cannot address all the points made by Deputies in the time available but I am keen to respond to some specific points made. Deputy McGrath discussed Ireland's corporation tax take as a percentage of GDP and as a percentage of total tax revenue. I welcome Deputy McGrath's acknowledgement that our corporation tax receipts are in line with or even above the relative percentages in other EU and OECD countries. Corporation tax receipts to the end of September of this year were almost €4 billion, a 45% increase on the same period last year. While these figures can be difficult to interpret, our analysis suggests that the greater-than-expected performance in the year to date is broad based and primarily relates to improved trading throughout the entire economy. These strong corporation tax receipts underline the important contribution businesses make to the Irish economy. Deputy McGrath and Deputy Boyd Barrett rightly highlighted concerns about multinational profits being shifted to tax havens, in particular through how transfer pricing rules are applied. Addressing this concern has been a key focus of the base erosion and profit shifting project. Changes to the OECD transfer pricing guidelines as a result of the BEPS project will significantly reduce the ability of multinationals to shift income to cash box companies in tax havens. The BEPS package revises the guidance on the application of transfer pricing rules to prevent taxpayers from using so-called cash box entities to shelter profits in low or no-tax jurisdictions. It has been recognised that the existing international standards for transfer pricing rules can be misapplied so that they result in outcomes in which the allocation of profits is not aligned with the economic activity that produced the profits. The BEPS reports have targeted this issue to ensure that transfer pricing outcomes are aligned with value creation. This corresponds with Ireland's tax strategy, whereby we seek to align the right to tax with real economic substance and activity. Deputy O'Sullivan raised the question of the UN being recognised as an international body on tax. The Irish position has always been that the issues of base erosion and profit shifting are best addressed by a multilateral solution and that the OECD has the recognised international experts in this area. It is, therefore, important that the work of the EU, the UN or other intergovernmental work on tax takes into account the ongoing work at the OECD, and that a twin-track and potentially conflicting approach is avoided.Ireland is a small open economy with a heavy concentration of foreign direct investment. The 12.5% corporation tax rate is critical to supporting our economic recovery and employment growth. Research by the OECD also points to the importance of low corporate tax rates to encourage growth. In ranking taxes by their impact on economic growth, corporate tax was found to be most harmful. I urge Members of the House not to conflate or confuse the policy of attracting foreign direct investment with a policy of tolerating aggressive tax planning. Just because Ireland attracts high levels of foreign direct investment does not mean that we encourage base erosion and profit shifting or aggressive tax planning. Yesterday, the Minister of State, Deputy Harris, outlined in detail the measures we have taken to improve our tax system and protect our reputation, including our engagement in the OECD BEPS project and our plans to implement its recommendations. As I said earlier this week, and as the OECD recognised, Ireland will be one of the first countries to introduce country by country reporting in line with the OECD’s recent recommendations. We have always supported a policy of fair tax competition, within the confines of the international rules and principles in this area. I thank Deputies for their sincere engagement with the debate and their comments. I commend the Government’s counter-motion to the House.

We acknowledge that there is a heavy concentration of foreign direct investment, but does the Minister not think that one of these days we will have to put a bit more thought and investment into indigenous industry rather than be forever dependent on strangers? The Minister referred to the importance of low corporation tax to encourage growth. The sad part of that is the fact that large business pays less tax now than it used to. A frightening statistic is that the corporation tax paid in the late 1940s in America represented seven times more of the overall tax take than it does now. There is a race to the bottom, where we are all competing to create employment and to attract companies which will create employment. It is almost a case of having to pay companies to come into the country to provide employment.  We have to ask ourselves what sort of world we want to live in. I accept that things are not much different, in lots of ways, anywhere else, but there is a problem. Society is organised in such a way that, whether we like it, there will always be a lot of people who will need help from those who can give it. Society breaks down if we do not care about the people who are in difficulty and need our help. Some of us are in a better position to look after ourselves than others. No Government can do that without a healthy tax take from those who can afford to pay. We discussed the lack of social housing earlier, something which is causing incredible problems. Social housing depends on Government spending. We accept that money does not grow on trees, but I cannot for the life of me understand why the EU does not encourage states to invest in infrastructure without placing a financial burden on the books. The Minister is under pressure, given the 3% rules, but I find it incredible that the EU does not change that structure so that infrastructure is something that all states are encouraged to engage in.  The fact that we do not have a child care system creates serious inequality and means that, to a great degree, women remain second class citizens. A child care system like that in Germany would be revolutionary for Ireland and would make a wonderful and positive difference. It would be worth anything. We all recognise that serious inequality is a problem for all of us, even those with loads of money in their pockets. There are more problems to deal with, higher walls need to be built, more money needs to be spent on security and there is more fear because those who have nothing will be encouraged to take from those who have. It is in the interests of all of us to make sure that everybody is in a better place, and that requires more of a tax take. I would be in favour of increasing corporation tax from 12.5% to 15%, and I do not think American companies would flee the country. 
#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	698	Gabhaim m'aitheantas agus mo bhuíochas leis na Teachtaí Dála a ghlac páirt sa díospóireacht. Agus an buiséad ag teacht agus leis an tuarascáil a fhoilsíodh ar an Luan, is rud dearfach é go raibh an díospóireacht seo againn anocht agus aréir. I acknowledge the work of NGOs like Christian Aid, Trócaire, Oxfam, the Debt and Development Coalition Ireland and Attac who do such tremendous work on tax justice. This Private Members' motion was worked on by Deputies Boyd Barrett, Collins and myself, with the support of other Members of the Technical Group. We can all agree that it is essential that we have a fair taxation system in our country, which is fair to individuals and large corporations. In May 2015, the Lux leaks scandal resulted in a number of protests about how corporate secrecy undermines global tax collections across the world, including in the poorest countries. One banner said it all, namely, that we want to see what multinationals pay in tax, which is what is at the centre of this motion. The Minister acknowledged that there has been an increase of 45% in the corporate tax intake recently, and he outlined his reasons for that. I suggest, however, that it is because issues like tax transparency, accountability and good governance are coming more to the fore that multinational companies are beginning to think and engage as they realise that their reputations are at stake. What was disappointing in some of the debate was the way in which it was suggested that those of us who tabled the motion are against foreign direct investment and want to increase corporate tax to such an extent that it would drive foreign direct investment away. We are all for job creation, but companies must respect workers' rights and pay fair taxes.  We made the point that tax systems that lack accountability and transparency are exacerbating inequality, and economic inequality compounds the other inequalities in health and education, not to mention the extent of the revenues that are lost through unjust tax systems. There were quite a number of examples of tax injustice highlighted in the course of the debate. Many examples showed where multinationals have played countries off against each other to make sure they only paid low levels of tax.  On the rate of 12.5%, even a modest increase would make a big difference but, leaving the increase aside, we have to collect the full 12.5% and also need to see the figures at the end of each year. A speaker mentioned Medtronic yesterday, an American medical devices company that acquired Covidien. It is reaping the benefits of lower taxes here, but has been quietly shedding jobs in a number of places in this country and there are concerns that it will continue to do so. It does not, of course, recognise that its workers should have any union rights. It obviously sees Ireland as a tax haven. We would welcome it, provided it respects workers' rights and paid its just taxes. The OECD base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, report purports, as the Government amendment states, "an internationally agreed approach to combatting aggressive tax planning and harmful tax practices". The OECD stated up to $24 billion is lost annually by governments around the world because of aggressive tax planning by multinationals. What is needed now are aggressive tax justice measures to ensure an end to this. This is what the motion is about. Will BEPS achieve this? It goes a considerable way towards bringing about change, but it does not go far enough. We are agreed on country-by-country reporting, but for it to be effective it must be done publicly. Even the European Parliament voted overwhelmingly in favour of this information being available. Yesterday evening, the Minister of State, Deputy Harris, said the reason against the information being available publicly was "to protect the confidentiality of potentially sensitive information" but as we know, the European Commission is investigating this. The Minister for Finance and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, received a letter from a group of NGOs, including those I mentioned and Transparency International, ActionAid and ICTU, stating that ending the secrecy surrounding tax payments and the economic activities of multinational corporations is a crucial step towards re-establishing trust in our tax system. It also stated this would bring about corporations paying their taxes in the jurisdictions where they operate and this would lead to financial stability and development. It would also give the public information on these multinationals and the contributions they make or do not make. It would also show lawmakers whether there were loopholes in tax systems that had to be addressed. It would help investors because they would have a fuller picture of companies and it would also help make a more level playing field for domestic businesses trying to compete with multinationals which have so many strategies at their disposal. It is hard to see why Ireland did not support the public country-by-country reporting. Going back to the banner, we want to see what multinationals pay. Yesterday, the Minister of State mentioned the OECD BEPS process sought to involve developing countries, but I must ask whether it really listened to the voices from the global south because my understanding is there was a feeling it was just a public relations exercise. No notes were taken when the countries from the global south were there, and their issues on exploitation by multinationals depriving them of much-needed revenue is not addressed by BEPS. I asked about the toolkits the OECD states it will develop. The spillover analysis of the impact of our tax system is very positive, but are we giving with one hand and taking with the other given the complexity on the tax issue? The Minister has addressed the question I asked yesterday as to why we did not support the intergovernmental body on tax under the UN called for by so many NGOs. If we had been really serious about transparency and accountability in tax matters and good governance, we would have given it much more support than we did. If tax avoidance were tackled, it would enable developing countries to mobilise greater resources for development. We went for the OECD best package country-by-country reporting but not for it to be made public. There is one way we can regulate, not eliminate, the increasing influence of the multinationals, and this is if we in Ireland implemented or developed our own national action plan to implement the guiding principles on business and human rights. Work is being done on this but it is taking quite a long time. At the very least, State-owned companies with an overseas presence should establish human rights due diligence. We should not go any further with the transatlantic trade and investment partnership, TTIP, until there is a robust assessment of the human rights aspects of it. At the very least we should oppose the inclusion of the investor state dispute settlement mechanism because it puts corporate rights over citizen rights. The UNHCR notes 1.2 billion people live on $1.25 or less a day and 2.7 billion people live on less than $2.50 a day. This is in a world where we have resources many times over what is required to eliminate global poverty. One of the resources is tax. In 1990, the illicit financial flows were $9.7 billion, in 2008 they were $26.3 billion and they are now approaching $1 trillion. We are supposed to be happy the OECD BEPS will change all of this. Ireland took a leadership role in facilitating agreement in the recently endorsed sustainable development goals, but the next step is the policy decisions which will see these implemented. Goal 16.4 commits action by 2030. This is too far away because too much damage can be done in the meantime. The aim of this goal is to reduce significantly illicit financial and arms flows because it will be very costly to fund the strategic development goals. Stopping illicit financial flows is a very viable and lucrative source of income as they are reckoned to be $1 trillion. This is what the Private Members' motion is about. It is about fairness and justice across the board when it comes to tax. Just tax policies and systems contribute to equality, combating poverty and tackling discrimination. It is hypocritical of us as a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council where we are very well respected for our development aid because it is untied. We should have the same strong voice when it comes to taxation justice.

However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service have informed me that a portion of land adjacent to Wicklow Courthouse was acquired by the Courts Service that would allow for the future development of the courthouse. The courthouse building and surrounding lands are in the ownership of the Courts Service. While the Courts Service has not been in a position in recent years to proceed with its plans for Wicklow Courthouse, it is committed to the development of the courthouse and is reviewing its capital investment proposals in the light of the recent publication of "Building on Recovery: Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2016-2021". I am assured that the matter will be kept under review, having regard to available resources.

Garda management keep this distribution under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of resources. I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that the number of Community Garda in the Kerry Division, from 31 December 2010 - 31 August 2015, the latest date for which figures are readily available, are as set out in the table attached. It is, of course, the case that all Gardaí have a role to play in addressing community policing issues as and when the need arises. In that sense, community policing involves far more than a single unit within the Garda Síochána, a point highlighted by the Garda Inspectorate in their third report entitled "Policing in Ireland—Looking Forward" in which they stated that community policing is a fundamental policing philosophy and that there is a strong foundation for it in Ireland. An Garda Síochána now operates a new model of Community Policing which aims to build upon and enhance progress made so far. I fully support this renewed emphasis on Community Policing particularly in light of the priority given to this in the Programme for Government. The model is about renewing, reinvigorating and restructuring the community policing function within An Garda Síochána to deliver a consistent national structure to the community policing function, a more co-ordinated and efficient Garda service to the community and a spread of good practice and quality of service in community policing on a national basis.
