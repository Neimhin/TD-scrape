          <p eId="para_14">In page 5, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following subsection:</p>
          <p eId="para_15">"(2) This Act in so far as it relates to extradition and the Extradition Acts 1965 to 2001 may be cited together as the Extradition Acts 1965 to 2003.".</p>
          <p eId="para_16">I welcome the Minister and his officials. This is important legislation on extradition. It will have the effect of abolishing all Ireland's extradition arrangements with the member states and putting in place a different administrative mechanism to effect the surrender of citizens in this jurisdiction. My amendment provides that this Act in so far as it relates to extradition and the Extradition Acts 1965 to 2001 should be cited together as the Extradition Acts 1965 to 2003 because effectively that is what we are dealing with. Effectively we will be establishing a mechanism for citizens to be extradited from this country, a common law jurisdiction underpinned by a Constitution, to other jurisdictions which are, by and large, civil law jurisdictions and which in a number of cases are not underpinned by a constitution. It is a fundamental issue and I would appreciate it if the Minister could accept this amendment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_5">
          <from>Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_17">I propose to oppose section 1 in its entirety. If you wish, Chairman, I will go through my opening remarks so that I cover some of the other points arising.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">One of my questions relates to the Minister's statement that we have international obligations to ensure that this is delivered by the end of the year. What are the consequences for Ireland of refusing to incorporate the enabling legislation in this case? My understanding is that Third Pillar measures do not currently come under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Therefore there can be no proceedings against Ireland for claiming that on reconsideration of the framework directives our national Parliament considers there are inadequate safeguards and that it would require the undermining of our constitutional rights, and on this basis it is unacceptable to us.</p>
          <p eId="para_19">What will happen to the other countries who will not have passed this or similar legislation by the deadline? As far as I am aware, only four other countries have passed similar legislation to give effect to this arrest warrant. France and Germany recently demonstrated that one can ignore such directives. They are not abiding by the Stability and Growth Pact. If such an agreement can be ignored, what is the position in this case where the national Parliament could state that, on reflection, we do not agree to participate in the European arrest warrant provisions?</p>
          <p eId="para_20">When this measure was first proposed at the Tampere Summit in 1999, it was discussed in the context of an EU legal system harmonisation over a period of a decade or more. The Minister has frequently defended the superiority of our constitutional guarantees over European systems and has argued the need to protect the integrity of the Constitution. I do not know how he can justify the measures proposed in this document in the absence of harmonised safeguards.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">The Human Rights Commission has pointed out that the framework decision itself was based on a flawed presumption of the effective and equivalent protections between member states, but that does not necessarily exist, as the Minister knows. How could he justify measures that will reduce judicial scrutiny in Irish courts? Does he not see that this is a broader drive towards the integration of the EU legal systems and ultimately what some believe to be the creation of an EU super state? What is the difference between this proposal and the slippery slope of harmonisation?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnBruton" eId="spk_6">
          <from>Mr. J. Bruton</from>
          <p eId="para_22">I congratulate DeputyÓ Snodaigh on his sterling defence of the British legal system and his support for the maintenance of a British legal system rather than the introduction of a rational European system which is more in line with my views of the future of this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">I have come here to support this good legislation. I strongly support the idea of a European arrest warrant. The reality is that the origin, directly or indirectly, of the majority of the crimes we face in this jurisdiction is within the operations of international drug networks and networks of other forms of crime which are organised on a Europe-wide basis. It has been estimated by Europol that there are in the region of 30,000 people engaged in international organised crime in Europe. These are gathered together in about 300 to 400 separate organised gangs, of whom about 31 originate in Ireland, but there is considerable interdependence. They are as sophisticated as any multinational company in the legitimate economy. They engage in subcontracting, in specialisation and in co-operation, even across language barriers. Many think the Albanian gangs operate only with other Albanians. The fact is that these groups have the capacity to operate multi-ethnically.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">The only way such groups can be combated is by a Europe-wide attempt to deal with them. That obviously requires that there should be a European arrest warrant in the case of the comparatively limited number of offences to which the European arrest warrant applies and to which the Minister's predecessor agreed. The Minister, Deputy McDowell, was then the Attorney General who wisely advised the Government in this matter and I compliment him.</p>

          <p eId="para_30">I have looked at Deputy Costello's amendment and I want to think about it. I will deal with it, one way or the other, on Report Stage if he resubmits it. This is not an extradition Bill. It is a Bill to do with a rendition which is not extradition in the classical sense. It is a European arrest warrant. It is more or less on the same lines as the rendition that existed between Ireland and the constituent parts of the United Kingdom. Therefore we will have to think about whether we want to have it cited jointly with our extradition law or have it as separate free-standing legislation. I will think about that between now and Report Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_31">On the broader issue, at this stage the UK, Spain, Portugal and Denmark have implemented in legislation the European arrest warrant. Belgium, Ireland, Finland and Sweden expect to be in a position to do so. Effectively eight of the 15 countries will have implemented it.</p>
          <p eId="para_32">Deputy Bruton will see the irony in that Germany, France, the Netherlands, Italy, Greece, Austria, Luxembourg and other states have not done so and are not expected to do so by 1 January, but I will not comment further on that save to say that there is a pattern.</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_34">Returning to DeputyÓ Snodaigh's fundamental proposition, this measure is the result of a fundamental strategic decision made by the European Union at Tampere, which was that they would not go down the road of approximation and a single law for the whole of Europe but would make all the systems interoperable and mutually recognitive. They decided that they would avoid the creating of a super state with a single law, and that is what this is all about. The strategic direction at that time was that member states would continue to have autonomy in their own criminal justice systems but that the price of that, in effect, would be to make them interoperable and mutually recognitive.</p>
          <p eId="para_35">We are now in the position where the implementation of this system is an international obligation and in my view it would be embarrassing for Ireland, having taken the stance we have taken on our own autonomy in criminal justice matters, to say that we want to do a U-turn on this, tear up this strategy and go back to where we were in the first place. In a Europe where there is freedom of movement, freedom of travel and freedom of establishment, and all the opportunities for criminality to which Deputy Bruton referred, it seems to me that there must be some system which is adequate to respond to the opportunities which that provides for criminality.</p>
          <p eId="para_36">There are two broad strategies available: a uniform harmonised system of law right across Europe, which is something I believe the Irish do not want; or, alternatively, a system which effectively deals fairly and squarely - while maintaining, on the principle of subsidiarity, each member state's capacity to deal with these matters itself - with the issues of criminal law posed by all of these freedoms and which also accepts the proposition set down at Tampere that there must be an area of freedom, security and justice within the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_37">Deputy Ó Snodaigh then states - this is the point where I cross swords with him seriously - that this should be delayed until we have put in place safeguards for everybody. He should be very careful to look around the particular corner towards which he is heading. He is saying that it should be a competence of the European Union to set out safeguards and to determine what is and is not an appropriate system. I am saying to him at this stage there is a set of proposals which are coming down the tracks on minimum standards and we will see what they are and judge them when we come to them. However, I am not going to say that I will not agree to this European arrest warrant unless and until we have created a competence for the European Union to impose on member states what Deputy Ó Snodaigh calls minimum safeguards or whatever. If, in the last analysis, one accords to the European Union member states, acting either collectively with qualified majority or unanimously, the function of determining how our system of safeguards should or should not operate over and above what is in the European Convention on Human Rights by which all member states are bound, one is actually walking down the exact path that Deputy Ó Snodaigh accuses me of taking, that is, centralising in the European Union very far-reaching constitutional competencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_38">The correct path is for Ireland to honour its international obligation under European law by bringing this into effect, to do so on 1 January, and to be in a position throughout our Presidency to encourage, and use some leverage on, the other member states to get on with the job. It would be very wounding to our Presidency of the European Union if, on this central pillar of the area of freedom, security and justice, we were found effectively to have abandoned, had second thoughts on or had cold feet about the project.</p>

          <p eId="para_39">It is important that there are safeguards and that the Union has the capacity to introduce safeguards and minimum standards. One of the ways in which this can be done is by accepting the draft constitution which provides for qualified majority voting in this area. If people are rendered from Ireland to another jurisdiction which involves them appearing before a judge whose first language is not the defendant's language, this will ensure that there will be rights to translation of all documents, rights to access to a lawyer and rights to various other minimum protections. The only way that will happen is by the adoption of the European Union constitution. I look forward to DeputyÓ Snodaigh's support for the constitution, given that it will provide the protections he seeks. I am glad that on this issue we are both in favour of greater European integration.</p>

          <p eId="para_46">A formulation of words should be inserted to provide that the Act should not come into operation until all European Union member states have enacted similar legislation and until equivalent bodies to the Human Rights Commission in each member state have certified, according to procedures of the respective national parliaments, that the safeguards provided are acceptable and the protections available are equivalent between member states. The Minister and Deputy John Bruton suggest that national parliaments should still retain power so that they will not agree to the EAW unless the safeguards live up to the standards they seek. The larger states within Europe are slow to adopt this legislation but one would expect them to be the fore.</p>
          <p eId="para_47">Even though our judicial system was originally a British system, since the foundation of the State it has been adapted and changed so that it is an Irish system. It is no worse and no better than the imperialistic Napoleonic code on which the judicial systems of most other member states are based. We must make do with what we have until the Minister changes the entire system but that will not happen for a while. I oppose the section.</p>

          <p eId="para_48">I was pleased the Minister proposed the amendment because it was not until the conclusion of Second Stage that we were informed eight of the 15 member states would fail to meet the deadline of 1 January 2004. Given the impending accession of ten new member states, that means less than one third of all member states will have adopted the legislation. I thought the Minister was standing up to the larger member states such as Germany and France, which feel they are subject to a different law, as was the case under the stability pact in regard to the basic matter of the marketplace. They have flouted the deadline with impunity, even though they should be taking the lead. As Deputy Bruton stated, the EU constitution has not been adopted but it contains other safeguards.</p>
          <p eId="para_49">Ireland is accepting the legislation at an earlier stage than the larger member states, yet we engaged in tortuous negotiations with various member states regarding extradition arrangements. There was a great deal of angst and the entire nation was worked up about it. The legislation will commence from 1 January 2004 but I hoped the Minister would continue to use his discretion in this regard. I thought the reason he was going down that road was that he would have flexibility regarding the appropriate time to sign the Bill into law and begin the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_50">This is not the appropriate time, even though there are pressures on the Minister given that Ireland will hold the EU Presidency from 1 January 2004.

The effect of the amendment is that Ireland will be able to operate the EAW on a reciprocal basis with other member states that are in a position to do so. The amendment takes into account that not all member states will give effect to the framework decision on 1 January 2004. Furthermore, it takes account of the position of the accession states, which are due to sign up to the arrest warrant upon their accession on 1 May 2004.</p>

We do not wish to say because the person is not described as a judge or a magistrate under their law, because those titles are not used, that they are not covered by the law.

Other countries are being asked to recognise our distinctions between the DPP and the Judiciary, which is very strange in most countries. Many civil law systems do not understand a system whereby there is a constitutional officer who is wholly separate from the court system and merely appears as an equal party in it.

          <p eId="para_96">Under Article 52 of the framework decision, individual states were given the liberty to make statements about the degree of retrospectivity for which they would provide. The Italians have said that Italy will continue to deal, in accordance with the extradition rules in force, with all requests relating to acts before the date of entry into force of the framework decision on the European arrest warrant as provided for in Article 32 thereof. Pursuant to Article 32 of the framework decision on the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between member states, Austria states that, as executing state, it will continue to deal with requests relating to punishable acts committed before the date of entry into force of the framework decision in accordance with the extradition system applicable before that date.</p>

I also suggest the inclusion of a section to ensure there is no risk to the rule of equal treatment of people who are subject to arrest warrants. This provision should be included instead of subparagraphs (2) and (3). That would be in line with recommendations made by the Human Rights Commission in its submission to the Minister and the committee in respect of equality before the law, differences in extradition standards and equality between persons charged with the same offence.</p>

          <p eId="para_112">I ask this to raise the matter of whether this procedure of laying an order before the House which, if not annulled before 21 days, becomes law, is appropriate in matters of such seriousness. I have great reservations about the way in which this section operates in other legislation. When I first came to the House a long time ago, there was an understanding that if an Opposition party put down a motion to annul a regulation within 21 days, there was an obligation on the Government to provide time to debate the matter. Given the 21 day restraint, the Opposition party would not be required to have the matter considered during Private Members' time. At some point during the 1970s the practice was abandoned. Successive Governments have adopted the position that motions to annul will not be entertained during Government time. In effect, this means the procedure of annulment of such orders is ineffective. Unless it is a matter of great political moment, the Opposition party will not be willing to forgo its Private Members' time and the matter will not be discussed within 21 days.</p>
          <p eId="para_113">While Deputy McDowell is not responsible for a practice which has grown up over the years, I ask him to consider whether or not some of the areas he identifies should not be more appropriately dealt with by means of affirmative motion. The Government would then have to table a motion which could be debated and approved in the Dáil. Some matters to be dealt with through this procedure may involve the implementation of policy in which case the procedure would be appropriate. Other matters might be of a more substantive nature, in which case an affirmative approval motion might be a more appropriate mechanism.</p>

          <p eId="para_114">If we were to require an affirmative motion in respect of all these matters, the time involved in each could be up to three months. It would hugely burden the business of the House to put in place such an obligation. There is enough for us to do at the moment. If either House wished to do so, it could establish a secondary legislation scrutiny committee and sit in constant session examining documents and issuing reports about whether time might be made available. Although I have been here far less time than Deputy Bruton, I have found there is no appetite for that kind of thing. It is a point that is easily made, but if it were put in place there would be no desire to participate.</p>
          <p eId="para_115">In support of this I must cite our experience of the constitutional obligation to consult the Houses of the Oireachtas about options and discretions. There is a limited appetite for that consultation process, even under European law as things stand. The broader point made by Deputy Bruton can only be met with the unworthy reply that if he really believed that he should have done something about it when he was in a position to.</p>

It is a technical amendment to ensure that the section only deals with criminal activities. No. 17 amends paragraph (<i>b</i>) to ensure that a warrant can only be issued in respect of a person on whom an immediately enforceable sentence of imprisonment or detention has been imposed, on the basis that somebody could be appealing their sentence at the time the warrant is issued, which would make a difference. Would the procedures operate if there was an appeal, in which case the person effectively would be entitled to be at large?</p>

If a person is found wrongfully to have been resisting extradition at great length, it may be that they should carry some risk. There would be a huge incentive to fight every case no matter how specious the grounds if a person thought they would always get credit for time served.

However, it makes a considerable difference if we are to insist that anybody who comes into our jurisdiction will recieve full credit for the period in custody in the other jurisdiction while we are not in a position to have that provision reciprocated. I do not know what period of time would be served where an examining magistrate is involved and bail is not as readily available as it is here. It is a flaw in the legislation that we are willing to give credit while we cannot demand that credit be given for anybody who is sent out of this country by order. The legislation imposes an obligation on us while failing to impose it on any of the other member states. A person could serve an extra six months or even two years in prison on top of their sentence than they would if they were in this jurisdiction.</p>

Article 26 of that Schedule provides that the issuing member state shall deduct all periods of detention arising from the execution of a European arrest warrant from the total period of detention to be served in the issuing member state as a result of a custodial sentence or detention order being passed. Reading that, it may be that a distinction must be drawn in the case of a fugitive offender. In that instance, one would not wish to reward the fugitive for time spent in custody in Ireland on return to another country. On the other hand, if a sentence is passed, it would be fair to make that provision de novo. In any event, the obligation is made under Article 26 of the framework decision.</p>

          <p eId="para_187">I am curious about sub-paragraph 1(<i>e</i>) which refers to the circumstances in which the offence was committed, including the time and place of the commission of the offence. I wonder how this will apply with regard, for example, to frauds committed over the Internet. In the commission of such an offence, is the place of the offence clear? Increasingly we hear of offences involving conspiracy. The conspiracy occurs in one country and the offence takesplace in another. I am not sure it is entirely clear where exactly the offence is deemed to have occurred.</p>
          <p eId="para_188">The same argument could arise regarding the time of an offence, though I am not sufficiently familiar with such situations arising. Why is it necessary to specify the place in which an offence takes place if otherwise there is sufficient evidence that there was an offence and that a certain person was involved?</p>

          <p eId="para_189">I refer Deputy Bruton to Article 8 of the framework decision which lays out paragraphs (a) and (f) in more or less the same form. The phraseology of the framework decision is: "The European arrest warrant shall contain the following information set out in accordance with the form contained in the annex." The Irish draftsman has said that a European arrest warrant "shall, in so far as it is practicable, be in the form set out in the annex." We have left a little flexibility there. Going back to classic indictments for conspiracy in Ireland, it was that they be between two dates at a place unknown, and sometimes even with persons unknown. I recall that on one occasion during the Arms Trial a person came into court and claimed to represent the persons unknown, and ask for a right of audience. That was in 1970. I do not think he succeeded.</p>
          <p eId="para_190">Deputy Bruton is correct. There will be difficulties in certain kinds of inchoate crimes and fraud, in highly sophisticated crimes. There will be difficulties in saying where the offence actually took place. It is for that reason that the Irish draftsman has been slightly more pragmatic than the framework draftsperson and has left a little room for manoeuvre regarding practicability.</p>

          <p eId="para_219">Seeking evidence without further proof does not mean that everything in it must be accepted. The point is that it should be received in evidence without further proof. It means that one need not prove that the person whose signature appears on it is the person in question and that that is his or her signature. It does not mean that is conclusively determined. For instance, if a totally fraudulent document were presented in court, it would be quite open to someone to say that the signature is not the signature of the judge, and that a con job was being perpetrated. The effect of this provision is to allow it to be received in evidence. A document that purports to be one of these documents is allowed to be received in evidence and it is subject to the right of anyone to contradict any of its contents if someone wants to do that. Otherwise one would have to prove each individual proposition, that the person in question was duly appointed as a judge in the foreign country, that that was the judge's signature, that on a particular day in Bratislava, for example, that judge made the order in question. That kind of thing would be an unreasonable obligation.</p>

          <p eId="para_220">It highlights that it is a true copy of a document, so it is merely an administrative order. As long as it is an accurate document, coming from the person and the state it is supposed to come from, that is all right. Is the Minister saying it is possible to make an argument as to why a document might not be submitted, despite the provision "shall be received in evidence without further proof". This is fairly strong. There is a presumption that a document presented by an issuing state, once submitted, is to be followed by the High Court.</p>

          <p eId="para_221">It does not have that meaning, in my view. It merely means that no further preliminary proof has to be tendered before it can be received in evidence. Once it is received in evidence it can then be contradicted, rejected or whatever. Our laws on admissibility of evidence provide that documents are not normally admissible unless there is other evidence which makes them admissible. One cannot simply hand up to a court half way through a case a page purporting to be somebody's diary unless one can prove where it came from, whose handwriting is on the page or whatever. This is to get around all of that and make it <i>prima facie </i>admissible in court but not conclusively authentic as evidence.</p>

In addition, a person will be informed of his or her right to obtain or be provided with legal advice at the time of arrest and at the first court appearance.

          <p eId="para_265">In this case, the High Court has dealt with a situation where the person is likely to leave the State and has found there are reasonable grounds for a garda to believe that before the arrest warrant is received in the State. To preserve the status quo it would be remarkable if the High Court could then grant bail since the person could then effectively skip. The High Court is obliged to remand the person in custody and for that purpose it should have the same powers as if the person was brought before it charged with an indictable offence. As soon as the situation of the warrant crystallises, the High Court would be in a different position. Under subsection (4) the High Court may order the release from custody of a person remanded in custody under this section if, at any time after the person has been so remanded, it appears to the High Court that a European arrest warrant has not been issued in respect of the person or, where appropriate, the issuing judicial authority has not given an undertaking under section 9(3). Effectively, one is obliged to remand the person in custody. Once the warrant has issued, the question of bail does arise. It is purely to prevent a person dancing away from the whole system.</p>

          <p eId="para_301">Amendment No. 46 provides that where a person consents to surrender in the High Court and it makes an order directing that the person be surrendered, it must inform the person of his or her right to make a complaint under Article 40.4.2° of the Constitution at any time before his or her surrender.

          <p eId="para_302">Amendment No. 49 inserts new subsections (6) and (7) in place of the existing subsection (6). The new subsection (6) provides that while proceedings relating to a complaint under Article 40.4.2° of the Constitution is pending, the person shall not be surrendered. In preparing that amendment account was taken of the views expressed by the Human Rights Commission that the section, as currently framed, did not set an outer limit on the period of detention between the making of the surrender order and the actual hand over. While the Bill reflected a framework decision in that regard, it is considered that the amendment will ensure that the arrested person, first, will be aware of his or her right to bring a <i>habeas corpus </i>application and, second, will seek a release if the delay in the hand over is too long. That is something which is being done in deference to the Human Rights Commission’s observations. The new subsection (7) while, in effect, replacing the existing subsection (6) contains no significant change in substance.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">Amendment No. 57 inserts new subsections (6) and (7) in section 14. Subsection (6) provides that a person making a complaint in regard to <i>habeas corpus </i>under Article 40.4.2° of the Constitution shall not be surrendered while proceedings relating to that complaint are pending. Subsection (7) provides that a person to whom an order for surrender has been made shall be released from custody if he or she is not surrendered within 25 days of the order being made. A surrender order under this section does not take effect until the expiration of 15 days from the making of the order and the person must be surrendered not later than ten days after that - effectively, there is a period of a fortnight followed by one of ten days after which the person must be released unless there is some good reason for not doing so - or, second, within ten days of such later date that may be agreed by the central authority, which is the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the issuing state unless habeas corpus proceedings are pending at that time.</p>

          <p eId="para_369">In page18, before section 15, to insert the following new section:</p>
          <p eId="para_370">15.-Where, in relation to an offence specified in a European arrest warrant, the High Court decides not to make an order under <i>section 13 </i>or <i>14</i>, it shall not be necessary for the issuing judicial authority to issue another European arrest warrant in respect of such other offences as are specified in that warrant, and, where such other offences are specified in the European arrest warrant, that warrant shall be treated as having been issued in respect of those other offences only.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">A new section is being inserted here to cater for the situation where a single European arrest warrant is issued for several offences and the High Court decides not to grant surrender for some of the offences. In such circumstances it will not be necessary for the issuing judicial authority to issue another EAW in respect only of the offences for which surrender is being granted. In other words, the High Court can grant surrender for some of the offences specified in a single European arrest warrant without the need for a revised warrant being sent to it. Accordingly, the High Court can grant surrender for some, all or none of the offences specified in a single EAW.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">I am considering amendments to sections 9 and 27, to be introduced on Report Stage. This relates to the substance of what is the new section 15, in that they will clarify that European arrest warrants, either received here or issued from Ireland, may be in respect of more than one offence. I just want to make that one hundred per cent clear. The amendments will be by way of stating this fact for the avoidance of doubt and may involve the addition of new subsections to sections 9 and 27 of the Bill before us.</p>

          <p eId="para_508">In page 28, before section 27, to insert the following new section:</p>
          <p eId="para_509">27.-(1) For the purposes of paragraph 2 of Article 2 of the Framework Decision, the Minister may, by order, specify the offences under the law of the State to which that paragraph applies.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">(2) The Minister may, by order, amend or revoke an order under this section (including an order under this subsection).</p>
          <p eId="para_511">(3) This section shall not operate to require that an order under this section be in force before a court may issue a European arrest warrant under <i>section 27</i>.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">This new section is being inserted to assist Irish courts when issuing European arrest warrants. Under the framework decision the issuing judicial authorities require to indicate if the offence for which the person is being sought comes within article 2.2. The new section provides for the possibility of the Minister, by order, detailing the particular offence under the law of the State which fits within the category of offences in article 2.2 of the framework decision, thus facilitating Irish courts in meeting the requirements under the framework decision when issuing European arrest warrants.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">Article 2.2 contains the so-called positive list of offences for which the dual criminality requirement is relaxed. The offence is surrenderable if it is on the positive list and is punishable by at least three years imprisonment in the issuing state. It does not necessarily have to be an offence in the requested state. What effectively will happen here is that the Minister will be in a position to issue by order a list of offences which fall within the category of offences which are on the positive list.</p>

          <p eId="para_606">Section 34 deals with the grounds on which the execution of an European arrest warrant may be refused, that is where there are proceedings in the State in relation to the offence in question. The existing provisions of section 34 deal with the situation where proceedings have been brought in the State against the person for an offence, consisting of an act or omission that constitutes, in whole or in part, the offence specified in the European arrest warrant or the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General has decided not to enter a <i>nolle prosequi </i>in proceedings against the person for the offence specified in the European arrest warrant.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">Amendment No. 96 adds a new ground. It inserts a paragraph (<i>a</i>) in section 34 which provides that a person shall not be surrendered if the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General is still considering but has not yet decided whether to bring proceedings against the person sought for an offence.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">Section 36 also deals with grounds on which the execution of a European arrest warrant may be refused, such as where the offence was committed outside the issuing state. Amendment No. 97 amends this section by deleting paragraph (<i>a</i>). It provided that the execution of the European arrest warrant would be refused where the offence was, in whole or in part, committed in the state. As a result, only the existing paragraph (<i>b</i>) remains. It provides that a person will not be surrendered for an offence that was committed, or alleged to have been committed, in a place outside the issuing state if the state would not exercise extra-territorial jurisdiction in respect of such an offence committed outside its territory.</p>
          <p eId="para_609">In other words, if Belgium, for example, decided to put someone on trial for an offence committed outside Belgium, Ireland would not surrender someone to Belgium if we ourselves would not exercise extra-territorial jurisdiction for the offence concerned.</p>

          <p eId="para_654">(<i>b</i>) in such provisions of this Act as are specified in an order under subsection (1A) (inserted by <i>section 41 </i>of the <i>European Arrest Warrant Act 2003</i>) of section 4 of the Extradition (European Union Conventions) Act 2001, a country designated by that order, to which the provisions so specified apply.’, and</p>
          <p eId="para_655">(<i>c</i>) the substitution of the following subsection for subsection (1B) (inserted by section 9 of the Act of 2001):</p>

          <p eId="para_659">The existing section 39 is to be replaced by the provisions in this amendment. The amendment repeats the wording of section 39(1)(<i>a</i>) of the Bill. Its purpose is to facilitate the operation of extradition arrangements of territories as well as countries. For example, the EAW will replace existing extradition arrangements between Ireland and the United Kingdom. However, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands will not be operating the EAW so we must bring them within the potential ambit of the European Convention on Extradition.</p>
