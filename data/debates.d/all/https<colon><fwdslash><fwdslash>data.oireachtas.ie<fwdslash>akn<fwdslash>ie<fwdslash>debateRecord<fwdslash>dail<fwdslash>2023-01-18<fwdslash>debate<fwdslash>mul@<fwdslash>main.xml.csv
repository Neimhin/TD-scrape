Happy new year to one and all. Today, the Taoiseach takes his first Leaders’ Questions and his Cabinet is mired in scandal. The two Deputies at the centre of these scandals - the former Minister of State, Deputy English, and the current Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe - reportedly received a round of applause for their efforts at last night’s meeting of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party. Last week, Deputy English was forced to resign as Minister of State because he lied on a housing planning application. Tens of thousands of people were not able to build a one-off home because, unlike Deputy English, they were honest in filling out their forms. However, he believed those rules did not apply to him. The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, is embroiled in controversy for flouting election donation rules. There has been a concerted attempt by the Minister to trivialise the matter as an administrative error but you and I know it is far more serious than that. The truth is that in the 2016 general election, the Minister received a political donation from a businessman which he failed to declare, and which was above the amount allowable by law. The businessman who provided the donation of a postering service, Michael Stone, at that time headed the Construction Industry Federation, the organisation that represents developers. Mr. Stone was subsequently appointed by Fine Gael to the Land Development Agency outside of the normal process. This demonstrates again how politics work in Ireland. There is a cosy club culture that sees Fine Gael Ministers slip seamlessly out of government and into roles as financial lobbyists, allows vulture funds to run amok, and sees housing policy written for big developers and corporate landlords. Despite his best efforts, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, cannot escape the fact that he broke the rules by receiving this donation. That is why he failed to correct his election return when the matter was brought to his attention as long ago as 2017. It is why he tried to convince members of the media that there was nothing to see here when he was questioned in November. It is why it took the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, writing to the Minister last Friday for him to respond. Since then, the Minister has concocted a story that has changed so many times that its credibility lies in tatters. The Minister first claimed that the posters were erected at night but images published by the Irish Independent show workers - I can only assume employees of Mr. Stone’s - in their hard hats, using the company van to put up the Minister's posters in broad daylight, in the middle of their working day. Yet, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, wants everyone to believe that this was not an unlawful political donation to him from a construction company. Nobody believes that story because it is not true. Bhris an tAire, an Teachta Donohoe, na rialacha nuair a fuair sé an síntiús seo. Tá a scéal dochreidte. Caithfidh sé an fhírinne a insint. This smacks of cronyism and of favours for insiders. It is time for the Minister to come clean. My questions are straightforward. What involvement has Mr. Stone had in any other Fine Gael election campaigns or in any other campaigns for the Minister, Deputy Donohoe? Can the Taoiseach explain why Mr. Stone was appointed by Fine Gael to the Land Development Agency outside of the normal processes? When did the Taoiseach first learn of this donation? Was it brought to his attention in November when the media first started asking questions? Does the Taoiseach accept that the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, broke the rules when he received this donation?

Deputy McDonald, I believe Paschal Donohoe. I believe he is a man of integrity and a man of the highest standards. He is somebody I have known for a very long time and I believe he is somebody we can trust, and somebody who I believe. I think, deep down, everyone in this House knows that Paschal is a man of integrity and somebody who tells the truth. What happened here is that six years ago, a businessman who is a supporter of his paid six people less than €200 each to put up and take down posters. There was also the issue of a loan of a company van, and the amount, the value of that, was below the limit above which you must declare it as a donation. He did not know the full facts. He only knew the full facts himself recently. When he did know the full facts, he amended his return, as he explained on Sunday. He accepts that he should have done this much sooner. He does concede a mistake in that regard and has apologised for it. We have a system of accountability when it comes to the Electoral Act and the ethics Act here in Ireland and it is now up to the standards commission to examine this complaint. It is not for us to make definitive judgments. We have the standards commission to do that and it will look at it impartially and make a decision. Ultimately, this is a political chamber, a political place, and we all know how votes will fall if there is a vote. That is why we have an independent commission, a standards commission, to take it out of the political cut and thrust. That body will look at the information independently and it will decide whether to carry out a preliminary inquiry. It has not even decided that yet. If it decides to carry out a preliminary inquiry, that will happen; and only at that point will it decide whether it is appropriate to have a full investigation at all. I think it is important that we respect the ethics legislation we voted through in this House and that we allow the standards commission to do its work free from political interference, whether it is from Government or from Opposition. I think it is wrong to cast aspersions on Michael Stone. I do not know Michael Stone. I have met him. He is the chairman of the north-east inner city task force. Deputy McDonald knows the work that he has done in her constituency to help to improve the lives of people in the north-east inner city. She knows he does that without claiming any expenses or any salary or financial reward. She also knows that he served on the board of the Land Development Agency and did not take any expenses and did not claim the allowance that could have been given to him because he is genuinely somebody who wants to make the country a better place, believes in his community and wants to contribute. That, and for no other reason, is why he is a supporter of the Minister, Deputy Donohoe. The Deputy asked a question specifically of me. I only heard about this in the last couple of days. I could not tell her for sure whether it was Friday or Saturday but it was only in the last couple of days. I had no prior knowledge of it before that point. On the other questions she asks, I think she would have to ask them of the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, later today. He is willing to answer questions.

I am simply asking the logical, reasonable questions that arise from the recent turn of events.The story as told by the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, lacks any credibility whatsoever. The facts, as they have been established so far, are that this businessman, Mr. Stone, made a donation to the election campaign of Paschal Donohoe. The fact is that this donation was not declared. It is also a fact that it was only years later, when confronted with the letter from SIPO, that the Minister moved to clarify any matter. I have asked the Taoiseach, as Head of Government and the leader of Fine Gael, what I think are reasonable questions. Has he asked the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, whether Mr. Stone had any involvement in any of his other election campaigns, including the 2020 election campaign? Did he assist with postering services then?

This is a political chamber. We all know how this plays out if we allow it to become a party political matter. It should not be. We have ethics legislation and standards legislation. It is set up to be independent of this place. In my view, that body should be allowed to do its work, and we should not be so quick to rush to conclusions in that regard. I do not know all the details of Mr. Stone's support for Paschal Donohoe down the years. I think I recall him saying to me that he did not help with the postering in 2020, but I do not know that for sure. However, he is a supporter, and I am sure any donations that have been made since then were declared if they were above the limit. There is a not dissimilar situation here in relation to a €1,000 donation that Deputy McDonald accepted from Jon Dowdall, her friend, somebody who would have been one of her cronies-----

Was the donation to Deputy McDonald, which she took and spent, or was it to her party? There is a difference.

I wish a happy new year to all. What has emerged in the past week about the conduct of not one, but two Fine Gael Ministers is deeply concerning. It raises fundamental questions about standards in public life, standards in public office, trust in politics, the rule of law and the integrity of our democracy. A Minister of State has already resigned without answering any questions and, further, the Minister responsible for ethics reform is now under investigation for undisclosed election donations. It is welcome that the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, will make a statement this afternoon in the Dáil and take questions, but it is regrettable that it appears there will be no facility for responses to our questions. The revelations are all the more concerning when a fringe minority is seeking to sow distrust and attack elected representatives to further a vicious far-right agenda. We all know the power of politics to transform the lives of people but, unfortunately, we know politics can have a dark side too. For many years, our political system was plagued with corruption and grubby deals. For decades, we in the Labour Party fought to stamp out corruption. We called out corruption in the planning system when it took place years ago. We sought to pass ethics laws. We ensured the passage of the right to freedom of information, protection for whistleblowers and a register for lobbyists. We ensured there would be limits on donations and on the power to purchase influence. However, on the necessary further ethics reform, unfortunately since 2016 this and the previous Government have sat on their hands. Both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have failed to move further with the necessary reforms. Deputy Brendan Howlin's Public Sector Standards Bill 2015, which would overhaul SIPO and give it the necessary extra powers it has long sought, was last debated in this Chamber exactly seven years ago, on 20 January 2016. It was then stalled and shelved by the Government in July 2020.When will the Taoiseach commit to introducing that Bill? Who will be responsible for taking it through the House? Will it be the Taoiseach? A Minister of State resigned last week when it was revealed that false information was submitted on a planning application. That cannot be the end of it. As leader of Fine Gael, can the Taoiseach say that this is behaviour his party tolerates? Does he
think it is tenable for a Deputy to remain in his party having given false information on a planning application that he benefited from? What we know about the donation in 2016 to the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, is still limited. We still need to know more. It appears that a company and its owner picked up the costs of his election postering without his knowledge, which is a highly unusual arrangement to say the least. How can the Minister be clear that this was a donation to the party and not to the candidate to help his re-election? How can we trust what has been disclosed to date, in particular the commercial value Fine Gael has put on the donation? Where is the evidence the Taoiseach has to back up the revised disclosure? Can he tell us how the commercial value was determined? Is it common practice in Fine Gael for businesspeople to pick up postering costs for individual candidates?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-18 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	17	It is important to state, as a matter of fact, that the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, is not yet under investigation by the standards commission. A complaint has been received. That body will consider the complaint. It will then decide whether there should be a preliminary inquiry and, on foot of that, it will decide whether there should be an investigation. It is important that people do not claim that the Minister is under investigation when that is factually not the case. That may change but it is not the case today. On the cost of renting of van, renting a van is an easy thing to do. When I first heard about this at the weekend, I looked up what it costs to rent a van. Anyone can see what it costs to rent a van for the course of a day, or a few hours, as the case may be. It is well under €200. People run their election campaigns in different ways. I do not know how the Deputy runs hers but, at least during the past couple of general elections, I have always run mine through the Fine Gael Dublin West party account and not through a personal account. I appreciate other people do things differently, especially if there are two candidates from the same party in a constituency, where it might be done through a different mechanism. However, I have done it through a constituency account. I imagine that is what the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, has done as well. It is important to say that this donation was one that the Minister did not receive in person, nor did he give the donation in person. It was a third party that paid people to put up some posters for the Minister. It was a third party that gave a donation and gave money to a fourth, fifth and sixth party. The Minister was not aware of it. I imagine plenty of people in this House are wondering whether it is possible somebody could have done something similar in their circumstances. Maybe that is not the case but say, for example-----

Indeed, his response has shed no clarity and perhaps obscured things further. The crucial point is that we cannot see any return to the bad old days, when politics in Ireland was plagued by corruption, grubby deals and cronyism. We cannot see that. We need to be sure that will not happen again. I repeat my question. In respect of the former Minister of State, Deputy English, is that behaviour, namely, the submission of false information on a planning application which resulted in a benefit to the individual, tolerated by the Taoiseach's party? I cannot put it any clearer than that. What action is the Taoiseach taking on that, as leader of Fine Gael?Did the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, receive a written acknowledgement, as required by SIPO guideline 1.3.4, confirming that this was a donation to the party and not to the candidate? What evidence is there that the employees were paid personally rather than through a corporate account to put up the posters? Is it acceptable to the Taoiseach that there was such a long delay between the Minister apparently becoming aware of this inadvertence or error in disclosure and the rectification of that error, which came only as recently as the past few days? Is that delay in rectifying the disclosure acceptable to the Taoiseach?

He acknowledges and apologises for that. He should have made changes to his declaration when he became aware of this a few months ago. He deeply regrets that he did not because we would not be in this position today had he done so. Lots of people in this House, from all parties, have amended their declarations retrospectively when they became aware of omissions. The Minister deeply regrets that he did not do that at the time. With regard to responsibility for policy on these matters, he is recusing himself from that until all of these matters are resolved. We intend to transfer responsibility to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael McGrath, by means of transfer order. He has been working in this area for the past two and a half years and knows it already. It makes sense for him to have those powers transferred to him.

Some very nasty, sinister and hateful forces on the far right want to blame the problems in our society on desperate and vulnerable refugees fleeing war and poverty. It may be better for them to focus on what is really the epitome of the problems we face in the world, that is, the world's billionaires and multinationals discussing the future of the world, particularly in light of the Oxfam report, which reveals the absolutely gross, grotesque and growing inequality that exists between the super rich in this country and across the world and the vast majority of people, who are crushed with the cost-of-living crisis and housing crisis and who are impacted by the crisis in our hospitals and in many of our public services. The facts revealed in the report are shocking. It states that the number of people in this country who have more than €50 million in personal wealth has doubled since 2012; the number of people worth nearly €5 million each has doubled in the same period and now comprises up to 20,000 people; the richest 1% of our population now have more than a quarter of all the wealth; and the richest 10% have more than 64% of all the wealth while the poorest 50% have just 1.1% of the wealth. These are grotesque and growing inequalities.  Will the Taoiseach now consider something we have called for a long time and that Oxfam is now calling for, which is the introduction of a wealth tax? Oxfam says that a modest tax on those who have wealth in excess of €4.7 million would raise more than €8 billion in extra revenue in one year.Imagine what that would do to alleviate the crushing blows of the cost-of-living crisis, to address the housing crisis-----

I know some people believe it is part of some form of world government and we are all going off there to make decisions on behalf of the elites that secretly run the world. I guarantee that if that was the case I would go for the whole thing, but I will not because I have other things to do. Regarding the Deputy's question, we already have wealth taxes in Ireland. Our income tax system is regarded as being one of the most progressive in the world. Less than 1% of people here pay more than 20% of income tax. We have the local property tax, and the bigger and more valuable a person's property, the more property tax the person pays. Those who have modest properties pay modest amounts and those who have no property pay nothing at all. We also have a capital acquisitions tax. This is a tax on inheritance, for example, and gifts. Oxfam points out in its report that two thirds of countries have no inheritance tax at all if moneys are passed on to people's direct descendants. In Ireland, it is 33%. We also have a capital gains tax, which is a wealth tax on the share of businesses, property and shares, for example. Our tax there, again, is 33%, while the average across the world is only 18%. This gives a good example of the kind of wealth taxes that already exist in our country. I did have a look at the report from Oxfam. It is interesting. I will look at it properly again when I have a bit more time. I do have two questions about the report, not for the Deputy but perhaps for others. One is around the methodology. Is it net wealth or gross wealth? We all know from past experience that some people who are billionaires on paper, or appear to be billionaires, are actually fur coat and no knickers. They have a lot of money and assets on paper, but they also have a lot of debts and liabilities and their actual net wealth is negative or small. It seems this report takes their gross wealth, and this would make it somewhat inaccurate to me. The second thing is that the report specifically refers to eight Irish billionaires. When we look at the names of those eight Irish billionaires, however, and most of them would be names that are familiar to me and the Deputy and most people in this House, most of them do not live here, do not have their business based here and do not keep their assets here. Why does the Deputy think this is? It is precisely because we have a tax regime that taxes wealth much more so than other countries.

There is no conspiracy; it is naked, brazen greed. The Taoiseach's answer does not explain how the number of people with more than €50 million or the number of people with up to €5 million in personal wealth has doubled. It does not explain how corporate profits have trebled in the last ten years while ordinary people are suffering. Let me give the Taoiseach an example, just one of dozens that I encountered over Christmas and the new year, of a woman and her husband with an income of €500 per week from invalidity pension and half carer's allowance. The husband has Alzheimer's disease. When they got a housing assistance payment, HAP, tenancy, he was working. Five years later, the rent has increased and those people now pay €275 a week of a contribution to rent from the €500 they have in total. They cannot make ends meet. Her rent was due on 13 January and she cannot pay. She has a gas bill of €700 unpaid and a new one to arrive later this month. Apparently, when she looked for an exceptional needs payment, she was told "No" because she had received two payments last year. This is the reality that ordinary people are facing. What Oxfam pointed out was that the gross and growing inequality in wealth had a lot to do with what it called "greedflation", profiteering by big corporations-----

One thing the Deputy is right about is we have seen a major increase in corporate profits around the world and Ireland in recent years and as a consequence of that, we in Ireland have benefited from massive receipts in corporation profit tax from those companies.

Mary passed away on 4 January at Portiuncula hospital after waiting more than seven hours for a bed before finally being admitted to a ward. Mary had been forced to leave a bed in Roscommon hospital to go onto a trolley in Portiuncula hospital. Her daughter, Edel, spoke to the Roscommon Herald and she said:My poor mother went to Portiuncula unwell, and it is not so much a case that she died because of it, it is more her passing was not as peaceful as it could and should have been. The crisis increased her suffering and ours. The system is hurting people beyond belief.Sadly, this is one of many personal stories emerging around this country. If we delve down into the numbers of patients waiting on trolleys to date in 2023 and analyse this as a percentage of the number of beds in each hospital, which I believe is a far better reflection of the pressure that each hospital is under, Portiuncula hospital, with just 157 beds and an average of 22 patients on trolleys each day this year, has a 40% greater demand on its beds than the headline-grabbing university hospital in Limerick and a whopping 325% greater demand on beds than Galway university hospital. We should not be surprised because not one additional bed has been put into the hospital since the emergency department was closed at Roscommon hospital in 2011 even though Portiuncula has taken the bulk of the Roscommon referrals. In June 2020, I wrote to the then Minister for Health, the chief executive of the HSE and the Secretary General of the Department of Health pointing out the desperate situation in Portiuncula, which at that point had lost one in ten of its beds due to the Covid reconfiguration at the hospital. At that stage, the hospital had put forward a proposal seeking two modular buildings, one of which was to provide the space needed in its emergency department to deal with the present demands that were being placed upon it. Thirty-one months later we are still awaiting a decision from HSE estates as an average of 42 patients a day lie on trolleys in that hospital. We need to see this project proceeded with - the modular emergency department - as a matter of urgency. I am asking for the Taoiseach's intervention and for his intervention in similar proposals in other hospitals that can ease the current crisis that we are facing.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-18 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	52	I thank the Deputy. I want to say at the outset how very sorry I am to hear about Mary's experience of our health service. For most people, their experience of our health service is very good - that is what they tell us in patient experience surveys - but I know for some people it is very bad. Mary, sadly, is just one example of many others that all of us could recount to this House. It is not acceptable that she experienced that.We know that overcrowding in emergency departments and delays in getting to a ward result in reduced patient outcomes. We know from international research from the UK, Western Australia and other parts of the world that it can result in higher mortality also. This is what makes it a very serious situation. We are working on this as a Government. In less than three years the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, has added more than 1,000 beds to our acute hospital system, including community beds. We have 6,000 more doctors and nurses working in our health service than we did three years ago. We are doing a lot to keep people out of hospital in the first place with, for example, more funding for general practice and community intervention teams. There are also record levels of funding for home care so that people can get out of hospital when they are well. That is still a work in progress and there is much more to be done in this regard. We are catching up on period when there was very little investment because the country could not afford it. In the coming years I will work very closely with the Minister Deputy Donnelly, and with the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and the whole Government, to see what we can do to speed up health capital projects. Too many of them are taking too long. Some happen pretty quickly, and I am impressed with what happened in Kilkenny and the Mater, but some are going on forever and it is not okay. I accept the point the Deputy made that overcrowding in a small emergency department in a small hospital can be worse, and I have seen it. I have been to small emergency departments such as in Naas and Portiuncula where ten or 11 patients on trolleys block up the corridors and the whole space in a way that would not be the same in a large emergency department with a lot of floor space. The point the Deputy made is valid in this regard. The budget allocation for the hospital has increased to €85.6 million from less than €70 million five years ago. The outpatient department will be relocated to a new modular build on-site. That will allow the existing outpatient area to be converted into a 12-bed ward with eight single rooms and two twin rooms en suite. This area will accommodate service users requiring isolation rooms and end-of-life care. I am told that could be ready for occupancy later this year. The Deputy will also be aware that enabling works have started on a new 50-bed ward block. This will provide 50 en suite single rooms allowing for the relocation of two medical wards from existing buildings and general improvement in the services to patients. We believe that could be open next year. Saolta University Health Care Group has also advised us the ward block could accommodate additional development, and enabling works have been completed with that in mind.

I am asking the Taoiseach for his intervention on this. He is correct that the second modular building at the hospital was to facilitate the relocation of the outpatient department and provide those ten additional single beds to replace some of the beds lost to Covid reconfiguration. This project was to be completed as part of the 2020-21 winter initiative. These beds will not be available until this summer. As the Taoiseach said, a 50-bed ward block is being constructed at Portiuncula University Hospital. This is thanks to the intervention of the then Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, on my behalf. Sadly, these are only replacement beds. What we need to see at the hospital is more beds. Again at my instigation, provision has been made to facilitate a further 50-bed ward block at the hospital. I ask the Taoiseach that plans be expedited to proceed with this extension while the builders are on-site.

As he knows, the Minister for Health is with us this afternoon and will certainly speak on it later. We will work together to do anything we can to speed up increasing capacity in Portiuncula University Hospital, which is all the more necessary since the reconfiguring of Roscommon University Hospital and given the fact that Galway University Hospital is so congested. As I mentioned, the outpatient department is being relocated. This will provide a new 12-bed ward. Work is ongoing with the design team on a prefab extension to the emergency department to give it more space. We are awaiting an updated draft of the plan for the prefab so it can be expanded. We mentioned the 50-bed block earlier. It will open next year. The development of a further 50-bed ward would involve significant reprovision and reconfiguration of the campus and, so far, no capital submission has been made on this. It is something we are open to.The population of the region is only going to increase and get older, and it is unquestionable that we will need further capacity in addition to the 50-bed block that is being built now.

First, the obvious farce of a Minister who has recused himself from SIPO responsibilities presenting to answer questions on SIPO tomorrow is self-evident and it points to the seriousness of the situation in respect of the Minister, Deputy Donohoe. I raise the issue in that regard on "statements", it seems: a statement from the Minister followed by statements or reaction from other parties or groups. That is not satisfactory. What is required is for the Minister to present himself, set out his case and then take questions and answer questions from the Opposition parties and groups.We must insist that that is the form this exchange takes. I also raise the issue of former Minister of State, Deputy Damien English. We have not yet had any word of when Deputy English will present himself, make a statement and take questions from the Opposition. The idea that a choreographed statement from the Minister would suffice is utterly unacceptable.

They are valid questions that many of us have already asked the Taoiseach on the floor of this House. There is precedent for having a statement of this nature where there is an opportunity for a response to be provided. I think the Taoiseach provided a response of that sort himself previously in this House and a back-and-forth was enabled. It was far better as a way to clarify outstanding issues. We also need a statement from former Minister of State, Deputy Damien English. We do not see that listed on this week's schedule. It is important to have the opportunity to clarify these issues relating to two Fine Gael Ministers in this House this week.

The Order of Business as the Ceann Comhairle circulated this morning does not allow for that. It allows for five-minute statements from each of the Opposition parties. Can we get clarification on whether each of those five-minute slots can be used for back-and-forth questions and answers from each of the Opposition parties and the Minister? It is important for that to happen. There is no reason, as I understand it, that could not happen. Will the Taoiseach clarify that, please?

I want to raise what I believe is a scandal. That is the planned deal between Coillte and the UK investment fund, Gresham House. It is essentially the State facilitating and financing a corporate grab by a for-profit investment fund of tens of thousands of hectares of land and forestry in this country. I asked the Chief Whip at the Business Committee last Thursday for an urgent debate in the Dáil about this plan. Small farmers, environmentalists and anybody who cares about the forestry, heritage and land of this country are horrified by this deal, which is a repeat of the disgraceful plan to try to privatise the harvesting rights of Coillte back in 2013, which we protested against and gladly overturned. This deal has to be stopped. At a minimum, I ask for a commitment to an urgent debate in the Dáil about this outrageous plan to privatise Irish forestry.

We have statements before European Council meetings and post European Council meetings. When will we have pre-visit to Davos statements? The Taoiseach said he will only be there for a day and a half and that he would like to be there for a week. Frankly, I do not care how long he stays there. Professor Schwab said that it has penetrated many cabinets around the world. I know the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael McGrath, is going to Davos. I do not know how many more Ministers and how many hangers-on are going. What the hell is going on over there? Why is the Taoiseach not responsible for telling this House what the agenda is and, when he comes back, for informing us about it and about whatever bit of Ireland he has sold off or powers he has given to these mighty people? I want to have pre-World Economic Forum statements and post-World Economic Forum statements. We have a precedent with the European Council. We must have one for this.

It is the deal between Coillte and Gresham House, the venture capital fund, on the acquisition of 100,000 ha of forestry across this country.It is raising huge concerns among members of the public. They want to know what is going on, what has been agreed, what the Government was aware of, whether this was signed off by Cabinet and when the Cabinet was made aware of these particular proposals. We need not only a full debate in the House on the provisions of this arrangement but also that the agreement of the House and the Oireachtas as a whole is sought for it and gained before it is progressed any further because it causes huge concern to every single citizen in the State.

Before I ask the Taoiseach to respond, yesterday I received a request from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, under Standing Order 55, to make a statement to the House. As has been set out already, the provision is a matter for my discretion. I decided I would facilitate the making of a statement. It is further at my discretion as to whether Opposition parties' spokespersons could also make statements. I agreed they should. In light of what I am hearing, we might augment the proposal a little later by asking the Minister if he would respond at the end of the contributions-----

Insofar as this has been brought to me and is a matter for my discretion, my approach is to evaluate that request against the competing business of the House that falls to be taken.

I have heard what farmers, the Irish Wildlife Trust and others have to say about it and I am sure we can make time available through the Business Committee, whether here in the Chamber or in the relevant committee, to discuss this matter. I confirm it was not signed off by Cabinet. Coillte is a State-owned enterprise and its board makes its own decisions. There was no memo for information to Cabinet at any point. Deputy English has resigned as a Minister of State. There is no requirement for him to make a statement, as I understand it. Ministers who have resigned in this Dáil have not made statements. It is at their discretion to do so and there is no requirement that Deputy English do so. As to the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, the Ceann Comhairle's proposal is a reasonable one. The Minister will make an opening statement, the different parties' representatives can then make statements and ask questions and he will respond to the questions at the end of that. I do not think we should turn this Chamber-----

They are living in apartments, duplexes and houses that have very serious fire safety and other structural defects. The cost of remediating defects for these homeowners and tenants, defects that they did not cause, can be up to €80,000 per home. I understand that a memo went to the Cabinet on this today. Can the Taoiseach confirm if a redress scheme for these homeowners and tenants will be in place this year? Can he confirm that it will provide 100% redress? Will it be retrospective? What immediate funding will the Government put in place for interim emergency fire safety works?

The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, announced the scheme only in the last couple of hours. It will benefit tens of thousands of people. It is not just about the financial distress and there is also enormous emotional distress for people if they live in a building and the alarm goes off when the fire safety works have not been done. I believe this decision will be a huge relief to tens of thousands of people around the country. To answer the Deputy’s questions, we expect the legislation will take until the end of the year, the scheme will be up and running next year and there will be retrospection for people who have already carried out works. As I am talking about this matter, I should declare a potential interest. I own an apartment in Castleknock. It is the only property I own but it is in a building with defects. While I will not be claiming from the scheme personally, the owners' management company might, and I could be an indirect beneficiary in that regard.

In many cases, they have paid thousands of euro to remedy the defects and are in dire financial straits as a result. The Taoiseach said he is affected personally by this as well. Following the announcement by the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, today, I would like to know whether the redress will amount to 100%. Will owners get back 100% of what they have already spent on remedying defects? We know many people have already spent thousands of euro. Therefore, we need a firm commitment that the scheme will be inclusive and will apply retrospectively to that full extent for those who have already taken the advice of the Government and have already begun or concluded repair works. It is vital that this scheme also marks a definitive end to the arm’s length approach to dodgy developers and builders. We need to hear from the Government its plans to tighten up the planning regulations so that those responsible for putting households at risk will not be put in a position where they can do so again, and so that owners' management companies will be reformed to give residents surety that the same builders will not be in charge of repair works.

I can confirm that it will be 100% redress, that there will be retrospection and that we will be establishing a new independent building regulator to try to make sure this does not happen again. That said, there will be checks and balances. It will not just be a case of people or management companies putting in a claim. It will have to be certified work, legitimately done, and all the rest of it, so there will be checks and balances in the scheme. I think this news will come as an enormous relief to tens of thousands of people and families around the country. I represent a suburban constituency with a lot of apartments and duplexes, and many of them need work done, particularly when it comes to fire safety, but also with regard to water ingress and security. The financial worry of this is huge and the emotional worry is huge, and that will be eased for a lot of people today.

Under the plans, Coillte will source tens of thousands of acres in rural Ireland, plant the trees and manage the forests. The State entity will do all the work with regard to this project - it will do all the heavy lifting - but private international investors will reap the rewards. This is a very lucrative investment for them: it is secure, low risk and profitable. Why is the Government facilitating this land grab by international investors, subsidising this through forestry grant schemes and tax incentives, and pushing up land prices across Ireland? Fine Gael has a track record of putting corporates before community and large investors before community, whether it is on housing or health, and now it appears to be happening on climate action. Why is the State not using some of its €5 billion surplus this year to invest in forestry for the benefit of rural Ireland, for the benefit of our climate targets and for the benefit of biodiversity? The Taoiseach needs to knock this deal on the head now.

Coillte is partnering with our own sovereign wealth fund, the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, and also Gresham House to establish this fund, so we are also investing in this fund.

I welcome that fact, that assurances are being given it will be 100% redress and that it will be retrospective. However, the devil is always in the detail in these things. I would like and, more importantly, tens of thousands affected by this would like to see the details of the new scheme and also that those responsible for these defective buildings will be chased down, held responsible and forced to contribute to the redress scheme. Also, will the State consider developing its own construction capacity so there is capacity to do the remediation of these dangerously defective buildings?

Costs already incurred will be covered by the scheme. It is important to say that those who have contracted work, which is either due to start or who are in the middle of that work – approximately 32% of the properties affected are in that category – will also be covered by the scheme. The Deputy can have no doubt that any avenue this Government can use to seek recompense or recourse from those who have created this problem will be taken. We do not want to leave residents in the lurch. We said we would do this, and we are doing it. We have had excellent engagement with homeowner representative groups, which have strongly welcomed the announcement by the Government today.

This goes to the very heart of the functioning of the political system in this country. The reason we have declarations of donations is because we need transparency to see what influence businesses and developers can have on the political system. For decades, this country was hammered by the fact that a golden circle bought influence through donations to Ministers. This created incredible damage that we are still paying for now. In the case of the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, it is reported that the donor in question was nominated to the board of the Land Development Agency shortly after the donation was given, and that the Minister himself named that individual as the chair of the north east inner city initiative. I do not say that individual has gained in any manner, financially, as a result of that, but we need to make sure there is transparency. We need to be able to tease this out. Is it not important that the Taoiseach would facilitate a debate on this issue now?

The commission has received a complaint and it will decide whether to carry out a preliminary inquiry. We should not seek to take its role. In my view, that would not be the right thing to do as a Parliament.

The Save St. Brigid's Hospital committee is coming to Dublin tomorrow to present to the Committee on Public Petitions. It is the final effort in trying to get the hospital reopened. We saw how badly needed step-down facilities and beds were in the recent crisis at Christmas, which is ongoing in January. St. Brigid's is a functioning hospital with an excellent staff and a good report from HIQA. The report has been twisted and turned to suit the narrative. Hospitals should not be closed. Will the Government reopen St. Brigid's without further ado to ensure that the patients of east Waterford, south Tipperary and south Kilkenny will have a place to go for respite and, above all, access to the hospice cancer care beds?

There are seven new jobs involved. The hospital offers support to people with long-term illness, pain management and diabetes. The facility is working well, and it is still offering healthcare to the people of Carrick-on-Suir and the surrounding areas.

Many mica-affected homeowners are being put under severe pressure by banks in respect of worthless homes on which they have mortgages. Many homeowners are still mortgage holders who will not be able to remortgage to repair their homes. To date, mica-affected homeowners have not heard any response regarding those contacts and what progress was made. Could the Minister update the House in this regard?

We are doing that. We have been engaging with the local authorities on the draft regulations and we will receive feedback from them. I expect to meet with the homeowner representatives within the next two weeks. How mortgage lenders are dealing with some homeowners is an issue that has been raised with me, which we will continue to address with the banks. I will address this directly with the residents. I am pleased to note that we are seeing applications, particularly from counties Donegal and Mayo, being processed effectively and efficiently through the system. We have a lot more to do in that space, but all those homeowners will receive the benefit of the revised 100% redress scheme. I will keep the Deputy informed of our engagement with regard to the banks on the mortgage issues.

I am also pleased that we have this opportunity to review it. We will continue to do so as we implement it in the coming year and continue to evolve it to meet what is the greatest challenge of our time, namely, to protect the stability of our climate system for future generations and to avoid the worst impacts of climate change that we already know is inevitable because of the change that is happening in our atmosphere. For clarity, we have known the science of this for some 35 years or more. Going back to that period in the late 1980s, the concentration of CO2 equivalent greenhouse gases in the atmosphere was some 350 parts-per million, ppm. It took a number of years before the world started to address the reality of that science. A key moment in that regard was in 2015 – the signing of the Paris climate agreement - when 193 countries came together to commit to do what it would take to stabilise our climate, and doing so with all sorts of risks in avoiding crossing over tipping points that would see runaway climate change. When that was agreed only eight years ago, the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere had gone up to approximately 400 ppm. The frightening thing that raises alarm and the need for action is that today it is just short of 420 ppm. We are not going in the right direction. The scale of change has not been delivered. We must act now. This is the critical decade. What the Paris climate agreement said was that to reduce the risk of runaway climate change we must keep the global average temperature below 1.5°C. We must get to net-zero emissions by the middle of this century. For a developed country such as Ireland, that means we must halve our emissions this decade and be at net zero by 2050. It is important to review it and to know where we are coming from in this regard. The initial legislation relating to a climate Act was set out in 2015, and the first climate plan was devised in 2017. An appropriate and correct Supreme Court judgment stated that it had not sufficiently addressed the scale of change we needed to make. It was on the back of that, and also the citizens’ assembly established in 2017, that we started on the path that brings us to this plan that we have today. At the joint Oireachtas committee in 2018, all parties committed to a much more ambitious approach to how we reduce our emissions. In 2019, under the then Minister, Deputy Bruton, who deserves credit, a broad approach was initiated which we are still following, whereby we look at every aspect of the approach we need to take in government and set clear actions and timelines that we need to meet the objectives. The programme for Government was established with climate as part of the three central ambitions of the Government. These are to address the housing crisis, reform our healthcare systems and show leadership in delivering climate action and emissions reductions. We followed the science. We stuck to what the Paris Agreement on climate stated we would have to do, which, in our case, meant an emissions reduction of approximately 7% per annum. This was based on a reduction target dating from 2018 because that was the period, during our entering into and signing of that programme for Government, for which we had the latest statistics. That is the broad context within which this plan is set out. The Government has made significant progress through devising the much more thorough and powerful Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021. By any analysis, this legislation is seen globally as the most ambitious, or the most rigorous, in holding the Government to account. The way it is set out requires a long-term vision and an iterative evolving plan with sectoral targets. Each Minister responsible for the relevant area has to show how we are meeting the overall targets. Since that period, sectoral emissions targets were developed in summer 2022, as required under law, which range in ambition from a 75% reduction in emissions for the likes of the electricity sector and a 50% reduction in emissions in transport, while industry varied between reductions of 35% and 40% down to 25% for agriculture. We are clear on the responsibilities each sector has. The climate action plan, agreed by the Government just before Christmas, turns those sectoral targets into specific measures in each of those sectors that we have to show can deliver the reductions we need. The one exception, which has been debated at length in this House over the past year or so, relates to land use, land use change and emissions, where we committed this year to developing the scientific information we need to be able to make the further reductions that are needed for us to be able to meet our overall reduction target. I would prefer to have done that at the same time as the other sectoral emissions ceilings were being set, but we did not, and do not, have the information available to us to know exactly how we could or would do that. That is why it was more appropriate, as I said, to carry out that scientific analysis as part of the land use review, which I might return to, to make sure that what we are setting out is credible, achievable and based on good science. That is the only way we will be able to address this incredibly complex and challenging issue effectively. I will add briefly, and this is key, that this process is iterative. It is one where the plan will evolve each year. Additional information and measures, changing circumstances, and reacting to what is actually happening, mean that this is a plan that is due to be revised, and has been, and will be, revised each year, which is the nature of the approach we are taking. That is the right way rather than setting out a ten- or 20-year plan and not actually taking into account what is happening. The key developments in this iteration of the plan, which is much more significant because it now has all the legal force of the 2021 climate Act behind it, and in assessing the report are outlined in chapters 12 to 16. I will concentrate my contribution on plans within the electricity industry, the built environment, transport and agriculture. I will briefly go over some of the key commitments in these areas, which frame what will be our whole economy in the coming years, including how we will have to deliver this as a just transition, and how we deliver these significant measures will be fought out and set right. Electricity has the highest reduction target, based on what is achievable and what is in our interest in terms of the security of the country and its economic development. We should not be reliant on expensive imported fossil fuels but instead rely on our own resources. The commitment to go from some 5 GW of onshore wind power today to 6 GW in 2025, and subsequently 9 GW, is critical. We know we can do this. We know that we have a comparative competitive advantage. It is a sensitive issue in the context of planning and other local community issues, but that is a development we need to get right. In my expectation, a large part of the new power will be delivered by the likes of Coillte, Bord na Móna and others, when it comes to some of the land-bank areas in the midlands and elsewhere where we can do this in a sensitive way through working with local communities. At the same time, this is a significant change in development from previous plans. We are setting a target within the next three years, which is incredibly challenging, to go to 5 GW of solar power and 8 GW by 2030. In the past 20 years, we have developed hardly any solar power. We started to ramp it up to 200 MW or 300 MW in the past year. That will exponentially increase in the coming years, as we put solar on our school rooftops and people's solar homes start to be deployed, but also as solar in the field is developed at scale. We need that level of deployment if we are to meet our targets, including our interim 2025 target under the three- to five-year budgeting framework. Reducing the cost to consumers and householders is also a key, critical, new development that will require huge effort for us to deliver it but we can and will do that. Similarly, the development in this decade of 7 GW of offshore wind will include some 5 GW in phase 1 and phase 2 projects, which we expect will largely be on the east coast, before moving to southern and western waters. Offshore wind will also be deployed to convert energy into hydrogen, ammonia or other molecules that will give us a storage and export capability, which is central to our economic, and not just environmental, future. As part of this renewable electricity future, we will also require 2 GW of further gas power infrastructure in order to be able in those periods when there are cold, high-pressure conditions - such as the likes of what happened before Christmas or this week - to have the back-up power to meet our energy needs. That will only be one component. A significant role will be played by batteries, pump storage, demand management flexibility, the use of smart metering and the use of some of the solutions in other areas, such as transport and heating, to give us storage capabilities and back-up flexibilities. This is the new industrial revolution of our time. We are good at it as a country. We are one of the leading countries in the world at integrating renewable power into a synchronised electricity grid system. We need to use that expertise, advantage and the capabilities we have through EirGrid, the ESB, the private sector, Bord na Móna, Coillte and other State companies to make this happen. This is also a choice we need to make in industry, first, because of our national climate law but, second, because of European law. Some 20 Bills are going through the European Council and Parliament to trial out processes with the Commission at present, which will transform the European economy in this more digital, low-carbon, green future that the EU is setting us on. These are even higher targets than the ones set out in national law. We have to do this for Irish legal reasons to be part of the European solution but, in addition, there is no option not to take this route because industrial and business sectors are also going in this direction. They will look to work with governments and communities that are successful or have set themselves on the same path. In industry, particularly in the area of heat, which tends to be the area that does not get attention but is the one we now need to focus on most to meet our targets, an inevitable transition is happening that we need to lead and accelerate rather than try to resist and hold back. Industry will deploy the use of heat pumps, in addition to them being used in our homes. For any high-grade heat, beneath perhaps a 200°C heat requirement, I see us switching away from the use of fossil fuels. We need to switch towards heat pumps instead from more than 50% by the middle of this decade to up to three quarters of new heating sources coming from that sort of supply by the end of this decade. We have everything to gain from that. There are significant efficiencies and competitive advantages but it is a transition that has to start and happen now. The second element in the responsibility of industry relates to the construction sector.I see the use of higher quantities of clinker within cement production as another way in which we can get significant reductions in CO2 emissions from the construction sector and industry. We also have to work on the percentage of embodied carbon within our building sector, including the use of cross-laminated wood products and other embodied carbon systems within our buildings. It is not just that we have to build all of these houses for people; we also need to start building with timber in new and different ways, based in the circular economy, that embed carbon in our buildings. By the end of this decade, up to 30% of the emissions reductions could come from that approach. My last point on this industrial sector is that the whole emphasis will be on efficiency and this circular economy which, as I have said, is at the centre of the European Union strategy. The energy efficiency directive and the renewables directive, which has been agreed by the Council, will still steer us in that direction. We need to go with it rather than resist it. That is the best and most secure and stable form of economy for our country in the future.  I will refer to the built environment. I know I am touching on these key areas only fleetingly but getting this right was a key part of the substance of discussion within government. In the coming years, we have to get to net-zero emission and then zero emission buildings so that our buildings can be, as I have said, part of the solution rather than part of the problem. This is all doable. The technology exists in domestic heat pumps and in better insulation and air management and ventilation systems within our homes. We have everything to gain from this. It will not work if it is seen as a punitive or negative story. It is about creating healthier homes. It is the social justice project of our time because, by retrofitting our houses, as we plan to systematically do, we will end up with a country in which we can tackle energy poverty. We will be able to tackle it at the source by making sure that our buildings are fit for purpose and healthier. I particularly refer to our social housing stock and those on lower incomes. They are the ones we will prioritise within our retrofit programmes, which are working. We are on target. We introduced that scheme last February. It is innovative and extensive and provides widespread grants. It is delivering. We met our target of retrofitting 27,000 houses last year and we will meet our target again this year as we ramp it up to 37,000 houses. Yesterday, Deputy Harris showed that there has been a significant uptick in the number of people who are looking to work in the industry. We have put 2,000 people through the training and apprenticeship programmes that will help them get into this industry and we are only starting. We are only warming up. This is going to work because it involves a systematic approach over 30 years. The funding is guaranteed. It is being raised from the application of the carbon tax and a range of other different measures. That gives the signal to our young people and householders that this is the way to go. I will move to my fourth point. I am conscious of time and, therefore, I cannot address these matters in great detail. I look forward to further debates in this House as we start to deliver. Transport may be the sector in which we have the biggest challenge. We have a problem in that, over the past 50 years, we have developed a car-oriented transport system and a pattern and model of sprawling housing in which it is difficult to achieve a low-carbon system. We are looking at a revolutionary change in transport and at bringing life, housing and activity back into the centre of our villages, towns and cities to reduce the overall volume of transport. We are talking about a quantum shift away from dependency on private cars. It is not about being anti-car or blaming individuals for their lifestyles or the daily choices they have to make. It is about recognising that, if everyone is driving, it will not work for everyone because our roads get clogged and it is not possible to keep up with that. In fact, the more you try to provide solutions by providing more road space, the more traffic you introduce, which sets you on a vicious cycle downwards. We need to change to a virtuous cycle, which is what this plan sets out to do. As I have said, we will do that by reducing the volume of travel. The target we are setting for ourselves is a 20% reduction in car kilometres. We will introduce the measures to deliver that because failing is not an option nor is ignoring the problem.  Like every other sector, transport has to play its part. We will do that through an increase of at least 50% in active travel, although I expect it to go further. We must create safe spaces on our streets and roads, which we have not done. We have created a hostile environment that is scaring people away from active travel solutions and that sees 30% of our morning traffic comprising children being driven to school rather than being able to get there through more sustainable methods that are better for them and their families. That has to change. On a similar note, I will address the increase in public transport that will be needed as we await the big rail-based solutions, which, unfortunately, take time to build. We will introduce demand management measures through road space reallocation and parking strategies to provide the space the buses need to be able to get through traffic more quickly and to work for everyone. That will not be easy. It will require courage and commitment in local authorities across the country but, under the law, those authorities must also now react. They have to develop plans in tune with what the overall climate action plan says we need. That is what we are going to do to deliver change in transport, along with all of the other sectors. I only have a minute and so cannot do full justice to the whole of my last point. Agriculture must also play its part. I believe it will do so and that it will achieve more because doing so will be good for Irish agriculture. Reducing our use of fertilisers is essential to meeting our climate targets and will also save farmers money. We will move towards a less intensive system but I believe we can get paid a higher price for our produce in that system. There will be a smaller national herd but the critical thing for farmers is their family income and how we protect family farms as we do this. We will increase their income by investing in anaerobic digestion, supporting moves to diversify towards tillage and other sectors and bringing in income from forestry and solar power, as I mentioned earlier. The key project for this year is advancing the land use review, which will give us a steer as to how to make further reductions in the area of land use, implement the nature restoration law here, deliver the type of forestry we need to restore biodiversity and reduce emissions and protect rural Ireland and see it thrive in a low-carbon future, which is possible and essential for this country's future and for the security and future of our children.

I will take ten minutes and she will take five. I welcome the opportunity afforded by these statements. I ask the Minister to reflect on the fact that this is a new project, coming on the back of the sectoral emissions ceilings and the first climate action plan. It is based on documents published a couple of days before Christmas. We have not yet got the annex of actions. I ask the Minister to consider whether there is a better way to bring this forward or a better timeline in which this would not be discussed so close to Christmas and in which we would have the annexe of actions at the earliest opportunity. We have not received a hard copy of the climate action plan yet. I accept that this is a relatively new process. If there is an opportunity to improve on it, as I believe there is, let us do so. In saying that, I acknowledge that the climate action plan itself and the annexe of actions provide a strong framework for documenting the exact measures that will be taken by Government. Whether we agree with them is a different question but they do document the measures and allow those of us in the Opposition to hold the Government to account in respect of them. I acknowledge that. The Minister has said we are going in the wrong direction globally. We are also going in the wrong direction in Ireland as regards emissions reductions. In fact, we are not realising emissions reductions; our emissions are increasing. As time goes by, we are eating further and further into the time period of our carbon budgets and into the emissions ceilings they provide. If we continue on our current trajectory, there is a real risk that we will max out or exhaust our first carbon budget well in advance of 2025. There is significant detail in the climate action plan and a ten-minute statement will not address all of it. I will break it down into a number of areas. There is broad political consensus as regards the ambition. That is set out in the science.There is a great level of detail in the action plan and a ten-minute statement is not going to address all of it. I will break it down into several areas. There is broad political consensus regarding the ambition and this is set out in the science. There are many areas where I and my party would be critical in saying we are moving too slowly. The path in some areas we can contest, while in other areas the path is quite clear but we are moving too slowly. I will touch on some of these areas in respect of renewables. In other areas, retrofitting, for example, I will contend that we are on the wrong path and our schemes are designed incorrectly. It is the same with electric vehicles, EVs. We accept the targets and want to meet them, but the path designed by the Government is not the correct one. It is acknowledged by everybody that there is a real need for additional quality information in several areas, including land use and agriculture. Regarding the financial end of this, work is being done in the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance. Let us make that happen as quickly as possible. A point that I have made to the Minister before is that I see there is a move in respect of the governance structure and accountability and new mechanisms within the Department of the Taoiseach. The Minister needs to continue to push that. There is a need for accountability within the Department of the Taoiseach but also within the individual Departments. We have seen this at the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action where we have struggled to get responses and engagement from individual Departments. It is frustrating and my concern is that it shows a lack of priority in this regard within those Departments. There needs to be an absolute focus, not by 2030 but by the end of the year. Sinn Féin published its vision for renewable energy and outlined a number of measures that need to be taken. There needs to be increased ambition regarding the proportion of community, State-owned and domestic renewables. We must empower our strong State agencies. It is great to have them. We must empower communities. We must see the guidelines updated that have been on the books for far too long. If we are to deliver on the ambition for onshore and offshore wind, we need to have community buy-in. We can achieve this if we take a particular approach. We need investment in ports, the grid and the planning system. I raise this point with the Minister regularly and I am sure he is aware of it but we need an identified workforce plan. I understand An Bord Pleanála has come forward with that. Is it up to scratch? Are those people in place? Will they be in place to deliver and assess the applications coming the Minister's way? We need reform of the public service obligation, PSO. It is regressive between large energy users and residential energy users and also between residential energy users. The PSO needs to be reformed to ensure fairness. On retrofitting, we have published a policy and had a Dáil debate on this issue. The Minister is not taking on board the points made by me and others in the Opposition. We and the Climate Change Advisory Council, CCPC, have stated that shallow retrofit need to be introduced at pace. Up to 500,000 homes would benefit from shallow retrofits today. Far too many people cannot access schemes because they are not eligible for them or do not have the money to do so.  I appreciate that we need to scale up in respect of capacity. The Government needs to ensure the resources are applied in the most efficient and effective way possible. Sinn Féin has set out our proposals in A Fairer Retrofit Plan, which looks at taking an area-based approach. This area-based approach has been employed and I have heard that Fingal County Council has sought for it to be standard practice. In the better energy communities scheme, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, has employed it, almost on a pilot basis, in Cork. This is the approach we need to take. We must identify the coldest and poorest households and retrofit those along with neighbouring homes to allow us to get through as many houses as possible, rather than retrofitting Nos. 6, 11 and 14 in one street this month and then doing Nos. 5 and 8 six months later, with everybody in between left behind. There is a possibility and need to take a fairer and more efficient approach.  Lifting people out of energy poverty is also a key priority. While I welcome the movement on the energy poverty strategy, it needs to happen at pace. It is the same with solar power. There is a great opportunity in this area. As I understand it, however, some energy providers are still not getting paid for the energy they are giving back to the system. This needs to be addressed. Again, it is an example of where the Government and the Opposition are on the same page. Why is this not happening in a timely fashion to show people the benefits and opportunities of climate action? Regarding transport, there are great opportunities in the Connecting Ireland plan. I ask the Minister to please prioritise and resource this plan. A sum of €5 million was allocated in its first year. Sinn Féin has committed to allocating €25 million to it in year two. Let us make that happen. I have seen it implemented through the introduction of the 188 bus service. This is a route I have argued for since before I was a Teachta Dála and while still a county councillor. It has been welcomed by the community. Let us make more of this happen. This development is in stark contrast to the Navan rail line, which we are again hearing will not be delivered until 2036. That is far too slow. Communities want this rail line and will appreciate it. It would be a very positive development in the context of climate action. Let us make it happen.

As a Sinn Féin member of the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action, I am acutely aware we are no longer working to prevent climate change. What we are trying to do now is mitigate the impact and keep temperatures as low as possible and any increase as slow as possible. Here in the EU we have had heatwaves, droughts, fire storms, landslides and flooding. Even the temperature anomalies we experienced over Christmas showed that climate change has us firmly in its grip, with experts saying we are already experiencing now what they had thought would happen much further down the line. Our task as legislators, and indeed as citizens, is to ensure that humanity, our so-called civilisation, can continue to exist on Earth, with all its seasons, habitats, flora and fauna and all the things that we took for granted as kids growing up. We hope we will keep these intact for our grandchildren too. With this action plan, though, I am a little worried. I remember only a couple of years ago when, in complete defiance of the science, the current Taoiseach spoke about climate change as if it was something kind of positive that might help us to keep our bills down. As such, I do not envy the Minister's position. This exposes a plastic, populist, soundbite-driven, headline-grabbing approach to climate, as with everything else, including housing, health, refugees. Frankly, the shallow approach has nothing to offer the State or, indeed, the world in the context of the challenges we face. We agree with the objective of cutting emissions by 51% by 2030 and achieving net zero by 2050. It is perfectly clear, however, that the Government's plan is not working and that we need new and far more dynamic climate approaches. Despite the fact that our carbon budget must fall by 4.8% in each year from 2021 to 2025, far from falling in 2021, emissions rose by 5.4%. The Government is kidding nobody but itself. I was reminded this morning that far from imagining ourselves as this greener than green island in terms of ecological integrity, Ireland is considered to be one of the most depleted countries in Europe as regards biodiversity and rewilding.I worry that there is a residual sense in Government that our being a so-called "small open trading economy" will somehow trump what the climate scientist, Professor Kevin Anderson, who came in to us at committee, calls "the molecules of climate change". The molecules of climate change are coming for us whether we are ready for them or not. Sinn Féin is planning across all our Departments because climate effects everything - health, housing, transport, school buses, how we grow our food, how we heat our homes and especially how we get to work around public transport - and that is key to the climate plan. I am starting to feel sorry for the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, because I have his heart broken talking about the appalling state of the buses in north Kildare for people trying to get to work and for my constituents trying to travel to Maynooth University in my constituency. My constituents are desperate to do their bit for climate by getting out of their cars and onto public transport because they see what their children are facing and they want to be able to mitigate it as much as possible but the State must do its bit in return. The bus in north Kildare is either late or a no show. It sails pass them full, with people packed down the aisles and the bus nearly hitting the floor. Buses might seem like a small issue in the climate change plan but it is a significant issue because the poor service is forcing people back into their cars when they know in their heart and soul that they should not be driving. Many of them do not want to drive. My comrades, Deputies O'Rourke, Quinlivan and Guirke, and I introduced a Bill on the need for a hydrogen strategy last year which, I am delighted, passed Second Stage on 14 January. It might sound a bit buzzy to talk about hydrogen in the future the Government loves to live in but we really need a hydrogen strategy. My party's Bill is just through Second Stage and I ask the Minister to have a look at it. My party's plan to give free public transport to under 18s is ready to go. That way the public transport is the no-brainer option and it gets young people into the habit of using public transport and not buying a car. I have spoken to the Minister about that previously. They cannot afford electric vehicles. They are buying the old banger if the bus is not reliable. We have to get the essentials right and we need proper joined-up thinking.

I have stated previously, but it bears repeating, that the delay and missed targets are regrettably characteristic of the Government’s approach to the climate and biodiversity crises. The matter of climate action is so serious, we should have been scheduled for the Dáil and Seanad to debate this updated plan before Christmas and it is somewhat late coming to the House today, in January. Nevertheless, I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute on behalf of the Labour Party to the debate, and I do so in the spirit of working constructively to overcome the immense challenges we face in meeting our necessary climate emission reductions targets. This answer to our collective problem is inherently political, but it should not be partisan. Ireland must lose its reputation as a climate laggard and we must all work together to achieve a better status for us. We are well into the key decade in which we must see our emissions reduced by half. We are already on the precipice of reaching that worrying milestone of 1.5°C global warming. We are mid-way through the first carbon budget, which requires emissions to fall by an average of 4.8% per year, and yet the Environmental Protection Agency has reported that Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions rose by almost 5% in 2021, during a pandemic year. At this rate, we are seriously diminishing the chance of meeting our climate targets. I have to ask if the Minister believes that there will be further slippage in the achievement of these targets. I listened carefully to the Minister's speech. Indeed, there were some welcome announcements today on the roll-out of rapid electric vehicle, EV, charging points. The Minister's points about circular economy are vitally important and I support those. There is much in the climate action plan that is important and significant and yet it is heavy on aspiration but light on delivery. In the section on district heating, for example, all are agreed on the considerable potential of district heating schemes to curb emissions but there has been such a severe lack of delivery and such a severe delay in rolling out schemes, such as in Poolbeg. I visited the Covanta plant some time ago and saw the mechanisms there for achieving district heating systems, and yet no resourcing is put in place to ensure that they would, in fact, be delivered. That is the real problem. To echo the sentiments of Friends of the Earth and other environmentalists, the real test for the Minister and indeed for the Government is to deliver not only ambitions but also outcomes. We need to see serious priority placed on outcomes on climate action, not just by Ministers and Departments, but also by State agencies they oversee. I have raised in this Chamber previously reports in the media, in particular in the Business Post, that elements of Government appear not even to be aiming to achieve their own targets. We have documents released under freedom of information confirming that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is conceding it will not meet its methane emission reduction targets. That is clearly serious, but it is not only the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. I read recent reports about pensions in Ireland in The Journal’s Noteworthy outlet, which has reported that an ambition in the 2019 Climate Action Plan to tighten scrutiny regarding the investment of pension funds in fossil fuels appears to have been quietly rolled back by the Department of Social Protection almost as soon as it was published, and no delivery. I note the absence of any such objective in more recent iterations of the climate action plan. Why are policies such as this falling between the gaps or, indeed, being reversed? We in Labour have repeatedly called for the Department of the Taoiseach and the Taoiseach to take a stronger role in keeping climate action plans on track across Departments and across State agencies. In housing, for example, the Minister has said that Government has met its targets on retrofitting of housing. Let us face it. There is a significant building and deep retrofitting programme in place, with 120,000 dwellings to be retrofitted to BER B2 by 2025 and a goal of 500,000 by 2030. According to the Department’s own reports, construction of public housing slowed between the third quarter of 2021 and the same period last year. Anyone attempting to renovate a home now will know of the effect of inflation on the cost of building supplies. They will know of the difficulties in securing labour. It does not seem that it will be feasible to meet those ambitious retrofitting targets. Does the Minister believe that his Department is sufficiently resourced to ensure retrofitting targets are met and a greater co-ordination between Departments would be vital to see these targets achieved? I will speak finally on the topic of forestry. Too often, the issue of biodiversity and the biodiversity crisis is overlooked in conversations about climate change. In that context and in the context in which we know that forests serve such a vital function as a carbon sink, I want to raise with the Minister the worrying proposal to sell-off land by Coillte. This is a proposal that has raised immense concerns. I have heard numerous people - constituents of mine and people across the country - who are really concerned about this. We in Labour are unequivocal about this. Coillte must adopt a new approach. They must plant more publicly-owned forests and partner with farmers to support farmers in developing new forestry on their own lands to provide a long term sustainable income, as the Minister suggested in his speech, and to help Ireland meet our climate targets. The proposed fund appears not to make any sense in the context of our overall objectives. Indeed, it has united environmentalists and farmers, and all sectors of society, against it. It seems that, under the reported proposal, Coillte will source the land for forestry, carry out the planting and management, but private investment will benefit from State grants and premia. We will see more monoculture forests, driven by a profit motivation. We cannot see how this will either boost biodiversity or support our agriculture sector to meet ambitious targets. Indeed, we think it is wrong for private investors to reap all of the financial benefits. Why is Coillte itself not simply managing these proposed forests and why is the Government not supporting Coillte to do this so that it is done in public ownership? I would like to hear some clarity from the Minister on that. I am aware this was raised earlier and the Taoiseach stated that this was not directly a matter for the Government. I simply do not accept that. The Government must intervene here to ensure that Coillte can be supported in this way. We want to see farmers provided with a new long-term source of income so that we can commit to a sustainable and biodiverse farming sector and a sustainable and biodiverse forestry sector. This is something that requires a urgent response from the Government.

In the first instance, I am delighted to be reappointed as Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works for another while.The climate change we witness in the communities we must visit year in, year out in this country is not in any way political. It does not discriminate on the basis of where these people live, the background they have or the way they vote. It is having a huge impact all over Ireland. If anybody thinks it is not, they should walk in my shoes for a fortnight or three weeks. They should visit places such as Clifden, Bridgetown in County Wexford, Enniscorthy and Crossmolina, a town that has been waiting for so long. There is a constant threat and fear hanging over people with regard to what the weather forecast might bring in the next 24 to 48 hours. This is one side of the equation. The other side of the equation in the immediate term is the issue of how our coastline communities continue to be threatened by rising sea levels. I say continually that we could reduce all of our emissions in the State to zero, which will never happen, and the water levels around us would continue to rise. We cannot have this discussion in a vacuum. We need to speak about adaptation and mitigation. We need to speak about resilience and responsiveness. Before Christmas I visited the city of Liège in Belgium. It was devastated by what can only be described as a climate change event a number of years ago. The statistics from it are terrible. Thirty-nine people died and 100,000 people were directly impacted. There were 11,000 vehicles washed away, 15,000 private dwelling houses were impacted and public buildings were obliterated. The cost to the Government of Wallonia, which is a small state in Belgium, was approximately €6 billion. The question is not whether the same thing can happen in Ireland but when it will happen. We have to address in a very serious way, under a number of legislative headings, planning, resilience and the capacity to respond. The speed at which the OPW as an organisation is allowed to respond is far too slow. Everybody accepts this. When a planning Bill comes before the Dáil in the not too distant future I implore Deputies on all sides of the House to think not of the political implications of what their votes will do when they cast them but about people in Crossmolina, Bantry, Cork, this city of Dublin and communities all over the country that are waiting for the next amount of sewerage, filth, dirt and excrement to pour through their front doors. We in the Office of Public Works implore the Oireachtas and our colleagues in the European institutions to deal with this issue quickly. What is happening around us is not just about emissions. It is also about adaptation and mitigation. If we do not deal with it in the not too distant future, we will have an event such as that which occurred in Wallonia in our country and lives will be lost. People speak about climate migration. Climate migration has started in Ireland. As I speak, houses are being knocked in County Roscommon because of an intractable situation caused by climate change and the rise of a turlough. People have to leave their homes. Collectively, everybody in the House has responsibility in this regard. It is not about the Government and the Opposition. Everybody has to stand in front of the mirror and ask themselves whether it is appropriate in 2023 that people in Roscommon are leaving their homes because of a planning system that will not allow their properties to be protected. I implore the House, on behalf of those who work for the Office of Public Works and the outdoor staff of local authorities, to deal with this issue.

I will try to raise as many issues as I can in a very short time. The first thing we need to do is progress offshore energy. There are a number of elements to this. We need fast, efficient and transparent administrative systems. We need to change the legal systems so decisions are made in good time. We also need to ensure community buy-in. I am concerned the community funds do not specify the geographic areas where the money should be spent. There is major concern in my constituency that the money will be spent away from the most affected communities. I want to touch on the importance of creating storage of electricity. Hydrogen is a very obvious example. We need to expedite this. I notice in the Minister's statement that he is giving us three buses a day to the nearest town. The reality for those living where I live is that the vast majority of people do not want to go to the nearest town. They want to go to Galway because it has two universities, a hospital and major employment. What do we find? We find that people are using the buses but they have two main problems. One is that the buses are full by the time they are halfway to Galway on all of the major arterial routes, including Headford, Clarinbridge, Spiddal and Oughterard. Another issue is that it is hard to believe that in this day and age no bus leaves Galway for Clifden later than 6.10 p.m. It is absolutely incredible. I am very concerned about the corporatisation of the ownership of land with regard to forestry. We could get the same amount of planting done by farmers if the incentives were there. We spent long enough trying to get our own land back not to give it away willy-nilly. I cannot understand why we cannot work with the farmers and farmer co-operatives to ensure the necessary planting. The next point I would like to raise is the feed-in tariffs. Hundreds of people in my constituency, particularly in rural areas, are mad to sell solar power to the grid but they keep getting the push-off from the companies that have promised to give them a feed-in tariff. Then we speak about trying to persuade people to go green. I understand charging systems will be put on the motorways. We should always watch the small print. On the news this morning, "main routes" were mentioned but this refers to motorways. The reality is that this means the counties of Sligo, Mayo, Roscommon, Leitrim, Donegal and Cavan will once again be excluded.
#EmerHiggins	unknown-#EmerHiggins-party	unknown-#EmerHiggins-dob	unknown-#EmerHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-18 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	203	I am delighted that on the first sitting day of the Dáil in 2023 climate is the top of the agenda. This is where it needs to be. It is not just climate but climate action. Our action plan for this year is critical. There is no doubt that solving the climate crisis is a priority for Irish people. Unfortunately, while awareness and the will to make change is growing, so too are temperatures, sea levels and the number of climate disasters we see. This is why the climate action plan needs teeth. It cannot be advisory. It has to be actionable and enforceable. The 2023 action plan puts climate solutions at the centre of our social and economic development. This year's plan is the first to be placed on a statutory footing. Previous climate plans indicated what should be done. This plan makes those measures law, legally obliging Departments, agencies and local authorities to follow the plan. This is a part of the plan I want to take the time to welcome. The sectoral emissions ceilings of the action plan are significant. The cornerstone of our climate response is our commitment to reduce emissions. It is also a pillar of the programme for Government, with targets of net zero by 2050 and a 51% reduction by 2030. Recently, a constituent wrote to me stating that nationally only bold actions will do now and it is long past time for half measures and baby steps. I want to put those views of my constituent on the record. We are two years into our first five-year carbon budget and, worryingly, our emissions are only growing. This underpins the urgent need to reduce our emissions across every sector to turn the tide. The sectoral ceilings and the ability to hold Departments, agencies and local authorities accountable will be vital to allow us to turn the tide, as will Government actions that enable people to go green. The Minister knows this and I commend him, and his officials and team, on all of the work that has gone into the action plan because it will deliver change in Ireland.
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-18 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	204	We cannot speak about climate action without speaking about forestry. I have repeatedly said in the House that if we fail on forestry, we will fail on climate action. The Government is failing dramatically.The programme for Government sets out an annual target of 8,000 ha per year in new afforestation, but instead the Government has overseen the near entire collapse of Irish forestry. We are now planting fewer trees than we were during the Second World War. Under a Fianna Fáil Minister and a Green Party Minister of State, forestry outputs have got worse since this Government came into office. Rather than engaging with the forestry and timber sectors, and farmers and local communities, to address the core issues that have led to the current dysfunction, Ministers have organised photocalls and press conferences and commissioned report after report, but all the while the crisis in forestry has intensified. In an all too familiar story, the answer of the Government appears to be to facilitate the sale of thousands of hectares of Irish land to a British investment vehicle. We are told the Green Party Minister of State knew, as far back as March 2021, about Coillte's plan to use such a private vehicle to acquire land. Yet following the recent formal announcement by Coillte of its proposed arrangement with the Gresham House funds, Ministers have pretended they are neutral observers. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is the shareholder, on behalf of the Irish people, in Coillte and he can and should instruct Coillte to stall this plan immediately. The Government can and should state categorically that it will not permit the use of €2 billion plus of Irish taxpayers' money to facilitate this land grab. This joint venture is not about climate. It is not even about forestry. Gresham House has confirmed that 8,000 ha of its Irish portfolio will consist of existing forestry land and as little as 3,000 ha will be bare land for new tree planting. From the perspective of Gresham House, this is all about corporate profit. It is a typical approach that sums up the Green Party in government, an approach that points the finger at ordinary workers, families and communities, while the Government fails to reach every single climate objective it sets. A good forestry policy is one that delivers for the environment, for communities and for local economies. The Coillte joint venture with Gresham House will deliver in none of those areas, just as the Government has delivered in none of these areas. The Minister should, therefore, use this debate as an opportunity to confirm that the Government will stop this scandalous venture immediately.
#ChrisAndrews	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-party	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-dob	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-18 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	205	Carbon emissions, climate change, the climate action plan, COP26, and COP27 are undoubtedly very important to us all, but they mean very little to those living in Dublin City Council flat complexes. The Government talks about this scheme and that scheme, but none of them impact on residents living in Countess Markievicz House or Whitefriar Gardens. The Government regularly announces how many schemes it has provided to help households to reduce emissions, but the tenants in Bishop Street or Rathmines Avenue do not see or feel any benefit from all these announcements. They are living in neglect and have been neglected for too long. I was in McDonagh House and Pearse House recently meeting with residents and, almost without exception, every flat had serious dampness and mould problems, the level of which has serious health impacts on young and old. One family had an elderly parent who was receiving dialysis three times per week. The seals are broken on the windows and the cost of heating is huge, and this is clearly not healthy for this gentleman. One parent in St. Andrews Court is living in completely overcrowded conditions and has a young child who has a cough that is more like a smoker's cough, which is caused by the mould. Climate measures have to make a difference to residents who have been neglected for years. Carbon emissions, reductions and schemes seem to be for the wealthy. That is what so many residents of flat complexes are telling me. Why not put solar panels on the roof of flats? The climate action plan does not affect families living in flat complexes and we need a change for those families. People living in the flats in Pearse House and Mercer House have been forgotten about and neglected. There needs to be an urgency around ensuring proper, adequate, decent retrofitting for residents living in flat complexes. Let us see real change for those living in flats. Let us see real improvements in the conditions of those living in the flat complexes across Dublin city.
#JenniferWhitmore	unknown-#JenniferWhitmore-party	unknown-#JenniferWhitmore-dob	unknown-#JenniferWhitmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-18 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	206	I will always welcome talking about climate in this Chamber but today I wish we had the implementation plan for the climate action plan. The clue is in the title; we need to see action. It is not just me or other Members of the Opposition who are saying we need to move from talk to action. It is also being said by the Climate Change Advisory Council, CCAC, and the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA. Hopefully we will have statements again when the implementation plan is published because that is going to be very important. I also welcome the fact that the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works was in the Chamber earlier talking about adaptation. Oftentimes, we forget adaptation when we talk about the climate. It is clear that climate change is happening. It is happening now and it is happening in Ireland. A major contribution must be in how we deal with and adapt to the changing climate and in preparing communities to deal with what is coming down the road. I only have six minutes, unfortunately, so I will quickly go through my key points. I have repeatedly raised, in this Chamber, my fears about the Government meeting the targets it sets. While the plans are very thorough and are welcome, we need to see the actual targets being met and the delivery of these measures, and that is key. The climate action plan talks about taxation policy. I was very disappointed that the Government did not take on board the Social Democrats' proposal of putting a zero-VAT rate on solar equipment and services. That was a real opportunity the Government missed. This is allowed for under an EU directive and the Government should have introduced a zero-VAT rate for solar. I again ask the Minister to reconsider investing properly in solar for communities and to look at the Social Democrats' policy on that. It would involve large State intervention when it comes to rolling out solar panels for houses across the country. It would help people dealing with their electricity bills, help with the pressures on our grid and help with our climate policies. This is very important. I would like to see someone with biodiversity experience on the CCAC. We cannot deal with climate and biodiversity separately. They are two issues so conjoined they need to be dealt with together. I understand there is not a biodiversity or ecologist specialist, particularly a terrestrial one, on the CCAC. There may be a marine biologist but there should be a greater focus within that committee on biodiversity. Today, I want to primarily talk about just transition, on which the climate action plan contains a large chapter. When the Government talks about climate action, it continually refers to just transition and how it is important to bring communities along with us when dealing with climate and introducing climate action measures. In fact, the climate action plan states that the Government will "maximise employment opportunities, and support persons and communities that may be negatively affected by the transition" to a zero-carbon economy. The plans by Coillte to partner with an international investment fund to plant forestry in Ireland, as a climate initiative, absolutely flies in the face of the whole concept of just transition in Ireland. The Government is using its funds through the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF. It is subsidising this partnership between Coillte and a UK investment fund. Grant aid will also go to this investment fund to enable international investors to buy up land and profit from it. That will, without doubt, push up land prices for farming communities across this country. Coillte has said it does not believe this will happen. Without a doubt, it is going to happen because there is only so much land in Ireland. If UK investors are subsidised by a state government to purchase land, it will only push up prices.We need this Government to use some of the €5 billion in surplus this year to invest in rural communities, local grassroots climate action, our climate future and biodiversity. If we offshore this, we are essentially facilitating a land grab by international investors. It is similar to what we have seen in housing policy Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and the Green Party have overseen over the past number of years. When it comes to health, we see prioritisation of large corporations and now, yet again, we will see this when it comes to climate action. It is not good enough. I am pleased to hear some of the backbenchers in Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael talk about this as well. I hope the Minister of State listens. I understand this is not primarily the portfolio of the Minister, Deputy Ryan, but it is a major issue. It is a climate action issue and the Minister needs to get involved. It is obviously the area of the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, as well. This plan cannot be allowed to happen. We need to invest in rural communities. We need to assist people who will be disadvantaged by climate measures we need to take. Without a doubt, it will be very difficult for our rural and farming communities to deal with this. The Government will expect changes of them which they will have to implement and such changes will impact them financially and socially unless the Government supports them. This is the very antithesis of supporting those communities. It is supporting international investors to take land away from them. I ask the Minister of State to have a conversation with the Minister, Deputy Ryan, and to sit down with the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, and the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, and knock this plan on the head. It is not how one deals with just transition or climate action within local and rural communities.
#BrianLeddin	unknown-#BrianLeddin-party	unknown-#BrianLeddin-dob	unknown-#BrianLeddin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-18 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	207	I welcome the climate action plan. It is the first statutory plan since the adoption of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 and the agreement last year on the sectoral emissions ceilings. One of the critical pieces of the climate Act is that it provides for an annual revisable plan and should we find we are off track at any point, we can review and revise the plan such that we get back on track. That is one of the strongest elements of the Act. Achieving a decarbonised economy and a climate neutral Ireland will bring new sustainable opportunities but it will also be challenging and it will require significant changes across all and every sector. I was pleased to see the announcement yesterday by the Ministers, Deputies Ryan and Harris, on the significant progress being made in the number of participants in the near zero energy building, NZEB, and the retrofit upskilling and reskilling programmes. Following the opening of the education and training board, ETB, centres of excellence in retrofit training, there has been a continuous strong increase in the number of workers availing of the upskilling and reskilling opportunities. The increase from the initial 363 enrolments in 2020 to more than 2,000 last year puts us strongly on the path towards the target of retrofitting 500,000 homes by 2030. The centre of excellence for retrofit and NZEB skills in Roxboro in my own constituency of Limerick City will provide training for approximately 1,500 workers per year. Skills and resources have the power to underpin or, indeed, undermine our great effort. The skills challenge we face is not just directly in the area of renewables or retrofitting. Our whole planning system has to ramp up in order that, now that we as a State have set the ambition, we do not then get in the way. We have sent strong signals that Ireland will be a net exporter of energy, primarily utilising our west coast wind energy resource. This will be floating wind technology. Private industry throughout the world has heard the call and wishes to move fast and, within reason, we should not hold it back or get in its way. I have a serious concern that while we are sending these strong signals we are still constraining this sector. Concerns have been raised in recent days. I draw the Minister of State's attention to an article in The Connaught Telegraph published just this afternoon. The concern is that the west coast ambition in floating technology is to be scheduled behind the south coast in the upcoming policy statement on phase 2 of offshore wind with regard to floating wind deployment. This is a very bad message to be sending to the global wind energy development sector, when developers are telling us they are chomping at the bit to get involved in the west coast of Ireland. I ask the Minister of State to ensure the west is not scheduled behind the south coast and that we have a level playing field in the deployment of floating offshore wind technology.

As we all know, according to what we released in the most recent census, Ireland has a rapidly growing population. As a consequence,we need to engage in very serious work around infrastructure development, whether it is roads and transportation infrastructure, rail or any of the climate friendly transportation projects. Unfortunately, the undertaking of these projects have very large emissions, as does the construction of housing and expansion in Irish agriculture. We have set ourselves a target to try to reduce our carbon budgeting to 2018 types of levels. However, I have highlighted a concern in the area of transport in particular. I was very dissatisfied by the response I got in this House from the Minister, Deputy Ryan, who went on quite an extensive speech about the planet burning rather than answering the question he was asked. This is about the current national development plan, NDP, the Government painstakingly tried to negotiate. I make the point to the Minister of State that if we are trying to calculate our carbon budgets on 2018 emissions for future development of infrastructure, there were very few major infrastructure projects under way. We are talking about several projects listed within the NDP, whether it is the Cork metropolitan area transport strategy, CMATS, around public transport infrastructure in Cork, the Cork-Limerick motorway or a number of important key rail and road developments including the construction of a €22 billion metro network in our capital city. The point has to be made that the 2018 targets are wholly unrealistic. I ask that the Departments of Transport and of the Environment, Climate and Communications go away to do the work, do an audit of the projects in the NDP and come up with some type of a palatable and realistic solution rather than coming in here to talk nonsense. I am very concerned by what is being presented as a backbencher supporting the Government through its legislation. It is a difficult place to be when one wishes to get a point across or when one has a problem with something. Perhaps the Minister, Deputy Ryan, may take up on that again in the new year. I wish all the staff and the Ceann Comhairle a very happy new year.
#PatrickCostello	unknown-#PatrickCostello-party	unknown-#PatrickCostello-dob	unknown-#PatrickCostello-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-18 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	209	Few things we do in this House will be as fundamental as addressing and facing up to the challenge of climate change. It is, quite literally, an existential issue for life on this planet, not just for the human race. Biodiversity loss has been highlighted by several speakers already. We have to grasp this issue and challenge. We cannot simply sit on the fence or we cop out on this issue. It is not right to say we do not have the information and we will leave that to someone else. We all have a responsibility to act on this. The climate action plan is living up to that responsibility. It is driving forward the changes we need. It will be hard and difficult but the cross-cutting and cross-departmental nature of the plan really highlights the ambition as well as the complexity of this challenge we will have to address. It is important, however, this is done in a fair and just way. The phrase, "just transition", is used repeatedly through the plan. We need to focus on just transition, on what it means and what it is, rather than it becoming jargon or a simple buzzword to quote. If we look at the nature of the climate action plan in addressing the issue of fuel poverty through retrofitting homes, it shows we can address both climate and the challenge of decarbonisation while also addressing the challenge of fuel poverty. By building better, in the right way, we can address housing, homelessness and climate all at the one time. That cuts back to the complexity of this problem which is reflected in the complexity and comprehensiveness of this plan. It is fundamentally important that the element of social justice, alongside climate justice, not be lost. That must be the focus to deliver a climate plan that is fair for all.

We spend far too much time in this House arguing about targets, mostly with the Opposition demanding higher targets than the Government has committed to, and not enough time looking at the innovative policy tools that we need to bring in to make a difference. I listened to the Opposition and, by and large, their contribution is finding fault with the measures that are already in the plan, not coming up with new ideas. I have also listened to people saying that 100% finance is needed for this. The reality is that if we cannot mobilise private capital as well as public capital, we will not achieve what is set out in the climate plan.

I know this is close to the heart of the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth. There are two areas with opportunities for fresh thinking. One is carbon farming, where we pay farmers for the sort of thing we need to do, such as rewetting and reducing livestock herding on some of these drained organic soils. It offers a significant opportunity but the incentives are not in place. There are other examples. The second matter is the circular economy and I know the Minister of State has done much work to contribute to that. The plan emphasises that there is much more to the circular economy than reducing waste, which tends to be the focus of the strategy at the moment. It is about the whole design of the supply chain. We all have responsibility, including those who design buildings, those who occupy them, those who produce food and those who consume. The ESRI has shown that we have 75% more emissions if we look at our consumption patterns than if we look solely at our production patterns. We throw away stuff with greater frequency. We buy expensive, high-end materials that we could use much more efficiently. We need much more efficient construction sites, use of our vehicle fleet, and so on. That is where we need to find ways to deliver. There is a new opportunity in those areas and we need to tap into them. We still need to see sectoral plans, which are crucial. I think we can deliver a much less adversarial approach to meeting our targets if we look at this through the prism of the circular economy rather than pointing the finger at data centres or farmers, which we are all too familiar with hearing people speak about. We need to change how we manage our whole supply chain if we want to achieve this. I get frustrated with people who want to find one scapegoat to blame for all the challenges faced. There must be genuine commitment by the public sector to lead. I do not see it yet in procurement or its patterns. We can only have a call to arms to the wider population if the public sector is seen to lead. The last point I want to make is that when land use is included, one discovers that land use is generating far more emissions than we thought. It has added another 3.3 million tonnes that have to be found under the climate plan. I do not see where that has been allocated or where it will be met. That needs to be clarified otherwise we will be revisiting the targets set for the different sectors, which will not be easy.

The current proposals are inequitable. Much of the Government's climate action plan puts a burden on ordinary workers and families, particularly family farmers and rural communities. Those living in rural Ireland find it difficult, if not impossible, to access services, whether employment, education or retail, without using a private car. A large proportion of our greenhouse gas emissions can be attributed to the transport sector. If we are to meet our overall emissions reduction target by 2030, we need a serious increase in investment in our public transport services to reduce the dependency on private cars and to accelerate the roll-out of rural bus services. We need to cut fares and make bus and train stations wheelchair accessible for disabled people. We also have to ensure there is sufficient capacity on existing services. We need to have a public service that is reliable, affordable and safe, with sufficient capacity. I particularly want to mention the 109X route from Cavan to Dublin. That route is oversubscribed nearly every day when going home. People are left waiting at the side of the road for hours for a bus to come eventually to bring them home. We encourage people to buy electric cars but it is too expensive for those who most need to do this. Those who have the oldest, dirtiest cars, who most need to replace them, cannot afford to do so. We need to consider looking at grants for second-hand electric cars to be rolled out. The grants to retrofit houses are generous but only if people have money in the first place. More investment in the warmer homes scheme is needed, as well as in local authorities, which inform me that they do not get even nearly enough funds to retrofit their own supply of houses. Some of those houses are quite old and most need to be retrofitted. Afforestation can play an important role in meeting our emissions targets. However, the Government is not doing enough to foster this sector. The programme for Government set a target of planting 8,000 ha. Only a quarter of that target was reached last year or the year before. There are ongoing problems with the licences. Farmers and private forestry companies have been deprived of licences to plant trees for some years now. The Government needs to look at and deal with those issues. It needs to support farmers in dealing with ash dieback instead of allowing a British company to come in and practically giving it land to invest in our country. Farmers and forestry companies here should be given the first option to invest.

Many are homes that people could live in and where they could raise families. Instead, this Government is leaving them idle, empty and rotting. When the Government tells us it is serious about tackling climate change, I ask how serious it is. It is serious enough about making ordinary people struggle to pay prices, taxes and unfair carbon taxes but it is not serious about tackling the wealthy speculators who are hoarding homes in the middle of a housing crisis. There are no simple fixes to climate change but there are solutions. Repairing and retrofitting a built house is better for the environment. Everyone accepts this. Using empty stock would make a real difference and it would deliver homes quickly. In my constituency, Cork North-Central, there are areas where one in five homes is empty. Does the Minister of State know how frustrating this is for families where three or four generations live in a house and the house next door is empty? It is wrong. Children are sleeping in hotels and the rich are profiting from leaving these homes empty. That is wrong. We need to build new homes if we are serious about tackling the housing crisis and the climate crisis. We need to be serious about finding solutions. Tackling vacancy and dereliction is a fair solution. It creates homes for people, reduces dumping and makes it better for the environment. The Government's answer to that in last year's budget was a vacant homes tax of 0.3%. How is it serious? A number of years ago, when I was a councillor on Cork City Council, I was told by the OPW that in 40 to 50 years, because of global warming, Cork city will need a flood protection barrier. Is the Government planning to protect Cork from flooding because of global warming? What plans are in place to do that?

The German Government has decided to destroy and demolish a village called Lützerath to make room for a coal mine. It has been met by brave resistance. Some 50,000 protestors turned up to resist, who in turn were subjected to incredible brutality by the German police. Indeed, yesterday, Greta Thunberg was arrested. In the town of Lützerath, we are seeing the brutality of the police against climate protestors while the Greens are in government in Germany, which is a dramatic illustration of the failure of the Greens really to deal with a climate catastrophe.This plan is less dramatic. It is less clear to people and less brutal than the police but its failure, which is an indication of the failure of the Greens in this country, is no less profound. If the justification for the Greens' participation in government with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael was action on climate change, this plan, in its own quiet way, blows that out of the water. We must compare, as we always should, the scale of the crisis versus the response and it is the equivalent of advising a patient bleeding to death from a gaping wound to use some tea tree oil on it. The failure is not an accident; it is built into this Government's management commitment to the capitalist system to allow the big business decisions on agribusiness, data centres and private energy to take priority over the needs of ordinary people and the need to avoid climate catastrophe. The only things the Government has are wishful thinking about the market delivering and wishful thinking on the future technology that will come down the line. The latest EPA report confirms that up to quarter 2 of 2022 Ireland's emissions grew once again, making it the highest per capita emitter in the EU. In total, Ireland's emissions are on track to exceed the combined ten-year carbon budget by between 23% and 26%. It is an absolutely brazen, clear and complete failure in every single aspect. The reason is the Government always puts the interests of big business first. To stop climate change and absolute catastrophe we need system change, a break with the ecocidal capitalist system and ecosocialist change that puts people's interests and our planet first.

I am thankful that shameful proposal was defeated through mass protests but now we essentially have a continuation of that attempt by the State and by the State forestry company to facilitate a corporate takeover of tens of thousands of acres of land and forestry to benefit a for-profit investment fund. The questions and answers produced by Coillte on this spell it out clearly. It states:The [Irish strategic forestry] fund is designed to generate profits from the business of forestry and timber production. These profits will be retained within the fund and from time to time be distributed to the investors in a similar way as a company distributes dividends to its shareholders.That is what this is about. It is a corporate grab of land and forestry at the expense of small farmers, biodiversity and water quality. It is absolute nonsense to suggest any of this is going to benefit the climate. As Friends of the Irish Environment pointed out when it wrote to the European Commission, a report done for the Department showed Irish forests, because they are being cut down and are based on a monocultural industrial model, are net carbon emitters because we have a totally dysfunctional for-profit forestry model. We need to reform Coillte, abandon this deal and adopt a sustainable forestry model.

They have taken this stance despite the mobilisation of thousands of riot police against them and the detention and arrest of activists, including Greta Thunberg. The Minister of State might comment on the fact the Green Party's sister party is part of the German Government that is presiding over all this. Does he support the stance of his sister party or does he support Greta Thunberg and the climate campaigners? What are the top ten carbon emitters in Ireland? In order, starting from the number one position, they are: Dublin Airport, the Drogheda cement plant, the Ballyconnell cement plant, the roads in Dublin, the Limerick cement plant, the Irving Oil refinery at Whitegate, Corrib, the Kinnegad cement plant, Shannon Airport and Cork Airport. Of those ten entities, seven are privately owned and operated on a for-profit basis and the other three are semi-State companies, but their emissions come in the main from privately-owned airlines that are also run on a for-profit basis. You cannot control what you do not own. A serious carbon action plan would move to nationalise the major carbon emitters and run them on an environmentally-sound, not-for-profit basis.

The first is the wind energy guidelines, which are grossly outdated given they are 15 years old. We have been promised time and time again that a new iteration of them is on the way. On the eve of the last general election, I think in December 2019, a draft version of the wind energy guidelines made its way into the Dáil and was debated. Along came the general election and the draft was put on ice. It never happened and it still has not happened. We are a long way down the road and the iteration put out in December 2019 is now outdated. We have repeatedly had blocks of legislation on planning and amending planning law coming through these Houses but the big elephant in the room is the fact we have an outdated wind energy policy. It is not good for those who want to develop wind energy and it is also not good for the communities that are surrounded by wind energy. It is bad on both fronts and gives little protection to those communities. I speak with many planning officials and they find it difficult to assess a modern application coming in for a colossal wind farm, yet planners are trying to benchmark it based on an old policy that is outdated. I ask that when the Minister of State responds later, he tell us when those guidelines will be published. The last I heard was that they were on the desk of the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and then they went over to the desk of the Minister, Deputy Ryan, and that the latter was looking at the noise output and had some level of concern. It is being kicked over and back. These things should belong in one Department and not be passed from one Ministry over to another. We need new guidelines. I think of communities in Clare, some of whom saw 12 to 15 turbines go up in their locality, and who embraced it. However, they are now seeing a proliferation and they need some protection in these new guidelines because it just is not there at the moment. The other point I wish to join colleagues in addressing is the Gresham House deal and the €1.3 billion, I think, to increase afforestation more quickly. It is a very bad deal for rural Ireland. In fact, it sells it out. There are so many people who still depend on farming. There are 8,000 farm families in Clare, which is hard to believe, out of a population of 120,000. That shows how dependent we still are on that in the county. I farm myself. I foddered this morning at 7.30 before getting on the train here. We are hemmed in by Coillte. We embrace forestry. However, the Government should not sell the national silver and gold. We should not let the land to a private consortium from Britain and allow it to afforest our landscape, which many farming families would depend on or might want to buy to add to their landholdings.

The plan lists more than 180 actions and many sub-actions that must be taken if we are to meet our climate change targets. We have already seen this year stark evidence of climate change throughout the world. California has experienced devastating storms and floods, while northern Europe has experienced some of the highest January temperatures on record. Who knows what El Niño and climate change will bring for the rest of 2023? The scientific evidence is indisputable and record temperatures, wildfires, floods and droughts are occurring much more frequently. Global warming is the greatest global challenge we face today. The plan contains challenging targets and will involve real change in the way we live. These real changes will be in respect of electricity, industry, enterprise, housing, heating, transport and waste management.Many of the changes will improve our health and our quality of life. We will switch to renewables, offshore wind energy and solar and decrease our reliance on imported fossil fuels. There will be a big switch to public transport, cycling and walking and a reduction in road space for the private car, including the one in three private cars that will be electric. Our retrofitted homes and businesses will be much warmer, family farms will be more diversified and will gain new income streams or enhanced landscapes, and biodiversity will boost our tourism product. All of this is worth making the necessary sacrifices to our current daily routines. The plan is ambitious but like so many other areas of Government policy, delivery and implementation are crucial. It is a disappointment that even the smallest measure brought before this House for approval to tackle climate change can be fiercely opposed. The opposition to the proposal to ban the sale of turf is a prime example. When it comes to Sinn Féin, it becomes all populist and will not provide leadership on the issue. Its opposition to carbon taxes, even before the current energy crisis, demonstrates this. To implement this plan, we need buy-in from people. We need ongoing citizen engagement but it cannot just be left to the citizen. The corporate sector globally also has a major role to play, as well as Government and State agencies and local authorities. I welcome the agreement reached at the UN COP15 summit on biodiversity in Canada last month, which the Minister of State attended. The agreement is indeed very significant. The implementation of our climate action plan will clearly demonstrate that Ireland is doing its bit with regard to climate change and global warming, in association with the EU and the Green Deal outlined by that organisation.

The first thing I have to mention is the actions of the Germans in the last couple of days with the demolishing of a village and the extension of an open coal mine in Germany. As a farmer in Tipperary, we are all in the one EU. If that happened in this country there would be a huge outcry, and rightly so. We cannot get the climate of the world right. That is going to need the co-operation of all the rest of the countries in the world. I know Germany's energy security has been seriously threatened due to its huge dependence on Russian gas but it is hard to balance this equation with the extension of a very large coal mine in Germany. Regarding emissions, we are talking all the time about reduction. We have to be positive. I will speak on the agrifood side. There is loads of technology that we can embrace and loads of infrastructure that will allow us to meet the 25% target that has been set. I will mention two of them in the brief time available to me. I met with the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, the other day. It has done extensive work on genotyping of all bovine animals. It will cost a bit of money. To genotype all cows in a herd would cost €40 million to €45 million and each calf would then have to be done each year. This will allow a record to show which animals are the most efficient, whether in the conversion of kilograms of beef or the conversion of kilograms of fat and protein for dairy cows. For a reasonable investment, the ICBF says this could have an impact of a 20% reduction in our emissions. Having more efficient animals, and knowing what animals are the most efficient, has a huge role to play. The second thing I want to focus on is Lisheen. Lisheen is a site of 1,100 acres on the Tipperary-Kilkenny border. This site has a huge role to play in our circular economy with the proper investment. We have wind energy on that site. There are advanced plans to put in a large solar farm there and there are huge amounts of water available. This is about the waste that is coming from our society, whether from industry or households, and the circular economy. This site in Lisheen has a proper designation and would have a huge amount to deliver to the circular economy and the meeting of our targets.

As the Minister of State is aware, a very significant chunk of our carbon emissions arises from our transport sector - just under 20%. There is an extraordinary opportunity presenting to us right now as a country to eat into those emissions and reduce them using public transport. In general, our people are ready to make that change, to effect that modal shift essentially to leave the car at home and begin to avail of the public transport options that are becoming available. We have a major issue with public transport provision in rural Ireland. Yes, it is beginning to happen but it is not happening quickly enough. It is not presenting people with the efficient, reliable kind of public transport opportunities they need finally to leave the car at home. Looking at the excellent research done by Professor Ian Walker in the UK, he concludes that people will simply avail of the most effective, efficient and straightforward opportunity when it comes to getting up in the morning and heading to work. I will give one example where it is not working and that is in the town of Gort in south Galway. There are numerous reports now of Bus Éireann buses turning up in Gort not on time or not on schedule and when they do turn up, they are full. There are people in Gort and all the intervening stops between Gort and Galway city seeing the bus literally driving past the bus stop with no opportunity for them to get on. That is not the kind of transport service we need to present to people if we are to encourage them to make that modal shift, that transfer from the car to public transport. I urge the Minister of State and all Ministers, both at Cabinet and at a junior level, to begin to focus on delivering the kind of efficient, reliable, rural public transport services and opportunities that can convince people it is time finally to leave the car at home and make that shift.

Local members crowdfunded to send a copy to each Deputy. It is a very informative book, which I find myself dipping in and out of. One of the chapters is called "Why Didn't They Act?" and the conclusion is that people in positions of power and privilege refuse to acknowledge that climate change is a manifestation of a broken economic system. This needs to change and it needs to change urgently. We live in a country where the top two richest people have more wealth than the bottom 50%. With this kind of inequality, a just transition is just a pipe dream for most people. It is certainly a pipe dream for most of our older people. Half of Irish homes are rated D or lower in terms of building energy rating, BER. Age Action Ireland - not Sinn Féin - estimates that more than 300,000 poorly-insulated homes are occupied by older persons, making them especially at risk of fuel poverty. More than half of the estimated almost 600,000 older person households have low home insulation and many older persons cannot afford the cost of retrofitting. We urgently need big changes in transport, agriculture, electricity and buildings. As the UN climate science body put it, we need "rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society". I do not see the required urgency from this Government. The Rubicon has been crossed and this Government is allowing big businesses to burn our boats. We in Sinn Féin have plans to address the climate crisis. There are massive carbon savings to be made in transport. We need to expand school transport and bring rural transport into the 20th century. We need to incentivise electric car ownership, especially for second-hand vehicles and we need to address the high cost of electricity. I know many people who are now questioning their commitment to electric cars because of the cost. It is time to act now, before it is too late.

I do not think there is anyone here who can in any way understand the madness of what we are seeing in Germany, where a village is being demolished for a coal mine and coal-produced electricity.Nobody considers that will be a viable solution into the future. We must look at ourselves and ensure we can make Ireland a wind powerhouse and not only say it in this Chamber. That requires a planning process that works and is properly resourced.  If we are talking about sustainability, I do not think anybody would like to defend the potential deal between Coillte and Gresham House. It is a terrible deal for Ireland and it needs to be revisited before there is even a chance of it happening. People will talk about issues in respect of state aid rules. That means we need to have a conversation with the European Commission. The proposed deal is hardly a solution. We have all spoken about a retrofit plan that will work for people. Those who are in most need of such a plan are those who do not have the resources to put €25,000 on the table. That is what we are talking about. I once again raise the issue of Carlinn Hall and communal heating systems. I welcome the fact that a geothermal feasibility study has occurred. Indications are good. The people concerned are paying anywhere between 42 cent and 47 cent per kWh. The systems are mad. They are gas-fired heating systems that in no way work. The associated inefficiencies are huge and are probably increasing as people try not to use the system. That creates its own difficulties. We must ensure that the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, has a grant scheme that can deliver, whether through geothermal solutions or a return to woodchip. We must ensure that people are not paying ridiculous rates. We have a wider issue in respect of the cost of electricity that needs to be dealt with but the Minister of State knows the particular issues relating to communal heating systems also need to be dealt with.
#MattShanahan	unknown-#MattShanahan-party	unknown-#MattShanahan-dob	unknown-#MattShanahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-18 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	224	I am glad to participate in the debate. I took careful note of the opening statement of the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the stretching targets that he highlighted in the climate action plan. I have some questions about certain sectors. I will go through some of them and the Minister of State might reply to me in writing. I will first consider the transport sector and the adoption of electric cars. We are now starting to see the pinch points in respect of electric car consumption. Range anxiety is building because of the lack of charging infrastructure in the country. Costs are rising. The Green Party was at the forefront of ensuring that hybrid cars were not included in the programme for Government, which was a mistake. Where are we going in the worldwide production of electric vehicles? We know that we will not get close to the target of 1 million electric vehicles on the road by 2030. There also issues relating to the minerals that are produced in electric cars and the ethics around the harvesting of the likes of lithium and cobalt, particularly in countries where child labour is being used. Has Ireland taken any steps to try to understand those considerations? The local authority in Waterford has announced a plan to provide an additional 12 on-street charging points in the city in the coming year. The rate of adoption of electric cars in the city is running at 15% per annum, which is the same as the national rate. Perhaps the Minister of State will come back to me on some of those points. Is it realistic to suppose that people who live outside urban areas can easily adopt electric vehicles? There are issues in respect of the costs involved and range anxiety. Those people cannot access suitable and frequent public transport alternatives. It seems that the climate agenda is trying to direct our rural populations into urban areas over the coming 20 years. Is that the way things are going? The Minister mentioned electricity generation and the great opportunities being presented to Ireland. He also spoke of the significant potential to develop offshore wind. I will speak about the offshore wind options that are being surveyed off the south coast at the moment, specifically in my own area in County Waterford, adjacent to the Copper Coast. A number of farm licences are being considered for wind farms totalling anywhere between 50 and 70 pylon turbines that are fixed to the seabed. All those pylons will stand at a height of 350 m, which is far higher than the Spire in Dublin. I am told by people in the maritime industry in the area that the shelf that runs along that coastline dips below 60 m close to two miles offshore and, therefore, these pylons cannot be fixed. I would like to understand, because we have had no clarity yet, where these pylons are going to be situated. How close to the shore are they going to be? In respect of a just transition, I will mention the potential amenity damage. What compensation will be offered? I understand that for some of these farms, a community dividend of between €15 million and €18 million is being considered over the lifetime of the project, payable in the first 15 years of a 25-year project. I do not see the sense in that. If wind turbines are spinning for 25 years, the community needs to be compensated. It is not fair to say that 1.5% of the overall investment of more than €1 billion is adequate to compensate the coastal communities that are going to be impacted by the harnessing of wind power. Contracts are being drawn up for the provision of wind energy. The regulatory body has not been activated and the delay in doing so is difficult to understand. Where is the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority, MARA, now? Negotiations are taking place with wind energy providers at the moment because surveys of the sites would not be happening if that were not the case. I would like to ask some questions about the contract terms. Has the State secured itself in respect of the future spot rate at which electricity will be charged to the Irish grid as opposed to the rate that will apply for electricity that will be exported from Ireland? Is it the case that Ireland could find itself paying more for the electricity produced on our shores than it would pay on the open French or German markets where electricity is exported? Has consideration been given to including in the contracts any lever or pivot to allow the State to buy out the wind farms at any point in the 25-year term? There are many reasons the State might wish to make such a purchase. Is such a clause included in the contracts being devised at the moment? I will move to the agricultural sector. The Coillte deal with Gresham House has been referenced a number of times. The proposal appears to be for upwards of 250,000 acres to be privately taken in by Coillte and Gresham House. That would in some cases require Irish landholders to sell their holdings. Some €2.1 billion in State support and subsidies are potentially on offer to Gresham House. Those supports and subsidies should go into the rural and regional economy. They should go to support Irish farm growers and not to funds on Threadneedle Street and Bond Street. The Minister of State might be interested to know that Coillte achieved 110% of its target for the processing of licensing applications in 2022. I am sure it was happy about that. By contrast, it only achieved 80% of its private felling targets and 60% of its private afforestation targets. Our private growers cannot get their forestry licences approved. At the same time, a new forestry programme is being talked about by the Department and nothing as yet is being considered for the ash dieback programme, which many growers are availing of. They need to understand the impact before they can go again. I echo the calls made by others in the House. I am opposed to the idea that State subsidies would go to support UK or other foreign equity firms investing in our domestic forestry sector. An ample number of growers and farmers in this country are prepared to grow forests if they are given access to subsidies and licences. That is not happening at the moment. There is also an issue around multi-seed pasture land. The Minister, Deputy Ryan, was in Waterford approximately 14 months ago.I thought he was coming down to review the great work being done by the Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT, into multiseed sward analysis which has been going on for five years. At the time, he did not have the time to look at it, unfortunately. I recommend a film on Netflix to the Minister of State, entitled Kiss the Ground. He may have seen it. It is narrated by the American actor, Woodie Harrelson. It talks about desertification, which is an ongoing climate challenge right across the world. Largely it has to do with the tilling and spraying of land which is stripping topsoil and ultimately killing the microbiome underneath. A great deal of work is being done here, particularly in WIT, on multiseed pasture land which it appears could remedy part of this problem and return the microbiome. It could also make additional inputs in regard to carbon sequestration. We do not have a policy in place to incentivise farmers to move into these systems. Will the Minister of State take those issues on board in the climate action plan? I would appreciate it if he addressed the questions I have asked. While we need stretching targets, we also need just transition, with the emphasis on the word "just".

For 20 years I have knocked on doors talking about the climate challenge. The climate plan we have introduced is the reason I am here. I am proud that the Green Party in Government has delivered that. I have no doubt in my mind that without the Green Party in Government the climate challenge would not be met. It is a huge challenge. We know that and we have not done enough to face it. Our children, grandchildren and future generations will suffer, not just immediate, close-to-home suffering brought about by storms, droughts, flooding and the increased cost of food and energy, but also the global creep of climate disaster, entire populations being displaced, global food shortages and wars over diminishing natural resources. Every responsible parent, guardian, grandparent, aunt and uncle inherently wants a better future for the next generation. As parents, we want to provide better for the future but we are failing the future. We are the generation that is failing that future. Everyone in this Chamber knows what needs to be done. It is big, complex and difficult and we should have started 20 or 30 years ago, but now is that time. We have heard today of huge investment in public transport across bus and rail systems in both urban and rural areas, with towns and villages that were never served before being served by buses; investment in walking and cycling infrastructure; and safe routes to school for our children. We have heard about the retrofitting programme, which is paid for through carbon tax to some extent and is creating thousands of jobs providing warm energy and efficient homes throughout the country. We are doing more on that. We heard about the investment in and progress on renewables. Solar and onshore wind plants are being built as we speak throughout the country and delivering electricity. Every bit of solar and wind infrastructure we put in means there is coal or gas that does not need to be burned. Massive acceleration of offshore wind will provide us with independence and surety of supply and the ability to export electricity through interconnected cables. These are being built at the moment and will connect us to Wales and France. Very soon, we will be exporting hydrogen as that industry progresses. Agriculture also plays its part. I know farmers are up for the challenge of playing their part in diversifying, planting trees, embracing the concept of regenerative farming and moving to a less intensive fertiliser model through organic production. It is imperative that we support those farmers to ensure they get the price for the extremely valuable, good quality food they produce.  In the most critical challenge of our time, are we doing enough? The answer is clearly "No". We need to do much more. We need to be faster, greater and unified in our challenge. It is not too late to change the outcome and the end of this story. The Climate Book by Greta Thunberg
was provided to every Member of the Oireachtas. I recommend reading and acting on it.

As a climate action spokesperson and member of the Joint Committee on Climate Action, I am proud of the role that I and my colleagues of all parties and none have played in assisting the Minister on the legislative side of these plans and building upon that which was published and enacted in 2019. In the short time available, I will cover four key themes. The first is building and the need to support homeowners in the State's plan to retrofit up to 500,000 properties by 2030 to building energy ratings, BER, of A and B. The Minister of State will appreciate how important the State-backed finance arrangements are to that particular programme. These have yet to be announced. This finance is key to ensuring that homeowners can make the change and retrofit their homes to include heat pumps rather than gas or oil boilers and improve the quality of their homes. A property with a BER of A or B gets better ventilation which is beneficial to human health. A key point with regard to Rebuilding Ireland and Housing for All is that we are not building enough properties with timber. Our afforestation rates are clearly a constraint on that particular goal. That needs to be addressed and incorporated in our building regulations in a firmer way. If an incentive programme needs to be provided to achieve that, we should provide one. In regard to energy, the acceleration of delivery of offshore and onshore wind farms and solar power is important to ensuring we can reduce the carbon footprint of our energy sector. A new planning and development Bill to be introduced shortly will make a substantial contribution to that. MARA also has a critical involvement in the delivery of offshore wind power. The hydrogen strategy is to be published, and should be published promptly. Those considerations need to be kept in mind when it comes to the all-important implementation, which is key to the success of this plan. Transport is the third area. Massive reductions are required in carbon emissions. Improvements to rural bus services are needed, as is the accelerated delivery of BusConnects, not to mention the importance of electrifying the vehicular fleet throughout the State. Finally, I mention the importance of ensuring that businesses play their part in this and are incentivised to reduce their carbon footprint in the business they conduct daily.
#JoeFlaherty	unknown-#JoeFlaherty-party	unknown-#JoeFlaherty-dob	unknown-#JoeFlaherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-18 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	227	I rarely take issue with my colleague, Deputy Matthews, but I emphasise that the Government parties are as one on the climate action plan. I appreciate there are many Green Party fingerprints on the plan but we in this three-party Government are passionate about it and have enthusiastically supported it. I commend Deputy Matthews on acknowledging that there is a will and desire in rural Ireland to meet our climate action targets. There is a groundswell of enthusiasm among farmers for the challenge that lies ahead. That is reflected in the interest in the new agri-climate rural environment scheme, ACRES, which is significantly oversubscribed. While it is an issue for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, I believe we should bring all farmers into that scheme. If we want to see the progress to which we aspire in regard to climate action, we need to make it more accessible and make it work for people. Everybody in this Chamber will have had people come to their constituency offices who have become perplexed trying to access the SEAI grants or find out how the grants fit their circumstances and what they need to do. Many people have been told in one-stop shops that unless they spend €40,000 or €50,000, they will not get a grant. People want to do this in a number of stages. They may only want to replace doors and windows or a heating system. We have to allow them to do this incrementally. We need to look at the way the one-stop shops are working. Many of them are shutting people down too quickly rather than engaging them. Most people believed the one-stop shop would provide them with an opportunity to discuss what they wanted to do and what was best for their particular property or premises. To my mind, that is not the way it is working. It needs to be a much better engagement and consultative process with members of the public. It may be a role for local authorities to do information days and road shows. We need to bring people on a collective journey. We have to realise that we want to do something very quickly but to do that we need to bring people with us. To bring people with us, we need to get buy-in. The retrofit programme in the local authorities is encountering significant cost issues.I have taken up this issue with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and I know some local authorities are looking at dropping the idea of the heat pump and the air-to-water system to try to save costs. I think that would be a retrograde step and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage needs to look at that. If it is the case that more funding needs to be given to this, we need to do it. The Government is enthusiastic about climate action, as, indeed, are the people of Ireland, but make it easier for them.

In that time, I want to contribute briefly on both the home heating issue and agriculture. It is a hugely important document but it strikes me as a debate where all of the oxygen in the room was taken up with the debate about the sectoral targets and very little was left in terms of putting detail in the plan on what needs to be done. Nowhere is that more evident than with regard to home heating. It is great that there are targets for 120,000 homes to be retrofitted by 2025 and 500,000 by 2030. Bravo, that is great, and to have heat pumps for those for whom it will work is fantastic. However, I have a question about putting all of our eggs in the electrification basket. What of the 1.5 million homes that are unmentioned in this regard? There is reference at page 170 in the document to accelerating the electrification of the remainder of those homes, most of which are heated by home heating oil boilers. Why is the report silent on hydrotreated vegetable oil, HVO, which is a sustainable alternative fuel? All new boilers are compatible with that technology. For €500, the existing boilers can be retrofitted with that technology, which would deliver a solution. For somebody whose house boiler goes belly-up, deep retrofitting is not a quick fix. Deep retrofitting is several months of work, and getting a contractor and possibly getting planning permission is a big job. I do not think it is wise to put all of our eggs in one basket in terms of electrification. If the power goes out, how are those homes going to be heated if they are entirely dependent on electricity? This action plan, unfortunately, is not technology neutral and it should be, as long as it is delivering in terms of decarbonisation. HVO is delivering an 88% reduction in carbon heating. The plan, unfortunately, is entirely silent on agriculture. Farmers can deliver and they are the solution, but they can only deliver with proper incentives.

We had the COP shenanigans and the cost of all the aeroplanes that flew out there. They try to use fear. I definitely did not want the book referred to but I got it in the post as well. I did not ask for it, I did not read it and I will not read it because I know what is going on is a sham and a scam. We have the details here already of the failure to roll out broadband, the failure and scandal of the national children's hospital - you name it, because there are countless State projects. Everything that is in this supposed plan will not be achieved and is not achievable. On the other hand, while this is going on, the Government allows Coillte to be sold off to an English company, Gresham House - a lovely name - and all the sequestration that is in that will go to that company. The farmers who have that land will not have any bit of it. It is the biggest con since time immemorial. We then have an Irish farm plastics company, operated mainly by ex-IFA people who were in the know, who were scamming and who have driven out private producers which were doing great work picking up farm plastic. Declan Doocey is one in Lismore who they have broken and blackguarded with unfair competition laws. It has been raised in this House and raised at the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine by Deputy Michael Collins and others, but those in government do not want to know about it. The blackguarding they are giving ordinary people is simply shocking. The owners of hundreds of thousands of houses want retrofitting but they cannot afford to do it and cannot get grants or get the materials. Leave it all to the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, but she will not allow people to cut a cipín, never mind a tree. There is such a bad taste now in farmers’ mouths that they will not go near forestry because she has blackguarded them every which way she can and stopped them from cutting trees, even though they had contracts to do so. It is a shocking situation and it should not be allowed. This is a three-card trick of the worst order. They keep bringing in more plans here and it is all talk and no action. They have fools made of the children. That is what they are trying to do.

It is another betrayal by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael of the farmers of this country. He said also that farmers must be compensated for this drop in cattle numbers. How does he propose this when farmers in west Cork are being told they must change their practice of slurry spreading for environmental reasons? One farmer in west Cork told me this change will cost him about €14,000 and no grant will cover this. The same farmer asked me where he can find the money as he already owes the money to the bank and credit union for previous farm improvements, so he is in dire straits. The Government is going to put these ordinary, modest farmers out of business. That is the real plan, so Ireland and its farm and meat production will be the same as our fuel, which comes from the UK, in that we can bring it in from Brazil. In November, I asked the Minister, Deputy Ryan, who went with him on this lavish trip to Egypt to the COP27 farce. It is reported that 55 people travelled with him as part of the 400 lavish jets which filled the skies with poisonous fuels. Surely a first-class business flight would have done a Minister going to Egypt and the 55 people with now-hidden identities could have joined on Zoom. They are out there, telling us to tighten our belts, while they fly, dine and wine for two weeks to best of their ability. Disclose the identity of the 55 Irish people. The taxpayers paid for this and we need to know. I am also calling on the Minister for Transport to intervene on Dublin Bus's highly misleading and toxic advertising posters on its fleet. That this advertising imagery, which is sponsored by veganism campaigners, states that Irish agriculture is the single-worst offender in terms of greenhouse emissions is scandalous.

I can tell each and every one of those in government that in the last four or five weeks, people appreciate a fire when they have nothing else and they have no other option given to them. I am one of those people who is burning turf in my fire, and they can go to blazes, the whole lot of them. A lot of other people will continue to do that because they have no other way of keeping themselves warm. With regard to petrol cars, I have nothing against electric cars but we do not have the infrastructure or even the electricity. All I am saying is that we could convert petrol cars to LPG, which would reduce the emissions almost entirely. We could run diesel cars on biofuels but the Government is doing nothing like that.

As a rural Deputy, I am strongly opposed to it. The Government needs to step in and show leadership, and proper leadership that we have not seen before. I know a number of organisations, whether farming organisations like the IFA or forestry organisations like SEEFA, have expressed serious concern, and they are not alone. These stakeholders need to be listened to. I urge the Government to step in immediately. On another issue, on 5 January the Irish Climate Science Forum, ICSF, sent the Minister of State and the Government its own scientifically informed and professional analysis of this plan that we are debating. The ICSF shares the Government's vision of a sustainable future as aspired to in COP23 but points out that in order to be achievable and socially acceptable, it must be based on the latest objective science, consistent with real-world observations, and pragmatism on the limits of mitigation and on the greater benefits of adaptation. The ICSF notes that COP23 is based on exaggerated climate science and also leads to a nonsensical strategy. Indeed, it states that the aspired to deep level of mitigation, if ever achieved, could seriously damage the Irish economy. It states that prudent mitigation should instead focus on areas with quantifiable benefits in energy efficiency, economic benefit and social gain.In this context, given the Irish energy supply and the electricity grid, there is an increasing risk of national blackouts and the most urgent imperative is the approval of the LNG import terminal.
#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-18 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	239	There are only two of us due to speak now so Deputy Fitzmaurice will take whatever time remains after I have spoken. Climate change is destroying our planet in a very real and devastating way. While we all contribute to it, not all of us will feel the effects in the same way. In fact, it has been shown that those who contribute most will be affected least. How can we say we live in a fair and equal society when this is the case? How can we allow some of our citizens to suffer more than others? In the case of Ireland, it will be low-income families and rural communities that will suffer the most. The Climate Action Plan 2023 is full of contradictions. It aims to work towards solutions that are "meaningful, inclusive, fair and accessible". Having reading the plan, however, there is a real lack of a rural approach and the very few mentions of rural communities are simply not grounded in reality. For example, the plan references the national broadband plan, which it states, "will ensure that households and businesses in rural parts of Ireland will have a similar level of connectivity as households and businesses in urban areas" and that "for each new remote worker, an estimated average net saving of up to 10 kWh per day will be achieved, reducing commuter transport energy use and carbon emissions". This sounds great, but it is completely detached from the fact that a lot of areas in my constituency of Donegal do not have access to fibre broadband and will not have access until at least 2026. I am not sure how this is "fair and accessible". My constituents have been calling for broadband access for years and every year this is not addressed is another year of rural depopulation and local business closures for my constituency. I live within the Eir feed plan, so my area is not part of the national broadband plan, but I do not have the high-speed broadband that has been touted so much. That is due to Eir and the way it screws everybody in this State for what it gets. The plan makes one brief point on ACRES and the only other mention of rural communities is the rural mobility programme. I am pleased that the plan recognises that "Dispersed and low-density development has led to high levels of transport poverty in certain regions and for certain cohorts of society." I am also pleased with the statement that "This is a particular challenge to rural communities". The challenge should be to improve the transport routes to ensure that people can be connected. That is not happening fast enough. I recognise that there is a plan in place to update transport routes, but we should really be focusing on free and accessible transport. I am also pleased that we will see the establishment of a just transition commission this year. I can only hope that it makes a better attempt to address rural concerns than this plan does and that it will not just be a case of forming a commission and saying the job is done and away we go as happy as Larry.
#MichaelFitzmaurice	unknown-#MichaelFitzmaurice-party	unknown-#MichaelFitzmaurice-dob	unknown-#MichaelFitzmaurice-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-18 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	240	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Climate Action Plan 2023. I often wonder about plans, including the climate plan. The rich can always afford the obstacles that are put in front of them, but the poor always suffer. Motorists in rural Ireland must contend with the carbon tax and the attempt during the past year to try to stop them burning a bit of turf. It is a half of 1% of the whole country. We then saw 500 aeroplanes going to COP27 and nearly €100,000 spent on doing up offices. One wonders what agenda is being pushed here. In the context of the Government's plan, if we want to help the climate situation, there is some low-hanging fruit that I did not see in the plan. The first thing I would do is provide bus transport for every child going to school, in the way we did in the 1980s. We are not able to do that today although we are supposed to be a society that is wealthier than we were in the 1980s. In regard to the second point, I cannot for the life of me understand why this is not done. We are not going to have electric cars or the provision of hydrogen by 2030, but if we want to try to hit the targets, which at this stage are unachievable, there is an additive for diesel, similar to the dye added to white diesel to make it green diesel, which reduces emissions by 20%. There is a boat in Cork that operates on this type of diesel. Funnily enough, the company concerned tried to talk to the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to see why we do not do that. I have since contacted the Minister of State in the Department, Deputy Chambers, who in fairness has come back to me. It is a solution for the next ten to 12 years. We are not going to magic up electric cars overnight. In addition, the Government has done so much to increase insecurity. If the Minister has a look, he will see auctions of machinery in various parts of the country this week, because contractors are getting out. Why are they getting out? It is because they do not know what future there is for them. What is that going to do? It will put more pressure on other people, create unemployment and result in less service around the country. Deputy Pringle talked about making sure that people in all parts of the country are looked after. What is the plan? Coillte is to become a subcontractor. We are now going to let it mind the forests for an English entity to which we will give grants. I accept there will be some money involved for Irish people, but most of the money is going out of the country. At the same time, we will be trying to rewet 8,000 ha in the north west, midlands, west and south west. If the Government were honest, it would admit that the plan is to make a theme park out of certain parts of the country. That is not going to wash because many people live and work in their communities and they make a better community. That is how we build an economic area. Now, under all the plans, we are making the situation lopsided.

I also thank all Deputies for their constructive and insightful contributions today, which are always welcome. In closing, I wish to restate the significance of the climate action plan, which sets out the steps we must take to achieve our climate objective and to evolve into a more resilient, healthy and energy-secure society. The climate action plan provides the sectoral emissions ceilings, which were approved in July of last year. They contain specific emissions reductions targets for the various sectors of our economy. The plan also provides an update on the progress that is being made in meeting Ireland's national climate objective. It seeks to identify any challenges or obstacles regarding this progress. Moreover, it sets out clear, tangible policies, measures and actions across all sectors to meet our climate goals and emission reduction targets. The plan includes actions that will transform and improve life in Ireland. For example, we are going to generate enough power from renewable electricity to provide power for every home and business in the country by 2030. We will retrofit 500,000 homes across the country to BER B2 standard. Sustainable transport modes will account for half of all daily journeys in the country. The science is very clear and definitive on the need for urgent action. The negative effects of climate change are already being experienced globally, and they will continue to increase exponentially in magnitude but also in volatility, along with global temperatures. Additionally, I reiterate the Government's commitment to climate action, which will benefit Irish citizens. It will foster innovation, create new jobs and improve our overall quality of life. As we transition away from fossil fuels and progressively decarbonise, we will ensure that the way we decarbonise captures the unique opportunity to ensure a just transition which protects those who are most vulnerable. I again thank all Members for their contributions.

It is probably not likely to take up the full 20 minutes allocated. I am very pleased to address the House on Second Stage of the Bill and to be joined by officials from the Department. The Bill is largely administrative and procedural. It provides for contingencies in the event of an emergency rather than introducing major new policy or other provisions. It is important all the same because, as Deputies will be aware, progress is being made and will continue to be made in increasing the use of renewable fuels and electrification within transport and in replacing oil use in heating in accordance with the climate action plan, which we have just discussed. Reduction in petroleum product use will be further driven by the carbon budgets and sectoral emissions ceilings. Notwithstanding this progress, the State continues to be reliant on oil to a significant extent. As Deputies will be aware, my Department monitors the security of oil supply into the State in the context of the tightening of supplies in European oil markets primarily caused by the war in Ukraine. This monitoring of the oil markets is currently being undertaken in accordance with the national energy security framework through the oil supply subgroup of the energy security emergency group. This subgroup is chaired by the Department and includes representatives from the National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA, the Department of Transport and the main oil importers into the State. Deputies should note that an adequate supply of refined product is currently available in domestic markets and the State's strategic oil reserves provide a strong buffer against any oil emergency. However, my Department, in common with many European member states and as requested by the European Commission, is currently reviewing and strengthening its oil emergency contingency planning measures. The main purpose of the Bill is to strengthen the statutory provisions available to the Government to respond to a severe or prolonged oil emergency in the context of ensuring adequate supplies for emergency and critical services. This Bill contains four Parts and 31 sections. It amends two Acts: the National Oil Reserves Agency Act 2007 and the Fuels (Control of Supplies) Act 1971. The Bill also brings into effect the transfer of statutory functions relating to renewable transport fuels from the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications to the Minister for Transport following the change in policy responsibility that took place in early 2021. In addition, the Bill provides for the Minister for Transport to make regulations to affect an increase in the use of renewable transport fuels in line with the renewable energy directive. I will provide a brief overview of the most important measures the Bill addresses before discussing them in more detail. As Deputies may be aware, there is currently no statutory requirement for the Minister to conduct oil emergency contingency planning, nor is there any provision specifying the measures to be included in any plans produced. This proposed legislation amends the 2007 Act to place a statutory onus on the Minister to produce an oil emergency contingency plan and specifies the main elements to be contained within the plan. I am also making provisions requiring co-operation from relevant public bodies and oil companies with the Minister in the making of the plan and in response to any oil emergency. These provisions will facilitate the further development of oil emergency contingency planning. The Bill also provides for the establishment of a petroleum register. This register will provide the necessary contact information to allow for timely communication between the Minister and the oil companies, the operators of service stations, and other oil wholesalers and retailers operating within the State, in the event it is ever necessary to activate emergency plans. I am also making provisions for the transfer of excise information relating to the disposal by sale of mineral oil within the State from the Revenue Commissioners to the Minister. This data will provide a more complete understanding of oil sales and consumption within the State, including within the service station network, and will assist across a range of oil emergency contingency planning activities. This legislation amends the 1971 Act to provide for the overall strengthening of the Minister's powers to respond urgently to a fuel emergency. The amendments allow the Minister, by order, where there is a Government order in place during a severe fuel emergency, to provide for direction-making powers to regulate, restrict or control the acquisition, supply, distribution, marketing or use of fuels in order to protect the operation of the electricity grid and other essential services. In addition, I am making provision for the exemption by the Minister for Transport of NORA's strategic stocks, not capable of being blended with biofuels and released to rectify a shortage in the markets, from counting towards a renewable transport fuels obligation. This is being done to remove an anomaly whereby currently strategic stocks that cannot be blended with biofuels nonetheless attract a blending obligation and, to ensure that such stocks will be placed quickly by the oil companies onto the market in an emergency, to protect the operation of critical services. In 2021, the policy responsibility for renewable transport measures transferred from the remit of the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications to the Minister for Transport. In order to affect the necessary transfer of relevant statutory provisions, including responsibility for the renewable transport fuel obligation scheme, the Bill provides for the transfer of necessary functions under the relevant sections of the 2007 Act and the separation of relevant ministerial responsibilities for operational reasons. Functions within a number of relevant regulations will also be transferred to the Minister for Transport. The Bill also provides for the Minister for Transport to make regulations to affect an increase in the use of renewable transport fuels and to incentivise their use for particular purposes in line with the renewable energy directive and climate policy. This includes providing for the Minister for Transport to make regulations to provide for the issuing by NORA of additional certificates under the renewable transport fuel obligation scheme to incentivise the use of certain renewable transport fuels. Prior to making such regulations, the Minister for Transport is required to consult relevant Ministers and bodies. In addition, and subject to the consent of the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, the Minister for Transport may make regulations specifying the minimum percentage volume of renewable transport fuel to be present in fuel disposed of by sale or otherwise in the State by a renewable transport fuel obligation account holder. Deputies will note that these provisions are consistent with the aims of the renewable energy directive, are in line with the fuel quality directive and enable the implementation of the E10 petrol grade in the State aligning fuel grades with those available in Northern Ireland. I now propose to give a more detailed overview of the Bill in each of its four Parts. Part 1 contains standard legislative provisions that cover the Short Title of the Bill and its commencement. Part 2 amends the 2007 Act. I will draw particular attention to the key provisions of Part 2. In sections 4 to 7, we provide for information sharing and co-operation between the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications and the Minister for Transport relating to the governance of the renewable transport fuel scheme functions carried out by NORA. These sections also include a requirement for NORA to provide the Minister for Transport with the relevant information relating to its operation of the scheme. Section 8 provides that information transferred by the Revenue Commissioners to the Minister may only be used in the exercise of his or her powers and functions relating to the administration of the NORA levy, or in the preparation of the oil emergency plan, and shall not be disclosed by the Minister to any other person for any other purpose whatsoever. Sections 10 and 11 provide that the Minister for Transport may make regulations authorising NORA to issue additional certificates in respect of renewable transport fuels for the purpose of incentivising the use of these fuels in particular sectors and means of transport. The Minister for Transport may also, with the consent of the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, make regulations specifying the minimum percentage volume of renewable transport fuel to be present in fuel disposed of by sale or otherwise in the State by a renewable transport fuel obligation account holder. The Minister for Transport must consult appropriate bodies as set out in the legislation before making these regulations and consider the effect on fuel prices in the State and the requirements of relevant energy and climate plans, carbon budgets and sectoral emissions ceilings.Section 14 provides for an exemption from the renewable transport fuel obligation in cases of particular urgency. The Minister for Transport, following consultation with the Minister and NORA, and having regard to relevant climate legislation, may determine that oil stocks to be released that cannot be blended with biofuels be exempt from counting towards obliged parties' renewable transport fuel obligation in cases of particular urgency. Section 18 provides that the Minister for Transport may make regulations and orders in respect of the renewable transport fuel obligation and advanced biofuel obligation. Section 20 provides for the preparation of an oil emergency plan, to be prepared by the Minister with the assistance of NORA, oil companies, oil consumers and such public bodies as the Minister considers appropriate, and for the plan to be implemented in the event of an oil supply disruption. Provision is made for the plan to contain certain measures to be implemented by the Government, as required, including the timely release of strategic stocks, a reduction in the consumption of oil and the prioritisation of stocks for emergency and critical services. The requirement to include these measures arises from the obligations on member states to conduct the emergency planning contained in the EU oil stocks directive. Section 21 provides that the Minister shall establish and maintain a register of oil companies to be known as the petroleum register. It specifies the information to be contained in the register and provides for annual reporting by each company of updated information. Part 3 provides for the transfer of statutory functions relating to renewable transport fuels under the 2007 Act from the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications to the Minister for Transport. I will draw attention to a number of the provisions of Part 3. Sections 23 to 30, inclusive, provide that the necessary functions relating to renewable transport fuels currently conferred on the Minister under Part 5A of the Act of 2007, SI 33 of 2012, SI 160 of 2017 and regulation 4 as amended by SI 350 of 2022 are transferred to the Minister for Transport on the vesting day. Provision is made for the transfer and continuation of various administrative matters, including those relating to the continuation of business and legal proceedings, and to ensure that relevant statutory instruments made or granted previously are considered in future to be made by the Minister for Transport. Provision is also made for the appointment of a vesting day, subsequent to the commencement of the Act.  Part 4 amends the Fuels (Control of Supplies) Act 1971. Section 31 amends section 3 of the Act of 1971. Section 3 currently provides that where there is a fuel emergency necessitating a Government order under section 1 of the Act, the Minister may, by order under section 3, provide for the regulation or control of the acquisition, supply, distribution or marketing of the type or types of fuels to which the Government order relates. In this Bill, I am also providing that the Minister may, within such an order under section 3, provide for the necessary powers to, by direction in writing, control such oil supplies in this way where it is absolutely necessary to quickly divert oil stocks to generate electricity in the event of a significant gas disruption or to protect the operation of services deemed by the Minister to be critical. The legislation before the House today also includes some consequential and other technical amendments but the provisions I have outlined are the principal issues. To give the broader context, my understanding is that the need for this legislation and the amendments I have set out, which are, as I have said, largely technical in nature, mainly came from work done in my Department and relevant agencies in the last year to prepare for an oil emergency arising due to the global events with which we are all very familiar, including the sanctioning of Russian oil and gas imports into the EU. It is not that we see this as an immediate possibility but that we are preparing for any such contingency. The lesson from some of the exercises that were done when we were assessing our preparedness was that some further tightening of the legislation was needed so that, if such an emergency were to take place, the Minister of the day would have all powers necessary to protect our society and the critical supply of energy to key sectors within our country. As I have said, it is in a spirit of caution and in preparation for such an eventuality rather than in any expectation of it that the legislation is presented. I commend the legislation and hope for the agreement of the House to the question.

I will share time with my colleagues. It is a 20-minute slot. I will take ten minutes and allow five minutes each for Deputies Cronin and Martin Browne. I regret that the Minister is ushering through yet another Bill at breakneck speed without sufficient parliamentary scrutiny. This method is becoming the norm for the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan. For example, the Marine Casualty Investigation Board Bill was rushed through, as was the Development (Emergency Electricity Generation) Bill 2022. The EirGrid, Electricity and Turf (Amendment) Bill 2022 was also hurried through the Dáil and did not undergo any prelegislative scrutiny. In addition, both electricity credit Bills were brought through the Houses at speed. The Minister seems to be setting aside long-standing parliamentary process and scrutiny and ramming through legislation that has undergone very little prior examination by Deputies and Senators. An absence of prelegislative scrutiny combined with guillotined debates from this Government is a recipe for disaster. Rushing legislation can lead to bad legislation. I put on record our concern about this regular approach from the Minister. Here we are again today, on the first day after a four-week recess, with another Bill that has not undergone prelegislative scrutiny by the climate committee, which the Government intends to ram through all Stages in a matter of weeks. This Bill would confer significant additional powers on the Minister that relate to an essential commodity that everyone in the State needs to heat their homes or power their vehicles. Section 31, nestled neatly in the last line of the Bill, seeks to confer on the Minister the power to “regulate, restrict or control the acquisition, supply, distribution, marketing or use of the type or types of fuel”. That one sentence is extremely wide-ranging and would have major consequences for individuals, households, businesses and the economy. It bestows great power on one Minister. Whether we like it or not, oil remains an absolutely essential commodity so any emergency powers relating to its control and supply need to be carefully considered. Because it has not been examined in detail and the consequences have not been teased out, Sinn Féin will be submitting amendments to the Bill, one of which would require the Minister to seek Dáil approval to regulate, restrict or control the acquisition, supply, distribution, marketing or use of a fuel. Sinn Féin will not be writing blank cheques for this Minister. It is important to ask why exactly we are here. We are living in extraordinary times due to the war in Ukraine and the impact it has had on our fuel supplies and their prices. It is important to respond to that. The Government will seek to lay the entire blame on the war but that is simply not the full picture. This State remains heavily reliant on imported oil due to the failure of successive Government policies in the areas of energy, transport and residential heating. Over the past decade, successive governments failed to realise our potential for offshore wind power. Not one offshore wind turbine was constructed during their tenure in government. While countries like Scotland were literally laying the foundations of massive offshore wind farms, successive administrations here simply sat on their hands. I visited a Scottish wind farm off the coast of Aberdeen last year. That project alone will power 1 million homes. There is absolutely no reason Ireland could not be in the same position right now. Indeed, we should be further ahead given our extensive revenue-raising ability compared with Scotland but a lack of action and ambition over the past decade has left us trailing behind. As a result, we are reliant on imported gas and oil to keep the lights on. That is one reason the Minister is seeking these additional powers here today. The slow pace of change to electric vehicles is another reason. Other countries, like Norway, have powered ahead with their transition to electric vehicles, EVs. For years now, Sinn Féin has being calling for alternative policies to be introduced to help to speed up the transition to EVs but these calls have not been heeded. We called for a second-hand EV grant to be introduced to help ordinary people to afford an EV, such as been done in other countries. This has been ignored. We suggested that increased grants for lower income households could be looked at. This suggestion was not taken up. We also called for the VAT and customs costs that are in place as a result of Brexit to be removed to encourage the importation of used EVs from Britain, which has, in the past, been a significant market for the importation of used cars.That was not, however, looked at. Building a second-hand EV market is important to make EVs accessible to more people on normal incomes. All three of these initiatives could be funded through reform of the existing grant scheme, which has a budget of €100 million. Reducing the value threshold of cars that qualify for grant aid, for example, would free up tens of millions of euro to be redirected to these more equitable policies, but instead the Government has been handing out grants of €5,000 to people who do not need financial help, supporting the purchase of expensive sports cars and luxury EVs and boosting the egos of multibillionaires who run many of these companies. No help or assistance has been provided to ordinary people to help them to afford an EV; quite the opposite. They are the ones who have been punished by the Government's carbon tax. It is a perfect example of the Government’s wider approach to climate action. EVs make up 20% of all cars in Norway now. In Ireland, this number is just 2.7% according to statistics from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI. This is another reason the Government is seeking these emergency powers on the distribution of fuel. Its policies on EVs have failed dramatically and left us with a tiny proportion of EVs on our roads and therefore heavily reliant on imported oil, which history will tell us is a volatile commodity. We did not need to wait for the war in Ukraine to learn that. The same can be said regarding getting people out of their private cars and onto public transport. I raised this point with the Minister earlier concerning the need to invest significantly in the rural transport plan to ensure that communities that do not have bus services get such services and that the services in those communities that have them are improved and made affordable, accessible, reliable and safe. Let us look at the Connecting Ireland plan. The scale of funding required is not there. It needs to be increased. As I said to the Minister earlier, Sinn Féin would commit €25 million to that plan in 2023. This would ensure a significant increase in the roll-out and would mean that in 2024, if the funding was matched again, the full plan would be rolled out. This would deliver significantly increased services and present people with the realistic option of leaving their cars behind. A two-car family could become a one-car family. The daily commute could be broken up, being done some days by car and other days by public transport. People will not, however, do this when they do not have that option. Another reason we are here and we are so dependent on oil and liquid fuels is because of a failure to roll out public transport. The same can be said when it comes to residential heating. Homes across Ireland are still reliant on burning oil to keep warm, because the Government's retrofitting plan has and is bypassing them. These households cannot afford to upgrade their heating systems, as the Government's retrofitting plan is inequitable and inaccessible. Over the past decade, shallow retrofits fell by 88%, resulting in lost heat and a higher demand for oil to keep warm. Failed policies on retrofitting mean burning oil to keep warm is still a reality for far too many people, and this further increases our reliance on imported fuels. While the war in Ukraine might be the handiest excuse to hand for the Minister, in reality failed policies in the areas of energy, transport and residential heating have all contributed to our massive reliance on imported oil and left this State and our people worryingly exposed to imported fuel. We need policy change in the area of offshore wind in order to accelerate it and this must involve widespread State ownership. We need policy change with regard to EVs to support ordinary people, with regard to residential heating to have a fair and equitable retrofitting plan and with regard to public transport to ensure people have access to such transport. In terms of more sustainable residential heating systems, Sinn Féin has asked the Minister to explore the use of hydrotreated vegetable oil, or HVO, as a cleaner alternative for home heating. HVO, which can be used in traditional home heating oil boilers, cuts emissions by between 80% and 90% compared to home heating oil.  We will submit amendments to this Bill and continue to engage with this process. We have concerns regarding this legislation. We recognise that it is necessary but there is much more than can and should be done. 
#MartinBrowne	unknown-#MartinBrowne-party	unknown-#MartinBrowne-dob	unknown-#MartinBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-18 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	244	The measures and powers proposed by the Minister in this legislation are extraordinary in nature. They reflect the current challenges we face as a consequence of the illegal invasion by Russia of Ukraine. We must, however, be aware that among the factors that make the introduction of this Bill necessary is the Government's poor policy choices and its failure to invest over the years. Like Deputy O'Rourke, I wish to raise the worries we have about this legislation being rammed through like this. There was no pre-legislative scrutiny or debate, and this seems to be an approach that the Minister and others on that side of the House have taken since they have come to power. This has put energy affordability and security in the precarious position we are being asked to mitigate against. The failure to realise the potential of our own wind and solar resources and the consequent failure to reduce our dependence on imported liquid fossil fuels at pace has also left us excessively exposed to the negative impacts of an energy crisis arising from global events that are out of our hands. In the Department's statement on this Bill, it admitted that its "main purpose ... is to strengthen the Government's ability to manage stocks in the ... event of a curtailment of oil supplies". It went on to note that the "Bill follows work undertaken by the department last year, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine". Herein lies the problem. The Government has a habit of preparing for potential problems once we are in the heat of these issues. It is the case here because the statement on the website of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications states that "there is also an onus on the government to provide confidence to households and businesses with respect to the security of Ireland’s energy supply". Yet in the same statement, the Department concedes that "it has [only] been testing emergency plans in recent months". This is all but an admission on the part of the Government that it has failed to manage our energy system adequately and that it is now scrambling to address the key concerns raised with it over the years. We need to deliver adequate gas storage, which has been recommended for years. Has the Government listened? Given that we find ourselves in a situation in which we are now discussing a Bill of this nature, the answer is obviously in the negative. As for the provisions in this legislation, a central aim is to strengthen the Government's ability to manage our stocks in the event of a curtailment of oil supplies. For this reason, the Minister has been given a range of enhanced powers, including the power, when necessary, to control the supply and distribution of oil within the State in an emergency. This is a considerable power to invest upon the Minister. We must for that reason ensure that it is kept under constant review and that the Minister is accountable to the Dáil on the use of these measures. This again indicates how our reliance on liquid fuels has been allowed to continue. Little was done over the years to enable families to move away from kerosene for home heating, for example, while the supports available to get people into EVs are insignificant and only target those who have the financial means to invest in these vehicles. The same is the case when it comes to retrofitting, which has left out considerable cohorts of people, such as those in old stone buildings, etc. Ireland has a sea area seven times the size of our landmass, and this area has a long-term potential opportunity of generating 70 GW of ocean energy. With innovations in green hydrogen and battery storage, we have an increasing ability to translate our vast resources into clean energy that could be released on demand. Sinn Féin has promoted this policy for years. We have also been pointing out to the Government the need to recalibrate our planning system to assist in the development of our wind energy resources at sea and the adversarial planning system that results in uncertainty in communities and delays as a result. The Government needs to start listening and to not shut out valid voices because it is intent on being the ones in the right. Effectively, then, this Bill, while necessary in ways, is in large part the direct consequence of poor Government policy and decision-making. When I talk about decision-making, I am not talking about the decisions we are forced to make in the depths of a crisis; I am talking about the Government's poor record in making provisions for the future and for the unexpected. This Bill is the equivalent of a last-minute scramble by a Government that continuously fails to plan and has a record of making demands of the people to put a sticking plaster on its own shortcomings. Sinn Féin, therefore, will support this Bill but we will be submitting amendments to ensure that the extensive powers being acquired by the Minister are reviewed and limited and that he is held accountable by the Oireachtas.

I spoke to the Minister earlier about public transport. I talked about the climate action plan.It is a no-brainer for the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications. I am sure Deputy Eamon Ryan is the envy of other Ministers for climate change across Europe when he has the portfolio and all the power that goes along with being the Minister for Transport too. Speaking of power, my party supports the Bill in principle but we have reservations, and not a little concern, about the power that it gives the Minister. It is very disappointing that we did not get pre-legislative scrutiny at the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action. We will table amendments, as my two comrades have said, when it comes to Committee Stage. The granting of such power to the Minister demands equally powerful accountability. We want to make sure that the Minister is fully accountable to the Oireachtas in his holding and wielding of it. This is particularly so given the tricky juncture we are at now, with a war in Europe, with future threats to energy that might entail and, across the EU as well, with governments of the right establishing themselves in several countries and the potential consequences if they opt to not act in solidarity with the wider European family. This is particularly so, too, in the current Administration that is prone to silo thinking and is failing steadily on joined-up thinking, whether around the appalling bus service in north Kildare that is putting people back into cars or elsewhere. I was speaking to the Minister earlier about young people who cannot rely on the bus service such as people living in Prosperous coming into Maynooth. If they cannot rely on the bus service and they cannot afford to buy an electric vehicle, although the grants might be good, they buy a banger of a car to get on the road. I spoke of how the rocketing costs of living and the scary costs of renting are leaving us short of teachers. We need joined-up thinking. We have women having to quit work because they cannot rely on the public transport to get them into work. We have the problems in our health service as well. These are, basically, all the things that make society work and can make or break a life day to day. I have spoken today about how I realise that the Minister has his work cut out for him. He does not only have to listen to climate deniers across this side of the House; he also has a few in government too. That must be difficult for the Green Party but it illustrates the way, and perhaps the reasons, over ten years the Government has been slow to deliver on renewables. That slowness is shown in the failure to move people away from kerosene to heat their homes and from petrol to diesel in cars, although the Green Party had something to do with the fact that we have so many diesel cars on the road, but we are in a tricky situation where we are exposed and highly dependent on liquid fuel. It has been recommended for years that we establish good gas storage, most recently in the energy security review, but that was not done either. We have a heck of a lot to do. The Bill gives the Minister a heck of a lot of powers to do it but, for us, accountability is key. We are very disappointed that there was not pre-legislative scrutiny. We will table amendments on Committee Stage and we hope that the Minister will look upon those.
#IvanaBacik	unknown-#IvanaBacik-party	unknown-#IvanaBacik-dob	unknown-#IvanaBacik-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-18 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	246	I am glad to take this opportunity to discuss the Bill to strengthen the State's ability to manage stocks in the event of a curtailment of oil supplies. I listened to the Minister’s assurances that no such shortage is imminent. Indeed, I agree it is important that debates in the House on energy security do not give rise to any sense of panic but it is inevitable that at some stage fossil fuels will no longer be available to us to further exploit. It is also clearly in the context of the brutal invasion of Ukraine by Russia that we are having the debate. That has made us all acutely aware about the risks to our energy security and fuel security. It is both in the context of the climate catastrophe and in the context of that brutal war that we are having this debate. With that in mind, I look forward to further engaging with the Minister on the Bill and on other measures to make more durable the various sectors of everyday life that are most vulnerable to fluctuations in the supply of fossil fuels and energy insecurity. The Bill offers some welcome clarity around the powers of the Minister, and how quickly they can be deployed to control the supply and distribution of fuel in an emergency. The Bill will also put all aspects of oil emergency planning on a statutory footing and will establish a register of oil suppliers to ensure fast communication to retailers, which is positive. We are all conscious that, as part of our EU and International Energy Agency obligations, NORA should maintain approximately 85 days of strategic stocks. That stock holding is expected to be at 90 days, I understand, by the end of this month. Without adequate contingency plans, that is not a long enough time. It is all well and good to protect and preserve fossil fuels for emergency use. Of course, our priority must be reducing our reliance on fossil fuels, but also in the interim insulating people from market-driven volatility on international wholesale energy markets. In that regard, we in Labour have previously raised with the Minister the prospect of the Government engaging in a temporary nationalisation of the Corrib Gas Field. I renew my call on him and his Government colleagues to give that serious consideration. It does not require any additional legislation. It is a matter that does not need to be dealt with within this legislation because legislation is in place from the 1970s giving Government that power. We believe that temporary nationalisation of the Corrib field should form part of any contingency plan to mitigate supply line disruptions. It would mitigate supply line disruptions by providing a healthy supply, a guarantee of supply and, crucially, allowing for price control. I have spoken previously about the anomaly that gas produced locally in the Corrib gas field is still subject to price determination by reference to international markets. As a result, we see the owners of the field gaining what one might describe as "windfall profits" because, for them, the cost of production has not increased. It has not been affected directly by the war in Ukraine, yet they are benefiting from the international setting of prices in this way. Of course, we appreciate that the best contingency plan to mitigate supply lines of imported fuel being interrupted is to develop our own indigenous clean energy sources and we believe that much more should be done by Government on that. This Bill, and the context of a war, should not be allowed to distract from the much more pressing need to realise our potential as a world leader in clean energy production. We need in Ireland to rapidly accelerate our efforts towards deployment of onshore wind, offshore wind and solar capacity. The Government has ambitions to do that but we need to see delivery of that. We need to see serious investment in energy efficiency and in the development of renewable capacity. We need to see an expanding interconnection with European energy suppliers and deepening internal market integration. We need to break the hold of the fossil fuel oligarchs and magnates to make Ireland the renewable superpower that the Minister thinks we can, and we all want to, be but we need to see a greater sense of urgency in the delivery of that objective. Of course, one of the most versatile ways to avoid chaos in the transport sector in the event of an oil crisis is to make more accessible the options of walking, cycling and travelling in electric vehicles or vehicles powered by green hydrogen. We discussed this to some extent earlier in the debate on the climate action plan. We are all conscious of the embeddedness of oil and other fossil fuels within transport. The Minister pointed out that transport was one of the most difficult sectors in which to achieve reductions in emissions. We know how heavily dependent Ireland is on imported fossil fuels for transport, as well as for energy generation and for heating. They comprise 80% of fossil fuels at present. That is a chilling context within which we have this debate. Part of the plan to create durable systems to withstand inevitable difficulties with oil supply must involve that key transition to modes of transport not vulnerable to shortages. I welcomed the report this morning of the new EV charging measures to remove or at least reduce so-called "range anxiety" to encourage more people to make the shift from fossil fuel vehicles to electric vehicles. I was glad in that context to read in the climate action plan what was set out as part of the avoid, shift, improve framework. Welcome measures include the setting of a target of a 50% increase in daily active travel journeys and a 130% increase in daily public transport journeys. The improved targets that set percentage shares for low-fossil public and private vehicles, including the goal that 100% of new car registrations should be EVs, are also welcome. We have seen impressive increases in the take-up of EVs but we are still not coming close to the targets set by Government.Delivery is key on this issue. At local level, every week in my constituency, which is also the Minister's, I hear from constituents who want to make the move to electric vehicles but who do not have a driveway or any accessible charging point they can use to ensure they would be able to use an EV. I reiterate my call for better provision of EV charging, not only on motorway networks as the Minister outlined earlier but also for charging on streets where houses do not have driveways or where there are apartment blocks. At present these people do not have access to any public or private charging point. The lack of such charging points is preventing people from making the necessary move to EVs. It would be positive to see greater movement on it this year. I have engaged closely with Dublin City Council on this and I am constantly told that new strategies are being rolled out. Again, we are just not seeing delivery. In the Portobello area, there is one public charging point and it is always in use. This is the area where I live. No house has a driveway. Many people in this area who need cars want to make a move to electric vehicles. They are prevented, or at least discouraged, from doing so because of the lack of charging facilities. There are lofty public transport goals in the climate action plan, including progress on continuing the programmes of work; advancing BusConnects in five cities; MetroLink; DART+; the Cork area commuter rail programme; PSO electric bus fleet procurement, including depot charging upgrades; and investment in passenger freight rail. These are flagship infrastructure projects. The Labour Party is glad progress is being made on these. We emphasise the potential for climate action and the transport revolution to raise standards of living in Ireland by creating new well-paid unionised jobs in these sectors, thus providing for the all-important just transition we speak about as a party of the left and the party of the trade union movement. We reiterate our call for a widening of access to public transport and the introduction of a €9 climate ticket to incentivise greater use of public transport in towns and cities in all our communities. We believe this initiative should have been undertaken by the Government in the budget to encourage greater usage of public transport and to address the cost-of-living crisis by reducing public transport fares and transport costs from many families and households. Other smaller changes are required to support all of those who wish to make the shift to public transport. In our constituency, Labour Party Councillors, Dermot Lacey, Kevin Donoghue and, in particular, Mary Freehill, have been working on small but significant ways to make public transport more accessible. Councillor Mary Freehill has done work with the age-friendly working group in the Kimmage and Rathmines area, for example, seeking to make bus stops more accessible. Many bus stops in Dublin lack seating. It may sound like a small thing but when I raise this at meetings with local residents I find it is something that older people in the community in particular find a real hindrance to using buses. There is a simple bus pole and often there is no shelter or no seating. This can be a disincentive for people who want to use public transport but, as they have mobility issues, are put off by the prospect of having to stand for long periods at a bus stop. For those who find it difficult to avail of such facilities for reason of age or disability, it is a disincentive to using buses. Councillor Freehill, having investigated the matter, learned the primary obstacle to the NTA installing seating at bus stops, which was the simple request she made, is a refusal by users of the advertising panels at bus stops to cede space. The company that runs the advertising believes that putting in seating, even where there are panels and the facility to do so, would diminish the scope for advertising. In addition to electronic advertisements being a problematic addition to the public landscape, the fact they would take precedence over access for ordinary citizens shows the need for a readjustment of priorities. I appeal to the Minister to address this point. As a cyclist it would be remiss of me to omit from my contribution the awesome power of cycling as a tool in the fight against energy insecurity and climate change. I am glad some promising bicycle infrastructure programmes are starting to come onstream. It is promising, for example, to see Dublin City Council rolling out such an extensive network of cycle lanes across the city. That is welcome and long overdue. We in the Labour Party have long called for the extension of the cycle to work tax scheme to allow parents to purchase bikes for their children. We call it a bike to school scheme. We have costed it at €1.4 million. We believe it would have a significant impact in encouraging the uptake of cycling among children and younger people. The problem is the current tax scheme does not support those out of work or those who are self-employed to purchase a bike nor does it offer supports for parents to buy bikes for their children. We would allocate additional funding through the social welfare allowance additional needs payment to provide grants of up to €250 to support those who want to buy a bike but who are not covered by the cycle to work scheme at present. Alongside this we are calling for the Government to carry out a comprehensive review of how the tax system could be better used to incentivise the uptake of cycling, e-bikes and cargo bikes by homes and businesses. The cycle to work scheme has been a huge success but it is about how we can expand the take-up. This is the question. I hope the Minister will take these suggestions on board in the spirit of constructive engagement. As we are discussing the volatility of the energy market and the effects of external factors, in particular, the war in Ukraine, I want to express my sympathy to those killed this morning in the attack near Kyiv. It is another appalling loss of life. We have seen so much loss of life since Vladimir Putin commenced his brutal invasion, which is an affront to our values of democracy, justice and respect for life. While it is our friends in Ukraine and neighbouring countries who are suffering the worst consequences of Putin's awful invasion, it is also a reminder of how vulnerable our way of life is to the whims of despots and warmongers. When we debate Bills such as this it bears repeating why we are debating them and what the context is. Climate change and conflict around the world are strongly interlinked. The protection of our fuel systems and the protection of fuel and energy security in Ireland is closely related to the protection of our peace and democratic values. None of this should be taken for granted. Part of our resistance to dictators such as Putin must involve showing that we are serious about building our resilience so that not only Ireland but all European countries and all democratic countries will not be held to ransom by those who seek to meddle or interfere with our energy supply, or to interfere at a much more substantial level with our country and our way of life, as we have seen in Ukraine. I look forward to further engaging with the Minister and the Department on the Bill. I reiterate that the context in which we are debating the Bill is one that none of us could have envisaged a year ago. We all thought it would not happen and now we are 11 months into a brutal war. Of course it is raising all of these questions about fuel security and, more fundamentally, about the security of all of our countries and peace in Europe. It is in this serious and depressing context that we debate the legislation. The Labour Party will support it because we recognise the need for it. Without wanting to raise any panic it is important that contingencies should be made. We appeal to the Minister to consider other contingencies, such as the nationalisation of Corrib and, of course, the important climate action plan measures on transport and so many other ways in which we can reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.

The merits of the Bill speak for themselves and it should be roundly supported in the House. I want to make a number of points. A new strategy paper is to be published later this month on offshore wind. I hear there will be segregation between anchored east coast offshore wind turbines versus their floating counterparts off the Atlantic coastline. This is understandable. They are two very different pieces of infrastructure. With regard to their progression through the regulatory system, MARA and the planning regime, I hear the anchored turbines will be fast tracked while the floating turbines will be slowed down. This would be a retrograde step because we have incredible potential off the Atlantic coastline. Many diplomatic staff from other countries have been wearing a path to Leinster House lauding how incredible this would be in meeting energy targets for the European Union and for greening the Irish economy. The potential it has is incredible. At present, wind projects offshore in the Atlantic worth €78 billion are in the pipeline.Behind some of those projects are some massive, global, heavy-hitting companies. If we are going to have them sit back a little while the east coast progresses, it would be a retrograde step and would send out the wrong signals. There is a worry that the companies, along with the investment, would move to and set up in another windy part of Europe. We must seize this opportunity and not have a two-tier system. If there is a project that can progress, let it progress. The Minister should not take a two-tier approach to this. I refer to the issue of offshore wind and how equipped our Irish ports are to meet the infrastructure needs of those project. I recently attended a meeting in Leinster House where I discovered we are not that well equipped at all in our port system for developing and bringing onto site the infrastructure required for offshore wind. Other European nations had not only an offshore strategy but an onshore strategy to ensure they could build the best quality equipment and infrastructure and to tow it into place. The worry is that if we do not quickly get to that pace in Ireland, our offshore turbines will be constructed in Rotterdam, Bremen and Hamburg, and they will tow them onto site. There are two phases to this, both of which are equally lucrative. Phase 2 is generating this huge volume of offshore wind energy, using it domestically and selling it to our counterparts in continental Europe, which is very lucrative. However, phase 1 is the economy around building an offshore network of wind energy and I do not know whether we are moving at the pace to provide that. It would be a shame to see other European countries rush in to build the infrastructure when we probably would have the ability to do so if we had a strategy to pull these last few elements together. With regard to renewable energy, we have an exciting project in Shannon, which the Minister is supportive of. The old fuel farms that were developed adjacent to Shannon Airport in the 1970s will hopefully be converted into hydrogen storage hubs soon. All the wind energy generated off the west coast of County Clare, brought ashore at Moneypoint, will be transferred to a hydrogen storage facility at Shannon, the potential of which is incredible. We need to push that out a little bit further because, using leaving certificate science, if nitrogen is added to hydrogen, one ends up with ammonia, which is a far more stable fuel to export, put into tankers and bring all over the world. An Oireachtas joint committee, of which I am a member, recently travelled to the Netherlands to look at where they were at in respect of sustainable travel and renewables, etc. It is not just hydrogen; they also have an ammonia strategy. This is how it will be brought around internationally as a more stable fuel that can be exported. I would love to see an additional layer put on top of those plans, at Moneypoint and Shannon, to ensure not just the production of raw hydrogen but that we have an exportable, stable and safe ammonia fuel that can be brought around. Several Deputies mentioned public transport, of which the Minister is a great advocate. I travelled to the Dáil on the train this morning, which I do as often as I can. It is a fantastic way to travel, but it takes an inordinate time and a lot of expense to construct a rail system. Someone recently told me that five buses equal one train. A bus can be provided quickly. It does not have to follow a linear route of railway lines set down in the 1800s, or lines that are soon to be built at an extraordinary cost. Buses are a quick and cheaper way of getting the tentacles of public transport into the smallest rural communities and the most densely developed urban communities. Buses need to feature more in our strategy. I would like to comment on the wind energy guidelines, which I mentioned earlier in the Chamber today. They are grossly outdated. They date back to 2008. They were being overhauled in 2019, a draft version of which was brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas in December 2019. Along came the general election in January 2020 and Covid immediately afterwards. A series of events have caught up with us and we find ourselves three years out from when they were to be agreed, but that is not so important. It is 15 years since these guidelines were formulated. They are outdated. They are outdated to a person who wants to develop wind energy, and they are equally outdated to a community that feels there has been a proliferation of wind turbines around them and does not have sufficient protection. They are outdated on many fronts. If the guidelines were to see the light of day now, they would probably no longer relate to the level at which technology is now because they were formulated in 2019. This is not good enough. We have heard time and again that they are ready to go. They need to be agreed. I once heard they were on the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien's, desk. I believe they could now be on the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan's, desk. When he is wrapping up, I would love to know where these guidelines are at and when do we hope to implement them.
#PatriciaRyan	unknown-#PatriciaRyan-party	unknown-#PatriciaRyan-dob	unknown-#PatriciaRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-18 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	248	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. It is long overdue and it requires the Minister to conduct oil emergency planning and obliges oil companies to co-operate with the Department and public bodies in the creation of such a plan. It will establish a centralised register of oil companies, both retail and wholesale, and give extra powers to the Minister for Transport relating to the renewable transport fuel obligation scheme and a biofuel levy under the National Oil Reserves Agency Act. This will allow the Minister to specify the level of ethanol in petrol. It would also provide for a number of certificates that can be awarded for certain renewable transport fuels to incentivise their supply. We in Sinn Féin support the Bill in principle but we have reservations about the extent of powers being given to the Minister for Transport. There must be sufficient accountability to the Oireachtas. Other colleagues have said we will table amendments to the Bill. The powers being given to the Minister are significant. We are in extraordinary times due to the war in Ukraine with the effect this has had on fuel supply. It is important these powers be kept under review. The public is well aware of the Government's failure to adequately respond to the cost-of-living crisis, particularly in respect of the cost of fuel. We saw last year that the Government was slow to react to the struggles of ordinary workers and families. Sinn Féin argued, throughout the crisis, that taxes charged by the Government at the pump should be reduced to the greatest extent permissible. In our alternative budget, we proposed excise duty changes that would have reduced the cost of 1,000 l of oil by €118. Years of mismanagement by the Government and its failure to adequately manage our energy system have left us in a position where we are far too dependent on liquid fuel. If the Government had prepared better, delivered more renewable energy over the past decade, we would not be so exposed. If the Government had supported more families to transition from kerosene for home heating oil, we would not be in this position. If the Government had gone the extra mile - no pun intended - to support the transition away from petrol and diesel cars, we would not face this problem. If the Government had delivered gas storage, which has been recommended for years in the energy security review, we would not be here today trying to close the gate after the horse has bolted. The Government's record is one of failure both in addressing the energy security crisis and the climate crisis that we are now facing because of it. It is time to call an election so that Sinn Féin can deliver real change rather than the constant firefighting that is going on across this Chamber floor.

It speaks to a real concern many people have about the State's ability to ensure we have a secure supply of fuel not just for the coming winter and spring of 2023 but into the future as well. Since the outbreak of war in Ukraine, fuel prices and supply chains have been heavily impacted. Many people are living that reality. It is good to see this kind of measure being given time in the Dáil. I share the concerns of others about how we are seeing many emergency measures coming into play with limited consultation and discussion. We are a year into this crisis and I am surprised that we continue to see emergency Bills and measures being put in place. The Bill seeks to address several areas, including providing more clarity on the powers of the Minister and how quickly they can be deployed to control the supply and distribution of fuel in an emergency; putting all aspects of oil emergency planning on a statutory footing; establishing a register of oil suppliers to ensure fast communication to retailers; allowing Revenue to share data on oil movements to enhance responsiveness of the State in an emergency; and the transfer of functions from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications to the Department of Transport regarding renewable transport fuels. When I resume my contribution tomorrow, I will raise the transfer in particular and whether the Minister of the Environment, Climate and Communications will continue to have any oversight of or be able to view those decisions if this area is completely transferred to the Minister for Transport. I note the Minister, when speaking about the Bill recently, said it was part of a suite of initiatives being deployed by his Department to ensure the security of Ireland's energy supply in the near future.I am interested in hearing what further upcoming measures, if any, the Minister will bring forward in the near future with regard to that. The Minister also stated the long-term priority is to insulate consumers from volatility on the international wholesale markets by investing in energy efficiency and renewable energy, expanding interconnection with European markets and deepening Internal Market integration. I will focus on that issue tomorrow and on how we can ensure that not just businesses and the State, but communities, individuals and homes can become as energy resilient as possible in order that these kinds of initiatives become less important or necessary.
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-18 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	250	Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for the opportunity to address Dáil Éireann and clarify matters pertaining to the 2016 election campaign. In that campaign, the Fine Gael organisation in Dublin Central was offered assistance with my re-election campaign, erecting and removing posters. This assistance was understood by me to be on a voluntary basis. It was provided across four dates during the campaign period before and after polling day. Six individuals were involved, working in three pairs. Neither I nor anyone involved in my campaign team paid the people concerned, nor was I, at that time, aware they had been paid. For that reason, no cost was attributed to this support on the election expense form submitted to the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, following the election. In December, in light of a complaint made to SIPO concerning this support and the letter confirming the receipt of a complaint which I received last Friday, I undertook a full review of the campaign in recent weeks. During the course of the review, I was made aware that the individual concerned had been paid for their help in the 2016 campaign. I was not aware before this time of any payment having been made. It was a personal payment made by Mr. Michael Stone in support of the local Fine Gael organisation which funded the campaign. The total payment to the people involved was €1,100, of which approximately €917 pertained to the campaign period. The remainder relates to work done after election day. With regard to the vehicles used, two of them were personal vehicles and a company van was also used. I was not aware during the election campaign of the use of such a van. However, I was aware of an allegation in 2017 that a company vehicle had been used during the campaign. In retrospect, at that point I should have amended my election expenses form to the value of €140 to take account of the commercial value of a vehicle for the hours used. This was a clear mistake on my part and I acknowledge and apologise for that error. As the equivalent commercial value of the van was below the relevant donation limits, it did not need to be included on the donation register. Having been made aware at the end of last year of the payment to the individuals, it is clear to me that the value of the labour should also have been declared in my election expenses form. Therefore, on Sunday, my election expenses statement was amended to reflect the additional spend for the 2016 campaign of €1,057, reflecting the equivalent commercial value of a vehicle and payment for labour. This amended statement was submitted to SIPO at the weekend, both by email and in hard copy. The payment to the individuals who provided the labour and the corresponding value of the use of the company van were a donation to Fine Gael Dublin Central within the legal donation limits. Neither I nor any of my campaign team intentionally misinformed SIPO or knew that a form was incorrectly submitted to it at that time. In light of the information that has now been made available to me, I have taken the steps to address the issue as fully as I can. I also wish to provide as much additional information as I can to the House. Mr. Stone has made no donations to me personally. However, in 2020 and 2021, he made a donation to Fine Gael by the purchase of Superdraw tickets which were sold by me. The donation was to the Fine Gael Party centrally and was within the legal limits. It is not required to be disclosed. However, as stated, I wish to be fully transparent with the House. In 2020, it was five tickets with a donation value of €334 and in 2021, it was 22 tickets with a donation value of €1,382. Mr. Stone is a man of the very highest standards. He has spent much of his life giving back to the community from which he came and which I am obviously so proud to represent. Mr. Stone has done so much for the north-east inner city and I am very sorry he has become involved in this matter of public interest. I accept responsibility for making all supporters, the vast majority of whom are volunteers, aware of their obligations at election time. As Minister with responsibility for public expenditure, national plan development, NDP, delivery and reform, SIPO falls under my remit. To ensure there is full transparency and independence in this matter, any responsibility for ethics legislation and SIPO will be transferred to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael McGrath. I am conscious there is a complaint to that commission which will decide what steps, if any, need to be taken. I will engage and co-operate fully with any process that SIPO undertakes in this matter. To avoid any undue influence in that process following today's questions, I will not be commenting further. I have worked tirelessly in any public office that I have held. I have always been committed to the public interest and the common good. Honesty and integrity matter above all in public life and I am very sorry this has happened. I sincerely regret this situation and the role I played in it. I thank the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Minister, Deputy Ryan, and my Government colleagues for their support.

He tried to cover this up when the allegations were put to him in 2017. Last year, he again tried to cover this up when the media made inquiries with specific detail on all of this with regard to the political donation. The Minister claimed at the time that he reviewed this issue, there was nothing to see here and everything was in order. Now he has concocted a story that does not stack up. The charge is that during the 2016 general election campaign, the Minister received a political donation from his friend, Michael Stone, CEO of Designer Group and then president of the Construction Industry Federation, who was later appointed by Fine Gael to the powerful Land Development Agency, LDA, outside of the normal process. The Minister failed to disclose this donation, which was required of him under law. The donation accepted by the Minister was above the legal limit. In the past five years, the Minister has dodged this issue and concocted stories to make it go away. He said the individuals did the work for him over a number of nights, so the work was carried out outside normal working hours. We now know that is not true.We now know that the work was carried out in broad daylight, in the middle of the working day, by men in hard hats with a company van marked Designer Group. The Minister claims that this was a donation to the party rather than himself. That is laughable. He should know this because he is the Minister who oversees this legislation. The rules are clear. I will quote them to the Minister. They state: "Where expenses are incurred on a candidate's behalf by an individual or body other than a political party ... and the expenses are borne by the individual/body, the expenses may be regarded as a donation to the candidate." It is a donation to Deputy Paschal Donohoe, not to Dublin Central Fine Gael. It is crystal clear and the Minister should stop trying to dodge that issue. The Minister tried to reverse engineer the value of the political donation to make sure it was below the allowable amount. He said the donation was worth €1,100, but the problem for him is that the rules are crystal clear. They state: "Donations in kind ... are to be valued at the usual commercial price charged for the purchase, use or acquisition of the property or goods or the supply of any service donated." It is not about how much Michael Stone paid the individuals to do the work but the commercial value on the open market. How does the Minister's claim of €1,100 square with somebody who was contesting the same election in the same constituency, Senator Mary Fitzpatrick, who had to pay nearly €5,000 to get her posters put up and taken down? Many of the Minister's colleagues, sitting behind him, paid €2,500 to just get posters put up. That is the reality of the amount of the donation that the Minister failed to disclose. It was an unlawful donation that the Minister is still trying to cover up. In an attempt to make the numbers add up, the Minister claimed that these people were only putting up 150 posters over three nights. As we can see from the photographs, they were putting up posters two to a pole. The Minister is good with numbers. That would be 75 poles, which would mean they were putting posters up on two poles per hour. Who is seriously going to believe that? The Minister and I should grab a ladder and a stopwatch to see how many posters we can put up. What the Minister is trying to do is laughable. He is trying to take us for fools with regard to these concocted stories. He refused to come clean in 2016 and again when it was pointed out to him in 2017. When the media went after him about this in November last year, he said there was nothing to see here. It is only now that SIPO has started to inquire about this that the Minister is concocting a story. The Minister should be answering questions but he voted earlier not to answer direct questions. They are serious questions. Who did Michael Stone offer this service to? He is the Minister's friend. The Minister was at his wedding in November. He is a close confidant of the Minister. It is natural for him to offer the Minister this donation. In 2017, who brought it to the Minister's attention that the company van was used in 2016? Who made that allegation? What action did the Minister take? How did he value the use of the van? How many days was the van used for and for how many hours each day? In 2021, when a number of journalists made specific, detailed inquiries of the Minister regarding the issue which is now in the public domain, the Minister said he carried out a review and that all was in order. Who carried out the review? How did the Minister satisfy himself of that? How does that square with the fact that he knew in 2017 that, at the very least, a van was used in this process? How could the Minister say that everything was in order when this was the case? When did he speak with Michael Stone about this? He told the media at a press conference on Sunday that he took a number of weeks to make sure that all of the detail was accurate and that they were out putting up posters on four nights. Unfortunately for the Minister, there are photographs showing them out in the middle of the working day, wearing hard hats and high-visibility clothing, right off the building site with the company van parked nearby. When did the Minister contact Michael Stone to find out how much he paid, how it was acquired and whether they were Designer Group employees? Were they paid in cash? The Minister was Minister for Finance.

#GeraldNash	unknown-#GeraldNash-party	unknown-#GeraldNash-dob	unknown-#GeraldNash-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-18 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	254	The Minister is selling us a narrative that suits his own ends, but what are the facts? Is it not a fact that there has been a breach of both the donation and expenditure rules that everyone in this House is bound by? The Act insists that no expenditure can be incurred at an election except by the agent or his or her nominee. The SIPO guidelines point out that it is an offence for a candidate or anybody else, including, for example, "a local branch of a political party", to incur expenses or make payments in connection with a candidate's campaign if this was not authorised by the agent. Was this unauthorised expenditure incurred during the Minister's 2016 election campaign and, if so, will the Minister notify SIPO of this breach of the Act? This service was provided by six company employees in a company van but it was, in fact, provided by the shareholder, the company owner. The distinction is relevant because the law imposes a lower legal limit on corporate donations than on donations from individuals. This is the net point which goes to the heart of this whole farrago. Let us stop the pretence that this was not a corporate donation. One might think there was an effort going on to retrospectively regularise a highly irregular situation. Third, the Minister said the two separate donations, which were an individual donation of the services of six company employees and a corporate donation of the use of a company van, were not made to him at all but to the Fine Gael constituency party in Dublin Central. This distinction is significant because there are higher limits for permissible donations to parties than donations to candidates. It is again an attempt to present the situation in a particular light. Is there any reality to this? Constituency parties have no role whatsoever in law in incurring expenditure during elections. Candidates incur expenditure and the agents of candidates account for and authorise that expenditure. It would be an offence for the constituency party to incur this expenditure. Is trying to drag the constituency party into the picture not just a red herring? How about the estimate of the cost of the service? We know that the usual price charged for erecting and removing election posters in 2016 was about €5 per poster, with it costing €3 to put one up and €2 to take it down. If 1,000 posters were involved, which would be normal in a campaign, then the commercial value is closer to €5,000. The Minister might go some way to addressing the points about how many posters this organisation put up. The guidelines are explicit that where a price charged for a service is less than the usual commercial price, then the difference between the usual commercial price and the lower price is a political donation. Whether provided by an individual or by a company, the true value of this service seems to be way in excess of the donation limits. If that is so, does it not follow that what was received was a prohibited donation in excess of the donation limits? If so, should the Minister's amended declaration not also state that he received a prohibited donation, the value of which he has so far not returned to the donor? Finally, if this expenditure was revalued at its full commercial price, would the Minister be in breach of the candidate expenditure limit for the 2016 general election? That is an important point. We are being told that an individual, his company and its staff provided a service during the Minister's election campaign which ended up being free of charge to him. The company's owner then decided to pay the staff himself. It was later decided that this payment of wages should be treated as a donation to the Fine Gael constituency party but not as a donation to the Minister, even though it is his face on the posters. The long and the short of it, as far as donations are concerned, is that the Minister ended up as the recipient of a free service, which was a political donation. As far as expenditure is concerned, expenditure was incurred by a third party which was not authorised by the Minister's agent. These are the facts. I am pleased that the Minister has recused himself from having responsibility for the development of long-awaited ethics legislation, which the Labour Party has been campaigning for for eight long years. From his previous time as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, which was when this issue first came to his attention, the Minister will be familiar with Deputy Brendan Howlin's Public Sector Standards Bill 2015. The Bill would have given the Standards in Public Office Commission sufficient teeth and robustness to deal with the situations we are dealing with all the time that impact on trust and confidence in politics in this country. The Governments in which the Minister has served have waited for far too long. We are expecting the publication of draft legislation this year. We need to see that now. The situation in which the Minister finds himself and the transfer of functions to the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, should not be used to further delay the publication of critical legislation to help to restore trust in politics in this country.

First, we have the revelation that Deputy Damien English submitted a planning application which included a barefaced lie. Now we have a Minister for Finance who cannot keep track of his election donations and expenses. I will first remark on this process.Facilitating Opposition Deputies in making statements but declining to answer their questions in real time is designed for just one thing, namely, to give a veneer of accountability. It is nothing more than that. What is the Minister's reluctance to answer legitimate questions from the Opposition in real time? It was notable that when he opted to hold a press conference at short notice on Sunday afternoon, he responded to questions from the media. Perhaps he just felt it a necessary evil, as the optics of giving a statement and running away without answering questions would have been appalling. The optics today are equally bad. There is nothing procedural stopping the Minister from answering questions from the Opposition as we ask them. It seems he just does not want to do so. People can draw their own conclusions from that. There are a number of aspects to this controversy that raise serious concerns. For a start, it is extremely difficult to understand why the Minister did not rectify his returns in 2017 when he says he first became aware that a cost applied to the van that was used. It should be remembered that in 2017, the Minister had responsibility for SIPO, so one would have hoped he was completely familiar with our electoral laws at that time. Having ignored the matter for five years, he also tried to stonewall the Irish Independent in November when it questioned him about the matter. The Minister is an experienced politician and he was an experienced politician back in 2016. It seems extraordinary then that he thought private individuals with no connection to Fine Gael were putting up posters for free. How naive can the Minister have been? He tells us he only recently became aware that the team of six people were actually paid for the work they were doing. He seems to have forgotten that the rules that applied to him were the same rules that applied to everybody else and that donations, whether they were monetary donations in services or otherwise, had to be declared. The Minister seems to have got the deal of the century. The six individuals working in three teams of two were paid a grand total of €1,100 for their efforts over four days. That is approximately €180 each. Is there an invoice or a payslip that can be produced to demonstrate this was the actual amount that was paid or is the Minister relying on Mr. Stone's memory? Of the total cost of €1,100, the Minister further says just €917 was incurred as an election expense as the remainder arose after the election. This appears terribly convenient, given the limit for personal donations is set at €1,000. Of course, the serendipity does not end there. The purported cost of the van was €140, which is also below the €200 limit for a donation from a commercial company. The Electoral Act is clear that the value attributed to services must be equivalent to the commercial rates. The Minister cannot rely on mates' rates for the purpose of his returns. Is he really telling the House that the real commercial cost of employing six people and hiring a van over four days was just €1,240? If that is right, I can only imagine there will be a stampede of Deputies to the Designer Group to request that it put up their posters come the next election.

We see all the signs of reverse engineering of the figures in order to fit within the spending and donations limits. I am sure the Minister will agree with me when I say it is important our electoral laws and spending limits are strictly adhered to. I just hope he shows more respect for and engagement with SIPO if it opens an investigation than he has shown this House.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-18 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	258	Earlier on the Taoiseach told us "I believe [the Minister, Deputy Donohoe] is somebody we can trust, and somebody who I believe. I think, deep down, everyone in this House knows that ...". I looked deep down, a Cheann Comhairle, and I must say I do not know that. I do not trust the Minister. I do not trust the fact the Government has blocked a real question-and-answer session here and I do not believe the story that has been concocted after the fact to try to avoid as many rule breaches as the Minister can. The Taoiseach also told us the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, was happy to answer questions but earlier the Minister said he was not going to make any further comments after this to avoid prejudicing SIPO, so it is a theoretical commitment to answer questions. I will ask some questions and I want answers. Were the workers who were putting up the Minister's election posters being paid by the Designer Group at the time they were putting up the posters? If not, how were they being paid? How can workers working for the Designer Group putting up posters during the day not be a corporate donation from the Designer Group? How can someone paying to get posters of the Minister put up for his election campaign not be a donation to his election campaign? If the Designer Group put up only 150 posters at a snail's pace, how many other posters did the Minister get put up and how did he get them up? Does the Minister accept he is an extraordinarily fortunate man? I wonder if that good luck transfers into other aspects of his life because there are series of very happy coincidences with the values placed on various donations he got here. The value of the van donation was €140, which is an amount below the €200 requirement for corporate donors. The value of the work of putting the posters up was €917 and from an individual, so it also did not trigger the need for a corporate donor to be registered and reported. The fact that both these donations, together amounting to €1,057, were donations to the Fine Gael branch rather than the Minister's personal election campaign is again very fortunate because if they were to his campaign, they would be an illegal donation above the €1,000 limit. As it was to the party and was less than €1,500, it does not even need to be declared. Is the Minister normally that lucky? Will he resign if SIPO finds he breached the rules here or does he think it is credible for him to continue as the Minister with responsibility for SIPO when it has made a finding against him? Anybody who follows what has gone on here can see what happened. This is an "I scratch your back, you scratch my back" situation. A friend who is a private developer and head of the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, helps the Minister out with postering, which is an illegal corporate donation. He gets the chair of the north east inner city initiative, gets appointed to the board of the LDA and continues to get large State contracts. This is a tight golden circle of establishment politicians and big business looking out for one another. The Minister is caught out and questions are asked. He denies it, it is published and he concocts a story after the fact with entirely implausible elements. I do not think this is the only example of that. I know of one case where a People Before Profit councillor was asked by a developer to vote for the rezoning of land and was told if they voted for it, the developer would get all their election posters up for them. Of course, we did not have anything to do with that but I suspect other Deputies in the House have had posters put up as a donation and have not declared it.

This is because it was set up in the middle of the greatest housing crisis in the history of the State and has the wherewithal to make a real difference in that crisis. However, instead or pursuing an aggressive policy of building public houses on public land, it is instead tending to organise a major programme of land privatisation. Who is steering the ship? The LDA has a five-person board. One of the board members is Michael Stone, who was appointed in 2019 by Fine Gael Minister, Eoghan Murphy. Michael Stone is a member of the ruling class. The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, is a representative of the ruling class. This is how ruling class power works - there are a thousand threads between big business and its political representatives. In this case, the big employer picks up the tab for the Minister's posters, the Government, of which Fine Gael is a part, appoints Michael Stone to the LDA, the agency steers a course towards privatisation, the housing crisis continues and working class people suffer. Time will tell whether the Minister will have to resign but that is how the system works and the system is rotten.

We all appreciate that standards in public office are hugely important in order to maintain public trust and public confidence in our democratic system and, indeed, in democracy itself. It has been generally acknowledged that standards have been improving in recent years and it is very important that we keep that trend going, that we do not allow standards to slip and that we do not return to the bad old days from which we are still trying to recover. We believe these standards should be applied consistently and fairly in this House, for both the Opposition and the Government and in the Independent benches as well because the very first person we should all hold to account is ourself. It is on that basis that I and my colleagues in the Regional Group are very keen to strengthen, upgrade and modernise the ethics Act, in particular in relation to SIPO. Any dealings I have had with SIPO have been very professional and very proper. It has consistently been looking for three things, namely, greater powers to audit, greater powers to investigate and powers to actually sanction. The audit function in particular is very important in order that we get ahead of these issues. We would certainly be supportive of any proposals to strengthen SIPO in that regard. I have three questions for the Minister and it would be very helpful to the House if he could enlighten us, if he feels it appropriate. The first relates to the SIPO letter he received on Friday. I am always very conscious of the autonomy and the operational independence of SIPO but it would be useful if the Minister could indicate if SIPO suggested it will make a decision by a particular date on whether to dismiss the complaint or progress it to a preliminary inquiry. If the Minister could divulge that it would be very helpful. Regarding the businessman who is caught up in this inquiry - I do not want to mention his name because there is no allegation of wrongdoing about him at all - could the Minister just confirm again that he was entitled to be remunerated for the two State jobs but waived that entitlement? Is that still the case? Finally, there are questions to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform scheduled for 10.30 a.m. tomorrow. I will be here asking a question myself. Which Minister will be attending?

He said on Sunday, and I heard him myself, that this was all done under darkness. I have photographs supplied to me showing that it was broad daylight, thankfully, with six men well clad in jackets. All they are missing is a "Paschal Donohoe No. 1" label on them. They did not have that in the photographs, so obviously they were hiding something. The Minister must surely have been aware that the Designer Group was working on substantial Government contracts for the Department of Social Protection at the time it was engaged in erecting election posters for him. Did he not question whether the crew that rigged and derigged the posters over several weeks may have been contracted to work on Government contracts at the same time, instead of jogging around putting up and taking down posters? It could quite easily happen. I think there were three vans mentioned. Two men and a van is fine but not six men and a van. First, they would not have the capacity to travel in it and second, they would have needed a van for each two. It stretches credulity that we are expected to believe this cock-and-bull story that they were around there just taking photographs and hanging around. Will the Minister accept that he was a member of the Government that appointed a certain Mr. Stone to the Land Development Agency board and to the north inner city task force? It has been said that the said gentleman does not take a fee for his LDA role, and we appreciate that. Nonetheless, as a property developer sitting on the board of a semi-State agency with an annual budget of €2.5 billion, it is nice to be in the know and to be in the golden circle. This is what I see the problems as being. There are huge issues here. Deputy Donohoe was the Minister in charge of SIPO. He had a chance in November. I have had this information since a week before the Taoiseach changed office. Did the Minister inform the now Taoiseach, then Tánaiste, Deputy Varadkar, of this ongoing issue and the complaint against him to SIPO before he reappointed him as Minister during the revolving chairs swap-over? There are a number of questions like that. From a political judgment it is the least you would expect he would have done and the least, I am sure, he would expect or demand from the Minister. There are so many questions and it is a pity they are not answered. The Minister will not have time to answer them here. I deliberately did not do anything with the information because there was a complaint being investigated by SIPO and that could be made against any of us at any time. It is there to do its job and we must give it all the powers and assistance it needs. It stretches the imagination that the Minister is going to answer questions in the morning regarding SIPO. He has recused himself from dealing with issues while the investigation is going on but it is absolutely farcical in the extreme that he is taking questions in the morning. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael McGrath, is otherwise engaged in Davos, coming and going from that great big party. Deputy Donohoe will miss out on it this year but will hopefully get there next year with his well-heeled friends. This is very serious. It reminds us of the cheques from Ben Dunne - the big fella - to build houses or build whatever. We thought we had moved on from that. We should have moved on from that and we must move on from that. We saw figures from other Deputies in the same constituency and their costs for posters were furnished to SIPO in the complaint. They do not come anywhere near the value for money the Minister got. It must be magic erection and taking down of posters because we all know how much it costs. Some of us have had to do them ourselves and with our family and friends and whatever. We all know you cannot have companies doing them for you, especially if they are not declared, because those are the simple rules of engagement. We all know the Minister had so many posters in that election. Most people struggled because it was a sudden election but the Minister was all ready to go. It is great to have friends in good places. Then he had teams of men out by day. He said on Sunday that it was night-time but my photographs show a nice sunny sky over Dublin Central. That is the first thing the Minister can correct the record on. It was happening during the day. They were obviously being engaged by their employer. If they were not working for their employer, who were they working for? I have nothing against the men. They were doing what they were told as employees but you never know when some of them might start singing. They do not want to be the stool pigeons here. They are people we have to respect too and in their jobs fulfilling their roles and their orders. Often we say to break your boss before you break his orders but this one has a long way to run if the Minister does not answer these questions and answer them honestly.

What this is all about is the Minister's inaction in relation to his SIPO declaration and the issues over the non-disclosure of postering carried out by a supporter using his business staff and vehicles. I note the Irish Independent has reported:The work was carried out over four days/nights over the course of the campaign; three days/nights up to polling day for a total of 10 hours and one day/night after polling day,” Mr Donohoe’s spokesperson explained.[...]His admission came after the Irish Independent obtained photos showing workmen using a Designer Group van putting up posters before lunchtime in early February 2016. Mr Donohoe’s office last night claimed that a review had found that around 150 posters were hung by the men ...That is shocking bad value for the amount of money the Minister spent. The Government is trying to make light of this situation, and the Taoiseach's response today during Leaders' Questions tried to do this as well, saying it was so long ago and so on, and then trying to shut it down by saying it was up to SIPO to investigate and we should not be commenting on the matter at all. The problem is that SIPO does not have the power to deal fully with these matters. The fact that SIPO even has to wait for a complaint to be raised before it can investigate something signals the ridiculousness of the situation. That situation is the problem of the Minister and should be rectified as a matter of urgency so these matters can be dealt with properly. SIPO has raised these issues with the relevant authorities and it seems the Department with responsibility and the political system do not want to deal with it, which in itself is noteworthy. The system is great at pretending it is dealing with a situation but in reality it does nothing. That will be the big outcome from this debate and row in the Dáil today; nothing will change. That is something the Minister, because he is responsible for it in government, will be responsible for. Hopefully, when the time comes, he will be answerable for it as well.
#CatherineConnolly	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-party	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-dob	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-18 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	264	Anybody can make a mistake. I have certainly made mistakes. It is about how one handles those mistakes. If we are looking for perfection in politicians, we are not going to get anyone to put themselves forward. However, how we deal with mistakes when they are made and the consequences of those mistakes are what is important so that trust is restored. I say that conscious of tribunals in the past that have cost the taxpayer an absolute fortune. The most recent estimate for the costs of the Flood and Mahon tribunals was €143 million. The Moriarty tribunal, with the clue of "payments to politicians" in the title, cost almost €70 million. I also say this in the context of SIPO which has begged us repeatedly, year after year, to change the legislation to give it more powers and to make it totally independent. SIPO does not have its own budget and in that sense does not have independence. My comments are in that context and the successive failures of governments to take heed of what we should have learned from the tribunals in respect of payments to politicians and the endemic corruption identified by the Mahon and Flood tribunals. SIPO has been ignored year after year. The Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, announced in December that a report in respect of the review of the ethics legislation was to hand. A press release acknowledged the review was there and ready for publication but its last line included gobbledegook. It stated, "The Review report is being prepared for publication. It is expected to be published shortly." In his speech tonight, the Minister made no reference to the absolute urgency for the review to be published. Why was it not published today? Why was it not published before now? In 2009, SIPO recommended that the Department of Finance should draft new legislation. In 2021, and time precludes but I could pick any year, SIPO stated "for a number of years, the Commission has called for a comprehensive review of the...ethics framework" legislation. It has not happened. When some sort of review was eventually carried out, gobbledegook was used to tell us it is being prepared for publication. It is in that context that I stand up here tonight, not to point a finger: I will leave it to SIPO to carry out an investigation in respect of the complaint that has been made. However, SIPO could not carry out an investigation before that, which in itself tells a story. If we want to restore faith to politics and public discourse, we must be honest and make language mean something. We are not perfect. We all make mistakes but it is about how we deal with those mistakes, what we do about them and more importantly how we resource and empower the independent bodies to keep us in line.

I begin by acknowledging that a wide variety of questions have been put to me. First, in my response, I want to give the best answers I can to many of those questions. Second, I emphasise my apology for what has happened and my awareness of the issues that this conveys regarding integrity in public life and issues that really matter to me. Third, I will also respond to the issues that have been raised regarding my role as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform with regard to SIPO and, fourth, how the work of my Department will continue in the time ahead. Many different and detailed questions have been raised regarding how many posters were put up, at what cost and at what time. I have done my best to provide the information I can for an election that happened nearly seven years ago. I reiterate my apology and acknowledge my recognition of the mistake that I made. What I should have done at election time and in the aftermath of the election when I became aware of payments being made to the individuals who were involved in postering and when I became aware of the use of a commercial van, was reviewed and renewed my electoral submission. That is my responsibility. I should have taken that action. When I became aware of an allegation in 2017 and when I became aware of the questions that came in to me at the end of last year, the mistake I made, for which I take responsibility, was that, due to my understanding at that time that those individuals had not been paid for by my campaign organisation, and my lack of awareness that they had been paid at all, at no point did I feel there was a need to review the submission I had made to SIPO. I got that wrong and I apologise for getting that wrong.

In fact, the pressures that those on the front line are facing today are still as stark as they were in the first week of January. It has to be said that the experience of patients in emergency departments throughout our country, with overcrowding levels that we have not seen previously, was an absolute disgrace. I will be the first to accept that rising cases of flu, Covid-19, respiratory illnesses place pressures on the healthcare system, and they did but we cannot excuse the lack of capacity in our hospitals, we cannot excuse the fact that the winter plan was clearly insufficient and we cannot excuse the fact there was not sufficient leadership coming from the centre either politically or from the HSE leadership to ensure that patients were treated with dignity, that there was humane treatment of patients, as opposed to the inhumane treatment that so many people received, and that we had a health service that could offer the basic levels of care to patients. We all saw the images of trolleys in corridors of hospitals throughout the State. Some of those patients were elderly and some were there for days. They were only the patients waiting to be admitted. Many more waiting for care also waited long periods - in some cases more than 24 hours; in other cases, days on end. Some of them ended up sleeping on the floor in emergency departments. I will focus on all the solutions that need to be implemented urgently by the Government. We know what we need to do in the short term when we have a crisis and a surge such as this. We have to prioritise care in emergency departments, redeploy staff and do all the things we know need to be done. That is crisis management. However, we have known for some time that hospitals simply do not have the capacity they need. Once and for all, we have to make a decision to put the beds that we need into the public system to enable decision makers on the floor of emergency departments to admit patients much quicker. We need more beds. We also need more staff, including consultants, doctors, nurses, healthcare assistants, radiographers and allied healthcare professionals. We need more diagnostic capacity. I have been saying that to the Minister for some time. The lack of diagnostic capacity in public hospitals makes it more difficult for decision makers to speed up the care for people in emergency departments. That in part is the reason people are waiting too long. All that capacity is needed in our hospitals. We also need to expedite the elective-only hospitals and the surgical hubs that were promised to ensure we have a separation of scheduled from unscheduled care. The capacity in acute care, including elective hospitals, and putting capacity into our hospitals, is the first priority. The second priority has to be workforce planning. We have to increase training places substantially and ensure we have sufficient recruitment and retention strategies, and deal with all the contractual issues. We need to hire and train more staff to open the beds to provide the diagnostic capacity and to put the physical infrastructure that we need into the hospitals.  The third priority has to be right care, right place, right time. It sounds great. I have heard the Minister say that time and again. It is the cornerstone of Sláintecare but we have people who should be cared for outside of hospitals but the capacity is not there. What angered people during the month so far and in December was hospitals saying, "Do not come to emergency departments - avail of all the alternative care pathways that are available such as out-of-hours GP care, out-of-hours pharmacy care", only for many people to be left ringing numbers and not getting through. There was not a chance of them being able to avail of any of those services because the capacity was not there. We need more GP capacity, more out-of-hours capacity and more community intervention teams doing all the work that needs to be done.  The fourth priority has to be reform. We need good management and good leadership. It has to be said that what is called organisational grip, which in layman's terms is simply good management, is absent from many of our hospitals. We are not using the resources in the way that we should. We also have to expedite the regional health areas, RHAs, and get that part right where we integrate healthcare and not have the layers of management that we have. We need a single tier of management that can make decisions in regard to primary care, community care and acute care. We are not doing any of that. I believe that Deputy Donnelly has failed as Minister for Health properly to support our health services. I believe he should take responsibility for that and he should apologise to all the patients who were left without the care that they deserved. He should apologise to all those on the front line who have been left high and dry without the tools, the capacity and ability to deliver the safe care they want to deliver.
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-18 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	325	The overcrowding we have witnessed in our hospitals this winter represents an inhumane, unsafe, undignified health service. We need radical action. Unfortunately, few people have confidence that this Government will deliver that because the cause of the unrelenting crisis in our health services is the policy agendas pursued by successive Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Governments. I have seen it happening in real time in my political life in my county of Monaghan. I saw local elected representatives but, more important, local communities warn Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Governments that if they were to remove services from Monaghan hospital, it would lead to increased pressure on Drogheda and Cavan emergency departments. That is what happened. We warned about this. I was actively involved in pursuing Ministers for Health in respect of a GP shortage that we were seeing in County Monaghan as far back as five years ago. Ministers say it is an operational matter. What did the HSE say? It said there was no shortage at all. Now throughout the State we have a recognition that primary care is in disarray. At least two decades of negligence have come home to roost. There are fewer acute inpatient hospital beds in hospitals than 25 years ago. In 2022, there was not a single day when there were fewer than 300 people waiting on trolleys. It is a scandal but the solutions are there. We do not need to learn any more lessons. We need to implement the plan that Deputy Cullinane outlined because overcrowding was declared a national emergency as far back as 2006. It has been allowed under the Minister’s watch and the watch of his predecessors to become the new normal. However, it is not normal. It is a national disgrace and it needs to be addressed. We need to implement the measures that Deputy Cullinane outlined such as adopting the multi-annual plan to increase the number of public beds, including more acute inpatient and sub-acute hospital beds and community step-down beds. We also need to speed up admissions and discharges. Most important, we need to ensure that those thousands of Irish healthcare workers who are scattered to the four corners of the world are brought home and that those currently envisaging such a prospect are enticed to stay here. What we need is for the Department and the Government to use a fraction of the effort they used to ensure that the Secretary General of the Minister’s Department is one of the highest-paid civil servants in the world. They should use a fraction of that manoeuvring to ensure our healthcare workers remain in our health service and are proud to do so, and we can be proud of the work they are doing on behalf of all our patients.
#MauriceQuinlivan	unknown-#MauriceQuinlivan-party	unknown-#MauriceQuinlivan-dob	unknown-#MauriceQuinlivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-18 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	326	I attended an online meeting with the Minister for Health and the Taoiseach together with other public representatives of the mid-west.Obviously, the issue there was University Hospital Limerick, UHL, which is what I will focus my time on, where we are at and how we get out of the mess we are in, which was created by a previous Fianna Fáil Government. I will quote my colleague who was our health spokesperson at the time, Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin, when he spoke in the debate in the Chamber on a motion tabled, believe it or not, by the current Government party, Fine Gael, on 10 February 2009. He said: “No matter how often we try to impress that on the Minister, she remains dogged in her determination to move ahead with her foolhardy plans.” The foolhardy plans he was talking about were closing the emergency departments in Nenagh and Ennis, and St. John's in my constituency. He also quoted a consultant, who said:Limerick Regional Hospital can't meet its own requirements at the moment. The HSE is devising a plan without looking at the situation on the ground. Consultants refer patients who need a bed in Limerick on a daily basis and are regularly told there is no bed for them due to overcrowding and the fact that there can be up to 30 people on trolleys.This was well flagged in 2009. Last year, more than 18,000 people waited on trolleys in UHL. They presented to the emergency department but there was no bed for them, even though they were assessed as being medically in need of a bed. These are people we know – neighbours, friends and close family relatives in some cases - but we see no plan to get ourselves out of that. I appreciate that the Minister attended the meeting and that the Taoiseach was also present. There was confirmation from the Minister and the Taoiseach but I would like the Minister to put on the record of the House the details on the new 96-bed units at UHL. There is one under construction at the moment and there will be two additional ones, so that is three 96-bed units. As the Minister knows, the first will only deliver 48 new beds as it will take 48 out of the equation as well. What is he going to do to fast-track the other two 96-bed units for UHL? We cannot go on the way we are going at the moment, as it is clear it is not safe. It has been fine in the past week but that still means 40 to 60 people a day on trolleys, which is shameful, although it is not too bad for our hospital. Nonetheless, we want to get it down to two or three, or even zero, but not the situation we have, where we started off the year with 95 people a day on trolleys. There has been massive intervention but we cannot sustain interventions like we had in the past week or two. I remind the Minister that the worst months for trolley numbers in Limerick were May and June last year. That is my contribution, which is focused on the two units. I ask the Minister to confirm that those will be speeded up.
#MarkWard	unknown-#MarkWard-party	unknown-#MarkWard-dob	unknown-#MarkWard-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-18 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	327	In the winter plan there was no provision for additional supports in emergency departments for people experiencing mental health difficulties. On average, we have 5,500 adults per year presenting to emergency departments with suicidal thoughts. That is an average of 100 people per week attending our emergency departments. Emergency departments are not an appropriate environment for anyone suffering from mental ill-health but because of the lack of access to 24-7 emergency mental health services, it is sometimes the only option for people. People should have the right to mental health supports when and where they need them. We know that mental health problems do not happen from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on a Monday to Friday and they can happen anytime. We, therefore, need a mental health service that is accessible and operates on a 24-7 basis for people to get the help they need. Let us imagine being a person with suicidal thoughts who arrives at an emergency department that is overwhelmed. Does the Minister think that person who presents to the emergency department following self-harm or suicide-related ideation will receive compassionate, empathetic, validating responses, as outlined in the HSE model of care? The reality is much different. In January, Sinn Féin and I published the results of a survey that asked people to share their experiences of mental health, and I sent the Ministers copies of this report. One of the sections in our survey asked about people's experiences of seeking help for mental health difficulties in emergency departments. Almost 60% of people who took part in our survey attended an emergency department to seek support for mental health difficulties, yet 85% of them felt they did not get the support they needed. We have all heard of the tragedies of people presenting to emergency departments desperate for help and not receiving it. It is high time the Government prioritised mental health.

It was a valuable meeting that served to highlight the damage that failure to invest in hospital capacity, primary and community care and workforce planning has done to our health service. I made the point, and it has been reiterated tonight, that it is frustrating for many people to be told go to their GP. In many cases, people do not have a GP or they cannot get to GP when there is a difficulty. When is the best time to get sick? It is certainly not on a weekend, certainly not at Christmas and certainly not on a long weekend. There are challenges within the system. I made the point that my big worry is that many people who are seriously ill will not go to an accident and emergency department. I also made the point that many years ago, when I had sepsis, I was not going to go to an accident and emergency department. Fortunately, I was persuaded by my wife to go along and I would not be here today only I did that. I appeal to people, despite all the challenges they are facing in accident and emergency departments, that they need to go if they are feeling sick and they should send a loved one there if that is needed. I can understand if they are immunocompromised, elderly or seriously ill that it is the last place they want to go, but it is the right path for them and their families. I am old enough to remember that, when the then Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, was making his 2011 election speech, he said we would end the scandal of patients on trolleys. We are further away from that 12 years later.
#PatBuckley	unknown-#PatBuckley-party	unknown-#PatBuckley-dob	unknown-#PatBuckley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-18 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	329	It has been said here tonight that there are 73 patients on trolleys in CUH, with 13 waiting for beds in the Mercy Hospital. What we are facing at the moment is not surprising but it is unprecedented. I am glad the Minister and the Ministers of State are present. The Government is closing a 22-bed mental health respite centre in Midleton, the Owenacurra centre, in the middle of a health crisis. As I raised with one of the Ministers of State in a Topical Issue debate before Christmas, we have excessive deaths in nursing homes, in particular in CareChoice in Ballynoe, east Cork, with no independent inquiry, so there is nothing moving forward there. Last October, there was a pilot project and a feasibility study on ambulance services bringing patients to Mallow General Hospital instead of CUH, and we have seen no progress on that either. My biggest fear, and the reason the motion was tabled, is that we need to push forward because people are terrified to go to the emergency department. Our front-line workers are probably the best in the world and they are not getting the support they need. The HSE management is top heavy and that has to be addressed. I recall a number of years ago talking to a gentleman who had had a triple heart bypass and he was on a trolley in a hall with no privacy, and that hall was absolutely jammers. That has not changed in seven or eight years. Unfortunately, the Government has normalised an unsafe, undignified and inhumane health service, which is nothing that we should ever be proud of. I appeal to the Government to start to address this immediately. If asses have to be kicked at top level, then kick those asses because patients are dying.

In the time since, the situation has got even worse. I think I saw him again over Christmas saying the exact same thing. Before I go any further, I want to thank the hard-working staff at Naas General Hospital who continue to work in overcrowded conditions that are too frequently appalling. They know better than anyone that the dysfunction in the health service is getting wider and deeper, while the way they are treated as workers goes from bad to worse. We have heard it from the non-consultant hospital doctors who are being driven to distraction by the way they are being treated by their employer, the HSE. When I talk to comrades from the North, no matter how bad the NHS is, they talk about it with respect. The people love it and the workers in it love it, but people who work for the HSE have had enough. I will stand with the workers in the HSE in their fight for better and more humane conditions. Let us face it: there is something incredibly selfish about treating the people we depend on to heal us and our loved ones so carelessly and so badly, with no regard for their well-being. That has to change. If enough people decide they want a change of Government, it will change. Sinn Féin has a multi-annual plan to tackle capacity, be it capacity in beds, diagnostics, surgery, both acute and elective, or medical personnel.We need change urgently in the HSE. Many of our healthcare workers want to stay and build their careers, have their families and live their lives here, which they would do if they were treated better in their conditions so that they could rent a home at a fair price, depend on public transport and have a decent life without breaking the bank. None of that is looking for too much. All of that is achievable if we put people first, value for public money first and public services first rather than a private, for-profit approach. It is achievable if we had a government thinking in terms of the economy and society, and not just the economy alone. Despite the Taoiseach's musings that more beds might be bad for how hospitals work, the people out there, including all medical staff, know that is pure nonsense. It is difficult to hear him say that it is not just a question of getting beds in; that they must be staffed. We know that. He should stop treating the people like fools. We need more capacity to take our growing population into account. We need more hospital beds. We need at least 800, be it in acute hospital or community settings, before next winter. We need more doctors and nurses, and all the allied healthcare professionals to make sure that we make the best use of them to get the best health outcomes for people, patients and staff alike. Above all, we need long-term planning and joined-up thinking, and we need to retain the medical staff we have.

this growth will be seen across all service areas and in key staff categories, such as medical staff, nurses and health and social care professionals;- limited access to diagnostics can result in patients being referred into hospital emergency departments (EDs) and outpatient departments for services; the nationwide general practitioner (GP) Access to Diagnostics programme, which began accepting referrals in January 2021, facilitates direct referral by GPs to diagnostic services for their patients; this structured pathway for GPs to directly access diagnostic tests enables a greater level of care to be delivered in the community, supporting patient-centred care, early diagnosis, and early intervention; and 251,601 scans of various modalities were completed by 25th December, 2022, which far exceeded the 2022 target of 195,000 scans;- the Enhanced Community Care (ECC) programme is a suite of reforms enabling new ways of working, empowering local staff leadership to meet the needs of local communities and a shift in the focus away from acute hospitals; the Government is strongly committed to this goal, and have allocated very significant resources to ensure that this transformation will be delivered, with annual funding of €195 million provisioned to the ECC programme to enable recruitment of 3,500 additional staff, and with service delivery provided through Community Healthcare Networks (CHNs) and Community Intervention Teams (CITs), that commitment will continue into future years; and significant progress is being made, with 91 of the 96 CHNs and 42 of the 60 CITs now established, almost 2,500 staff recruited to the programme, with the balance of recruitment and establishment of the remaining teams targeted for 2023;- the Government has strongly endorsed all 16 of the recommendations presented in the Report of the Strategic Workforce Advisory Group on Home Carers and Nursing Home Health Care Assistants (October 2022) and is committed to their full implementation as a priority; the Advisory Group's recommendations are targeted measures which, when implemented in conjunction with the wider sectoral reforms which are in train, will have a lasting impact on the workforce challenges associated with front-line care-workers; however, given the breadth and complexity of the issues that affect workforce-planning, it is not feasible to provide a precise timeframe for the implementation of each recommendation;- on 16th December, 2022, the Government announced the authorisation of 1,000 employment permits for non-European Union (EU)/European Economic Area home-support workers, as recommended by the Advisory Group, this promises to significantly reduce the shortage of home-support workers in Ireland in the immediate future; and- the Health Service Executive (HSE) procures home support services via a contractual arrangement with providers and it is envisaged a new contract will be finalised by 30th April, 2023, which presents an opportunity for sectoral reform, and the process of finalising the new tender is underway in the HSE and established procurement protocols apply;notes that:- our health service, in common with health systems across the northern hemisphere, is under significant pressure due to a combination of influenza, Covid-19 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV); and in the United Kingdom (UK) the Health Secretary has said that England is suffering its worst flu season in a decade, and in France, President Emmanuel Macron has outlined his new plan to stop 'endless crisis' in the French healthcare system;- our population is both growing and ageing, which is welcome but puts additional pressure on the health service, the population has increased by about a third between 2002 and 2022;- there is a significant increase in presentations to EDs from older patients;- 194,230 people over 75 years of age attended EDs up to the end of 2022, and that represented an increase of 25,505 (15 per cent) on 2019;- of these 194,230 some 101,561 people were admitted, an increase of 9,988 (11 per cent) on 2019; and- significant additional funding was made available to support the HSE's Winter Plan 2022/23, which is supporting delivery of a range of actions to optimise available capacity across community and hospital services by expanding GP access, including within the GP out-of-hours service, facilitating patient flow through the hospital system, and supporting safe and timely discharge to the community upon completion of hospital care;- building on recent investment across 2021 and 2022, the Department will continue to develop critical care, acute and community capacity, and progress a strong pipeline of capital projects with the HSE, including several new hospitals (including finishing construction of the National Children's Hospital, progress the elective programme/elective hospitals, and relocation of the National Maternity Hospital) and significant new facilities for existing hospitals;- the Department is also developing a new Strategic Healthcare Capital Investment Framework, including a standardised/streamlined Capital Appraisal Framework for the healthcare sector, refreshing the Health Services Capacity Review, working out a medium-term capital plan to the end of the decade and building the required sectoral capacity, working with the HSE to deliver health infrastructure under the National Development Plan 2021-2030 process;- the Department of Health is currently engaging closely with all stakeholders in working to mitigate the current immediate medicines shortage issues;- of the products currently in short supply, there are none that do not have a therapeutic alternative that can be used to meet patient needs;- the position, as outlined by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) last week, remains that alternative strength, brands, and formulation are available for all medicines associated with the current winter surge; HPRA, through the medicines shortages framework, is managing the coordinated stakeholder response to these shortages to minimise patient impact;- HPRA continues to engage with suppliers to obtain updates and remains open to expediting regulatory procedures to enable supply of additional stock, where possible;- a subgroup responsible for Antimicrobial Resistance and Infection Control (AMRIC) is meeting with HPRA daily to provide live data to prescribers regarding currently available antibiotics;- while other countries have introduced Serious Shortages Protocols (SSP) to allow for both generic and therapeutic substitution, Irish legislation already provides for generic substitution of therapeutically appropriate alternatives; the Minister for Health has asked his officials to explore options around developing a protocol to allow for therapeutic substitution in certain circumstances;- key considerations may include the legislative amendments that would be required (as they were in the UK) to allow for the use of SSPs under Irish legislation, and the framework and governance of such a system; a SSP does not address over-the-counter medicinal products; and in the UK, as in other jurisdictions, SSPs are time-limited and have strict conditions associated with them; and- there has been an increase of almost 30 per cent in the number of first-year nursing places in Irish Higher Education Institutions over the period 2014-2021 (from 1,570 to 2,032), with an additional increase planned for 2023; andfurther notes that:- the HSE directly engaged with the Private Hospitals Association (PHA) ahead of the Christmas period and asked that any additional capacity available be identified through HSE Acute Operations; and hospitals and hospital groups were also requested to continue to engage locally in this context;- the HSE is continuing to engage with the PHA to maximise additional capacity, particularly for medical patients and time sensitive or urgent procedures; a series of local arrangements are in place and there are currently approximately 180 public patients in private hospital beds;- additional GP supports have been made available to enable GPs to extend existing clinics or run additional clinics during weekday evenings and Saturday mornings; the funding grant arrangement for GP out-of-hours cooperatives has been increased by 7.5 per cent and additional funding is being provided to cooperatives to enable them to roster additional doctors, local GPs and locum doctors in treatment centres from 6pm to 10pm;- these measures allow more patients to be seen by GPs and out-of-hours cooperatives, helping reduce need for ED attendance;- this Government is committed to achieving one of the core goals of Sláintecare by continuing to invest in reforming and re-organising health and social care services, so that they are expanded and focused on delivering care in the community with a 'home first' approach;- a number of teams currently operate in the community to provide care for patients at risk of hospitalisation or to facilitate discharge from hospital, for example, referrals to CITs have consistently performed above their annual targets and since October, referrals to the CITs have increased month on month; significant investment in recent years has facilitated an increase in the number of CITs from five in 2014 to the 21 CITs currently in place, ensuring national coverage for the first time and with at least one team in operation per Community Healthcare Organisation area; and we continue to augment and expand this invaluable service, with Winter Plan funding having been provided to target recruitment of additional staff to the CITs;- the mandate of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) was formally expanded last year by way of Regulation 123 of 2022, which expanded the remit of the EMA to enhance its response to and coordination of shortages of medicines and medical devices at a European level, with a particular focus on driving consistency of approach with respect to mitigation actions; and- the EMA is liaising with antibiotics manufacturers with a view to increasing supply to the EU market; and the HPRA is taking a lead role in this EMA work on behalf of Ireland. I very much welcome the opportunity to talk about the issues raised concerning capacity in the healthcare system, and one element and knock-on effect of that, which is the unacceptable levels of overcrowding we are seeing in some hospitals in the public health service. The context matters. The motion does not reference the context at all. Ireland and Europe are dealing with a perfect storm of Covid, RSV and flu. We are dealing with an unprecedented level of the combination of all three of those. The best resourced and run healthcare systems in Europe are dealing with various versions of what we are dealing with in Ireland. That context is important. This is happening throughout Europe. Deputies will be aware of the situation in the Six Counties, which is very serious indeed, as it is in Britain as well. However, we must focus on our health system and do everything that we can. I have visited emergency departments around the country. I wanted to hear first-hand from patients and their families, and healthcare workers about their experience. I have seen the distress. I have spoken with patients and their families and with healthcare workers about the distress in many of our emergency departments. I acknowledge that what I have seen and what patients have experienced in many hospitals around this country in recent weeks is simply not acceptable in terms of the time waiting to be treated and the time waiting to be admitted to a bed in a hospital, if a decision is made to admit. I have also visited hospitals where patients are being seen quickly. They are being treated quickly and they are being sent home quickly, or if they are admitted into the hospital, they get a bed quickly. In Waterford, Deputy Cullinane's constituency, the hospital has gone more than three years without having a patient on a trolley. We must be cognisant of those hospitals and those parts of the country where things are clearly working very well. The motion tabled by Sinn Féin calls for an urgent expansion in the capacity of our public health service – more beds, clinicians and home care packages. What the motion fails to acknowledge in any way is that we are in the middle of an unprecedented expansion in capacity in the public health service. Over the past three years we have added nearly 1,000 hospital beds, more than 360 community beds and there has been a 25% increase in critical care beds. This is an unprecedented expansion in public beds across the country. We have hired more than 17,000 additional healthcare professionals since 2020. This includes more than 5,000 nurses and midwives, nearly 3,000 additional health and social care professionals, and 1,800 doctors and dentists. In fact, 2020, 2021 and 2022 are three record years of net recruitment into the HSE since its foundation. This year is going to be the fourth in a row. The past four years, including this year, will have had the highest recruitment into the HSE ever. Do I want to go further and faster, and does everybody here want to do the same? Yes, but let us acknowledge that in the middle of Covid, the HSE has hired at a level that has never before been seen. Our emergency departments depend on highly skilled and experienced staff to provide patients with care. We are rapidly expanding resources within emergency departments. I sanctioned 51 extra emergency medicine consultants last year. That is approximately a 40% increase in the total number. We have launched phase 2 of the safe staffing framework, which increases the number of nurses and healthcare assistants in emergency departments. However, as we all know, no additional resource we can put into emergency departments will solve the issue of overcrowding on its own. What we all know is that most of the solutions to the overcrowding in emergency departments lie outside them. That is why we are continuing to invest right across the board so that only those who really need hospital care come to the emergency department and when they do, they get seen quickly. We have added millions of extra hours of home care support. We fully acknowledge that more is needed. The motion calls for a move to the living wage in the new tender. That is happening. We are also recognising travel. We have also added 1,000 work permits. The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, is leading the work on this for the Government. She and I would like to see that go much further. We acknowledge that too many people are waiting for home care packages. The funding is in place, and we are taking action to increase the workforce to be able to help those patients and their families. We are also investing at an unprecedented level in the expansion of primary care, as called for in Sláintecare. Over approximately an 18-month period, we have put more than 90 new primary care teams in place. There are many new specialist teams throughout the country in elderly care chronic disease management. Approximately 2,500 healthcare professionals have been hired into this new enhanced community care programme around the country in every one of our constituencies over the past 18 months. This year we will continue with that. These teams, which are quite new, will further integrate into the healthcare services. They will integrate with GPs and into the nursing home sector, as well as the hospital sector. More and more patients can be treated at home and supported at home; treated in their primary care centres and community so they do not need to come into hospital, or if they do, they can be discharged as quickly as possible. We all know that limited access to diagnostics is one of the reasons people end up in emergency departments. The GP access to diagnostics programme, which was launched in 2021, has been a great success. This year, we have allocated tens of millions of euro. It means that GPs around the country can directly refer their patients for diagnostics. Last year, more than 250,000 scans were funded and took place under that programme, which is new. Sinn Féin is calling for more diagnostics. I accept that more is needed, but what Sinn Féin is not acknowledging is that it is happening. The motion calls for an increase in training places for clinicians; I agree. However, the motion fails to recognise that an increase in training places is happening. More training places are being funded for students and for clinicians pursing advanced practice, such as non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, who are seeking to become consultants. I have stated previously that we need to double the number of college places in healthcare in this country. They are increasing in several areas, but we need to go further. The Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, and myself are working together to that end. I have met several of the medical, healthcare and nursing colleges to see if there is an appetite for a radical expansion in courses for nursing, midwifery, dentistry, pharmacy and health and social care professions. The answer from every university team to which I have spoken is that there is. They want to work together to expand these places. We do not train enough healthcare professionals in this country. In spite of what is an unprecedented expansion of capacity – beds, diagnostics, workforce community care – we are all aware that a perfect storm of Covid, flu and RSV, coupled with a growing and ageing population, means that too many men, women and children are not getting seen quickly enough in emergency departments or getting a bed in a hospital quickly enough when they have been admitted. They are also not getting access quickly enough to other healthcare services they need. What are we doing? We are continuing with the expansion. This year, we are funding an additional 6,000 healthcare professionals across the service. Hundreds more beds are planned for this year. Building on recent developments, my Department is working with the HSE on the roll-out of new elective hospitals, the rebuilding of the national maternity hospital and finishing the national children's hospital.However, as I said previously, the current capital processes in this country, be they in the HSE, the Government, or are tendering and planning processes, when they are considered together, are not working. It takes years and years to put in place capital infrastructure and critical healthcare infrastructure that we need to put in place much quicker. I am working with the Department, the Government and the HSE to see what actions we can take to significantly reduce the amount of time required from when a decision is taken to add beds to those beds being open, staffed and used to treat patients. The current combination of processes, between European laws, tendering laws, planning processes, internal evaluations, re-evaluations, strategic reviews, business case modelling, and external validation of strategic reviews, when put altogether, are taking years and years to put critical infrastructure in place that patients need now. That is something we are looking to change. At the same time, more capacity is not the only answer. There are significant changes to working practices and more community-based care is not the answer in and of itself. We also know there are significantly different outcomes from different hospitals and community groups throughout the country. We must see consistency of good practice. We have to see more hours in hospitals and the community sector whereby senior decision makers are present to treat, admit and discharge patients and help to bring them home. It is what the new consultant contract is all about. Over the past few weekends, we have seen the enormous beneficial impact of having senior decision makers in hospitals and the community at weekends. We need more capacity. We are in the middle of the biggest expansion in capacity in a very long time right across the system. At the same time, we need to implement the Sláintecare vision of community-based and integrated healthcare. That is happening. In addition, we must modernise working practices, patient flow, treatment and discharge, and rostering, right across our service. If we do and continue doing all those things - we are in the middle of doing all those things although a lot more is needed - we will see a well-resourced, well-staffed and well-funded modern healthcare service that gets people throughout this country the care they need when they need it.

However, the fact of the matter is a large portion of his Government has been in power since 2011 and all the current failings have been there since then. I received an email recently from a constituent, Elaine, regarding her six-year-old son who fell ill and had to go to Caredoc in Sligo. Caredoc has its own problems. She waited several hours before her son was seen there. Finally, it was recognised that he needed to go to the emergency department. He was sent there and waited from 6 p.m. until 11.30 p.m. to get an operation to treat a perforated appendix. The one surgeon on call had to hunt up and down through the hospital to get a surgical team together in order to carry out that operation. The family have said how grateful they are for that surgeon and his efforts because that saved the child's life. His mother says in her email that this begs the question as to what would have happened if they had been unable to gather a team or if the one surgeon on call was already in surgery with another patient.

It is the same in any hospital throughout the country. The situation is dire in so many of our hospitals around the country. I accept that the Minister can come to the Chamber and tell us about all the great work that is happening. He is in the middle of everything but nothing seems to be concluded. Certainly, in the experience of the people dealing with the health service, they do not see the results. That is the problem we have got. We really need to sort this situation out. I will return to the matter of Caredoc, which is the out-of-hours service in the north west that deals with counties Donegal and Leitrim. We have a serious situation with NoWDOC where, at present, it is worked between Caredoc and the HSE. It is now proposed that Caredoc will take over NoWDOC entirely and the HSE will withdraw from it. This is a process I see all over the country. It seems to be the case that the HSE wants to do no work itself but wants to privatise it all. It wants to bring private companies in to run everything. I received an email from a staff member there, which states she is very concerned about the selling out to the private contractor Caredoc, where the only reasons for taking over this service will be to make profit. There is no doubt in her mind that corners will be cut, that there will be no nurse presence in Carrick-on-Shannon and eventually, once established and under the radar, they will stop doing home visits and move the service centre out of Carrick-on-Shannon to Sligo. This is the real fear an awful lot of the staff working in this service have. They see this happening under their very noses. When we write to or contact the HSE, we are told there is nothing really to talk about here, and these are private negotiations it is having with a private provider, which has nothing to do with the public. It certainly has an awful lot to do with the public when they cannot get a service and when the service is being withdrawn from them.
#PaDaly	unknown-#PaDaly-party	unknown-#PaDaly-dob	unknown-#PaDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-18 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	335	Most of the staff in University Hospital Kerry are too busy dealing with a hospital that was built in 1984 to serve 120,000 people, when County Kerry now has a population of 160,000, to be out campaigning. There were glad when a review of the hospital was promised. A team visited the hospital and staff there were told a transformation team was needed. A review and interviews were carried out but in the past ten days or so, staff were told that that review has been shelved. Staff are back to square one. I will give two examples. Oncology services in Kerry hospital include cancer patients and some of the most vulnerable people. Those with black humour are calling the oncology unit the homeless unit because, in the middle of the Covid pandemic, that unit was sent to palliative care. There was then a plan. Somebody thought it would be a great idea to spend €2 million to place the oncology unit in a private hospital, while that private hospital would invest a fraction of that amount. Thankfully, that idea was shelved but it is worrying that it was seriously considered. After palliative care, the unit is now being moved to the day ward. Oncology patients are on the day ward so surgeries for day patients have been cancelled and not one surgery has been carried out this year. Some 20 operations have been cancelled. The unit will probably be closed. If the last surgery is anything to go by, the day unit will probably be closed for months. The stakes in healthcare services have never been higher. There have been decades of neglect in respect of staffing and infrastructure. We accept that cannot be fixed overnight but one person told me that hospital staff in Kerry are under nearly as much pressure as they were during Covid and there is no sign of improvements. The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, recently reported that 20 patients were on trolleys in University Hospital Kerry. Last December, 36 patients had been waiting more than six months for inpatient procedures and 476 outpatients were waiting for the same time period. For a county the size of Kerry, these are extraordinary numbers. With an ageing and rural population, in a county with high peripherality and three peninsulas, the solutions for Kerry are obvious. Beds mean staff who must be trained. Retention and training need to be prioritised. That includes other areas. There are ways to ease the pressure. There must be more public involvement in community hospital step-down facilities and 70 or so beds.
#ImeldaMunster	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-party	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-dob	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-18 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	336	In 2006, hospital overcrowding was declared a national crisis. Declarations were made by the then Fianna Fáil-led Government. Each Fianna Fáil- and Fine Gael-led Government since then swore that this would be resolved. Despite that declaration, and all the statements on resolving hospital overcrowding from Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael health Ministers, and Fianna Fáil-led Governments, 17 years on we are looking at what could be considered a bad, repetitive joke, if it was not so serious. It is like Groundhog Day. It is winter. There is overcrowding in our hospitals. The Government continuously ignores warnings and pleas from front-line health professionals who are worked to the bone, stressed to the hilt and whose morale is on the floor. In December alone, nearly 12,000 patients were admitted to hospital without a bed. We have had 17 years of Fianna Fáil- and Fine Gael-led Governments. At the start of December, 11 ambulances were parked outside my local hospital, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda. The patients could not be taken out of the ambulances. They had to sit inside them as the ambulances could not go anywhere because there were no beds or trolleys. It is 2023 in a First World country. It is nothing short of outrageous. That overcrowding will get much worse if the Government continues to ignore the health professionals in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, and moves all the acute emergency cases from Our Lady's Hospital in Navan to Drogheda. Again, it is as if the Government is not listening. I genuinely believe, and I am not being political, that the Minister is afraid to take on the HSE.He is afraid to take it to task. Other Members here tonight have thanked the front-line staff. I will thank the front-line staff in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital and right across the State for the Trojan work they do in spite of their desperate working conditions and the fact that the delivery of every single type of public health service and support is crumbling under the Minister's watch. There is a shortage of GPs, there are no dentists for medical card patients and hospital appointment waiting lists are out of control. There is also a shortage of home care supports, a lack of funding for housing adaptations for elderly people who are being discharged and a dire lack of mental health service provision and supports. There are no beds and no trolleys. The list goes on and on after 17 years of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. Sinn Féin will deliver the public health service that the people need and deserve.
#JohnnyMythen	unknown-#JohnnyMythen-party	unknown-#JohnnyMythen-dob	unknown-#JohnnyMythen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-18 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	337	Our healthcare service is broken and not fit for purpose. It has been broken for a long time. The provision of a fully functioning healthcare service that can look after people and its staff should be a duty of care and priority for any Government worth its salt. The Government has utterly failed in this measure. The Minister referred to the years 2021 and 2022. The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, only reported five days on which there were fewer than 350 patients on trolleys in 2022 and no days when there were fewer than 300. It is the ordinary people, those who cannot afford private healthcare, their families and friends and our healthcare staff who are suffering, with damning consequences. The situation is no different in my county, Wexford, despite the personal sacrifices, double shifts and sheer determination of the healthcare staff there. We have seen recent reports of ambulances queueing for hours, with patients being treated in the back of their vehicles causing further delays, sometimes with devastating results, including even death, as ambulances are held up for hours. As I speak, the INMO is reporting 14 people on trolleys in Wexford General Hospital. Do we ever stop to think that our nurses should never have to conduct a trolley watch in the first place? This should not exist in a system that is well run. The announcement of a new 96-bed unit for Wexford General Hospital made for great press releases for local Government representatives but where is it? Will the HSE be able to recruit the staff needed to operate it? The serious recruitment and retention crisis in healthcare casts a significant shadow of doubt yet I see no proactive strategic plan to really tackle this head on. We cannot treat people's broken limbs with broken promises. The real question is whether the public has confidence in the ability of this Government to fix these issues. Taking into account the evidence of statistics over the last decade, we see that the answer is "No". Sinn Féin has credible alternative policies, which have been brought through by Deputy Cullinane, our spokesperson on health, to solve the crisis in healthcare, and which we have constantly outlined. Our people cannot wait one more day. Change is needed now.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	18305	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-18 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	338	I welcome the motion, which we support. I also acknowledge the bona fides of the Ministers opposite in trying to fix a perennial problem. I read the Minister's speech carefully but feel that there is much more that can be done to increase capacity. The Minister refers to the investment in diagnostics and primary care in particular. It is all well and good to state that the HSE has added 90 additional primary care teams in the country but there is still an issue in that people in the constituency I represent cannot get to the GP in the first instance. The diagnostic piece does not, therefore, arise. I am told by my constituents in the town of Mitchelstown, where we have an excellent primary care centre, that they are waiting up to two or three weeks - four weeks in one instance - to see or interact with a GP in a primary care centre. I am not here to criticise GPs. They are absolutely snowed under. We know that. However, with all due respect to the Minister, until such time as people can get access to the GP in the first instance, the issue of diagnostics is moot. I need to know how we are going to fix that. That is the problem that I need to see fixed. We know what the latent effect of people not getting access to basic GP services in the first instance is. It just heaps up a pile of problems for the long term. If there is no access to diagnostics, it just shores up a pile of problems down the line. I need answers to the questions I have in respect of Mitchelstown. The situation is similar in Mallow. It is not just Mitchelstown and Mallow, but every town in the country. Why is it that people now have to wait so long to get access to the GP? I do not blame GPs. We are very quick to blame. We need to blame somebody for problems. However, where is the solution to those problems?  As a local Deputy, I, for one, have done a lot of work with some of the GP practices in my area to try to assist them with visas for GPs coming in from third countries or from outside the European Union. We have had some measure of success there. Many people are now emigrating and taking up job opportunities elsewhere. If the Government and the HSE were to take a proactive approach to recruiting from across the globe - there is precedent for this and it is being done day in and day out - we could bring in GPs from other countries, which would help alleviate the problems in places like Mitchelstown and Mallow. That is one possible solution. With regard to out-of-hours services, throughout the Christmas period, we all received calls from people who could not get access to services such as that in my area, SouthDoc. SouthDoc is an excellent service. Once you get in the door and are seen, it is the best service in the world but there is the question of getting that initial access. I know of some very acute cases that arose over the Christmas period in particular. I do not have a degree in medicine and am not qualified to diagnose but, if I am contacted by an anxious parent who is seeking access to the service for a three-year-old, who has been waiting six, seven, eight, nine or ten hours for a call back from the out-of-hours service and who does not want to go to the emergency department because they are petrified of going to Cork University Hospital, CUH, we have a serious structural problem. Is that also about the supply of GPs? Can we get more GPs? The Minister will say that SouthDoc, Westdoc or the service in whatever part of the country one might be from operates on a co-operative basis but the HSE and the taxpayer are also big funders of these services. We have skin in the game and, as such, I am sure that we have influence at a ministerial level over how these services operate. All I want for my constituents is access to a GP when they need it because, once someone gets in the door of a primary care centre and gets access to a GP, a lot of triage can be done, reducing the need for people to present to the accident and emergency department in CUH. Do not get me started on CUH. I was there with somebody recently and saw the ambulances backed up and the lack of beds. That is again a structural problem but it did not just arise because of RSV or Covid because the trolley numbers are now up in the months of June and July as well. There is evidence for that. It is a year-round thing. When you look at the faces of healthcare professionals, which the Minister has seen, including nurses, doctors, attendants and people working on the floors, you see that they are all stressed out to the hilt. That is not sustainable. I genuinely worry for the health of our healthcare professionals at the moment. I genuinely worry that many of them are now saying they have had enough, they cannot take any more and they are out. It is hard to blame them. We need to try to alleviate the pressure. There is another way of alleviating the pressure. Level 2 hospitals are an untapped resource. Take Mallow General Hospital for example. The Minister spoke to issues around capital expenditure and turning bricks and mortar into wards. We have a 42-bed unit in Mallow General Hospital that is all but built.The hospital is operating excellently. It provides a great deal of elective care for people. It is excellent in diagnostics. Many people could be triaged on an out-of-hours basis and directed into hospitals like Mallow General Hospital. I ask the Minister to fast-track the 42-bed unit. We would get it up and running for the Minister. We would take people out of Cork University Hospital, CUH, and move them into Mallow General Hospital, as well as places like Ennis and Nenagh hospitals and other hospitals. The excellent staff on the ground will do what the Minister has spoken about in terms of delivering the healthcare we need. That would alleviate the pressure on CUH and this can be done now. The bricks and mortar are there. I invite the Minister to visit Mallow to take a look at it for himself. It is an excellent hospital. The writing was on the wall for the accident and emergency department a long time ago. We did a lot of work in respect of building out endoscopy suites, medical assessment units, a local injuries unit, an urgent care centre, etc. We now have a 42-bed unit and if the Minister will give us the money to put beds into it, we will do the business for him. That is what we want to do in Mallow. This would take a great deal of pressure, from a regional perspective, off tertiary care centres like CUH. It will not only serve the people of Mallow but also those in Tipperary, Limerick, Waterford and the whole catchment area. If we look at Mallow on the map, we will see it is right in the heart of Munster. This is what we are talking about in terms of solutions. The Minister has the capability, wherewithal and means to do this because he is the Minister. If he could take a look at Mallow General Hospital specifically, we could do a job of work there. We also need to talk about ambulance care. We are all deeply worried about people who work in the ambulance services. They are stressed out as well. They are being asked to do double shifts and take on extra work. I fear for their health and safety. In the not-too-distant past, we had a case where somebody going home from doing a shift crashed because they were just absolutely wrecked tired, to use my local parlance and to speak in the vernacular. We just cannot have that. People need to have adequate rest between shifts. We cannot have a situation where we are trying to squeeze more and more hours of healthcare professionals because at some stage it becomes dangerous for them and the people they are treating. I ask the Minister to take a look at this aspect. In the few seconds I have left, I will speak about pharmacies, which are yet another untapped resource. Community pharmacies have tremendous capacity to deliver, if they could be built out to deliver more at the community level. If I am not mistaken, the Minister may be doing some work in this area already. I ask him to fast-track that. Pharmacists are excellent. They provide excellent advice to people in their communities daily and they could do much more if they were given the training and resources. Increased capacity will require resources. I think the Minister is saying there is a budget of €23 billion. What we are seeking for the few small things I have mentioned would not be big money at all. The Minister could do it.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-18 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	339	To pick up on the last point made by Deputy Sherlock, there is an excellent example of what a community pharmacy can do in Cloyne. I am very familiar with it. That is a model that should be replicated all over. I very much welcome this motion. It is timely given the horrendous few weeks we have come through. At this point, after the last two or three weeks, some of the measures taken have kicked in and they have been relatively successful insofar as the indefensible figure of 930 people being on trolleys has been reduced to a somewhat more manageable but still unacceptable figure of more than 500. Actions were taken that were effective. I completely agree with the Minister in respect of people coming in over the weekends and ensuring there was patient flow and all that kind of thing, which is so important. This is obviously what we should be aiming for. Doing it with a reduced staff capacity and a reduced number of beds, however, is not sustainable in any kind of long-term way. The additional hours people worked on top of their normal week, the extra overtime and all of that was very effective and showed us what can be done if we have sufficient staff. Fair dues to the people who did that but, as I said, this cannot continue because people are already wrecked after the last two years. A big effort was put in and we did get rewards from it. We must stop staggering from crisis to crisis. The Minister knows the definition of madness is when we keep doing the same thing and expect to get different results. This seems to be what has been happening winter after winter, except that the crisis that used to exist during winter now rears its head several times during the year. There is, therefore, much to be done. Many good suggestions have been made in this debate and lots of people have ideas. The key point is the implementation of these ideas because we cannot again find ourselves in a situation like the one we were in over Christmas. The Minister must accept that is utterly unacceptable. It must also be accepted that it was, in large part, entirely predictable. Last September, for example, Fergal Hickey told the Minister that we were facing Armageddon. He predicted that winter was going to be disastrous, yet plans did not seem to be put in place to cater for that. We knew that Covid-19 was going to spike again and also that the flu was going to be a major factor. What is to happen? I accept what the Minister said. There have been additional beds, but they are not enough. There have also been some additional staff, though not enough. I will return to the point on staff in a moment. The most urgent issue that needs to be dealt with is the manner in which we run the health service and the manner in which the HSE operates. It is very easy for people to criticise the HSE and a predecessor of the Minister had plans to abolish it. All that kind of talk is nonsense. The HSE is our health service. What we must do is reform it. There are major problems with the way it functions. It is quite a dysfunctional organisation. It is highly centralised. It is a command-and-control organisation and hierarchical. When something goes wrong, whether in south Kerry, north-west Donegal or wherever, the CEO comes on the airwaves apologising and promising us a report. We cannot function like that. It disempowers managers down the line and means that managers become administrators. We pay a lot of managers and we should expect them to manage. This means placing responsibility on them and them then being responsible for spending budgets. It means ensuring those budgets are properly spent, we get value for money and services are managed so that they are adequate. We must stop talking about it being great that we are throwing money at the health services. I heard a Minister of State use this phrase last week on television. She said we are throwing money at the health service. We are spending a huge amount of money but we should not be "throwing" money at it. We need to be directing money to where it is most needed. Most of all, we need to reform the way the system operates. The plan is there for the reform of the HSE, as the Minister well knows. It is the regional health authorities, RHAs. The Sláintecare plan came up with that as the key element six years ago. The Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, was involved in that cross-party proposal and yet progress on that specific aspect has been exceptionally slow. We are looking at this element in considerable detail on an ongoing basis in the Joint Committee on Health. In October last, the chair of the advisory group to the RHAs, Leo Kearns, appeared before the committee. He stressed the importance of devolved authority to allow each RHA to exercise effective decision-making. The guiding principle that should underpin this restructuring is that of subsidiary.Authority for decision-making is devolved, responsibility is devolved, people are empowered to manage the service, and that must be underpinned with legal accountability. That is how we get the best out of people. Responsibility lies with senior people in the region. We know what has happened and the memorandum that was brought to Cabinet last year on that. I am not sure where that originated but all of the evidence would suggest that, at a senior level within the Department of Health and in the HSE, there was serious institutional resistance to the breaking-up or restructuring of the HSE. We know that two very senior and effective people, Ms Laura Magahy and Professor Tom Keane, walked away, unfortunately, because they said the Government is not serious about this. Given the fact there are undoubtedly obstacles and there is institutional resistance at the top of both of those organisations, I repeat, and I have said this a number of times, that it was a mistake to put the heads of those two organisations in charge of implementing something which might discommode them, which they may be uncomfortable with and which they may not necessarily want to see happening. We are in this situation. The Minister has to listen carefully to Mr. Leo Kearns, who does not pull his punches. He is involved with an experienced group of people in the advisory body.

In the view of the committee, that is sound advice. People were very taken, when Mr. Kearns came in, and said this is such a breath of fresh air and makes sense and asked why we are not doing this quickly. That is where things have to go, and quickly. On the memorandum that went to Cabinet on this, the decision of Cabinet was flawed. The three options in that memorandum were, basically, do nothing, do a little bit, or do the job properly. Unfortunately, the Cabinet opted for do a little bit, and that will not cut it. If the Minister is to do this, he must do it properly. The Minister would have the entire backing of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health if he goes back to Cabinet and states we need to strengthen this because it will not work unless it has legislative underpinning, specifically in accountability. The other key issue is to implement all the recommendations of the Minister of State, Deputy Butler's expert group. It is such low-hanging fruit to tackle the delayed discharges and yet there have been incredible delays in tackling that issue. We talk about extra beds etc. We need extra beds but there are 600 beds that are inappropriately used. When will we see the recommendations of the Minister of State's report implemented in full? A key part of that is to implement the recommendation on the living wage. That is how we get more people to sign up to be carers. According to a number of people who have examined this area in detail from an academic point of view, it also would help greatly to attract more male carers to come into the system. We cannot delay any longer. We need to see all of those recommendations put in place within the next few months. It is not sustainable to continue with 600 in delayed discharges. While a number of those have been moved, they would fill up again quickly.

It is important to say the health crisis we have, the trolley crisis we have annually, is not a natural disaster. It is not a natural function of winter. It is a policy-made disaster that we get regularly. Those polices are a commitment to a two-tier fragmented health service with a chronic lack of capacity and staffing in emergency departments, acute and elective hospital services, ICU, public health teams, primary care and GP services, mental health and disability services, step-down nursing home places, home care and more. It is a commitment to continuing a for-profit part of our health service, and the for-profit part of our health service only exists if there are problems with the not-for-profit parts of our health service. Finally, this year, on top of those annual problems, we have an extra problem in terms of policy to do with Covid where the Government did not take seriously enough the continuing threat of Covid, on top of which are the flu and the respiratory syncytial virus, RSV. There is nowhere near enough of an effort in terms of promoting the use of masks. We should be listening to the likes of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, and the unions representing bus drivers. There is still no action in terms of ventilation and filtration in our public buildings. Earlier I saw a picture from Davos where a number of world leaders were having a conversation. They had HEPA filters in front of them because they work and have an impact. The lack of action in this regard in this country has added to the crisis. It is policy driven. It does not have to be this way. In the conversations that happen around the regular health crisis, there is often an attempt to obfuscate and to present the whole thing as more complex than it really is and beyond anyone's understanding, as if we keep giving money to this thing and it still does not seem to work in order to make people think there is nothing that can possibly be done about it. Of course, there are complex parts to it and structural issues, but at the basis of the health crisis we have that particularly expresses itself every winter is a basic issue around capacity in terms of beds and staff to go with those beds. Where, in the early 1980s, Ireland had 17,500 hospital beds in our health system, today bed capacity is just over 11,000. It is the same as it was in 2009, when the population was half a million people lower than it is today. That is at the core of the crisis. That is the most important fact that explains why we have the crisis we have. In comparing the number of hospital beds per 1,000 of population in this country, at 2.9, to the EU average of 5.3, we are at little more than half the EU average. An extra 5,000 hospital beds are urgently needed in the public health system to address this core capacity problem. The other side of this is the enormous profits that are made in private healthcare in this country. Vast amounts of public money are being drained off into the private sector, which also benefits from significant tax subsidies. Three weeks ago, Mr. Larry Goodman's Blackrock Clinic reported a doubling of profits, to €14.5 million, on revenues of just under €160 million. This profiting from our health crisis must stop. We should stop having a public health service that is underfunded and under-resourced and allows the private health system to operate, and the private hospitals should be absorbed into the public system to contribute to the extra capacity we need. We need to take these into the public health system. We need to build an all-island national health service. I want to say a couple of sentences on the possibility of industrial action by the INMO representing nurses and midwives. They, together with the patients in the hospitals, are really on the front line of the crisis that is of the Government's making. Every year, they are the ones who come out with the trolley watch figures. They are the ones who put this on the political agenda and put real pressure on the Government. Every year, we get the commitments saying action will be taken and this will stop, yet it happens year after year and it is now worse than ever. Nurses and midwives have been left with no choice but to take action.We can see from Britain that strike action by nurses has put serious pressure on a hard-nosed Tory Government to negotiate. Industrial action by nurses and midwives here would be enormously popular. I was on a television programme where people were asked to text in, and more than 80% of people said they would support strike action by nurses and midwives. This would have the impact of galvanising public support for a mass campaign to force the Government to invest properly in our health service in order to protect patients' lives and the working conditions of all those who are in it.
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-18 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	347	The INMO is consulting its membership on the issue of industrial action in support of staffing levels that would be underpinned by legislation. Should the nurses decide to take action they will deserve the support of every health service worker, patient and relative who has had a loved one in a hospital and everyone who either looked on in horror or shook their head in sadness at the shocking overcrowding in our emergency departments over the new year. I have no faith in the Government to solve this crisis. I have no faith in the HSE to solve it. Only workers' action and other forms of pressure from below will achieve the changes we need to see, namely, more beds, more staff, better pay and a real properly funded national health service. There were 170 patients in the emergency department of University Hospital Limerick on 2 January when a major incident alert in the context of overcrowding and patient safety was triggered. The cap on the number of patients in the emergency department, as agreed by the hospital with the local fire department, is 78. There were more than double that number in the emergency department on the day in question. How many other emergency departments are in breach of fire safety regulations as a result of the failure of successive conservative Governments here to resolve emergency department overcrowding? There was a fire in the emergency department at Cork University Hospital a week ago. Thankfully, it was put out relatively rapidly by a quick-thinking paramedic. How long will it take before a fire tragedy might take place in an emergency department somewhere in the State? This is an issue that needs to be taken very seriously. We should take the events at University Hospital Limerick and Cork University Hospital as a very serious warning signal on this issue.
#PeadarToibin	unknown-#PeadarToibin-party	unknown-#PeadarToibin-dob	unknown-#PeadarToibin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-18 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	348	On Saturday, there will be a national day of action against accident and emergency department overcrowding throughout the country. For the first time in the history of the State, hospital campaigns throughout the country will work together and will show up in numbers outside hospitals throughout the State. A total of 15 hospital campaigns will be involved in the national day of action against hospital overcrowding. An incredible feat is being undertaken. There are leaflets and posters, and mobilisation is happening throughout the country. At 1 p.m. on Saturday citizens will gather outside Our Lady's Hospital in Navan, Cork University Hospital, Kerry University Hospital, Galway University Hospital, Mayo General Hospital, Sligo University Hospital, Letterkenny University Hospital, Causeway Hospital in Coleraine, Daisy Hill Hospital in Newry, Monaghan General Hospital, Cavan General Hospital, Regional Hospital Mullingar, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda, Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown, Naas General Hospital and Wexford General Hospital. The protesters in the mid-west representing Ennis, Nenagh and Limerick will gather at 11 a.m. outside City Hall on Merchant's Quay. In some areas, thousands of people will protest, in other areas hundreds will gather and in other areas dozens will stand. They will stand united on one main point, which is that some day every one of us will depend on a functioning hospital service being there when we need it. The truth is that this is not the case. It is increasingly not the case throughout the country. The old, the infirm and the sick have been most exposed by the current Government and those that preceded it regarding the lack of treatment. It is a form of cruelty that three of the most vulnerable cohorts in our society can be left so exposed every year in the context of the hospital overcrowding crisis. I thank the hospital campaigns for the work they have put into mobilisation. I urge people throughout the country to come out in numbers to their local hospital. I also urge political parties and Independent Members in the Chamber to make sure that they attend the rallies throughout the country and that they mobilise their members to do so. In many places unions, football clubs and civic society groups are mobilising people to get out on Saturday. It is incredible. I want to focus on a number of issues. Last year, 120,000 people spent time on trolleys. In many cases, the old and sick were left for an average of 24 hours waiting to see a doctor in an emergency department. Overcrowding in 2021 caused 105,000 adverse incidents. In each of the incidents an individual citizen of this country was damaged by the HSE. This is what constitutes an adverse incident. In a number of cases, people were disabled or died as a result of these accidents or mistreatments. In the five years up to this year, according to the reply I received to a parliamentary question, the State spent €2 billion on compensating people who have been damaged by our health service. This is incredible. Imagine if that €2 billion was focused on the front-line services in hospitals. Imagine the pain and suffering that would have been alleviated in terms of the families who went through these difficulties in hospitals. It is incredible that such a level of damage is being done. In the main, this damage is happening because staff throughout the country are under tremendous pressure. They are under so much pressure that they cannot do their jobs in as proper a manner as they would wish. One of the Minister's predecessors, Deputy Harris, wrote a report that showed there was a direct correlation between understaffing in hospitals and mortality and morbidity. This is what we have in the State. All of this has not happened by accident. That is the God's honest truth. Over Christmas, I listened to Government Deputies and Ministers going on radio and television to say this level of overcrowding is happening because of RSV, Covid and flu. Are we really saying the hospital overcrowding crisis is happening because people are getting sick? Are we really saying that if the pesky citizens were not getting sick, the hospitals would be fine? Surely we should be designing a hospital service that has the capacity to deal with the illness that exists in society. This is incredible. There are a number of reasons the health service is in such bad shape. In reality, it was designed to accommodate approximately 3.5 million people. There are 5.5 million people living in the State. The reason emergency departments are so badly overcrowded is because they have been significantly underfunded. The years of massive underfunding happened just after the banking crash. That underfunding has left our system significantly corroded. We have 6,000 fewer beds than we did in 2008. Even the HSE has admitted that we have 200 fewer ICU beds. We have 30% too few GPs. We are missing 700 consultants. In 15 years, Governments have closed eight emergency departments. It would be great if the Minister and the Minister of State were not having a chat with each other. We do not get much opportunity to converse and a little bit of listening would be great. The fact that successive Governments have closed eight emergency departments in 15 years is one of the most frustrating aspects of this process.I cannot fathom why the HSE cannot draw the dots between an accident and emergency capacity crisis and eight accident and emergency departments just after having being closed. It is surely so obvious. The most frustrating thing is the HSE is still wedded to the objective of closing accident and emergency departments. Even in the middle of accident and emergency capacity crisis, the HSE is actively looking to close the accident and emergency department in Navan. There is a serious dysfunction at the top of the HSE and the Minister knows this better than anybody else. He has had enormous battles with HSE senior management during his tenure. The Department fights with senior HSE staff on a regular basis. By way of a small example of this dysfunction, the HSE forced through an ambulance bypass of Navan accident and emergency department before Christmas. The Minister did his best to fight against it but the HSE managed to get it through. What happens now is that ambulances pick up patients in Meath and bring them to Drogheda, where they are triaged. As Drogheda is not able to deal with them, they are brought back to Navan by ambulance and if no ambulance is available, they are brought back in a taxi accompanied by a medical staff member to make sure they are okay, who then has to get a taxi back to Drogheda. It is absolutely amazing that anybody could have the creativity to design so dysfunctional a system. There has to be reform of HSE senior management in terms of where we are going in this regard. There has to be some level of cohesion between the Department of Health and the HSE if we are ever going to fix this issue. There are many issues, including a lack of funding for GP care. People cannot get to a doctor for a couple of weeks. Many people cannot get onto a GP list and therefore have no choice but to go to an accident and emergency department. Today, there are approximately 500 people who have been clinically discharged from hospital, which means the doctors have done everything they can for them and they should not be in a hospital bed. They should be at home with a home care package, in a nursing home or on another pathway to another hospital, the national rehabilitation centre or another area of the health service that can help them, but that service is not there. I found out through a response to a parliamentary question that dozens of people are clinically discharged in our hospitals for over six months and that the longest a person was in a hospital while being clinically discharged was two years. Imagine being in a hospital bed for two years knowing the hospital could not help you in any way and that the hospital wanted to move you to another location. How would it feel to be trapped and imprisoned in that situation? It is an incredible thing. There has to be radical transformation. Money has to go to the front line. If the Minister can do anything, he should consider activity-related funding, whereby hospitals only get paid by the number of operations they carry out, the number of treatments, the number of consultations etc. Then we would not see the money getting snarled up in layers of middle management in the HSE.

When we had the matrons running the hospitals, they were impeccably clean and sterile environments and they ran them from the front door to the back door, and consultants listened to them. Now we have ward managers, floor managers, bed managers, linen managers, hygiene managers, food managers, and discharge managers. We have managers for everything and nobody managing anything. It is absolute chaos. What happened after Christmas will happen next Christmas, as sure as the three Ministers are sitting over there. It is just incompetence. Hospital services have been closed down. The vast majority of consultants have disappeared. There is a skeleton staff on the front line who worked, might and mayhem, I want to support them but they are not getting the support. We saw one of the most senior people resign in disgust and despair two or three days ago. I heard him say on Friday that he could do nothing with it. He came with a wonderful CV but he was not wanted because he did not get the co-operation. It is shocking situation. I refer to a long-standing centre, the Circle of Friends cancer support centre, in Tipperary town. It had a new building built and has received fabulous support from the community. It has fabulous volunteers with limited staff. They need to be on a permanent funding basis to deal with people suffering from cancer and needing palliative care. The centre has put in a funding application and hopefully it will be successful. They need to be funded. There are more Ministers in the Chamber. I do not know how many there are. Are there four or five?

We have an ambulance crisis and a mental health crisis, and no one is responsible. The responsibility of the continued crisis is Cork University Hospital, CUH, lies with the Minister of Health, the previous Ministers and the HSE. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have continuously downgraded services at Bantry General Hospital and got away with it. They closed the overnight accident and emergency department in Bantry a few years ago. No matter how many people tried to explain the consequences, the Government did not give a damn. Now we find the injury unit in Bantry hospital having to close in the past two weeks if staff are sick. This is insane, meaning people from Ardgroom, Castletownbere, Ballydehob, Schull, going east to Kinsale, Clonakilty and Bandon having to go to CUH, which is overcrowded, for simple procedures. Is the Minister aware, as I am, that ambulances are being ordered to take patients to CUH, bypassing the state-of-the-art Bantry General Hospital for treatment of a small breakage in their bones? In some cases, people are going 130 km to an overcrowded CUH and in many cases - the Minister is not listening because the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, is talking to him - people wait hours in an ambulance due to the overcrowding when they could have been dealt with locally at home, within two hours. Why can the Government not get this right? The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, might listen to this part because it is for her. When she visits west Cork herself, she might explain the decision by the HSE to withdraw its appeal against the Mental Health Commission decision to close beds in Bantry General Hospital mental health unit last week. This will have enormous consequences for the people of west Cork and beyond. I accuse Fianna Fáil of being asleep at the wheel on this issue, so much so that its own Deputy in west Cork welcomed the news, if the newspaper that carried the article is to be believed. It is astonishing, to say the least, that this decision would be welcomed by Fianna Fáil. It paves the way for bed closures in the much-needed Bantry mental health unit, going from 18 beds to 15. To think the Minister of State, Deputy Butler and the then Taoiseach, Deputy Micheál Martin, were at the hospital promising more services last year. This is due to a lack of investment by this and previous Governments. This is at a time when mental illness is at an all-time high. When this was first announced last September, I pleaded with the Tánaiste and the Minister of State to intervene. I now plead with her again, and the Taoiseach this time, to intervene that there would not be a loss of beds in Bantry mental health unit.

When we talk about health in Kerry, we know people suffer immensely when trying to get into University Hospital Kerry. There are waiting times and people are waiting on trolleys. Ambulances are arriving and the staff cannot take in the patients from the ambulance. That is not acceptable. The ambulances are held up, the patients are held up and the whole thing is a disaster. We have to go back 12 or 14 years when there were wards closed in Tralee hospital, which have never been reopened. We have to start there. Health is a priority in Kerry and it needs to be treated as such. Never before have so many people died in Kerry than in the past six weeks. We do not know what it is. People of all ages have died, including our lovely, talented Saoirse Buckley, who was 16 years of age, and her neighbour, 97-year-old Nellie Lovett. Today, I learned that Hannah O'Shea, who was 107 years old, has died. So many people of different ages, and those in between, have died. I was glad to give a 98-year-old lady the opportunity to go up to the North on Wednesday morning at a quarter to four. She is 98 years old and she walked up into the bus, determined as anyone of 50 years of age.She walked up without a stick, a crutch or anyone assisting her but she had to travel for eight or nine hours up to the North of Ireland to get her sight back. I am proud to have been part of arranging that service with Deputy Collins back in 2017. We have taken 110 buses up so far. However, it is very hard on those people of great ages to travel that distance-----

The first day I came here, I asked for the help. Two and a half years ago, I brought to the attention of the Dáil - it is on the Dáil record - the structure of UHL. The meeting last week showed that the sitting CEO has been in charge of the UHL group for ten years, during which time it has recorded the highest number of people on trolleys and the number gets higher year on year. It is putting the patients and health professionals at risk with regard to fire safety alone. I spent 24 hours in there after a car accident in February when I saw first hand where there were sheets blocking off doors in order that one would not see people on trolleys. I asked for the Minister's help. Now we can see the CEO is not capable of managing this hospital. There are ten years-----

Whether it is in Waterford or south, east, mid-, north or west Kerry, getting access to the local GP is the problem. Trying to make it attractive for GPs to live in our communities as they did before and provide a local service is the biggest problem we have. We should give that service in the communities on a 24-hour basis. I appreciate very much the work that SouthDoc does. I appreciate the drivers. I appreciate Dr. Gary Stack in Killarney and the other people who organise it and have always been to the forefront of keeping SouthDoc going in County Kerry. I thank every person who provides the service. However, we still need more doctors. We have had excellent doctors. The Minister is talking about naming people negatively. I wish to name people positively. I will name my own great doctor, Dr. Boland, who represented Kilgarvan and Kenmare for decades and gave Trojan service 24 hours per day, seven days a week. It is the same thing with the two doctors O'Driscoll in Kenmare. They are great people who gave a great service. Unfortunately, it is not attractive anymore, from a business point of view, for a person to come along, operate out of a facility, have insurance and provide that service locally. We have to do more to make it attractive. If we can do that, we may be able to keep people away from hospitals and keep accident and emergency departments free for what they are supposed to be free for, that is, accidents and emergencies.  There is a tremendous problem in Kerry University Hospital at present when a person goes there. It is not acceptable. I have said before that if a cow goes down tonight and that cow needs a vet, it would be absolutely outrageous to think the vet would not be there in one, two hours or three hours. It would be outrageous. The cruelty-to-animal people would be down on top of you and everybody would say you were a scandal to have a cow in pain, have something wrong with her or have her needing an operation. However, no notice in the world is taken where a person is in an accident and emergency department for 24 hours or two or three days.

Our health service is at breaking point and it is clear that total collapse is not far away. The overcrowding crisis is catastrophic and will continue to get worse if drastic measures are not taken as soon as possible. Yesterday, Letterkenny University Hospital in my constituency was the second-worst affected hospital in the country with 54 patients waiting on trolleys. I cannot imagine how stressful the situation is for those 54 people and their families. It is not only totally inhumane to have so many left waiting for a bed, it is also extremely dangerous. It is estimated that hundreds of people die in Ireland each year due to the overcrowding situation. This Government and previous Governments should be ashamed of themselves. The severe shortage of beds in our hospitals is not a new problem. It has been raised in this Chamber every winter for decades. Unsurprisingly, the politicians behind the crisis have not changed either and that says it all. We had the Taoiseach as Minister for Health from 2014 to 2016 and the Tánaiste as Minister for Health from 2000 to 2004. Not only have things not improved in more than 20 years, they have gotten worse. The Tánaiste will remember the capacity review conducted in 2002 after which the Government committed to providing for an additional 3,000 acute hospital beds. Despite this commitment to provide more beds, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Governments have not only not followed through on this, they have allowed the number to drop continuously over the past two decades, with a significant dip after 2008. The Government always says the Opposition has never proposed solutions. In the past year, I have proposed that the Minister look to employ Cuban doctors to alleviate the crisis within the health service which is feasible and doable and which other European countries do all the time. Portugal, Italy and Sweden have done it all. I have written to the Minister, but have not got a reply. He has not even responded and acknowledged having received the letter with regard to this. It is there, if the Minister asks for it. Those doctors can help to alleviate the problems we have in the short term, while we are trying to implement the other measures with regard to graduating further doctors. That could be done but, obviously, the Minister is not interested.

However, having been elected in 2016, I really wish I was here with a motion from the Government and an update on Sláintecare and the primary care strategy in order that we could all participate. We have been through this song and dance, have we not, at every single election? Public health, housing and transport, dealing with climate change and our wanting to pay taxes is the message. Thus, we came together and a cross-party report was produced, Sláintecare, showing the way forward. I know the Minister is doing his best. I have seen it on the ground and I pay tribute to some of the changes that have come in.However, we are left going from crisis to crisis. I had cause to be in the emergency department last week for somebody close to me. I was lucky that day in that there were nine people on trolleys. One week later, in Galway, there were 46 people on trolleys. Staff are working full-time. The problem is complete under-resourcing for donkey's years, a commitment to private medicine, diversion of our public money into private medicine, and a National Treatment Purchase Fund that is looking at waiting lists that have been deliberately built up. I spent ten years of my life on a health forum and saw all the excuses. The Minister is inheriting a system but is also part of a system that has refused to say public health needs to be like public housing. Many things are needed, including more doctors and nurses, and proper conditions. I am in a city where the nursing home in Carraroe has not put back daycare. I know both of the female Ministers of State present are deeply committed to this. There is no day centre in Carraroe and no staff for one. Clifden District Hospital closed over Christmas and there was nowhere to take the pressure off it. I could name the places that have been affected. A fantastic day centre has been moved in Loughrea. We know from Councillor Donohue, the independent councillor, that it has been moved into a hotel. The daftest decisions have been made. Where is the roll-out of primary care? In Connemara, a woman in her 90s had to go into Galway for blood tests because blood tests were not done in Connemara on a Friday. The ECG machine had broken down, so somebody else had to go in for that. In my own case, somebody close to me avoided the emergency department like the plague to their cost. That patient should have been in the emergency department on Wednesday but we avoided it until Friday. We are making decisions that are detrimental to our health. We are not rushing up to the emergency department. We need the Government to provide a progress report every month on the roll-out of Sláintecare.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-18 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	385	I found it astounding and outrageous that when outlining his top priorities as Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar did not even mention the health crisis in this country as one of his priorities. The implementation of Sláintecare was supposed to be directed from the Taoiseach's office but it has not been. That office should have responsibility to drive it. There has to be political will to deal with its implementation. This clearly shows the attitude of this Government that these problems cannot be solved, so we just move from crisis to crisis. The political will has to be there. This is all while we have a record number of people in our emergency departments, with close to 1,000 people on trolleys, chairs and, in some cases, on floors. The fundamental cause of this crisis is the reduction of beds in our health service over the past three decades. In 1981, we had 19,000 hospital beds. In 2022, we had 12,000 hospital beds. This is in a period where our population has grown by 1 million and got older. Experts suggest that the lack of timely access to healthcare in the country could be responsible for more than 300 unneeded deaths every year. This is simply not acceptable. Almost one person a day dies because of a public health service that does not function and does not give people access to the care to which they are supposed to be entitled, despite the Trojan work hospital staff do every day of the week. If the Government does not act now, it means it is continuing to accept the situation. The Irish Medical Organisation has called for a further 5,000 beds to help to fix this problem fundamentally. The cost of that is roughly the same as the €5 billion budget surplus the Government has, so funding should not be an issue in providing those 5,000 beds over the next period along with the necessary staffing. We need to end the crisis in recruitment and retention and to provide better training and opportunities. We should be thinking outside the box by delivering a programme to train doctors, nurses, therapists and so on. The State should pay for that training and get those workers to commit to staying in the country for at least eight years as a way of resolving the retention crisis. We need to end the terrible working conditions for staff. Burnout is at an all-time high and this Government is sleepwalking into a conflict with the nurses' union. It would help if young people working in the health service could afford to live in this country. We cannot see a repeat of the climbdown. This Government should proceed with the reforms of consultants' contracts. Anybody would be willing to accept a job with nearly €250,000 in wages. It is ridiculous.

It is not to tell us he has spent it but to ensure good outcomes from that spending. How does the Minister's amendment read to those very sick people who spent their time in corridors, on trolleys, in side rooms and in outside wards over recent months? This affected 120,000 people last year. The Minister is really saying to them that the Government spent more of their money than ever last year but they are still on a hospital trolley. I looked at Sligo University Hospital. A total of 783 people were on trolleys in the month of November, but the Minister is telling those people he has provided certain things, which he has, but that the problem is that too many of them are getting sick and that if fewer people got sick, we would not have this crisis. The job of Government is to plan and implement that plan in a timely way to deal with the reality of the situation. The Government has reacted too late. The winter plan did not deliver. The Government did not mobilise all of the private beds in time to deal with the crisis. We have a chronic shortage of beds but I do not need to tell the Minister how that has come about and whose responsibility it is. We see smaller nursing homes closing while many people are ready to leave wards, but they cannot because there is no long-term care facility available. For the past two and a half years, the Minister has watched nurses and doctors emigrate. In the past week, a consultant who has come back from Australia told me that there are more Irish emergency department consultants in Western Australia and Perth than in all of Ireland. Those are some of the reasons we have the appalling trolley crisis. Some of these issues are within the Minister's control and some have been badly managed.

I believe in the delivery of fundamental public health services to the highest standard. The Sinn Féin motion was all about taking political aim. It is very personalised. It failed to take into account any of the significant investment in our health services and the policy measures already in train to increase capacity in our health service. Today, there are 137,220 whole-time equivalents working in public healthcare. As we stand here tonight, they are working. They will work tonight, tomorrow and the day after. There are 137,220. I sincerely thank every one of them. Since 2020, 17,403 more people have entered the public health service, including 5,169 nurses and midwives, 2,870 health and social care professionals, and 1,800 doctors and dentists. Those are facts, not fiction. Recently, our population was hit by three viruses, which were influenza, Covid-19 and RSV, at the same time. I accept and acknowledge how difficult it was for patients, staff and families. None of us here wants to see any person on a trolley. None of us wants to see an older person on the trolley. It could be any of our families. We have worked tirelessly to try to resolve this. The Minister, Deputy Donnelly, has been working with the HSE since early summer to put in place plans for winter. The winter plan is supporting delivery of a range of actions to optimise available capacity across community and hospital services by expanding GP access, including within the GP out-of-hours service, facilitating patient flow through the hospital system, and supporting safe and timely discharge. We have allocated up to €169 million to make this happen this year. When demand in our health services spiked, the Minister instructed the HSE to provide for additional out-of-hours cover, including from senior decision-makers. Diagnostic teams, radiology teams and laboratories worked expanded hours too, as did allied health professionals such as physiotherapists, since their roles are fundamental to ensure the full scope of discharge requirements is available. The HSE directly engaged with private hospitals ahead of Christmas and asked for any additional capacity that was available.Additional GP supports have been made available to enable GPs to extend existing clinics. The measures allow more patients to see more GPs. I echo the thanks expressed by the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, to all the front-line workers. We are truly grateful to them, and we are doing our best to add to their numbers. There are plenty of examples of good practice across our health system. In my constituency of Waterford, University Hospital Waterford has succeeded in staying trolley-free for over two and a half years. This is an incredible achievement and it must be acknowledged.

#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-18 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	389	University Hospital Waterford continues to perform better than the national average for patient experience times in the emergency department, ambulance turnaround times and maintaining a zero-trolley status for admitted patients, and all with a view to supporting a positive patient experience with 452 beds. This has been achieved through close co-operation between University Hospital Waterford, UPMC Whitfield Hospital and three private nursing homes to bring on stream additional capacity of more than 45 beds in the catchment area. This was not just done in the past few weeks; it was done over the past two years and it has made a significant difference. It means patients who no longer need consultant-level care in acute level 4 hospitals can be transitioned safely and securely for local nursing care while they continue their care pathway. A dedicated focus on patient egress through University Hospital Waterford - led by Grace Rothwell, the manager of the hospital, with the co-operation and support of all the staff - has resulted in it not having to rely on trolleys. The Government recognises a strong healthcare system goes far beyond our hospital doors and we know many older people would much prefer to stay at home. We have the community intervention teams. We have all 22 integrated care programme for older people teams in place. We have home and community nursing units. Without these teams and vital community healthcare networks such as St. Brigid's in Carrick-on-Suir, many patients would have to be seen in hospital. The teams on the ground support people living with long-term illness, pain management and diabetes. In addition, without these teams, many patients fit for discharge would have to remain in hospital. Timely access to home support is critical to supporting older people and people with disabilities to live and age well in their communities. The most up-to-date figures show that 56,500 people were in receipt of home care today. There are 3,240 new applicants with funding approved waiting for a carer and 2,819 people are already receiving some supports but not the maximum hours advised. Home support is important in helping many older people leave hospital safely. We recognise the workforce challenges affecting access to home supports and I have strongly endorsed all 16 of the recommendations of the strategic workforce advisory group. We are committed to the full implementation as a priority. On 16 December last, in conjunction with the former Minister of State, Deputy English, I announced the authorisation of 1,000 employment permits for non-EU or EEA home support workers, as recommended by the advisory group. I am very hopeful this will significantly reduce the shortage of home support workers in Ireland in the immediate future. A similar measure was successfully provided in nursing homes and the HSE community nursing units, with over 2,500 permits issued up to last year. Rolling recruitment campaigns across the HSE also continue to encourage people to see home care as a viable career opportunity. The payment of the living wage and mileage, which were also dealt with in the report, will be in the new HSE tender at the end of March. I wish to speak about the enormous ongoing efforts to support the safe discharge of patients from the acute hospitals into the community as soon as possible. The HSE national service plan includes several initiatives to support this and transitional care funding is available to ensure patients can move into a nursing home temporarily while their applications for fair deal funding are being processed. This funding is available all year round, with €16 million being specifically allocated through the winter plan. As a continuation of the winter plan initiatives, the HSE is working to ensure the full utilisation of 654 contracted private nursing home beds that have been brought on stream through the community beds initiative. The initiative has been in place since 2011, when €125 million was first allocated to develop short-stay residential and rehabilitation capacity. These beds are contracted nationally and enable patients to be discharged from our acute hospitals into nursing homes while awaiting transfer either home or into long-term residential care. Under these initiatives, patients transfer into community beds regularly. Last year, 10,000 patients were able to access temporary care funding. In the first week of this month alone 267 patients transferred from acute hospitals to long-term care in residential homes. This is double the number for the same week in January last year. There was also nearly 1,000 approvals for transition into nursing homes through the month of December 2022. It is recognised that capacity for transitional care will vary across the country. I continue to encourage engagement between nursing home providers and the HSE at a local level to agree suitable measures to meet the needs. Such agreements are already in place and have been effective in reducing delayed transfers of care. The HSE estimates that there are 221 patients awaiting transfer to long-term residential care. I have written to the HSE to ask it to encourage all community healthcare organisations to maximise their use of existing transitional care funding as needed. I have also advised it of my support for extra initiatives regarding home support to free up acute capacity. I was recently contacted by concerned older people and their families. They expressed the fear that if they attend an acute hospital, they may have difficulty in returning home and that long-term residential support may be a choice offered. I emphasise the importance of at all times hearing, respecting and ensuring that the voice and choice of older people remains central to decisions regarding their care. Many of the supports and capacity I have outlined refer to short-term supports until a person is suitably well to return to their own home. I take this opportunity to thank all the staff of the health service for their work to engage in providing surge capacity in respect of home support. Every part of the healthcare system, including primary care, social care and community care, is seeing additional investment to build for Ireland's future. When these are put together, they can be used to achieve the reform we all want.

Even the most unbiased eye can see our health service is in turmoil. Unfortunately, this is not a new problem. Successive Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Governments made decisions that caused the crisis we are in or failed to make the decisions necessary to avert it. There are three former Ministers for Health at the Cabinet table with the current Minister. They must all bear responsibility for this mess. We in Sinn Féin have detailed plans to address the crisis in our health service. In government, we will increase spending on healthcare by €3.3 billion to move from a failing two-tier health system to universal healthcare. More importantly, we will ensure the health budget is spent wisely by talking to front-line workers and patients. Their experiences must be taken into account. We need a major review of how recruitment and retention are managed. In government, Sinn Féin will recruit 6,600 additional front-line health workers, including nurses, midwives and consultants. We will review all vacancies and put in place a plan to do whatever is necessary to fill them. Despite the impact on patient care, there is no urgency on the part of the HSE to fill vacancies. To date, there has been no proper multi-annual capital plan for reaching the necessary capacity at all hospitals and that is not good enough. It is 17 years since the actor Brendan Gleeson called out the disaster zone that is the health service on "The Late Late Show". It is 16 years since Fine Gael asked the people to sign the contract for a better Ireland. It is 12 years since Enda Kenny promised to end the scandal of waiting lists and patients on trolleys. It is a few weeks since a national newspaper reported the experience of a patient who witnessed the death of another patient on a trolley in a hallway in one of our hospitals. The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, spoke about the elderly. I am my party's spokesperson on the elderly, and I can tell her that I have been inundated with messages from people whose family members were lying on trolleys in Naas Hospital over Christmas. I am not accepting that not everybody is on a trolley. Front-line workers are doing their best in appalling circumstances. This is what it has come to. The lack of dignity is an absolute disgrace. The Minister and the Ministers of State should be ashamed of themselves.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-18 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	391	Everyone knows someone who is waiting on an operation, is in therapy or is unable to get a much-needed appointment. We all know our health service is not working. It is plagued by overcrowding, which is putting patients at risk and condemns our healthcare staff to working conditions that they simply should not have to put up with. The crisis has been brewing for some time and has gotten so bad that patients and their families have almost come to accept that it is normal. It is not acceptable and it is not normal. The people of my constituency in Donegal cannot trust Fine Gael with our health service. On Monday, 66 people were waiting for a bed at Letterkenny University Hospital, which was the highest number in the State. Last year, more than 7,000 patients went without a bed at Letterkenny University Hospital. It was the worst year for overcrowding on record and more than a tenfold increase since Fine Gael took office. The people of Donegal deserve so much better but the decisions of successive Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Governments have caused this crisis and made it worse. Two weeks ago, the chief executive of the Saolta Hospital Group, which includes Letterkenny University Hospital, said it had not received a single additional bed in the past three years. These failures are repeated throughout the State. There are fewer hospital beds now than there were 20 years ago, despite population growth and the economic growth that this Government so often brags about but is so clearly squandered. The failure of this Government cannot be allowed to breed cynicism in our health service so it is condemned to failure. The situation can improve because there are solutions there. We need to make greater use of all public and private healthcare infrastructure to alleviate the pressures. We need to increase the number of public beds and speed up admissions and discharges. We need to ramp up the number of training places to ensure we recruit and retain the required number of healthcare staff. A long-term workforce development plan is needed urgently. This can be done but the truth is that successive Governments have failed our health service for far too long. Sinn Féin has a plan, put forward by our health spokesperson, Deputy Cullinane, that would address the crisis in our hospitals, would put patients first and would show that we can turn the tide on the disastrous policies of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. I call on this Dáil to support the motion put forward by Deputy Cullinane.
#DavidCullinane	unknown-#DavidCullinane-party	unknown-#DavidCullinane-dob	unknown-#DavidCullinane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-18 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	392	The speeches this evening from both the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, and the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, were breathtaking. In response to an emergency in our hospitals, the Minister's biggest complaint was that Sinn Féin did not give him a pat on the back for the good work he believes he has done. That was his chief complaint, repeated time and again in his script. The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, was concerned that we were too robust in our criticism of Ministers past and present. In fact, we were not robust enough because successive Governments are directly responsible for failing to properly equip our health service. What was absent from both of their contributions - I asked for it but it did not come - was any responsibility whatsoever for what has happened. There was no responsibility for patients on trolleys in record numbers, no responsibility for people lying on floors in emergency departments, no responsibility for older people over 75 waiting days on end in hospitals for care and not getting it, no responsibility for the fact that people could not access out-of-hours GP care. They took no responsibility for the fact that front-line healthcare staff are telling me every day of the week, and I am sure they are telling the Ministers as well, that they are broken. They are working huge amounts of overtime. In fact, the situation in our hospitals would be a lot worse today if not for the escalation emergency measures that were taken and people being asked to do more work on the front line, doing overtime that is actually dangerous. There has been no acknowledgment from the Minister or Minister of State. Not only was there no responsibility, there was no apology from the Minister for Health. At least the head of the HSE had the gumption to apologise for what happened. This Minister was concerned that we in Sinn Féin did not give him a pat on the back, never mind giving an apology. Let me remind the Minister again of what I said earlier. Yes, there are things he has done that I recognise as important. Things have been delivered that will make a difference. I welcome any additional resource in healthcare. I have said to him for a long time what needs to be done to fix problems in our emergency departments. All the commitments that were given to end the trolley crisis and deal with waiting lists were promises and commitments the Minister made. I am holding him to account for promises he and successive Governments have made. They are the ones that said they were going to fix the problem but year on year, month on month and day on day, the situation gets worse. There are four things we need to do. First is to start with the hospitals. We know we need more beds, more staff, more consultants, doctors, nurses and so on. We need more diagnostic capacity. More GP access to diagnostics is welcome but we need more capacity in the hospitals to ensure we can speed up patient flow in hospitals The lack of capacity is slowing things down. We need elective-only hospitals delivered as quickly as possible to separate scheduled and unscheduled care as much as we can. We need to double capacity in the National Ambulance Service and we need to make greater use of level 2 hospitals and of private hospitals for the public good. We need to do all of that and more.  The second thing we need to do is once and for all take workforce planning seriously. The Minister said in his opening statement that we need to double training capacity. He keeps saying it but he is not doing it. We are nowhere near it. In fact, the Secretary General of the Department, when he was before the Joint Committee on Health, acknowledged that what needs to be done in terms of workforce planning is not being done. The Minister should stop telling us what needs to be done as if he is some objective commentator. He is the Minister for Health. He should put in place the measures to substantially increase training capacity and a proper workforce plan once and for all. If we do not have the workforce plan we cannot train, we cannot recruit and we cannot retain the healthcare professionals we need to open the beds, provide the diagnostic equipment and provide all the care in the community. We need the right care in the right place at the right time. The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, talked about all the community intervention supports and supports for older people. Lots of those teams are not properly staffed. We do not have enough GPs. We are not making use of community pharmacies. There is a huge amount we need to do in terms of community care. I do not have time to go through it all. That is the third priority. The fourth is reform. The Minister said this himself and it is one of the things I agree with. We need better management. That is a fact. In some hospitals there should be better management. I do not agree with what was said by some Deputies in the Chamber around singling out any individual managers but I believe we need best practice across all hospitals. The responsibility for driving that change and making sure managers and hospitals are actually given the resources to do the job lies with the Minister. After everything that happened, after everything all of those on the front line have gone through and all the suffering of patients, there is no responsibility, no apology, no leadership and no vision from the Minister and his Government colleagues. That is shameful.

I am a bit concerned about this because it is a question of emergency medical cards. These occur in situations where a particular life-threatening or life-changing illness has affected a family and the concerns of the family are and continue to be such that they feel they are entitled to an emergency medical card. In the case of a terminal or life-threatening illness, the families in question have enough worries and problems on their agenda without worrying as well about the possibility of running out of money.Some might say there are enough provisions to ensure that cannot happen, but that is not so. Years ago, I dealt with a situation where a pivotal officer in the health services was eventually in a situation where the resources had run out. Along with the threat of an illness so serious that it could lead to the termination of a life, the family concerned was also going to face the problem of the loss of the family home. Those are not isolated cases. This is the second time I have brought the same cases to the attention of the Minister of State. I know she is a very hard worker and that she genuinely and sincerely hopes that the system works as it is supposed to work. However, it is not working as it is supposed to work. The reason I know it is not working is that a person intoned to me that they had reviewed the situation and decided that the person concerned is not entitled to an emergency medical card. On what basis was that decision made? It was made on a financial basis. The decision was made on financial grounds. The whole purpose of emergency medical cards is to get around those considerations to help the people concerned. Those people were receiving emergency treatment six months ago. They expect some little help. I know this matter is safe in the Minister of State's hands. However, some other body is using something to slow the whole thing down and to make it impossible to qualify. There are financial qualification limits when the urgency of the medical situation should be and is sufficient to warrant favourable consideration. I was told in both the cases I have referred to that the situation was being reviewed but a new application would have to be made. I need to ask about that part of the matter. If the existing application is insufficient and income guidelines are the barrier to the grant of the medical card in the first instance, how will that change by making a new application? It is a theory that does not work. This is not a criticism of the Minister or the Ministers of State. It is simply a question of challenging the concept that exists within the system whereby somebody has the neck, gall and effrontery to say to a public representative that they have reviewed the application and the applicant does not qualify. The people I am speaking of are seriously challenged by their health issues. They have enough other issues to deal with, including increases in the cost of living and the ordinary, run-of-the-mill situations of a household. On top of that, someone has arbitrarily made a decision above their heads that they cannot be helped.

I will stick to the script I have been given but perhaps the Deputy and I can have a conversation thereafter. The most striking piece of what I have read out to the Deputy related to the grant of emergency medical cards for six months with the exception of cases of terminal illnesses. Where a person has a life-altering condition or diagnosis, there is a period of time when filling out forms is not their priority. They are instead ensuring they are in the right space to receive the right care that gives them the time to adjust and understand the life-altering news they have received and its impact on their family. It is not only the individual who is affected. The wider family is also impacted. The HSE and the Department should be looking at that temporary emergency card. We do not want to create a hierarchy of conditions or anything like that. We are talking about life-altering conditions where people are undergoing treatment or need to recover or rehabilitate for six months, at which stage the process would be reviewed.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-18 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	397	The Minister of State has a clear understanding, as I have, of the regulations as they apply. They should be applied in a humane manner to take account of situations that may arise out of the ordinary run-of-the-mill circumstances. The HSE has to take account of a situation that may affect a family who are traumatised enough by virtue of the challenges facing them. If a person is seriously ill, the last thing he or she wants to be told is that this is the end. Who wants to tell somebody that, for God's sake? The therapy to be engaged at that stage is the kind of therapy the Minister of State has talked about and that we all know about from years of dealing with the situation. I know the way the system is supposed to work. The Minister of State is absolutely right. I will leave the matter in her capable hands and we will talk about it at a later stage. The Minister of State knows what the story is. There is a problem in that particular section and I do not know what it is. I spent three days last summer trying to track down an individual responsible for a payment that was absolutely necessary and vital. I could not understand how it could take three days. It was not because I did not know where the various lines of communication were because I did. It took all of those three days, and that was in the summer when the days were long. It would be beneficial to the good name of the HSE, and bearing in mind the goodwill it has shown in many other cases, to look at these cases in the particular way to which the Minister of State has just referred.

The cases the Deputy has talked about are very emotive. We know that means could be a barrier but all we are looking for is temporary consideration for six months while the person concerned can adjust to the news of the diagnosis. We are not saying what the term or condition would be. Where a GP submits the MC1 form from the surgery in circumstances where the consultant has written to the GP, I take umbrage with a clerical official saying that a person does not warrant support.The HSE needs to look at that. In fact, when it comes with medical advice for support that temporary period should not be based on a person receiving a terminal diagnosis. It is in its response that it looks at emergency cases. Emergency cases mean people with a life-altering condition or a diagnosis that has a life-altering effect on them.

As he did such an amazing job as Minister of State with responsibility for sport, I was thinking about whether I would be in touch with him as much as I used to be. Then I saw that he was taking on the National Driver Licence Service, NDLS, the Road Safety Authority, RSA and driving tests and I realised I was going to be in touch just as much. I have no worries about it. Obviously, he took up the role just before Christmas but this is still January so I do not expect him to have the full ins and outs and the full details of the issues happening in those areas. At the same time I trust that he would have a fair idea of what has been happening. I referenced in the Topical Issue specifically Skibbereen but there is an issue nationwide in regard to the time it is taking for young people in particular to sit the test. I single out young people because they are the most impacted by this. The time it is taking between finishing driving lessons and getting an actual test is an issue people coming into my office raise. A young lady from Ballinascarthy who finished her lessons came in to see me. She did everything right. She applied for the test on 7 November. She was told at that stage that she would be invited to book an actual test at the end of February or start of March, only to be told days later that it would be the first week of May before she would be actually invited to book, at which point there would be another four weeks before she would actually get the test. This is happening throughout the country. It is certainly happening throughout west Cork. What I am pleading with the Minister of State for today is to see that the resources and investment are put into that whole area of testing so that we can expedite this in order that primarily young people are not waiting such lengths of time. A young man from Rosscarbery had an almost identical issue. He looked to book a driving test in November only to be told that it would be at least the start of May until he could be invited to book a test. This is happening wholescale. It is happening nationally but there is actually a specific issue in Skibbereen where there were two full-time testers in the test centre, but now it is down to one. Clearly, to my mind it seems obvious that is having an impact on the ground here.  Young people are eager to get driving and to have that independence. We are all aware of that and familiar with it. However there is more than that. When you let that lengthy period lapse between your last lesson and your test that could be a seven-month period. The advice is to have further lessons in the interim. In the case of that young woman from Ballinscarthy, that will cost her €700. That €700 is very hard to come by when you are a leaving certificate student. That is another thing to factor in. There are other challenges, such as travelling to work, particularly in parts of Ireland that are not well served and connected by public transport. In that instance, that sixth-year student is coming up to exam time and requires grinds in different subjects. Young people need that independence instead of always relying on their parents. That is just a brief example of what is happening on the ground. As I said, the Minister of State is new to this role. I have massive faith in him because of how well he performed and what he has done especially for west Cork clubs in terms of funding for sports clubs and sports facilities. I have faith he will be able to turn this around.

It was great to be down in west Cork and see huge ambition in sport. However, now in a new role, we have to resolve some of the issues the Deputy is having in regard to transport. I know the difficulty and anxiety the delays in driver testing is causing many people who are waiting excessive times. It is unacceptable. As the Deputy knows, the Road Safety Authority has statutory responsibility for operational aspects of the national driving test, including applications and scheduling matters. The issue of driving tests delays is a problem throughout the State which is being repeatedly raised by a number of Deputies. The current national average waiting time for invitation to test is 19 weeks, far above the service level agreement of ten weeks. Indeed, in Skibbereen, I am told the waiting time for an invitation to test is 25 weeks which is well above the current national average and the national average is unacceptable and needs to be dealt with. That is what I am going to try to do.

The service level agreement is ten weeks, 19 weeks is the average and Skibbereen is facing waits of 25 weeks. That is exactly what we are hearing in the constituency office. Young people in the geographical area of west Cork are experiencing longer waiting times and are becoming frustrated. There was a question of the Skibbereen centre closing and I welcome confirmation from the RSA that it is not going to close. However, it is one thing not to close it.It is another thing to make sure it operates efficiently and effectively and gives people the waiting time for a test they deserve. That is going to require investment and resourcing and, at the very least, it is going to require moving the Skibbereen test centre from being resourced by one tester to two. The increase of that extra driving tester will massively reduce waiting times. There is also the parallel issue that there are many driving instructors in Skibbereen who rely on this for their income. They rely on the fact that Skibbereen is a town where people can go to do their driving test and, therefore, people choose to have their driving lessons there. There are many fantastic driving instructors in Skibbereen who rely on this and they will see the economic benefits of an extra tester being placed in Skibbereen. Let us not forget what this is all about. It is about young people who want their independence. They want to be able to drive themselves to grinds, to work or wherever they want to go. This is what it is about. These 25-week waiting lists are just too much. Let us work to reduce that and let us get an extra tester in the Skibbereen test centre.

We have to build greater capacity. The 30% increase in permanent headcount will make an impact and, as I said, they are being deployed with a focus very much on the centres that are above the national average, which should benefit Skibbereen. More generally, the Deputy is correct that many young people are waiting excessively for a test, which is impacting their lives in many ways, whether in terms of sport, education or a whole other range of areas. We have an obligation to deliver a public service that people expect. We also have a new vision around road safety and road deaths. We had a difficult year last year on road deaths, but if we are ambitious on broadening road safety objectives and trying to make sure people with learner permits have the opportunity to get a test, especially those with multiple learner permits, we have to ensure we have better capacity within the driver testing system. I assure the Deputy this is an absolute priority for me and there will be ongoing engagement with the Road Safety Authority on building capacity to make this much more efficient through the year. In regard to the service level agreement, which is at ten weeks, we need to ensure we are ambitious about building a better public service for all those who are waiting. We also know from the broader point on population demographics that there will be a growing level of demand over the coming years, and that is why we have to build on the capacity that was achieved last year with a 30% increase. I am anxious to engage with the Road Safety Authority on that and, as I said, we engaged with officials on this earlier today. We appreciate the Deputy raising the issue.

I am glad this matter was selected because, to a certain extent, I am not surprised when we get representations in regard to waiting times for assessments, access to therapies or even National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, appointments. When I first saw the letter from the school, “NEPS” jumped out at me on the page and I thought it was going to be about the number of assessments the school had. I know many schools find it very difficult, when they only have a certain number of assessments per year, to go through their list and nearly have to pick who they think deserves it most, even though all students who need an assessment deserve it equally. The letter states the school has no NEPS psychologist and that none has been assigned to the school, which is very concerned at the loss of this vital support. The school NEPS psychologists work with both primary and post-primary schools and are concerned with learning behaviour and social and emotional development. Each of the 221 psychologists is assigned to a group of schools and, earlier this year, this school, Newtown Dunleckney National School in Carlow, was notified that no NEPS psychologist had been assigned. Sometimes, when a Topical Issue matter is selected, I am hopeful this means there might be some positive news or development on the way, so I hope the Minister of State has some good news for that school and that it will have a NEPS psychologist. I am sure the school has furnished a copy of this letter to the Department or the Minister of State. The school is encouraging people to go to their GP to get a referral, but it knows those students are going onto a never-ending waiting list, which is extremely demoralising. At the end of all of this, we have to think of the children who are being denied access to a full and proper education if they need an assessment and are not getting that, particularly if there is no psychologist. It sometimes happens that if there is any sort of sudden or tragic event in a school, it is usually the NEPS psychologist who is called in, so what does a school in this situation do? That is just one part of it. The main thing is the assessments children vitally need, given the difference it can make to a child in terms of being able to access additional resource hours or access to a special needs assistant. We are always told people do not necessarily need a diagnosis, yet experience would say different. People will say that when they are trying to access these resource hours, special needs assistants or additional supports, they are told they need to have a diagnosis. I would be interested to hear what the Minister of State has to stay to that particular school on not having a NEPS psychologist.

In my capacity as Minister of State with responsibility for special education, NEPS is not directly under my remit but, notwithstanding that, I am very happy to talk about it this evening. Obviously, it is a separate service to special needs assistants, SNAs, and special education teachers, but NEPS is a very important service that is provided to all 4,000 primary and post-primary schools. The Deputy mentioned, for example, what would happen in the circumstances of a tragic event. It is important for the Deputy and the House if I outline how NEPS works in those circumstances. First, there will be direct engagement where there is what it would call a “critical incident”, which would be, for example, a tragic situation in a particular school. I have made inquiries specifically in regard to Newtown Dunleckney National School because, as the Deputy said, this is a Topical Issue matter that is particular and pertinent to this school. The Deputy will understand that in any national service at any given time, there can be gaps. My understanding in regard to the psychologist in that particular school is that the person was promoted. It can happen at any given time in a national service that a psychologist, or whatever person, can be absent for a number of reasons, for example, due to promotion, retirement, sick leave, maternity leave or a myriad of different reasons. Where there are gaps in the NEPS system for a particular school, the school can contact NEPS directly. The school has not contacted NEPS directly and I want the Deputy to be aware of that. I would suggest that, following this Topical Issue matter, the Deputy can let the school know she brought it up with me directly this evening in the Dáil Chamber and the school should contact NEPS head office for support until that recruitment process has been completed. While it has been brought up in parliamentary questions and here in the Dáil Chamber, it has not been brought up directly by the school with NEPS. That is the first thing that needs to be done. What can happen is one of two things. The school can either get support from the regional team through the NEPS head office, and there is a private psychological service that can be availed of, which is under the scheme for the commissioning of psychological assessments, SCPA, which can be relied upon on occasion. Therefore, it is either the regional teams through NEPS head office or the private psychological service.That is the way that I would suggest the school should proceed if it wants to get extra support, should it require it. It is incorrect to say that at any given time, a psychologist is removed from a school because that never happens. It is never the case. As I stated, across any national service, there is absenteeism for various reasons but the gaps are filled by others. In this particular instance, the written statement that I have, which I am sure the Deputy has a copy of, is directly from the Department and uses language that I am trying to make more easily digestible in terms of what the school should do from a practical perspective. It sets out quite clearly the steps concerning the type of model that is used and the fact that there is an assigned psychologist. There is an advisory support from an allocated psychologist, so there are people available to respond to queries. However, from a practical perspective, that is what I think the school should do.
#KathleenFunchion	unknown-#KathleenFunchion-party	unknown-#KathleenFunchion-dob	unknown-#KathleenFunchion-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-18 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	405	I thank the Minister of State. I will talk to the school about contacting NEPS directly and about what I would describe as interim measures in terms of the regional team. I imagine the regional team could be overstretched as well, but I do not know that. It is, however, a common occurrence. In regard to what the Minister of State says about no school being without a NEPS psychologist, obviously some schools do not have one if the person concerned got a promotion. Perhaps it is not the only school affected. I imagine that a number of schools is assigned to each psychologist. The school in question is very much of the opinion that it was informed that there is not a psychologist assigned to it. I do not know if there has been a breakdown in communication but that is the information the school has got when it has children waiting to be referred for assessment. I disagree with what the Minister of State has said about the school having a NEPS psychologist because with all due respect, the school would not have contacted me and asked me to raise it if it had access to the service. Is the private service to which the Minister of State referred something a school can avail of? Is there a cost to the school or is it covered? I would imagine that if there is a cost to the school that it would not be an option for the vast majority of schools, which we already know are under pressure in terms of fundraising and everything else, in particular with the increased costs. It is interesting to hear about the private service if it is something the school can access in the interim because it might be a helpful stopgap while waiting for somebody to be appointed. I assume that a person will be appointed as a psychologist to the school, or whatever group of schools in the area that is potentially missing a psychologist as a result of the promotion.

The point that I was trying to make is that the school does continue to have access to support and development work, which is delivered by the local team for critical incident response, as outlined by the Deputy. There is advisory support as well from an allocated psychologist for pupil casework. There is also an advisory psychologist who can respond to any queries that the school may have, and support from SCPA, which is the private service. I do not know whether there is a cost implication for this service, so I do not want to comment on it, but it is worth the school inquiring. We have 225 psychologists throughout the country across eight different NEPS regions. In 2014, there were only 173. There was an increase of 54 in this budget. Deputy Funchion asked about the recruitment of a psychologist. The competition is ongoing at present. Like any national service, there are gaps but it is important to say that there is access to a psychologist for the school. Deputy Funchion has brought the matter to my attention again today, which will bring it to the attention of the Department. It is also worth the school contacting NEPS directly and inquiring about the private service if the NEPS regional team is not itself in a position to assist. There are a lot of supports in place for well-being and counselling and other such measures that will assist the school.
#HollyCairns	unknown-#HollyCairns-party	unknown-#HollyCairns-dob	unknown-#HollyCairns-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-18 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	407	Last week was the first anniversary of Ashling Murphy's murder. Since then, a further 16 women have been killed on the island of Ireland, including two already this year, namely, Bruna Fonseca, and Maud Coffey. NGOs and campaigners have rightly called this an epidemic of gender-based violence. More than 250 women have been violently killed since 1996 and in the vast majority of resolved cases, they were killed by a man known to them. In half the cases, they were killed by a current or former partner. We must call this what it is: femicide. Misogyny remains deeply rooted in society. These murders are just the tip of the iceberg. The epidemic is manifest in countless cases of assaults, domestic violence, torture, coercive control, financial abuse, harassment, stalking and so-called revenge porn. The horrifying list goes on. Last year, vigils were held across the country and there was a national demand for action. However, we must be honest and ask what has changed. Women continue to be killed, to live in fear and to message when they are home safely. While this is a complex issue that needs responses from all of society, there are concrete things that the Government can and must do more quickly to confront gender-based violence. These are just some examples: first, we need more refuge spaces. Safe Ireland's pre-budget submission shows that the State only provides 29% of the required refuge spaces. The Istanbul Convention's standard is one space per 10,000 people and Ireland only provides a fraction of that. Cork city and county, with a population of more than 500,000, should have 54 spaces and it has six. I have repeatedly raised this matter. This week last year, speaking on Ashling Murphy's death, I called for additional funding to provide these refuge spaces. Again today, I reiterate that call. The next issue I wish to raise is domestic violence leave. I welcome the legislation bringing in domestic violence leave. However, it is recommended that this leave be up to ten days annually. The legislation only allows for five days, half of what is required. The third area relates to reform of the justice system. While there have been some very welcome and much-needed changes, victims and survivors are still experiencing hostile systems and there is still massive under-reporting of these crimes. The final issue I wish to raise is education, education, education. Social, personal and health education is scandalously outdated and, as a result, it is harmful. There is an immediate need for education on consent, sexual violence, coercion and online abuse. Shamefully, there are groups - even Members of this House - opposing these vital reforms. In November 2021, the Government delayed the progress of the Social Democrats Bill introduced by Deputy Gannon on relationships and sex education. The Minister for Education must immediately bring in a new curriculum and training for teachers to provide young people with the skills and knowledge to help them develop respectful social and sexual relationships. I accept that the Government is committed to addressing gender-based violence but to be fair, with the political will, considerably more could be done. One significant step the Minister for Justice could take is to immediately meet those working in this sector, especially organisations such as Safe Ireland, Women's Aid, and the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre. They are the experts and they know exactly what changes are needed across all Departments and public services. The Government should meet them and listen to them. We are just 18 days into the new year and we already have had two killings. This trend cannot be allowed to continue. There is more the Government can do and it must do it now.
#JosephaMadigan	unknown-#JosephaMadigan-party	unknown-#JosephaMadigan-dob	unknown-#JosephaMadigan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-18 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	408	Like the rest of the country, my thoughts continue to be very much with the loved ones of Ashling Murphy, in particular as the Deputy states, we have just marked the anniversary of her murder. The Minister, Deputy Harris, and I both welcome that the Deputy has tabled this issue for discussion, because tackling all forms of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence is, and will continue to be, a key priority for this Government. I cannot sufficiently underscore the commitment across the Government to tackling these hideous crimes and to address the underlying issues. As Deputy Cairns states, there must be collaboration with our partners and with all of society to try to prevent all forms of violence against women and to change the problematic attitudes that underpin it. We are also trying to improve and increase the supports that are available. We are putting in place new structures to ensure that we can deliver the systems and supports that victims and survivors so badly need. The Deputy mentioned a victim-centred criminal justice system that would support victims from the moment they report a crime right through the court proceedings and beyond. Procedures and processes have to be in place to hold perpetrators to account. There has to be a full range of supports and services available to victims of these terrible crimes regardless of where they live. We should continue to work with society to educate and raise awareness of all forms of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence and enable everyone to question and change problematic behaviours. Over the course of the past year, significant strides have been made in implementing Supporting a Victim's Journey, the plan to improve the experience of vulnerable victims as they engage with the criminal justice system. We want better training for professionals and the establishment of a course to train intermediaries. There is also the roll-out out of divisional protective services units in each Garda division, the introduction of preliminary trial hearings, and the provision of extra funding for organisations supporting victims, to address gaps in service provision by type and location. The zero-tolerance strategy the Minister, Deputy McEntee, launched is a five-year, ambitious, whole-of-government strategy. We all know its headings: protection, prevention, prosecution and policy co-ordination. It was developed in partnership with domestic, sexual, and gender-based violence partners and that sector. They have had direct input, which will help. It comprises 144 actions that have to be delivered. The legislation that the Minister, Deputy Harris, is bringing forward will increase the maximum sentence for assault causing harm; it is being doubled from five years to ten. Other legislation will include the monitoring of sex offenders, strengthen victims' rights, and make stalking and non-fatal strangulation stand-alone offences. The Deputy specifically mentioned refuge spaces, which she has been advocating on for quite some time. That has started and will continue. I was struck by one of the matters the Deputy mentioned, namely, under-reporting. I grew up in a very different era to the Deputy. There is still under-reporting. There was certainly a lot of under-reporting in my day, which is continuing. This morning, I attended a spin class very near where I live. I was crossing the road after the class, in my cycling shorts, and was verbally abused by a man who came towards me. I got such a shock that I did not even think it was directed towards me until I got into my car and he continued the abuse. I reported that incident today. I might not have reported that 20 or 30 years ago because that is what we do as victims. We think we are being silly and we maybe feel stupid reporting it but we must tackle that type of misogyny at the level of something as basic as that. It is completely unacceptable. Even though it is not a murder like that of Ashling Murphy, such misogyny runs the gamut. That is what is happening in society. We have to stamp it out. I said to myself, if we are talking about a strategy, I have to embody it too and have a zero-tolerance approach. We all have to. It takes men as well, if they see such incidents or conversations happening that are not acceptable to women, they also need to call that out. We all have to play our part.

I also thank her for telling her story about what happened today. Well done. She is right that such behaviour absolutely needs to be reported. A key point she raised is that for too long only half the population have been having this conversation. Girls and women know this reality inside out. We need structures and resources to help men have these necessary discussions. The Minister of State spoke about how we are seeing people report these crimes more and more and how good that is from a generational perspective but, to take cases of rape as an isolated example outside all other gender-based violence, less than 1% of victims get justice. Even though we have moved some bit forward, it is important for us to recognise how far we have to go. The figure is less than 1%.
#JosephaMadigan	unknown-#JosephaMadigan-party	unknown-#JosephaMadigan-dob	unknown-#JosephaMadigan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-18 00:00:00	Gnó na Dála - Business of Dáil	410	I thank the Deputy for her advocacy in this regard. I can hear the passion when she talks about this matter. Domestic violence has increased and has in fact doubled in the past 15 years. In my previous life as a family lawyer, l dealt with many women, and some men, who were victims of domestic violence. Ms Sarah Grace has spoken very eloquently on the criminal justice system. I could use the term "in part", but to a large extent many victims did not come forward because of their fear of the criminal justice system and facing that. The fact that we now have Garda training will help a lot. Gardaí are better equipped in how to deal with this violence. Judges also need training to deal with victims, and to make the process more victim friendly and victim centred, so there is not that fear and, primarily, that the woman is believed. Much legislation has been brought in relating to this area, such as Coco's Law. There is now legislation around coercive control, which the Deputy mentioned, and consent, which did not even exist when I was growing up. We have made huge strides but this is, as it is called in France, the grande cause nationale. It is something that will never go away. We have to stop it at its grassroots level before it becomes something really violent, similar to what happened to Ashling Murphy and the more than 200 women who have died since 1996. I thank the Deputy for her efforts on this issue. The Minister, Deputy Harris, has a zero-tolerance approach to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, as does the Government. For my part, I will also continue to advocate.
