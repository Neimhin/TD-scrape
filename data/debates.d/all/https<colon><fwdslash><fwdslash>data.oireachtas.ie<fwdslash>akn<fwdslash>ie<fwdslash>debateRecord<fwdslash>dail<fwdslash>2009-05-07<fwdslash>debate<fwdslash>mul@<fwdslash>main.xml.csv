#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	68	I indicated previously that if we did not see a reduction in prices I would consider legislative measures.  However, while there have been announcements on the reduction in prices, I welcome what has been said publicly that this would not be to the detriment of Irish suppliers.  However, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and I will keep a very keen eye on the situation.  I agree with the Deputy that the issue of assurance to our suppliers is very important if we are to have opportunities to support the food sector.  At the same time it is equally opportune that we see reductions in prices.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	69	What is the status of proposed legislation to establish NAMA as a toxic bank for failed loans to developers?  It has been reported in the media that the Minister has appointed a shadow chief executive to NAMA.  We have obtained independent legal advice that it is not possible for a shadow NAMA to function because under the terms of the laws dealing with the Financial Regulator there is no permission to divulge confidential information on bank loans or on the banks' books to anybody other than the authorities designated in the legislation.  A shadow NAMA was described as scoping the extent of the problem and the valuation of the banks' debts.  We have very clear legal advice indicating that is not legally possible.  Does the Government propose to introduce legislation in respect of NAMA and, if so, when?  Has the Government received advice from the Attorney General on the creation of this shadow NAMA authority, which will eventually cost the taxpayer, according to the IMF, between €25 billion and €40 billion if it is done wrongly?

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	71	That is my first issue.  I wish to ask the Tánaiste about a number of pieces of legislation.  I wish to ask about the bilateral arrangements and the legislation governing the protection of children.  I know the Tánaiste will be sympathetic to this.  It is in the matter of foreign adoptions, particularly those involving the Republic of Vietnam and Russia.  As the Tánaiste probably knows the bilateral arrangements for thousands of Irish couples, many of whom have spent five to six years in the adoption process getting vetted, are now at a standstill.  The bilateral arrangement with Vietnam expired on 1 May mainly because the Government did not have a sufficiently high-level contact between the Government and the Vietnamese Government.  The issue with Russia relates to the post-adoption contact and supervision required by the Russian authorities.  The administrative arrangements put in place by the HSE and the Adoption Board of Ireland are inadequate.  I ask the Tánaiste to personally undertake to investigate this as a matter of urgency.

This matter is in the Tánaiste's Department.  Mr. Eddie Hobbs tendered his resignation to the National Consumer Agency, NCA.  What does the Tánaiste propose to do?  A series of quangos were to be merged, but we have heard nothing more about it.  What is the current position in respect of the merger of the Competition Authority and the NCA?

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	86	——of all other proposals that any Government has entertained.

#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	91	I wish to raise three issues.  In light of the fact that a 93 year old blind person's home carer will not be replaced while the carer is in hospital, when will the eligibility for health and personal social services Bill be introduced?  It is vital that this issue be covered.Since we in County Monaghan have been promised that no hospital services will be removed until services that are as good as those available, or better, when will the health information Bill be introduced so that we can be told the truth?Last, but by no means least, I asked a couple of weeks ago whether any effort would be made to hold a full debate on the collapse in agriculture, particularly the dairy sector.  I was promised that it would be considered.  In light of the fact that the Tánaiste is back in her old haunt with the president and general secretary of the IFA, will she give the House some idea as to whether the issue can be addressed as a matter of urgency?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	92	On the first two Bills, we are not in a position to say when they will be available.

Some time ago, the Taoiseach gave a commitment to hold a second referendum on the Lisbon treaty in the autumn.  When can we expect a referendum Bill before the House?  This must be done shortly if the Taoiseach is to stick to the timeframe.A Fine Gael Party delegation under our leader, Deputy Enda Kenny, visited Israel and Palestine in recent weeks.  We saw some disturbing things.  Will the Tánaiste agree to allow a few hours next week for statements on the situation in Gaza and the West Bank?

The Adoption Bill is due to come to the House from the Seanad.  It relates to the question of Vietnam and Russia.  If we can deal with it as speedily as possible, the long-term situation will be helped.  When does the Tánaiste expect the Bill to be before this Chamber and does she expect it to be enacted before the summer recess?

This would allow the Bill to be debated in this House as quickly as possible.  I would like to do it this session.

My understanding is that it found that the Private Residential Tenancies Board has a role in adjudicating between apartment owners and management companies.  This is because a legal landlord-tenant relationship was judged to exist between apartment owners and management companies.  Is the Government aware of this judgment and how does it affect the planned legislation pertaining to management companies and agents?

#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	163	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this subject and wish to speak about the most vulnerable who are being targeted.  While Members may sometimes exaggerate slightly, in this case I make no apologies because it certainly is the case that the most vulnerable children are being targeted this time.  The cancellation of mild general learning disability classes has caused enormous problems and concerns for teachers and parents alike.  The decision to take away such special classes is similar to snatching medical cards from old age pensioners, except of course the latter had the power to have the decision reversed.  While small children do not have such power, perhaps their parents do and perhaps they will vote with their feet on this issue.Were the Minister present, I would invite him to visit any one of the more than 20 schools in the Dublin 8, Dublin 10 and Dublin 12 postal areas I represent, each of which is losing at least one class and some of which are losing two classes.  They all have DEIS status and no one will dispute they are among the most disadvantaged schools, both educationally and socially.  I must acknowledge the great work being done by both teachers and parents in such communities, where they are working against the odds.  Many of these parents did not have an opportunity and also had learning difficulties or perhaps were obliged to drop out of school.  However, they want their children to have a better chance and are fighting for them.  While the parents did not have this opportunity, they realise its importance for their own children.There are four or five reasons it is shameful that this facility is being withdrawn.  First, the children who need the support will be the first to lose out.  Although they need the additional help, they will not receive it and it can never be made up in future years.  However, they will continue to need such help both next year and in the following years.  Moreover, if this measure is taken, the other children in the classes into which the children from the special classes will be mainstreamed in turn will lose out.  A teacher must spread out his or her time and the layers of time that can be devoted to each child will become increasingly thin, regardless of whether the child is in the mainstream or is coming from the mild general learning disability class.  There will be two sets of losers in this regard.Moreover, in two to five years, these children will move on to second level.  The difficulties they will encounter when they so do were pointed out to me by the principal of a second level school last week.  They will come into second level still disadvantaged because they will not have had the special educational needs fulfilled that they had a right to expect.  There will be a knock-on effect, the consequence of which will be that either they will fall through the cracks and drop out of school entirely or simply will be completely left behind and at an even greater disadvantage.  Again, a further cost will arise in this regard.The economic saving has been measured as being approximately €7 million.  This is a drop in the ocean in the context of the overall economy's financial needs.  The Minister should consider the impact of and the negativity arising from the withdrawal of this €7 million.  Will the Minister agree to reinstate these classes in the coming academic year?  The Minister stated there is a magic number of nine or 11 pupils, depending on circumstances.  Why are these classes not being reinstated?  The Minister stated last night that many of the schoolsinvolved had not contacted him.  The schools in Dublin 8, Dublin 10 and Dublin 12 have been in touch with me, whatever about being in touch with him.  Moreover, I assure the Minister that many of them also have been in touch with him as the relevant letters were also copied to me.Instead of preaching about the importance of education, to which all Members subscribe, resources should be made available to drive the education facility for those children, such as those under discussion, who need it most.  Finally, I repeat my invitation to the Minister, who is not present, to visit even one of the schools in Dublin 8, Dublin 10 or Dublin 12.  He should visit a primary school and a secondary school, where he would see the social and educational disadvantage, as well as the efforts the parents and teachers are making to try to ensure their children have a fair deal and a fair chance.  I challenge the Minister to visit even one of those schools to see the impact that the withdrawal of this funding is having on those children.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	164	This week I attended a major Special Olympics sporting event in County Wicklow and noted the slogan was "Changing Lives".  There is no doubt but that the Special Olympics has changed lives for many children with special needs in particular.  While it has changed lives for the better, it seems the Government is set on changing the lives of many children with special needs for the worse.  I welcome this debate because it is clear that children with special needs require the investment of time, money and expertise.I wish to raise a particular case relating to children with special needs in my constituency.  There is a school for autistic children called Barnacoyle school.  It is a model of a school that has depended on its parents for financial and all other forms of support for the good of their children.  The children benefit from applied behaviour analysis, ABA, schooling and undoubtedly have benefited enormously.  Such a benefit has been recognised by the Department in other areas in respect of schools that already have been set up.  Moreover, additional schools now have been added to the list.  However, I am greatly concerned that the school at Barnacoyle has been deliberately excluded from the negotiations between Irish Autism Action, IAA, and the Department.  For five years, the school has been largely, albeit not solely, dependent on parents and the goodwill and support of the community.  Approximately 24 children benefit at present but I wish to mention one child in particular.  I refer to a little boy called Seán Ó Cuanacháin, whose parents Yvonne and Cian went to court because they saw no other way to ensure their child received the education and support he needed.  It was a terrible experience for the family.  The Department carried out an aggressive campaign and the cost to the taxpayer was prohibitive.  Seán Ó Cuanacháin is still in the same position he was.  We must examine what happened in this case.  The Minister, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, is not a vindictive man but the school has been treated unfairly by his Department.Reading about the case of Ms O'Keeffe, who took a case against the State and lost but was treated sympathetically by the State, it is extraordinary to note the treatment of the Ó Cuanacháin family compared to her treatment.  I urge the Minister to do the right thing and stop this exclusion of a school that is up and running, caring for and educating children with particular needs.  If the school were not there, there would be no school in County Wicklow for children with autism.  That is unsustainable.  Barnacoyle needs to be treated fairly.  I am concerned that the Ó Cuanacháin family feels it has no option but to take a case to the Supreme Court, with the trauma and expense that involves, because this matter between the school and the Department has not been resolved.  I regret that the Minister is not in the Chamber but I ask the Minister of State at the Department to raise this issue to unlock the logjam and deal fairly with the children in County Wicklow, who deserve treatment equal to that of any other child in the country.  They are not getting equal treatment and, as their representative, I must bring the case to the point where a difference can be made, where their lives can be changed by the Minister and the Department treating the school fairly, in line with the fact that the Department has funded 12 schools, plus two additional schools since the court case.  It is not the case that the pilot schools are in the loop, additional schools have been provided and funded yet the school in Wicklow is excluded from negotiations.  That is not fair, right or sympathetic to the children directly affected.  I urge that this case be dealt with fairly so that we can bring to a close an unpleasant and difficult chapter in the life of children in County Wicklow.
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	165	I propose to share time with Deputies Cregan, Dooley, Blaney, Connick, Calleary and Conlon.  I reassure Deputy McManus that I will bring the matter to the attention of the Minister, Deputy O'Keeffe.  I am the Minister of State at the Department but her comments would be best directed at the senior Minister in this case.I do not want to distract Members from our purpose with regard to this motion but I wish to register my strong protest at an article in the Irish Independent I read on my way here.  It referred to Members as bloodsuckers, which is an over the top and inappropriate way to refer to Members.  It reflects badly on the newspaper concerned and, as a profession, we need to defend ourselves because this is an outrageous phrase to use about us.  If we used this term with regard to virtually any other category of person in society, there would be understandable outrage.  If I used it about any group of people, I would have to resign my position.  It is important that this is registered.The mainstream approach to those with mild general learning disability is universally understood by educators to be the correct approach to this learning disability, which is general and mild by its nature.  It is important to reaffirm that point.  The Government measure is designed to put such pupils in mainstream class settings.  Children with mild general learning disability will continue to have additional teaching resources to support their education.  All primary schools have been given resources to cater for children with mild general learning disability.  Each school is given an allocation of resource or learning support teaching under the general allocation model, which was introduced in 2005.  This is given in addition to the school's allocation of classroom teachers.  This additional allocation will not be withdrawn from any school.  In the majority of schools, children with a mild general learning disability are included with their peers in ordinary classes and supported by their class teacher.  The curriculum is flexible so that teachers can cater for the needs of children of different abilities.  Schools use their resource or learning support allocation to give children extra help if they need it.  This policy of inclusion has widespread support within the education community and is in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.Having children included in mainstream classes is the desire of the vast majority of parents.  Academically and socially, children with mild general learning disability benefit from interacting with their peers in the classroom setting.  Historically, some schools were allowed to establish a special class if they had 11 pupils with mild general learning disabilities.  The arrangements were that the teacher would no longer be allocated where the number of pupils dropped below nine.  Some 128 classes are being discontinued in 119 schools.  All of these classes have eight or fewer children and over half have five or fewer children.  Eighty of the 119 schools have reduced class sizes under the DEIS or other disadvantage schemes.  Some 17 of these schools will gain an additional teaching post when these pupils are placed in ordinary classes.  In 2005, when the new general allocation system was introduced, schools with additional teachers and special classes for children with a mild general learning disability were allowed to keep the teacher for these classes.  Effectively, these schools got a double allocation.  Since then, these existing special classes continued in schools as long as there were nine or more children in the class.  The number in the classes has steadily decreased over the years.  Some schools have opted voluntarily to stop the classes and integrate the children into an age appropriate mainstream class.  No new classes have been established in recent years.  These are the facts underpinning the decision by the Minister.  Classes for these children with particular needs and difficulties were a phenomenon on the increase.  This mainstream approach was sought by educators and underpinned by the UN commitment.  When resources are constrained or cut back, there is an understandable clamour, worry, anxiety and frustration in regard to children with learning difficulties, particularly when one deals with education.  It is important to put this in context.  It is better for children in the short, medium and long term to be in mainstream class settings.
#JohnCreganFF	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-party	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	166	I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this Private Members' motion.  I welcome the Government's commitment to our education system over the past ten years.  I refer to the major improvements since 1998 in a range of supports available to these children.  Investment in support for special needs has more than doubled in the past five years, to over €1 billion this year.  More than 8,000 resource and learning support teachers and 10,000 special needs assistants are now in place.  Other improvements, technology and services have been provided.The Minister reiterated the Government's continued commitment to the improvement of education for our children.  The Government is committed to ensuring as many children as possible can receive an appropriate education in local schools, interacting with their friends.  The majority of studies, commentators, parents and teachers support integration and mainstreaming, and this should be recognised.Proceeding with this motion is very disingenuous of the Opposition as this is approximately the tenth occasion since the budget that the opportunity has been taken to attempt to vote down Government decisions which have been taken in exceptionally difficult times and in very difficult global financial circumstances.  Some day the people on the other side of the Chamber might get what they wish for.  Every party aspires to be in government and many Members across the floor aspire to be Ministers.  This may happen some day and they will have to be honest with the public, stand up, tell the truth and work within the resources given to them.That day may come for Opposition spokespersons and I wish them well if and when it does.  It is very disingenuous of them to be consistently negative and opposed to these decisions.  We have seen a range of decisions being contested and the Government has been accused of blowing the boom.  We know who has done this.  I have listed the significant investment we have seen in the education of our children, particularly in the special needs area.  If that is blowing the boom, I can buy into that.  It is only one example of where the Opposition has argued that we have blown the boom.Regarding the suppression of some of these classes, I understand the criteria which applied came into place in 1999.  The Minister and his Department have applied that criteria in recent times because of the agreement which existed with the partners in education that the ratio would be 11:1 but 9:1 would be accepted.  I understand that where such figures stand up, those classes will remain.  Where they do not stack up, any additional support required will be provided and made available to children who need it, which is very important.There is a special needs class in my own constituency in Newcastle West where tremendous work has been done by the teachers and school in question.  The class remains in place but there were three classes, consisting of two classes of six children and one with seven children.  The class is being maintained but the school is also mainstreaming like many other schools.I am glad to have had the opportunity to speak on the topic.  It is time for the Opposition to be honest and not criticise every decision taken by the Government.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	167	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and like Deputy Cregan, I believe there has been an effort by some in the Opposition — I do not want to tar everybody with the same brush — to misrepresent the facts.  The Minister's contribution last night sought to clarify as best he could the position and other speakers have been helpful in that regard.The needs of children with disabilities are not served by misleading people and developing inflammatory statements.  It would be helpful if some people sought to understand the facts rather than trying to score cheap political points at a time like this on the backs of children and families who are, by their nature, dealing with some very real difficulties in their lives.  I hope we can have a balanced debate; some contributions from the other side have been balanced while others have not.The most important issue is for children with mild general learning disabilities to have and continue to have additional teaching resources made available to them to support their education.  That is correct and fitting and something we would all support.  All primary schools have been given resources to cater for children with mild and general learning disabilities and each school is given an allocation of resources and learning support teachers under a special scheme, the general allocation model, which was introduced in 2005.That is only right.  For far too long we had a structure in place which did not involve the school principal.  Generally, nobody is in a better position to decide how the educational needs of children in a particular school can be catered for than the principal.  I welcomed the introduction of that model because it sought to put the principal and teaching staff centre stage in developing the necessary system to deal with the various levels of ability of children.  We act with regard to children who are not identified as having disabilities, but within this group there are children with very different abilities and we leave it to teaching staff to deal with the matter.  This is in addition to the school's allocation of classroom teachers, and the additional allocation has not been withdrawn.There is a special case in west Clare, in St. Senan's national school in Kilrush.  This school is caught in the middle because there are only three children in a particular class, with the difficulty being that these children have profound disabilities.  A solution must be found to cater for their needs.  The general learning class which was used was the only one appropriate at the time.  We need to develop a different system for such children.

The Opposition must be licking its wounds somewhat because it certainly missed the boat with this motion.  It has failed to understand that the best environment for the pupils involved is the school classroom and the way forward is exactly as the Minister, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, has outlined.  This motion is a poor effort at paying party politics.The Government and the Minister, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, must be commended for their efforts on special educational needs.  The contribution of the Government over the past ten years has been very significant if one considers the last time the Opposition was in government.

The Government must be commended on the amount of resources provided and work done in the special needs area over the past five to ten years, which has been significant.  The allocations have increased year on year, and this year, when times have not been so good, the area is receiving €100 million extra in the budget.  That is an enormous step in dealing with the difficulties suffered by children with special educational needs.  It is excellent that we are providing this type of support.I commend the Minister and Ministers of State on their effort and I hope they continue with their work for the betterment of this country's children.
#SeanConnick	unknown-#SeanConnick-party	unknown-#SeanConnick-dob	unknown-#SeanConnick-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	177	I am delighted to get the opportunity to speak today in support of the Government's amendment to the motion.  There is no doubt that we have made significant progress in recent years in investing in the education of young people with special needs and educational difficulties.  As a country, we will probably never reach the stage where we can say we have done absolutely everything we can and provided every single resource possible for people with learning difficulties.  However, we must always strive to provide every resource that our means will allow and introduce the best educational policies possible.Disability is extremely diverse and a one size to fit all approach does not apply.  In recent years the Government's investment in special needs education has increased dramatically and this year alone, the budget for special needs will exceed €1 billion.  This is a doubling of the level of investment in special needs education just five years ago.The range of resources being provided to special needs education has also expanded greatly over recent years and important supports, such as the resource teaching support, special needs assistants, special transport arrangements and increased capital funding for the purchase of special equipment, are now available to allow schools meet the requirements of pupils with educational needs, allowing these children to access a level of education appropriate to their needs.  There are now in excess of 8,000 learning support and resource teacher posts in primary and secondary schools and these provide additional support to pupils with learning difficulties.  When the Government entered office in 1997, there were only 2,000 such positions in the country.  The Minister, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, and his predecessors have overseen a significant increase in the number of posts available.  In addition, there are now more than 10,000 special needs assistants in our schools.  An increase of 33% in funding in 2009 will allow for the recruitment of up to 50 extra psychologists under the National Education Psychological Service.This debate centres on whether we should aim to integrate pupils with mild learning difficulties into mainstream classes and provide them with the most inclusive educational and social experience possible.  It is widely accepted in educational fields internationally that integrating children with mild learning disabilities with others in their age group and allowing them to have a fully inclusive educational experience is the most desirable approach for a society to take.  The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities agrees with this approach and advocates that children with mild learning disabilities should be integrated into the mainstream education system.  The European Union, in a resolution adopted in 1990, also believes that full integration should be considered as a first option wherever possible.  Many of our European partners take this approach in their education systems.Integrating children with mild learning difficulties into an inclusive educational system does not just revolve around meeting their educational needs, it is also about giving them a place in society and giving them confidence among their peers.  Segregating people with any form of disability, including learning difficulties, isolates them from society.  In a school system, removing these children from mainstream education marks them out as different from their peers and creates a barrier that extends far beyond the school yard.I had my accident during the summer holidays between first and second year in secondary school.  As a result, I missed nine months of second year.  One of the most important decisions my parents and the principal of my school in New Ross made at the time was to allow me to continue my education with my classmates.  If I had been held back a year, I would not have been happy.  The last thing I would have wanted would have been to be placed in a special needs class.  I did not have special needs assistants and I did not require them.

The first paragraph of the book was written by a woman called Mabel who was then in her 50s.  She was born with learning difficulties and because of her age she grew up in a system that isolated her from the rest of society.  Looking back on her young days she wrote:For people like me and a lot more you know, people were frightened of us.  If people are different, then other people get frightened.  I still see it.  People are frightened of people like me, and a lot more, because we are different.The basis of an inclusive educational system is to stop treating people such as Mabel as being different, to start treating them as being equal with their peers and to remove any barriers of fear or ignorance that other people might have in respect of them.  Educating children with mild learning difficulties in a mainstream classroom environment will help to remove these barriers, increase their confidence and self-belief and greatly increase their interaction with their peers.I support the Minister in his efforts to create an inclusive learning environment for children with learning difficulties and I acknowledge the substantial increases in funding for special needs education he has, despite the current economic circumstances, secured.  I fully support him and the amendment to the motion.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	184	I join colleagues in supporting the Minister, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, and the amendment to the motion.  It is important to recall that in the recent budget in excess of €1 billion was allocated to support children and adults with special educational needs.  While a great deal of this debate has focused on events that occurred during the past decade, it is important to place this matter in a more recent context.  The equivalent spend on special educational needs in 2004 was €468 million.  The allocation has, therefore, more than doubled.  The €1 billion allocation for this year will come from current spending.  The latter is the exact form of spending which those on the opposite side of the House consistently advocate should be cut or curtailed.  That is the context in which this debate should be considered.From the expenditure to which I refer, support is provided across a wide spectrum of initiatives within in the education sector.  At school level, in addition to the teachers provided in the classroom, significant additional supports have also enabled schools to cater for the needs of students with special educational needs.  Colleagues referred to the number of SNAs and teaching assistants who are now in place and who have transformed the entire area of education in recent years.  The level of services available to schools — particularly those with most need for such services — through SNAs and teaching assistants is greater than ever.Most pupils can, through the general allocation model, be fully integrated into mainstream schools.  All mainstream primary schools with students which have higher incidence of special educational needs and mild general learning disabilities attract extra supports through this model.  Some children, including those with autism, require additional teaching care and supports.  Schools are provided with special needs supports and additional teaching resources in order to cater for each individual child's needs.It is important that people reflect upon Deputy Connick's remarks.  Instead of speaking at the sector we should speak with it.  It was slightly disappointing that the Deputy's experience was dismissed in such a manner by those opposite.  Deputy Connick spoke from the heart and the proposers of the motion should have listened to what he had to say.The general allocation model, which has been in place since 2005 and which has been the foundation for much of the investment in this area, is incredibly important.  The critical point is that all pupils with mild general learning disabilities will continue to access additional teaching resources.  All primary schools, under the general allocation model, have been given resources to allow them to cater for children with mild general learning disabilities.  Such resources will not be withdrawn from any school.The majority of schools have ordinary classes and policy of inclusion enjoys widespread support within the educational community.  As has become evident during this debate, the debate relating to mainstreaming inspires emotion.  In recent years, the thrust of Government policy has been towards mainstreaming and addressing the concerns outlined by Deputy Connick.It is important to reflect on where the money that has been invested has been spent.  Such funding has been used to provide SNAs and teaching supports and to develop the curriculum.  There are now more than 8,000 learning support teacher posts in primary and post-primary schools.  In addition, more than 1,000 teachers in special schools teach pupils with various disabilities at very reduced ratios.  For example, the ratio in respect of children with autism is 6:1 and in respect of those with moderate general learning disabilities it is 8:1.  There are some 10,000 SNAs in the education system who work in primary, post-primary and special schools.  Approximately €190 million in enhanced capitation levels was allocated to special schools and mainstream schools with special classes.  This capitation rate is much higher than that which is available to other schools.  We have also made special transport arrangements and provided special funding for new technology, sensory technology and specialist equipment.We have made an enormous investment across the board and, in particular, in respect of those with special educational needs.  The Minister is ensuring that the money we are investing goes to those who need it most.  I fully support him in this regard.As already stated, the €1 billion that will be invested in this area during the coming year — this amount represents an increase of €100 million on the figure for last year — comes from current expenditure, which has been targeted by Deputy Bruton in recent weeks.  Are those opposite in a position to provide an assurance that this €1 billion would be secure were they to move to this side of the House?
#MargaretConlon	unknown-#MargaretConlon-party	unknown-#MargaretConlon-dob	unknown-#MargaretConlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	185	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the motion.  As many of my colleagues have stated, there has been a major investment in the range of supports that have been available to children with special educational needs since the late 1990s.  This investment has transformed the ability of schools to make provision for all children.  The Government is committed to ensuring that as many children as possible will receive an appropriate education among their peers in their local schools.  It is also committed to ensuring that these children will be able to interact on a daily and weekly basis with their peers because this will assist them in developing vital social skills.  The supports to which I refer are not merely teaching supports.  They include specialist equipment, transport and specially adapted buildings.  All of the latter must be put in place for children everywhere.The crux of the debate is that all pupils with mild general learning disabilities will continue to have access to additional teaching resources in order that their education will continue to be supported.  The provision of such supports ensures that children with special educational needs are given the opportunity to reach their highest potential.  Is that not what we would wish for all of our children?  I recall a time when children with special educational needs were treated as second-class citizens.  In many cases they were ignored or shunned by their peers because they were perceived to be different.  I would not like to return to that.  In the past few years Government supports were put in place to ensure the educational needs of those children were met.In the majority of our schools children with a mild general learning disability are included in the ordinary classes with their peers and supported by their class teacher.  The curriculum is flexible to ensure teachers can cater for the needs of children of different abilities.  Schools use their learning support allocation to give children extra help if they need it.  Those children benefit from interacting with their peers.  All pupils, including those with special educational needs, need to interact with other pupils and in different situations to enable them to cope in a world where that will be the norm.Teachers are to be commended for their inclusivity and their assistance and dedication in preparing children for life after school.  As the Minister, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, put it aptly last night, the Opposition is seeking him to play political football with this issue.  On one hand it wants us to manage public expenditure and, on the other, it wants us to provide resources to classes that do not have any children.  We cannot have it both ways.I have had close contact with the school in my town of Castleblayney and I have evidence of a willingness on the part of the Department, the SENOs and the teachers to work together in a partnership approach to ensure that the class, rightly so, would be reclassified, and in that case the class would not be suppressed.  I welcome that partnership approach.  However, that is misrepresented in the local media.  I read last week a statement that was made about the Department of Social and Family Affairs providing free lunches yet no education.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  That is an indication of the way the position was misrepresented.I take the opportunity to reassure parents that teachers and schools are working every day to deliver an excellent education to all children.  The teachers should be thanked time and again for the tangible difference they make in the lives of all our children to prepare them to for life outside school.In the past ten years the Government has driven a transformation in education policy for children with special educational needs.  Almost 12 years ago, when Fine Gael and Labour left power, most parents of children with significant or special education or care needs had no choice but to send them to a special school.  This Government will continue to represent, be aware of and deliver for pupils with special educational needs.  I will continue to work with my colleagues to ensure those pupils will continue to be a priority in terms of educational investment enabling them to achieve their true potential.

I refute all of those allegations.  I thank Deputy Brian Hayes for bringing this motion before the House.I speak from experience of two primary schools affected in my constituency, both of which are in my home town Birr, namely, St. Brendan's boys primary school and the Mercy primary school.  There are 13 children in total in those two classes and of these, 12 have already tried the option proposed by the Minister, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe.  They had already been in mainstream school.  Twelve of those children already had special needs assistance and resource hours and for 12 out of 13 children, it did not work.We have been asked to speak from the heart and therefore I will outline the comments of parents who contacted me about this matter who I believe are the experts in terms of what happens to their children.  The Government has argued that there are insufficient enrolments yet it is the very policies adopted by the Department of Education and Science that have ensured there are fewer children attending these classes.I wish to make it clear that I support mainstream education and I am aware that the first choice of every parent for their children would be to have them in mainstream education——

The Government wants to promote integration.  That is not something new.  It is something we all support but the two special classes to which I refer, and I have been in both classes, are not a sterile unit outside the building to which the rest of the children have no access.  They are very much part of the whole environment of the school and the children attending those special classes are part of that.  They are not isolated.  They are not as they were when we were in school when the attitude in terms of the way they were treated was completely different.The principal of the boys school stated, "It is a safe and rich environment within the larger school giving all types of opportunities for children throughout the school to live, learn and experience each other's lives in an atmosphere of inclusiveness and equality".  That is what is happening.There are seven pupils requiring special classes in the girls school and for those seven pupils there is only one special needs assistant.  She will now be asked to deal with those seven pupils in seven different classrooms in four separate buildings on the one school campus.  It is not possible for her to be able to give that level of attention to those children.The general model did not work.  I will outline to the House some examples of parents who contacted me about their children.  One mother explained that her son had an SNA and one resource hour per day in his former school.  The system was tried and failed him.  In fact, he was threatened with expulsion because the situation was not managed.  He is only in his new class in Birr since January and he has not had any problems.  Until then, mixing with other children was alien to him.  She now sees him mixing, partaking and socialising which would not have happened previously.  Last week he participated in "Pinocchio", at Birr Theatre & Arts Centre, which he would not have had the opportunity to do previously.  She said it is real, meaningful participation.  His life has been transformed.When I contacted another father last night he told me his daughter was in school for three years.  People have asked me to speak from the heart and I will quote this parent.  He told me last night that if his daughter is put back into a regular class, the Government may as well put her in the River Shannon.  He was deeply upset when he said that about his daughter but that is the reality because he has tried, she has tried and it did not work.  When she was in the other class, which had 38 children, she was utterly lost.  She cried every morning before school and hid under a bench in the classroom.  She is only in her class in Birr since September.  She is the first up in the house every morning and loves going to school.  He said that as it is, they worry about her every day that she will get somewhere.  They will not put her back into a mainstream class because regardless of the law, they will take her out of school.  They will not put her through that again.Another constituent who was in contact by letter with the Taoiseach stated:Returning to mainstream is not an option for our daughter.  Since the announcement she has not slept at night, is crying all of the time and just not able to cope.  She knows what it means returning to mainstream, being left behind once again.  She had a terrible time, was picked on by other children, was called names.  Not being able to keep up she felt completely useless.I ask the Minister, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, and the Government to consider the plight of these children.  They are not a political football.  They are real children.

The decision to target education cuts in some of the most vulnerable groups in our school system, namely, special needs children and migrant children, is appalling.  Those who cannot speak for themselves are being targeted by a Government that does not want them to speak.Language is a major barrier for migrant children in our classroom system.  We cannot achieve integration if some of the most marginalised in our society are not competent in the English language, both spoken and written.  Not only does that cause social problems but the cap on language support teachers in conjunction with the increased class sizes and the withdrawal of these special classes will result in teachers allocating an inordinate amount of time to some students, with the rest of the class suffering.Speaker after speaker on the Government benches lectured us on the issue of integration and the mainstreaming of pupils.  These special classes are mainstream.  If the Minister knew anything about the system he would at least know that.  They are in mainstream schools.  I know at first hand the challenges parents have to face in making the decision in the first instance on whether to send their child to a mainstream school or to a special needs school.  That is a difficult decision for any parent.  As a public representative, I dread a parent meeting me to seek a domiciliary care allowance or the carer's allowance because I know that for the next number of years I will have to fight to get every basic entitlement for those children, whether it be in or outside the education system, a psychological assessment, speech and language therapy or, in the case of migrant children, language support.It is hypocritical to be lectured by the Government on the issue of mainstreaming in this instance.  I will give one example of what is it issue from one school principal to whom I spoke in whose school two children will be withdrawn from one of these special support classes and put into a double class of 29 pupils.  At present, they get intensive support with English and mathematics.  There are six migrant children in the class born outside the island of Ireland.  Of these, there are three for whom English is not their first language.  There are also seven Traveller children.  One in four of the pupils in the school are Travellers.  They are entitled to an additional Traveller resource teacher but that will not be given to them by the Department of Education and Science.We are being told that this represents integration and mainstreaming.  Which of those children will the teacher prioritise in that class?  It is a decision of Solomon that the teacher must deal with on a day-to-day basis.  I am being told by the Government that this is mainstreaming, integration and isolation, and that it is a way of identifying those children as individuals who will be isolated in that class.  However, they will be like every other child in the class, therefore, I will not take lecturing from the Government on this issue.In addition to the withdrawal of services to children, not only within the education system but within the health system, which is appalling, is the dramatic increase in the pupil-teacher ratio in many schools in my constituency.  The Government has decided, with this policy and its other education policies over the past number of months, to pit one pupil against another.  It has chosen to expose these children, both Irish and non-Irish, to exclusion and isolation.  It is exclusion from the help that they need and from the ability to read, to learn and to participate.  That is what it calls mainstreaming.  It is appalling.  It is time the Government got an education in what it is all about.  I commend the motion to the House.

#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	197	The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, told the House last night he was commissioning research from the National Council for Special Education on this issue.  I draw the attention of the House to the report published four years ago on that matter which evaluates special classes for pupils with specific speech and language disorders. It states that the Department of Education and Science held a seminar for professionals on 28 May 2002 in Kildare.  The seminar concerned an important element of the review of education provision in classes with children with special speech and language disorders.  If any Minister or Deputy opposite spent the time to research this with all his or her background staff — nobody has mentioned it so far — he or she would find short paragraphs such as that it is recommended that the SENOs investigate the need for establishing additional special classes for pupils with SSLD of primary school age.  Yet, the Minister is abolishing such classes, which does not surprise me.In debate many Deputies cited international researchers but did not state who they are.  The Minister, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, told us a number of years ago that, according to the international experts, larger classes are better.  I challenged him on it and he eventually cited the expert.  It was a person from Texas who has been discredited and with whom nobody else agreed.  This is disastrous.  It is an insult to the House and it is an insult to the children.  The research has already been done.  It contradicts completely everything that the Deputies opposite have parroted this morning and last night.  They are completely wrong.

#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	201	Some Deputy on the Government benches called them "kids".  Kids are young goats; these are children who have special needs, who are in special classes and who require intensive one-to-one help.  I have been there, I worked with them and I know what it is like.  I do not know whether the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, has any experience of this area but some of these children with ADHD, Tourettes syndrome or dyspraxia, or even dyslexia, or any such condition, are so confused that they can be violent.  They can be a danger to themselves and to others, yet the Minister wants them to be put into a large class.  It is appalling.  These children will be expelled from the school.The report to which I referred also states that there should be adjoining rooms or a classroom of adequate size that is partitioned to create an area suitable for individual speech and language therapy, and that it is desirable that such a room be free from noise or distraction, the accommodation should allow the teacher and the speech and language therapist to work collaboratively with the pupils or with each group, with a small group or one-to-one as required.  The Minister does not need another report.  He has one already, produced by the inspectorate in the Department.  Let us get real.I appeal to the Members opposite not to take out the mess they have made of the economy on the weakest and the youngest of our citizens because they are sentencing them to a life of horror if they do this.  This is the one chance available to them.I spoke to other teachers working in this area.  It has been suggested that these children are locked away in a special room but that does not happen.  As other Deputies have stated, they integrate properly with others in art and PE and elsewhere, and they are withdrawn for special classes where they need the help.  The Government is abolishing that.  Has the Government any idea what it is doing?  Has it visited these schools, has it seen these children?  The Government does not have a clue what it is about.  I appeal to Deputies not to do this.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	202	I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Brian Hayes, on tabling this motion and for providing us with the opportunity to speak to it.  The record of the Government when it comes to the most vulnerable in society is appalling.  One need only remind oneself of the long hard struggle in which sufferers of cystic fibrosis had to engage to ensure that their oft-promised facilities at St. Vincent's Hospital would be built and delivered.  Although we have the Ministers word on this, we will watch this space carefully.  We have seen medical cards taken from the elderly, our children deprived of vaccination against cervical cancer despite being promised they would be afforded this protection, the terminally ill being means-tested and failing those means tests for a medical card, and, in the last week, people queuing to die as they cannot get into palliative care centres.  Against that background, to see the Minister, on behalf of this Fianna Fail Government, deprive children with mild general learning disabilities of the services which had served them so well in their special classes is not surprising, but nonetheless it is appalling.The foolishness of this decision and the callousness of it ranks with the other areas I mentioned already.  It is foolish because it will not save money.  It will cost more money as these children will find themselves in mainstream classes in need of special needs assistants and help.  It is costly because it impedes their ability to reach their full potential and will impede the development of the other students in the class, thus costing the economy further down the line.  In any event, in one school four of these children will be entitled to 17 hours a week, that is, a full teacher, and no saving will be made.  It is callous because it discards the concerns of these children's parents and their teachers and disregards the real need of this group of children, many of whom have progressed into the mainstream from these classes.In my constituency there are three schools concerned — St. Helen's in Portmarnock which I visited, Brackenstown in Swords and St. Teresa's in Balbriggan.  St. Teresa's in Balbriggan is a case in point.  This is a primary school in a rapidly developing part of Dublin where parents are finding it exceedingly difficult to get their children into school.  In this school there are two special needs classes with nine pupils in each and a waiting list of nine pupils, and yet the Minister in his wisdom has determined that one of these classes should go.  One of his arguments is that it is best practice that these children be taught in a mainstream school.  With that being the Minister's logic, could he tell the good people of Balbriggan and this House why this form of justice is to be delivered to one class while the other remains in place?There is no logic to this.  Furthermore, with no guidelines in place and all of these children having received a NEPS report, it is now left to the headmaster and the board of the school to decide which children will remain in the special needs class and which will not.  In the absence of any national guidelines, this means the teachers and the board are placed in an invidious position.  What logic can be used to distinguish between the children?  Will the Minister for Education and Science guarantee primary school principals, teachers and boards of management that he will indemnify them against future action by parents for depriving their children of this service when others were left to avail of it with nothing to distinguish them, given they all have the National Educational Psychological Service report?St. Teresa's accepts children from not just Balbriggan but from Balrothery, Balscadden, Naul, Oldtown, Ballyboughal, Lusk, Skerries, Loughshinny, Rush and Donabate.  This ill-conceived blunt instrument, designed to do nothing other than to save money without regard for the future of our children, will deprive the entire of Fingal county of their human right, the right to an appropriate education.  The Minister for Education and Science will be long remembered for this and for all the wrong reasons.

He cannot do it again at the expense of the most vulnerable in our society.  If he does, the people, particularly those of Fingal, will remember that Fianna Fáil in government meant bailouts for the banks but hardship for the hard pressed.  Where are the three Government Deputies from Dublin North, Deputies Sargent, Kennedy and Darragh O'Brien?  None of them could find time to debate this motion.  As with the cervical cancer vaccine, a few million euro cannot be found for our children, but billions can be found for the builders and the banks.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	205	I congratulate my colleague Deputy Brian Hayes on pursuing the Government on this matter.  The decision to axe special needs classes and abandon the most vulnerable children shows how out of touch the Government has become.  Last February, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, pulled the rug from under these children to save €7 million without any thought of the consequences for them and their families.  He could have found €7 million elsewhere without attacking these defenceless children.The Minister claims these children can be transferred back into mainstream classes without any major disruption.  He also claims the current level of resources available under the general allocation model is sufficient to meet the needs of the children.  Nothing is further from the truth.  I challenge the Minister to visit the special needs class at St. Senan's in Kilrush, west Clare.  If he did, he would not be making such statements.I was moved when I visited the school.  These children are an inspiration to all of us.  They are three happy children who are benefiting enormously from the excellent individual care and attention they receive from their teachers and special needs assistants.  Their parents are devastated by this decision because they know their children cannot be transferred across to a mainstream class.  They have witnessed the enormous strides their children have made already but are now worried and angry.  If this class is axed what will happen to these children?  Their parents are making many sacrifices to ensure their children receive the education they need.The Minister should also understand the geography of west Clare.  For one of these children to get to Kilrush every day would mean a round trip of 46 km.  If the class in Kilrush is axed, they will have no alternative other than to stay at home.  Parents of special needs children have to face a daily struggle to secure proper educational facilities for their children.In 2005, an autism unit was set up at the school.  Four years later, in spite of numerous promises, we still do not have a permanent structure for it.   Last night the Minister said the needs of students can change as they get older and mature.  While he is correct, no provision has been made for the future educational requirements of the children attending the autism unit in Kilrush once they have completed their time at the primary school.One parent of a child attending the unit told me recently she does not want any more fudge from the Minister.  She wants to know where her daughter and other children like her will receive their education when they leave St. Senan's.  These parents deserve answers.  Every day I receive telephone calls from parents across County Clare, concerned at the impact the reduction in the allocation of resource teachers and the hours available to access a special needs assistant announced in the budget will have on the needs of their children.  The lack of funding is also delaying the commencement of redecorating works at St. Senan's school in Shannon where the autism unit is due to open in September.Children with special needs did not bring this country to its knees.  Every child is gifted; they just unwrap their packages at different times.  I appeal to the Minister to leave these children alone and give them back their classes.  I hope he will have the courage to admit he got this one wrong and reverse his decision.
#PaulConnaughton	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	206	I wish to read into the Official Report a letter I received from a parent yesterday.  It states:I am a parent of a four year old autistic boy who suffers from epilepsy and severe learning difficulties.  He currently attends Springfield child development centre, Ballinasloe, two days per week and I would hope for him to be attending there five days per week.  However, this seems not possible as we are reliant on funding from the Department of Education and Science to keep this service running.For a number of years now, the Department of Education and Science has provided a pilot scheme for the provision of education to children aged three to six in our child development centres, including children supported in their local preschool by the early childhood services at Lower Newcastle in Galway.  The child development centres involved are located at the Burren View in Galway City, Stepping Stones in Tuam, and Springfield in Ballinasloe.  The funding provided by the Department towards the provision of teaching and special needs assistant hours has been very beneficial to the children involved over the last number of years.[Management of these centres is] unable to give parents the assurance they are seeking that their children will have an educational placement for September 2009.  There is quite an amount of anxiety developing among the parents involved, particularly the parents of children with autism.  In former years when we had our enrolment meetings at this point of the year, we would have been able to confirm places to parents in the child development centres.  If funding is not provided for this coming September 2009, we will not be in a position to enrol any new children who have applied for places in our child development centres.  This will mean that these children will be without any educational placement for September 2009 and children currently enrolled will have to have their time cut back.  The children who will be affected present with autism, severe learning disability and physical disability, and the multidisciplinary staff who have assessed these children have recommended the child development centre placements for them, particularly in the absence of other appropriate educational placements.  [It is all about these children having no place else to attend].Coupled with the above difficulties is the fact that we have a number of staff at each of the locations involved, whose employment was dependent on the provision of the funding each year from the Depart of Education and Science.The five professionals will lose their posts at the end of September because of these cuts.  I fervently hope this parent who wrote to me, and the many others affected, will read the contributions to this debate from the Ministers and Government Deputies.  Their contributions were nothing short of outrageous.  I am sure they will get an answer from the people on the doorsteps.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	207	I commend my colleague, Deputy Brian Hayes, on providing the opportunity for this important debate.  Having listened to the contributions by Members on this side of the House, I am proud of what Fine Gael Members stand for.  Their contributions show our true ethos.  A Government Deputy asked where would Deputy Richard Bruton get the cuts if he were Minister for Finance.  I can assure them the Fine Gael Party always stands up for people with special needs.  That is why our party in Europe is a member of the Christian democratic movement.  We stand for protecting the vulnerable in society.  I have never heard such cutting debate as I heard on this important issue.  As chairman of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party, I can state that my colleagues will not stand by and allow cuts such as these to be made.  They are unfair to very vulnerable people.Deputy Connaughton rehearsed a letter he received concerning a child with special needs in his constituency and I could describe many similar cases.  It is unfair and unchristian of the Government to make these cuts.  These are special children and their families are very attached to them.  What the Government is doing is cruel and unjust, especially given its failure to consult the National Council for Special Education Needs or the report it has produced.  Much voluntary work and effort has been invested in children with special needs and significant changes have taken place over the past several years.  As a society, we have given a lot in terms of voluntary organisations and activities.If this Dáil is to mean anything, we must stand up for these people.  I urge the Government to heed our arguments.  My constituents in Tipperary South have a long history of establishing organisations to help the vulnerable and those with special needs.  If the Government reversed its decision, it could help these people.
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	208	Yesterday, the Minister for Education and Science clearly set out the Government's commitment to meeting the needs of children with special educational needs.  The Government's track record over the past decade in providing substantial additional resources, including in particular extra teachers, special needs assistants, assistive technology funding and special school transport arrangements, to meet previously unmet needs is indisputable evidence of this commitment.  The Minister also confirmed to the House that the Government's investment in special needs provisions would continue and this is demonstrated by the priority status given to investment in special education despite the current difficult economic circumstances.  The Government's investment in special needs will be over €1 billion this year.I want to outline the many significant advances which have in recent years improved the lives of children with special needs and their families considerably.  We are doing what others failed to do in the past.  Ten years ago, the only option for many parents of children with significant special education or care needs was to send them to special schools.  Thanks to the major investment by the Government in the intervening years, parents now have three distinct choices.  Their children can attend mainstream classes in their local schools - with additional supports as required where they have low incidence special needs - special classes in mainstream schools or special schools.  Many children can, therefore, receive educations appropriate to their needs in their own communities alongside their siblings and friends.The development of inclusive practices in education over the past decade has been particularly significant in underpinning the allocation of increased resources for special educational needs provision to mainstream and special schools.  This has led to a large increase in the number of students with assessed special educational needs attending mainstream primary and post-primary schools.  At present, there are over 8,000 resource and learning support teachers in our schools and over 10,000 special needs assistants to provide care support for children with special educational needs.  More than €50 million is being spent on special school transport arrangements and school buildings are modified where warranted.  These investments have allowed schools to support children with special educational needs in becoming part of a genuine school community.  The principle of inclusion is not new and has widespread support within the education community.For obvious reasons, the majority of parents wish to have their children educated in their own communities.  This principle is also in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the Salamanca statement and framework for action on special needs education in 1994, the Council of Europe declaration in Malaga in 2003 and the Council of Europe action plan in 2006.  Is the Opposition suggesting that we ignore this advice and support a situation where children are not welcomed into their own school communities?

The impression that such children would be bereft of special needs support is disingenuous.  The Minister made it clear that the decision was taken because there were insufficient numbers in these classes to warrant their retention on the basis of the Department's policy on class retention.  These children will be supported by their mainstream class teachers as well as through the general allocation model of resource teaching that applies in respect of all mainstream primary schools.

The Minister stated that the Department of Education and Science is currently reviewing appeals from some of the schools where classes are due to be discontinued.  The Department also listened to the concerns of the INTO regarding a small number of schools and discussed the issue with the IPPN.  In a number of cases, it emerged that some pupils should be resourced more appropriately through other mechanisms, and advice to this effect will be provided to the schools concerned.The Government will continue to prioritise investment in special needs education.  Even in the context of the current economic circumstances and the many difficult choices that had to be made in the 2009 budget, the Minister managed to secure an additional €10 million for developing the capacity of schools to meet the needs of children with special educational needs.  Specifically, the funding will expand the National Educational Psychological Service, enhance the capacity of the National Council for Special Education to co-ordinate the provision of services to children with special educational needs and invest in teacher training so that the learning and teaching needs of all pupils with special educational needs continue to be met.The education and health sectors are adopting an integrated approach to target these additional resources at the areas of greatest need.  There is improved co-ordination between the education and health sectors through the establishment of a cross sectoral team and the appointment of Deputy Moloney as Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children with special responsibility for disability and mental health.  This debate has provided an opportunity to clarify the position regarding mild general learning disability classes.  The Government assures parents that priority will continue to be given to providing for children with special educational needs.

The parents of this country will thank him for his efforts on retaining the 128 classes this mean Government wants to take away from the people who need them the most.For the past 12 years, Ireland was awash with money but people with special needs were left behind.  Just when they thought things might improve, they were the first to be targeted when the economy took a downturn.  Shame on Fianna Fáil and the Government.  Fianna Fáil would have us believe it is the republican party and that it looks after families, but I am disappointed to say that it is not looking after families or the weak in this society.  On the doorsteps in recent weeks, people have been telling me that the vulnerable are the first to be targeted when the economy goes bad.Deputy Brian Hayes has been putting pressure on the Minister, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, who recently ran around my county to throw sods in the air for gaelscoileanna which had not yet received contracts or funding.  He should at least have waited until the contracts had been signed before throwing sods in the air.  I am glad to say that one of my Labour colleagues in Westport caught a sod and posted it back to the Minister.  Well done to him.  The Minister can bring the sod with him when he delivers the contractor and the money to that school.What is happening in regard to special needs education is very wrong.  What the Government is doing to the children who need it most is very wrong.  Fianna Fáil backbenchers are the most brazen crowd of people I have ever seen in my life as they praise the Government parties and say how well they are doing on this issue, yet families in every corner of the country will be affected by this decision in the next few months.  Shame on the Minister and the members of the  Fianna Fáil-led Government.  How can they attack the most vulnerable and weak in our society?  The classes should be left alone and further funding should be put in place for them.  Parents are feeling the pressure and I ask the Minister of State and his colleagues to tell the Minister for Education and Science they will not take any more and that they want to protect the people who need to be protected.  They do not have a strong voice.  Parents cannot take to the streets because they must look after their children at home.  They are under pressure and it is not fair.
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	216	I thank Deputy Brian Hayes for tabling the motion.  The Department's motives for this decision are based purely on bookkeeping considerations.  In my contribution to the Private Members' debate to encourage the Government to reduce the number of junior Ministers from 20 to 12, I pointed out the saving involved would almost cover the cuts in special needs provision of €7 million.  The Minister of State with responsibility for children had the audacity to reply that we were wasting valuable time on such a paltry figure and we were like turkeys voting for Christmas.St. Fergal's resource centre in Bray, County Wicklow, has two special needs classes with 18 children.  The maximum number of children allowed is 11 and the minimum is nine.  The school is under instruction to lose a class and to pick 11 children for the remaining class.  I presume the SENO will have to play God regarding the nine children who will be transferred to mainstream classes, which are increasing in size anyway as a result of other cutbacks and the failure of the Government to honour its commitment to reduce pupil-teacher ratios in mainstream classes.  In addition, many children who speak different languages and who have different cultural backgrounds are in mainstream classes and the Minister is asking children who are in a special class for mild and general learning disabilities to go into this mainstream environment.  The Minister suggests this is a better environment and will give the children a better opportunity.  Has it been the attitude of the Government parties in recent years to provide additional classes because it looks good, or to provide such classes because they are needed but we must be tough with people?  Neither attitude is fair.  My wife is a learning support teacher in a small school where provision is adequate, as there is no need for a general class.Thankfully, the Taoiseach reduced the number of junior Ministers to five.  The saving of €750,000 per Minister of State would go a significant way if it were targeted at special needs education.  While that is a simplistic way of looking at the issue, if the Government is to give example by cutting the cost of governance, the money should be allocated to projects that work.  When Finland experience a recession in 1991-92 similar to that we are experiencing now, more money, not less, was invested in education.  The result is every mobile telephone manufacturer in the world is trying to take over from Nokia as market leader.  While it may not be directly related, the Finnish Government educated its citizens to a level where it is the most competitive nation for one of the most sought after technological devices, which indicates that if a country wants to overcome a recession, it does not start by targeting education and, in particular, those who are most vulnerable and who need an opportunity.The Government's amendment states it will fund the provision of additional support.  When one nets off the saving of €7 million, one will be down to a minimal figure.  Children will leave primary school ill-prepared for secondary education and society and the challenges they face in securing gainful employment in order that they do not cost the State money in another form.

I thank Deputy Ring for sharing time.This is an important motion, as it clearly challenges those in Government who say they are protecting the vulnerable.  All Deputies have a duty to stand up and speak out on behalf of children with disabilities.  It is particularly relevant in these tough economic times that we support the 534 children who will be affected by the withdrawal of 128 special needs classes and I call on the Government to reverse this draconian decision.  It is unfair, it is unjust and it is a blatant attack on our education service.  I speak as a parent and an INTO member who has campaigned for many years on special education.  I commend the recent speech of the president, Declan Kelleher, at the recent INTO conference where he referred to creating a more progressive, caring society.  I congratulate Sheila Noonan on winning the general secretary's race in the organisation.The decisions for all families with a member who has a disability are becoming difficult and, in recent days, I have witnessed worse cutbacks to their services.  A young adult constituent of mine with a serious physical disability has had his five-day service reduced to three, which is causing major stress for his family.  Tragically, 245 parents in their 70s and 80s are on waiting lists at St. Michael's House for services for their sons and daughters because of a lack of money for additional residential places.  Four pressure points are emerging for the Prosper Fingal disability service in Swords and Skerries, County Dublin: follow-on day service in 2009 for those completing their training in Seatown Road centre; demand for new applicants, including school leavers, who will seek the service later this year; individuals and families in crisis who need residential or respite provision; and funding to meet the company's capital requirements.These are the realities for children and adults with a disability.  This is the real world for families.  Hence, my support for the motion.  I urge all Members to support children and adults with a disability and to support education as a right and a step towards a more inclusive and caring society.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	218	I thank all colleagues who contributed to the debate.  It is disgraceful that the Green Party sent none of its Deputies to contribute during the proceedings last night or today.  Deputy Sargent, in particular, stated two months ago that his stomach was turned by this decision and he has been putting it about in schools in north Dublin that he could not get time to contribute to the debate.  He did not have the courage of his convictions to put on the record his views on this issue.  We will see which way the Minister of State and his colleagues vote shortly.I agree with Deputy Finian McGrath that this decision is a direct attack on the most vulnerable children in our school system.  The Government parties will abolish 128 classes in 119 schools on 1 September and the decision will affect 534 children.  This is not about whether a mainstream class or a special class is better, the UN convention or about a declaration in Malaga.  The issue is the Government's decision to suppress 128 classes.  If the notion is that there cannot be a special class in a mainstream school on the basis that every pupil should be mainstreamed, will the Government abolish all special schools?  Is that the next logical step to take if it pursues its argument further?The Government's main argument is that the general allocation model was introduced in 2005 but the figures are out of date because the model was based on figures at that time.  It is not based on current figures and many schools have experienced an increase in enrolments.  The Minister's statement that there are no children in all these classes is absolute hogwash.  In many of those schools, come next September, there will be a quota of children for one or two classes based on the 1999 figures of between nine and 11.  It is wrong for the Government to suggest that in suppressing those classes the resource will be available for those children.  It will not.  The Minister said yesterday that those pupils would be provided with additional teaching supports through the general allocation model.  Exactly what teaching supports is he offering?  That is what we want to hear.I asked the Minister a straight question last night, to which I thought his junior Minister would reply today, about how many of the 128 classes he had visited.  How many of the teachers, parents or children had he met?  Not one.  He has not been to one of the 128 classes, yet at the stroke of a pen he can abolish them.  If it was wrong to keep those classes in 1999 why did no previous Minister abolish them between 1999 and now?  Perhaps they had the cop-on to realise that it would have been an attack on vulnerable children.  There is no credibility in the Minister who, at the stroke of a pen, could decide that he would play God for those approximately 500 children when he had not been to the schools, nor met the parents or teachers.The Minister is on dodgy legal ground.  Section 2 of the EPSEN Act outlines an approach based on inclusion – something we all support – but sections 2(a) and (b) refer to:(a) the best interests of the child as determined in accordance with any assessment carried out under this Act, or(b) the effective provision of education for children with whom the child is to be educated.The Minister is wide open to a legal challenge from any of the parents involved.  We all know the record of the Department of Education and Science when it comes to dragging people through the courts and defending its own action.  The decision is wide open to a legal challenge because the Minister is, in effect, taking away from children an existing service that they are to get in a mainstream class.  Last Friday I was in my constituency with my party leader, Deputy Kenny.  We saw two great classes, wonderful children and wonderful teaching.  Where previously those children were in a class with a pupil-teacher ratio of 6:1 or 7:1, they will now have to make do in a class of 25 yet we are told everything is going to be hunky dory and will work for those children.What planet is the Minister living on when he comes to the House to lecture us about UN conventions?  I suspect he and his colleagues who have spoken on the subject today do not have a clue about what they are talking.  The Minister is tearing down one of the key aspects of special needs provision in mainstream schools.  Those are classes that work and the Minister is telling the children their future will be bleak because of the Government's decision.  Shame on the Government Members who made such spurious arguments in the House today and shame on them for voting down this motion.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	220	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."I am pleased to introduce the Harbours (Amendment) Bill 2008 for the consideration of the House.  The primary purpose of this Bill is to give effect to certain aspects of the Government's ports policy statement launched in 2005.  In line with the objectives contained within the ports policy statement, the Bill seeks to further underpin and enhance the commercial freedom conferred on our State commercial port companies under the Harbours Act 1996.  Our commercial ports have played a key role in facilitating economic growth in the State and, notwithstanding the current economic difficulties, as an island nation we remain dependant upon seaborne trade to drive economic growth.  To facilitate such growth, it is crucial that our ports remain capable of responding to the commercial challenges they face.The development of this Bill has been shaped by an extensive consultation process and builds upon not only the recommendations and proposals contained in the Government's ports policy statement, launched in January 2005, but the work carried out by the high level review of the State commercial ports in 2003 and the statutory performance audit of the port companies carried out by Jonathan Packer in 2001-2002.  A number of the objectives contained in the ports policy statement require legislative change and the Harbours (Amendment) Bill 2008 is designed to incorporate these important recommendations into primary legislation.  The Bill also seeks to address certain anomalies in respect of the Harbours Act, which have come to light since its enactment.As Deputies are already aware, the explanatory and financial memorandum accompanying the Bill provides a concise summary of each section.  However, I would like to take this opportunity to expand on a number of areas of the Bill that I believe are of particular importance and to refer to some amendments made arising out of the Bill's passage through the Seanad.One of the fundamental areas for reform of the sector, as identified in the ports policy statement, was the need to enhance the commercial mandate of the port companies by facilitating improved port company board performance through the reform of board structure.  The Harbours Act 1996 provides for port company boards to consist of 12 members comprising of three directors appointed on the nomination of the relevant local authority, one or two employee directors, depending on the size of the company, either directly elected by the employees or appointed by the Minister to represent employee interests, and a chief executive officer.  The remaining directors are appointed at the discretion of the Minister.  Twelve directors is considered excessive for the State port companies.  In the case of some of the smaller companies, the number of directors exceeds the total number of employees and has the potential to create an additional financial burden on those companies.  Section 8, therefore, amends the articles of association of each port company to provide for a total of eight directors on each board.  This reduction will ensure that port companies are better equipped to respond rapidly in a focused manner to any commercial challenges that may arise.  To achieve this reduction, section 11 amends the 1996 Act by removing the statutory representation of local authority directors on boards and by standardising the number of employee directors at one per port company.Notwithstanding this proposed overall reduction, it is intended that all current directors will serve out their full terms of office.  I recognise the significance of these proposals and, in light of this, I would like to outline the rationale behind these amendments and the policy context in which they are made.As Deputies are aware, the State commercial port companies emerged with the enactment of the Harbours Act 1996.  Prior to that date, the sector was characterised by harbour boards with representatives from various interest groups, ministerial nominees and a number of local authority representatives.  These harbour boards were characterised by unclear mandates, public utility ownership, a localised perspective and local monopolies.While the commercial harbours review group, whose findings helped shape the Harbours Act 1996, recommended the removal of local authority representation and a streamlined corporate governance structure for the new companies at board level, the 1996 Act allowed for the continued statutory representation of three local authority directors on each company board.  It should be noted that the port companies are alone among the State commercial sector in continuing to have this statutory provision for local authority representation.  Since its enactment in 1996, the Act, and the sector, has been subject to a number of reviews, including the statutory performance audit of the port companies undertaken by Jonathan Packer in 2001 and 2002 and the high level review of the State commercial port companies in 2003.  Both of these studies recommended the removal of the statutory representation of local authority directors.  The developments that have occurred in the sector since the enactment of the 1996 Act have resulted in a major organisational and cultural change within the ports.  While I acknowledge the substantial and valuable inputs over the years from local authority directors, I am satisfied the rationale for this continued statutory representation is no longer evident.In line with the recommendations contained in both the statutory performance audit of the port companies in 2001 and 2002, and the 2003 high level review of the State commercial ports, I believe it appropriate to grant our port companies the same freedom as that conferred on other State commercial companies and remove this restrictive position as regards board membership.  However, it is my intention to continue to appoint a local authority director from among my own nominees.  This should help alleviate the understandable concerns of those who feel that this removal of the statutory provision represents an unwelcome break from tradition.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	222	Section 11 also proposes to standardise the number of employee directors at one per port company.  The current provisions allow for two employee directors being appointed at just three ports — Dublin, Cork and Shannon Foynes.  The other seven ports either elect one employee director or have an employee director appointed to the board by the Minister.  In the context of the overall reduction in board numbers from 12 to eight directors, it is considered that one employee director is appropriate to represent employee interests at board level.  This representation ensures that port company employees will continue to make a valuable contribution to the strategic decision-making processes of the port companies.While it may seem incongruous to talk of additional port capacity in the current economic climate, a cornerstone of the ports policy statement is the need to ensure that our commercial port companies are encouraged and equipped to provide adequate and on-time port capacity.  It is vital that our ports are capable of responding to the needs of enterprise so as to facilitate economic growth into the future.Section 3 has specific implications for the proposed development of a new deep water facility at Bremore by Drogheda Port Company and its partners.  This section will amend the 1996 Act and insert a list of principles and policies a Minister shall have regard to when considering an application to alter a company's harbour limits.  The insertion of such principles and policies is in line with advice received from the Attorney General and is consistent with the rulings given in the Mulcreevy and City View Press judgments.  These principles include planning applications or planning permissions under the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2006, various regulatory processes under the Foreshore Act 1933, navigational safety as well as the current and expected capacity of the harbour.The Bill will further enhance the capabilities of port companies in providing additional port capacity by introducing a greater degree of flexibility into a port company's borrowing capabilities.  My Department's study of national seaport capacity issues in 2006 identified a number of significant infrastructural investment proposals.  The development and successful completion of these projects may require significant borrowings by the port companies concerned.  Currently, the 1996 Act restricts the port companies to borrowing a sum up to 50% of the value of their fixed assets, subject to the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Finance.  Section 9 of the Bill allows for a port company, or a subsidiary, to borrow up to €200 million or 50% of the value of its fixed assets, whichever is higher.  The borrowings will of course remain subject to the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Finance.  In addition, section 9 will insert the principles and policies a Minister shall have regard to when making an order to vary the 50% limit, which is also in line with the judgments I mentioned.The Bill also seeks to enhance the ability of port companies to invest outside the limits of their harbours.  Currently, port companies are restricted under section 11(4)(d) of the 1996 Act from investing outside the State unless such investment would “promote the interest of trade or tourism in the State”.  Section 4 of the Bill will delete this restrictive provision and section 5 provides for port companies to invest outside their harbour limits, including outside the State, provided consent from both the Minister and the Minister for Finance has been granted.  The removal of this restrictive limitation is in line with the strategic objective of enhancing and underpinning the commercial ethos of our commercial ports sector and brings the sector into line with other State commercial bodies such as the ESB and the Dublin Airport Authority.Section 7 pertains to the transfer of certain ministerial responsibility regarding the compulsory purchase of land by port companies to An Bord Pleanála.  Currently, port companies seeking to make a compulsory purchase order must apply for a ministerial acquisition order under the Fourth Schedule to the Harbours Act 1996.  While this function has been exercised only once since its enactment, it is felt more appropriate that this power be transferred to An Bord Pleanála given its role, pursuant to the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006, as the determining body in respect of planning consent for strategic infrastructure developments at commercial ports.  With the new role conferred on the board since 2006 with regard to strategic infrastructure, it is anticipated that An Bord Pleanála will over time acquire and build up a body of expertise and experience in the planning aspects of major infrastructural development generally and particularly, in this case, on port projects.  In these circumstances, a strong case can be made that the board would be better placed to adjudicate on port company applications for the compulsory acquisition of land rather than the Minister of the day.In light of these considerations and that similar functions with regard to the compulsory acquisition of land by Aer Rianta were transferred to the board under the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Act 1998, I believe this proposal is the correct approach to take with regard to the State commercial ports.  Similar transfers of ministerial functions have taken place in respect of compulsory acquisition of land by local authorities under the Roads Acts and Housing Act.  As I have already mentioned, while there has only been one such application under the Harbours Act in the past 13 years, it is felt appropriate in the interests of best practice and consistency that these functions regarding the commercial ports sector be also transferred to An Bord Pleanála.While the Bill is primarily designed to address issues identified in the State commercial port sector, I have no doubt that Deputies are aware of the vigorous debate that took place in the Seanad regarding section 18 of the Bill and its potential implications for two of our regional harbours.  The proposal sought to provide a legislative basis for the recommendations contained within the 1999 review of the State's regional harbours, and reiterated in the 2003 high level review and the 2005 ports policy statement.  It introduced an enabling provision allowing for a ministerial order to be made transferring Tralee and Fenit Harbour to the control of Shannon Foynes Port Company and Bantry Bay to Port of Cork Company.  This is a third option in addition to the two options that already exist under the 1996 Act, that is, establishment of a private company or transfer to local authority control.Arising from the debate on the provision, I was happy to accept an amendment to the section to provide for a statutory consultation period prior to any order being made to transfer these particular harbours to port company control.  A local consultation period such as that now included in the section will ensure that all stakeholders will be given an opportunity to present their opinions as to the future status and management of these two important regional harbours.Furthermore, and consistent with the recommendations of the ports policy statement which called for the transfer to local authority control of regional harbours with little or no commercial traffic, the Bill also provides for the future transfer to local authority control of Arklow Harbour.  At the time of drafting the 1996 Act, consideration was being given to establishing a commercial port company in respect of Arklow Harbour.  Therefore, the harbour was not included in the list of regional harbours listed in section 87(2) of the 1996 Act that may, subject to a ministerial order, be transferred to a relevant local authority.  Since Arklow Harbour no longer has any significant level of commercial traffic, it is considered appropriate that the harbour should appear in this list, which will permit its transfer to local authority control along with other similar harbours across the country.Accordingly, section 17 will delete it from the list of harbours to be established as commercial port companies and include it in the list of harbours in section 87(2), which may then be transferred to local authority control subject to ministerial order.  While the section will remove Arklow Harbour from the list of harbours to be established as commercial port companies, inclusion in the list referred to above will also mean that a company could be established in respect of the harbour subject, once again, to ministerial order.  That provision has never been invoked since the enactment of the Harbours Act in 1996.The Bill also contains a number of amendments to the Harbours Act 1996 regarding pilotage and pilotage services.  These changes address a number of issues identified since the original Act was passed and changes that are required on foot of the separate provision to alter harbour limits.  It is my intention to introduce a further amendment relating to pilotage on Committee Stage to raise the upper age limit for retirement of marine pilots from 60 to 65 years of age.  This has been the subject of extensive consultation between the Department and the Association of Marine Pilots of Ireland, as well as the Irish Ports Association.The overriding objective of the Bill is to improve and enhance the commercial ethos of our State port companies so that they can continue to serve as facilitators of economic growth.  It is self-evident that a vibrant, dynamic and competitive commercial ports sector is vital to our future economic growth and prosperity.  The Bill builds upon the important provisions contained within the ports policy statement.  As well as enhancing the corporate management structures of the port companies, the Bill will aid port development plans.  It will further enhance the commercial ethos conferred on our ports by the Harbours Act 1996 and ensure that they are positioned to respond to the challenges they will face.If Deputy Broughan wants to submit an amendment whereby only Fianna Fáil members can be appointed to these boards, I would be delighted to accept it on Committee Stage.

While I support some important elements of the Bill, I do not support others that are at serious variance with the current period.  We are about to elect people to local bodies to effect the changes and policies wanted and needed by their communities.  At the heart of the Bill is an anti-democratic principle, in that it will replace three publicly appointed local government representatives with an individual nominated by the Minister of the day.  This is a serious error, given that we are discussing local democracy and people's expression of the opinions of their communities and businesses.  Local authorities bring together development plans and the forces of development in an economic balance, but that knowledge is to be removed from harbour authorities except where the Minister or his successors appoint someone.  This is a core issue.I have met a number of local government members and the General Council of County Councils, which represents all parties.  The collective wisdom of the elected local representatives is such that they should be able to retain their memberships on the boards in the same manner as has been the case to date, that is, they nominate their own members.  Louth and Meath county councils and the Drogheda borough council appoint people to the Drogheda Harbour board.  This has an advantage and I am sure that it is the case in other counties.  Where there are adjoining local authorities, yet the Minister only selects one of the three bodies in question to be represented, problems will arise.  For example, will the representative have the combined wisdom of the local authorities concerned?  Clearly not.Will the Minister reconsider the matter and, on Committee Stage, table amendments to retain the elected local representatives on the harbour authorities as they currently exist?  It would help the Bill, in that all government concerns communities and their members' involvement.  As elected Members, we collectively represent the country.  On harbour authorities, people would represent their local communities.I agree with much of the Bill's content.  For example, harbour authorities have changed over the years.  I fully support and subscribe to the principle of dynamic, modern, efficient and effective harbour authorities.  An authority must be business-like and as competitive as possible.  I support the question of commercial freedom and competition between ports.  I also support new management structures and maximising private sector involvement in our ports.  Over the years, the Minister has consulted widely on this legislation and many important players in the public and private sectors have commented on it.I accept the principle as it relates to the Drogheda Port Company, which is an important part of the Bill if we are to facilitate the proposal to build a new port at Bremore.  I am happy to support it.  The Attorney General has advised that there are not sufficient principles and policies in the 1996 Act to allow such an alteration of the harbour limits.  Therefore, an amendment is considered necessary.  The Bill will facilitate the modern and dynamic development of Drogheda Port at a new location at Bremore.  I welcome that it will also facilitate the Drogheda Harbour authority's commercial activities and excellent plans, to which everyone looks forward.The question of ancillary movements in connection with the new port at Bremore arises.  On several occasions I have made a point to the Minister regarding the new Drogheda Port's connectivity with the Leinster outer orbital route to facilitate the movement of products into the market.  The current road network, the M1, is chock-a-block, particularly early in the mornings, as the Minister knows.  After nearing the airport, one can be sitting in one's car for up to an hour before entering or getting around the city.  While I welcome the changes made to the M50, a proper distribution network from the new port at Bremore will require the construction of the Leinster outer orbital route as soon as possible.  It does not form part of the national development plan or Government proposals, but it should do.  If the new port at Bremore is efficient, there will be a greater amount of traffic on the current road network.  Therefore, the port will be less efficient without the essential road network.While my next questions are more pertinent to Committee Stage, I will put them on the record now.  The Minister's briefing document refers to how the Harbours Act provides for port companies to have regard to any relevant Government policy or guidelines on the acquisition of land.It states, "It is considered appropriate in the interests of consistency and best practice that this provision should apply also to the disposal of land by such companies".  Have issues arisen in respect of port companies not having due regard for Government policy or guidelines regarding the disposal of land?  Are some authorities disposing of land improperly or not according to the wishes of the authorities as such in contravention of Government policies or guidelines, as that would be a highly significant issue?  The fact this matter is placed first in the list of the Bill's objectives means this point must be of some significance.  In his response or on Committee Stage, the Minister should have regard to this matter.I note the commentary on the Department's website includes comments on the pension funds of some port companies.  While I wish to make a carefully constructed point in this regard, it relates specifically to three port companies that do not have the same pension funding arrangements as do other ports.  The Minister should explain the implications and what this means because this also is a significant comment.  Are adequate pension arrangements in place in those authorities and if not, will the Bill regularise the position?Another issue that arises concerns the proposal to allow port companies to borrow money and to invest, which I greatly welcome.  The Minister mentioned a limit of €200 million or of 50% of the value of a company's fixed assets, subject to the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Finance.  I refer to the present economic climate and value of properties as obviously the economy was in a completely different mode when this provision was drafted.  The value of the fixed assets of port authorities that wish to borrow money may be significantly less at present and consequently, they may not be able to borrow as much.  What implications, if any, will this have for the operation of port authorities?I wish to ask a second question on an intriguing issue.  This legislation will allow port companies to invest outside the State and it is fine if a company wishes to do so.  In his reply or on Committee Stage, the Minister should tease out the reason this provision is necessary and what implications, if any, it might have in the future.  I do not have a problem with the Minister empowering the port authorities to borrow the money themselves, which means such investment will come out of the public purse.  However, given the history of the present economic crisis and because of the mismanagement of resources by banks and other financial institutions, how will the Minister ensure that any investment made will be based on the value of the fixed assets?  In addition, what criteria, if any, will apply to borrowing for the purposes of investing outside the State?  In other words, will due diligence be performed on their activities and how will the Minister make them accountable?  While I appreciate the purpose of this Bill is to make the port companies more independent and more commercially inclined, how will the Minister ensure that such investment is done wisely and well?  The key point is that without interfering too much with any such investment decision and given the alacrity with which such decisions must be made at times, the Minister must ensure there is a balance between the business plan and the realities on the ground.I agree with the Minister regarding the transfer of functions from the Minister for Transport to An Bord Pleanála in the context of the compulsory acquisition of lands by port authorities and do not have a problem with that.  Ultimately, the net point reverts to the directors of the company and I refer to the excision of local authority members from these bodies with the exception of the Minister's appointee.  I ask the Minister to reflect on this issue.I have read the Seanad debate, in which this issue was much discussed.  On full examination of the issue, I do not discern a reason local authority members should not remain as members of the board.  One of the arguments made by the Minister in favour of removing them pertained to a reduction in time for port staff and a reduction in administration costs arising from a decrease in the number of board members to be serviced.  This would be of minor benefit and I cannot imagine that sending out four additional notices to board members would constitute a significant financial imposition on anyone.The removal of public involvement of public representatives in harbour authorities by this legislation will have a significant and adverse impact on planning in the area and on the information the board will have when it makes a decision.  There is an informal accountability at present in respect of public representatives nominated by county or borough councils.  While they are not obliged to account for what they say or do or how they vote on such bodies, what requirement is the Minister placing on the new boards of harbour authorities to ensure full and proper consultation in respect of local authority development plans?I wish to ask the Minister a question on the Bill itself to which he may respond at the appropriate time.  I refer to the proposed changes to the limits of Drogheda Port Company.  The Minister or one of his departmental officials should identify the reason for this.  I do not have a problem with changing the limits as the harbour board must be dynamic, practical and business-like.  I understood the prime purpose of the Bill in respect of County Louth was to change the location of the port.  However, the Bill also extends its present limits "along the Baltray Road to the village of Baltray, from there ... to Duff's Farm".  It encompasses a significant area in County Louth and goes from thence in the direction of County Meath, "to the southern limits of the townland of Bettystown" including "the high water mark of the eastern shore of the townland of Mornington" and so on.  What is happening in this regard?  I acknowledge this is a local issue.  This involves significant communities in County Meath, as I am sure the Minister is aware because he was the Deputy for that area.  The Acting Chairman, Deputy Kirk, and I now represent it.

Nevertheless, will this now mean that Mornington, Baltray and Termonfeckin, if Duff's Farm is located in Termonfeckin, are, by definition, harbour or port areas?  If so, what does this imply in respect of local development plans?  A High Court case was taken arising from the limits of the Drogheda harbour authority some years ago and its limit was fixed to a particular location.  I wish to make clear that I do not oppose the new location of the port at Bremore.  However, how will the new designation as a harbour area affect Baltray, the area around Termonfeckin, around east Meath and Mornington and Bettystown in particular, where thousands of new houses have been built and in which people are living in an area that is zoned residential at present?  Has this been done in consultation with local authorities?  I ask this question because when one no longer serves on a local authority, one is not fully familiar with what is happening in respect of such issues.  However, it is an important point that I must make.  While I have an open mind on the answer, this will affect two aspects.  The Minister is extending the existing boundaries and changing the location.  There is support for the new location at Bremore but there will be total opposition to extending it to residential communities, whose amenities will be under significant and serious threat, particularly in the areas of Baltray golf course, Laytown, Bettystown and Mornington.There are positive aspects to the Bill.  I accept the bona fides of many of the principles but what is at the core of the Bill is the effective removal of public representatives from harbour authorities and we do not accept this.  I support the Minister's point that at present, commercial operators in the port can be on the board.  This legislation will disbar them specifically but it is the intention that the business community will be part of the membership of the harbour authority.  My colleagues have points to make about different locations.It is our intention to debate these matters fully on Committee Stage.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the removal of public representatives.  The worst of all worlds is that, if the Bill is passed, the Minister will appoint one member and this creates problems where there are adjoining counties and local authorities.  It may help the Minister if someone in his Department examines this.  If one of three local authorities is selected, the other two will not be represented even though they have a significant and real interest in the development of the authority.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	228	Ports form a vital part of the economy and society.  Some 99% of our total trade imports and exports go through national ports.  Mariners in my home port of Howth and the ports I visited as spokesperson on this subject, from Greencastle to Castletownbere, use the phrase, "If you bought it, a ship brought it".  The critical nature of ports to the Irish economy is self-evident.  In 2005 a ports policy statement was released by the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Government.  I welcome the focus on the ports, which had been disgracefully neglected in policy development, particularly in the past 12 years.However, there are still worrying questions about the 2005 policy document and whether its key underlying agenda was for a privatisation of the network of national ports.  The Harbours (Amendment) Bill has been brought forward to give effect to the ports policy statement of 2005.  Why has it taken so long to produce this Bill from the 2005 document?  The unacceptable slowness in this legislation, which has meandered for the past 10 months since it was launched on a bank holiday weekend, is typical of the lethargy of the Government over the past 12 years.I welcome aspects of the Bill with regard to strengthening commercial facilities at our national ports but it lacks ambition and is not thorough enough.  We clearly need to facilitate our ports to be as dynamic and strong as possible given their massive commercial mandate but major issues of port governance remain.  There have been outrageous episodes at Dublin and Shannon Foynes ports that have never been transparently and publicly addressed.  As the objective of the Bill is to strengthen the commercial ability of the national ports to function it should have been accompanied by stronger and more accountable structures of port governance.This legislation does not enhance the governance and running of our ports.  Many of the measures contained  in the Bill will make our ports less democratic and less accountable and will increase the ability of the Minister to stack port boards with Government cronies who may not provide the commercial leadership and drive that our ports need in these challenging economic times.  In this context, the dropping of the statutory provision to provide for local county councillor representation on the boards of ports is appalling and is something the Labour Party will continue to bitterly oppose.  Ports are embedded in the local community.  To therefore remove the input of the democratically elected representatives of the community from the board of the port when any port development will have a massive impact on local people's lives is a retrograde step.This legislation proposes a similar outrageous reduction in the role of worker-directors in our ports, which the Labour Party has already strongly opposed through my colleagues in Seanad Éireann, Senators Michael McCarthy and Brendan Ryan.  I urge the Minister to withdraw these unacceptable legislative provisions in the Bill on Committee Stage.Other critical issues for ports and maritime transport, some of which are key aspects of the Government's 2005 ports policy statement, are completely ignored in the legislation.  The Bill does not advance the full integration of the ports into the national transport system, even though this was a key reason given at the time for the cannibalisation of the Department with responsibility for the marine and the subsequent transfer of marine transport and ports into the Department of Transport.  We have had discussions on integrated transport recently and the importance of facilitating port traffic.  Why did the Minister not take this opportunity to lay down some basic statutory guidelines for the full integration of transport systems?  This applies particularly to rail freight systems for our national ports.  We see the great problems the port of Cork had in its development.  The Cork board and the NRA seemed to be singing from different hymn sheets in respect of the development of the N28.  We need integration, a matter to which the Minister referred in his smart travel document.  He had the opportunity to give it a statutory basis in respect of heavy goods movement and he has not done so.  There are other glaring omissions in the legislation, including issues of overall port capacity, competition, costs and regulation, which was highlighted in the 2005 document and to which I will return.  It is also very disappointing there was little or no consultation on important measures  including the significant mergers that are proposed in this Bill, particularly those of Cork and Bantry, and Tralee and Fenit pier, the harbour to Shannon Foynes Port Company and on the series of amendments to maritime pilotage.This Bill has been many years in gestation and then nearly ten months in legislative limbo while it worked its way through the system.  I sympathise with the loss of Deputy Noel Ahern's role as Minister of State yet, given his baffling lethargy on road safety matters, it is very strange that he did not drive this critical marine transport legislation through the Oireachtas as a matter of priority.  The Bill was launched on the Friday evening of a bank holiday weekend, a style of launching major documents to which the Minister seems attached, compared to a more democratic style where the Opposition spokesperson would have an opportunity to comment on major developments.

One of the primary objectives for this legislation is to protect the legal entity and commercial dynamic of our ports.  I therefore welcome sections 3 and 9.  Section 3 deals principally with the limits of  a company's harbour and clarifies the law on the power of the Minister to change the limits in the light of the City View Press and Mulcreevy court rulings, to which the Minister referred.  The section clearly specifies and provides absolute legal clarity on the geographical limits of the Dublin and Drogheda port companies.  I note the comments of my Fine Gael colleague, who is a representative from Drogheda.Section 9 amends section 3 of the 1996 Act and allows for the ports to have greater flexibility to borrow money.  Given the vital role of ports, it is important that we allow the port companies sufficient commercial flexibility to operate as successfully and dynamically as possible.  I therefore welcome these changes to enhance the borrowing powers of national ports, with reference to the figure of €200 million with the consent of the Minister and that 50% of the company or subsidiary assets can be treated as fixed assets.  These financial changes are also necessary for the Drogheda-Bremore development but the integration of rail freight and critical transport issues such as the long-promised outer orbital ring road, about which we have constantly asked the Minister on Question Time, are not addressed anywhere in this legislation.  It is clear that the Government must provide further policy guidelines, and perhaps even legislation, to enable the Drogheda-Bremore development to go ahead.There are also huge residential districts in Balbriggan in north Dublin and surrounding areas.  Little thought seems to have been given so far to the massive transport, environmental and other impacts of the development of Bremore port on these communities.  My colleague referred to the communities in the Meath and south Louth area, where we must also be careful in protecting residential communities.It is unquestionable that there will also be significant gains for landowners around Bremore Point as a result of planned construction at that location.  There is no indication in this Bill of any mechanism to ensure community planning gains for Drogheda or Balbriggan and their environs.  I strongly support the redevelopment of Drogheda but it is important that we protect public money and ensure that development is carried out in a sustainable and commercially viable and responsible way.  In particular, it is important we act in this manner for the thousands of residents in Balbriggan, Drogheda and the surrounding district.One critical aspect of the legislation relates to mergers and I have referred to a number of smaller mergers.  Was any consideration given at this stage to any kind of linkage or strategic coming together of the ports in Dublin and Drogheda?  Given that the economic hinterlands of the Drogheda and Dublin region already meet, in many respects, and there is a merging in activities, has the Minister given any consideration to the viewpoint sometimes expressed by people in both Dublin and Drogheda that some sort of linkage between these two ports could be a valuable development for the economy and the societies around the ports?In the previous Dáil, the marine committee under the chairmanship of Deputy Noel O'Flynn, visited Buenos Aires.  Although I did not accompany the committee representatives, they told me in their report to the committee that the Buenos Aires city port continued to develop but a further port for heavy goods had also developed further down the coast.  There seemed to be a linkage between the new port and the older city port.  Has the Department given any consideration to kinds of strategic linkages between Drogheda-Bremore and Dublin?Dublin Port is the country's premier port and one of the key economic engines of the greater Dublin region, east Leinster counties and the entire country.  In 2007, trade went over 13 million tonnes for the first time and 42% of the 90% of GDP which we export goes through Dublin Port.  Dublin Port is the second-largest industrial estate in Ireland, with 4,000 workers, and it is a very important driver of economic development for this city and region.There has been intense speculation over the past number of years about the future of Dublin Port.  Former Senator Tom Morrissey of the thankfully now extinct Progressive Democrats visualised his now discredited dream of Dublin Port being turned into "a Manhattan on the River Liffey".  There is clearly an essential need for reform of the corporate governance in our greatest port, given the litany of errors and scandals that have bedevilled the Dublin Port Company in recent years, particularly relating to sale of lands in the vital land bank of almost 600 acres.For example, there was the 2005 sale of 27 acres at Dublin Port near East Wall Road and the Point Depot to the Anna Livia consortium, which was sanctioned by the Minister without a tendering process, despite the value of the land at this time being put at a staggering€270 million.  At one stage there was a ludicrous suggestion that the new national conference centre would be built on stilts to allow ships and boats to carry on their activities underneathit.In the 2005 Irish Glass Bottle Company debacle, South Wharf plc tried to buy lands at Dublin Port and State lands for a fraction of their true value due to a loophole in the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act 1978, which Dublin Port and successive governments failed to address.  This loophole allowed tenants to create a sub-lease, whose holders could then acquire the right to buy the fee simple of the property for a multiple of only 15 times its annual rent.  This meant that South Wharf would have been able to buy that land for €20 million, just 5% of its then estimated €300 million value.The Minister remembers that we had to rush through in a couple of hours the emergency Landlord and Tenant Act on 19 May 2005.  As a result of the incompetence of the Minister and the then Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, all Irish ports were not included in the exclusions contained in the emergency legislation.  The port and harbour lands were finally included in the Maritime Safety Bill, which was passed late on the night of 21 June 2005.Given the importance of Dublin Port to the local region and national economy, Dublin's long-term future still hangs in the balance, somewhat unfairly.  Over the past two years I have forwarded a number of submissions on behalf of the Labour Party on Dublin Port to different bodies, including the Department of Transport, An Bord Pleanála and the Dublin Bay task force.  One of the worrying aspects of all these consultations and reviews is the ongoing tug-of-war between the Green Party with their leader and Minister, Deputy John Gormley, on one side and the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, on the other over the future of Dublin Port and Dublin Bay.  This ongoing tug-of-war is disastrous for the port in all its uses, both commercial and recreational.At the moment, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, is carrying out one consultation process and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, is carrying out another.  The Minister made special arrangements for a particular local election candidate in the Clontarf ward who was the chairperson of one of those consultation bodies but, unfortunately, even she got sick of the Green Party's behaviour in government and is now running as an Independent.  The Minister got no benefit for all his efforts on her behalf.Who speaks for the Government on this matter and who will make the final decision on the future of Dublin Bay and Dublin Port?  On behalf of the Labour Party and local colleagues, including Councillors Anne Carter and Aodhán Ó Ríordáin and local election candidate Brian McDowell of Raheny, I sent a strong objection to An Bord Pleanála in October 2008 on the Dublin Port Company's plan to infill 52 acres of Dublin Bay, given the serious environmental, traffic and hydrology deficiencies in the proposal, the lack of consultation with the local community, and the bypassing of normal democratic planning procedures through the use of the Strategic Infrastructure Act.  There is also the fact that Dublin Port already has so much valuable land at its disposal.In submissions to the Dublin Bay task force and the Department of Transport's sustainable Dublin Bay development consultation process, I outlined the Labour Party's vision for Dublin Bay and Dublin Port, which fully supports the core function of Dublin Port as a mercantile, commercial and economic hub of this country, as well as ensuring the maximum environmental protection for all areas of Dublin Bay and its hinterland so as to ensure the sustainable and long-term development of this unique asset.  The Minister has responsibility, as does the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, to sort out the medium and long-term vision for the development of Dublin Port and end the confusion which this Bill will in no way assist today.The Port of Cork has also made major advances in the past decade and remains one of only two Irish ports which can facilitate all five shipping methods, including lift on-lift off, roll on-roll off, liquid bulk, dry bulk and break bulk.  We heard recently a first-hand report from the board of the Port of Cork at the Oireachtas transport committee about its plans and its difficulties with developing the Ringaskiddy facilities.  It is clear that the Port of Cork also needs a sustainable future development plan while at the same time preserving the wonderful natural assets of Cork Harbour.There are many similarities between Cork and Dublin and the economic importance of both — including the 2,000 jobs in Cork — are equally significant.  As with Dublin Port, the Minister has again showed no strategic vision or leadership for the long-term sustainable development of one of our premier national ports.Some of the other great ports, including Shannon Foynes, also face major challenges.  For example, there has been a litany of alleged criminal shenanigans at Shannon Foynes Port over a number of years and the Minister should urgently investigate and report on these.A shocking article published in The Sunday Business Post on 29 March last details how an internal review carried out by Deloitte found numerous breaches of the legislation governing the sale of State lands and tendering services on the part of the Shannon Foynes Port Company.  However, further action has not been taken.  The Minister appears to believe it was sufficient to replace the chairperson and directors of the company without carrying out a more thorough investigation of the past performance of the Shannon Foynes Port Company.  I understand the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation is examining further allegations in respect of the Shannon Foynes Port Company.  In response to a citizen’s request, I have already asked Mr. Paul Appleby of the Office of Corporate Enforcement, the Committee of Public Accounts and the Joint Committee on Transport to investigate the current and previous allegations.The legislation does not refer to the port of Rosslare.  The 2005 policy review strongly suggested that the legislation which governs the status of Rosslare — which comes under the aegis of Iarnród Éireann — be modernised.  In light of the importance of Rosslare to our national transport infrastructure and to commercial and passenger traffic, why is the recommendation relating to it in the 2005 policy review not included in the legislation.  Will the Minister be bringing forward specific legislation in respect of Rosslare?There have also been significant developments at the ports of Waterford and Galway.  A number of months ago, I was privileged to meet the members of the Galway harbour board in the company Deputy Higgins, and other colleagues from the Galway West constituency.  Deputy Higgins wishes to make a number of comments on the discussions which took place at that meeting.Reports in the media have referred to possible future links between the ports of Waterford and New Ross.  Will the Minister indicate his position in respect of such reports?I welcome section 5, which establishes legislative basis for harbours to invest outside their current limits, both inside and outside the State.  Dublin Port has, for example, already been very successfully involved in ventures with other ports outside the State.  I refer, in particular, to ports in Indonesia in this regard.  Given  the  outstanding  track  record  of other commercial and semi-State companies such as ESB International, ESBI, in overseas ventures, investment of this nature by the national ports — as publicly owned semi-State bodies — should be encouraged.  However, it is vital that a clear statutory basis be established in this regard and that is what is being done in the Bill.Sections 6 and 7 make amendments to the method through which ports can sell, lease and acquire land and propose to transfer certain ministerial functions in this regard to An Bord Pleanála.  I have already referred to some of the serious problems that have arisen in this regard in the past.  What is proposed is a political measure aimed at passing the buck away from the Minister and using An Bord Pleanála as a mudguard to avoid his being damaged by any difficult political fallout which might occur.  Were these sections partly inspired by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, who has shamefully discarded a long series of commitments to his constituents in Dublin South East in respect of the proposed incinerator and who does want to be obliged to take any decisions that may cause him any further local difficulties?As already stated, major changes are proposed in respect of the governance and board structure of our ports.  I welcome the provision in section 10 which stipulates that each port must provide a statement to the Minister on an annual basis.  However, I have grave difficulties with sections 8 and 11, which provide for the deletion of the automatic nomination of local authority directors and will, regardless of the size of the port, confine the number of worker directors to one.  There has rightly been major opposition from Labour and other councillors throughout the country in respect of this matter.  I was delighted to meet representatives of the General Council of County Councils to discuss this matter.  The basic point they made is that the track of councillors on port boards is impressive.  Councillors have served on such boards with great distinction for many years.  They argue that any deficiencies which may have arisen were not caused by the presence of democratically elected local representatives.While suggesting a reduction in the number of local authority members on the boards of ports, the Government's 2005 policy statement did not propose such a draconian abolition of all statutory representation on the part of county councillors.  This appears to be another milestone in the political career of the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, who has again taken an extreme approach in respect of a suggestion put forward.  We will be obliged to pay back the €60 million relating to the electronic voting machines he commissioned over a long period.  The latter episode represents perhaps the high point of his disastrous performance in ministerial office.The Minister has claimed that he will appoint a local councillor to the board.  Why abolish the statutory provision which connects the structures of governance and local democracy?  As already stated, ports have a unique relationship with their hinterlands and it would seem reasonable to ensure that people would be represented on their local port boards.  The Minister may argue that a similar mechanism should be used in respect of airports and other similar semi-State enterprises.  I agree that this should be the case.  There could be local representation on airports that have a profound impact on local areas.  What could be better than including locally elected representatives — the next generation of whom are due to be elected in four weeks' time — on the boards of such enterprises?It is clear this measure will result in an increase in the number of ministerial protégés and stooges appointed to the boards of ports.  When contributing to the Second Stage debate on the Bill in the Seanad, the former Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, stated:. . . a performance audit of the companies in 2001-02, undertaken by Jonathan Packer, recommended that the statutory provision for local authority directors be abolished.  The 2003 high-level review of the State commercial ports concurred with this recommendation and concluded that the practise of appointing port users, local councillors and those without relevant experience should cease.However, it appears that one needs few maritime qualifications to be appointed to the board of a port by the Minister.  The only qualification one needs to be appointed to the board of the Shannon Foynes Port Company is membership of the local Fianna Fáil cumann.  Our ports are too important to be used for political patronage and to provide jobs for friends and supporters of Fianna Fáil.  Under section 3 and the new harbour limits, Dublin Port will now clearly come within the remit of three local authorities, namely, Fingal County Council Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and Dublin City Council.The measures in section 11 to slash the number of worker directors on port boards from two to one is one of the most reprehensible and retrograde elements of this legislation.  The suspicion remains that the decimation of the representation of councillors and worker directors on the boards of ports is being done to facilitate an easier path for the Government's ultimate objective, namely, the privatisation of our ports.  As a number of their representatives strongly argued last year, worker directors have made an overwhelmingly positive contribution to the development of the commercial State-owned ports since the introduction of the Harbours Act 1996.  Worker directors tend to be people who have a deep and profound knowledge of the ports at which they work and who are overwhelmingly committed to maximising the development and potential thereof.  Worker directors also have a sound track record in the context of supporting the commercial and overseas roles of our ports.  The timing of this measure is very disturbing, particularly in view of the fact that many ports, including Dublin, Cork, Drogheda-Bremore and Greenore, are all in the midst of major expansion.Worker directors are also obliged to take part in the democratic process and are elected by their colleagues.  I do not, therefore, understand the logic of reducing the number of worker directors on the large port boards.I have always been a strong supporter of business models under which workers have a strong role.  I refer here to companies that are run by their own workers.  One example in this regard is the John Lewis Partnership, which has been enormously successful and which has 70,000 employees.  I do not understand why the Minister is proceeding with the proposal to reduce worker director representation.I generally agree with the provision in section 11 relating to the removal of port users as a result of possible conflicts of interest.  However, why does the Bill allow chief executives and managers to remain on port boards?  The stipulation that there must be a maximum of eight directors on the board of a port is surprising.  One could extend the logic of this provision to the Government itself and ask why it is necessary to have 15 Ministers or 15 Ministers of State.  If the Minister really wishes to reduce the number of board members, he should reduce the number of those he is empowered to appoint.  I intend to introduce a series of amendments in respect of this matter.  The Minister should move urgently and reconsider that, both in terms of councillors and workers.It is bizarre that there has been so many errors regarding the sale of lands at Dublin Port and the allegations about Shannon Foynes when the 2005 ports policy estimates an astonishing capacity shortfall of 12.2 million tonnes by 2014 across all the ports.  According to the ESRI we are in an economic depression.  We have left the recession and entered a depression, with a 10% fall in GDP, but there will be recovery, as always happens in an economic cycle, and I hope that will take place under a new Government.We need to re-examine capacity issues, which are not mentioned at all.  One must ask the reason for the attempted sell-off of lands in Dublin and Shannon when we knew there were capacity problems.  In addition to the necessity to examine the capacity issues, there are other matters in the 2005 report which are ignored in the Bill, for example, the question of competition between and within the ports.  The Minister, in his reply, might report on the operation of the EU directive on market access to port services and whether any further studies have been commissioned on competition issues, as recommended by the 2005 ports policy.There was a critical discussion about port regulation in the 2005 document but no fundamental answer was given on that.  I again ask the Minister whether he intends to appoint a port regulator, based either inside or outside the Department, given the appalling track record of this Government in regulating other sectors including finance, planning, construction and housing.  The Minister must urgently provide a full account on port regulation and outline the reason he has ignored all of those important issues that arose in his own report in 2005.I will refer briefly to some other questionable aspects of the Bill, in particular sections 12 to 16.  The Minister is aware that many maritime pilots are concerned that the amendments to the pilot exemption certificates being proposed in section 15 amount to the outsourcing of pilotage services and would facilitate inexperienced and novice officers taking a key role in navigating vessels in and out of Irish ports.  I am aware the Minister has had some discussions with the pilots but it is an issue on which he might report to us.The Irish Maritime Development Office is an important planning body in the maritime area.  Is the Minister planning any legislation in that regard?  I ask him to give the House an update on the Irish shipping register.In general terms I welcome some aspects of the Bill but I intend bringing forward a number of critical amendments, particularly on the representation of employees and local councillors.  I ask the Minister to re-examine that area.  I hope the Bill will not be used as a vehicle to privatise critical port assets.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	231	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this important legislation.  This Bill is necessary, as the Minister has identified, to ensure that our port companies are allowed to develop in a commercial manner, recognising the strategic importance of our ports to an island nation such as ours.  The Bill is also necessary to give effect to certain aspects of Government policy set out in the ports policy statement launched in January 2005.  It complements the original ethos given to the ten port companies by the Harbours Act of 1996 and deals with the objectives of that Bill in the following manner.The Harbours Act of 1996 provides for port companies to have regard to any relevant Government policy or guidelines on the acquisition of land.  It is considered appropriate, in the interests of consistency and best practice, that this provision should apply only to the disposal of land by such companies.  It is clear that the provision for the transfer of functions from the Minister for Transport to An Bord Pleanála, in the context of the compulsory acquisition of land by port companies, is important.  It is necessary that a statutory agency like An Bord Pleanála is seen as somewhat more independent than assigning it to the political head of a Department, and for that reason I welcome that decision.There was much discussion by a number of speakers on the provisions in the Bill which set forth to alter the provisions of the membership of the boards.  It is welcome that the size of the boards will be reduced from 12 to eight.  Those of us on this side of the House are regularly lectured by the Members on the opposite side about the necessity to control the size of Government, control public spending, increase efficiencies and reduce the unnecessary burden of members of various boards.  Some refer to important State boards as quangos, a term I reject, in regard to much of the good work done by State agencies.  It is important that we identify areas where savings can be made.  In a modern environment it is important that we bring efficiencies to such entities as the boards of these harbours, put in place a rationalised approach and deal with unnecessary duplication where that occurs.  It is important to have all the relevant stakeholders involved in decision making and setting out the corporate policy of the various boards but there is not a necessity to have unnecessary duplication of representation.  For that reason it is sensible to reduce the size of the board to eight as it will be more efficient.We are all members of various committees in our constituencies and of working or policy groups and committees of this House and it is often the case that the larger the committee the greater the talking shop it becomes.  I am a great believer in the notion of efficiency and brevity, keeping the board to a workable size and ensuring it has the broadest level of representation, while at the same time not overburdening the running of the company.  For that reason, this provision is a sensible one.The Minister's decision in regard to dealing with the local authority component is sensible.  In earlier conversations and in other legislation that has come before this House there was an effort to exclude people from various State boards simply because they were members of local authorities.  That would be a retrograde step were it to be allowed to continue.  I recall objecting strenuously to a number of items of legislation coming before the Seanad where I served prior to entering this House.There are some very talented people seeking public office at local authority level who have a great deal of knowledge, understanding and ability which they can bring to boards such as the harbour boards and for that reason it is important they would not be excluded by statute.  The Minister has indicated that it is his desire to appoint a county councillor representative on the various boards and that an individual will not be excluded simply because he or she is a member of a local authority.  That is welcome.There is no necessity to have more than one county councillor represented on the boards.  A councillor will bring a unique insight to the board from a local authority perspective but there is no necessity to have it on territorial grounds.  I speak with some knowledge of the Shannon Foynes board.There are and have been some fine members of local authorities who have represented the overall local authority structure on those boards extremely well but the same insight will be brought by more than one representative if the Minister so wishes.  The same applies to worker-directors.  That is not to take from the outstanding input we have had from worker-directors and county councillors but there is a level of duplication in having more than one.  Their unique insight and understanding of the workings of the port, particularly from a worker-director's perspective, is brought to the table but having two, three, four or five representatives is unnecessary duplication and may not be conducive to the smooth working of an efficient and appropriately sized board.  For that reason the proposals as set out are the most appropriate.There are also important provisions for a clear legislative basis to underpin investment by port companies outside their current harbour limits.  Deputy Broughan rightly identified Dublin Port's investment in Malaysia.  I am familiar with a number of executives of that company and I have spoken to them in the past about their vision for Dublin Port.  The move the company has made is a particularly bold one.  It is the right move and we are making the right connections in that area of the world by linking with Malaysia.  I just wish that more port companies had taken the same aggressive approach to development and a much broader view than merely being seen as managers of a facility.  For that reason Mr. Connellon, as the chief executive of the company, and people like Mr. Kevin O'Driscoll and others, together with the current chairman, and, indeed, the previous chairman, Mr. Burke, played an active role in broadening the base and, obviously, increasing the capacity of Dublin Port to continue to evolve and develop for many decades to come.Such a strategic approach is perhaps lacking in some of the other State agencies.  There has been almost a comfort zone in some State agencies on the basis that they were just managers there to respect Government policy rather than to take the bull by the horns or to take the ball and drive forward.  That commercial ethos, as recognised by those executives in Dublin Port, is something I want to see emanate from the others.  That is not to suggest that the other port companies have not made good efforts in their own regard.  They certainly have, but we need to ensure that it is expedited.The board representation is vitally important.  There has been a suggestion by Deputies on the other side of the House that the Government would use the opportunity to stuff the board with members of parties on this side of the House.  If one goes through many of the State boards, one will see little, if any, of that approach.  People are appointed for their ability, understanding, knowledge and capacity to discharge the duties as set out in legislation governing the various companies.  Many give freely of their time.  The remuneration these people receive for membership of State boards is small by comparison to the time they put in.  These are people from various backgrounds who give substantially of their time for the greater benefit of the State.  They receive little remuneration and, obviously, it is costly in terms of loss of input into their own companies or lives.  Often they receive a level of criticism from the media because of the work they do.  That is somewhat regrettable but, nonetheless, there are people prepared to take on the task.Members on all sides will be aware that it is often difficult now to get people to serve on State boards because of what they see as the level of nuisance associated with it, and that there is no real gain or benefit to them.  However, they then obviously attract unhelpful press from time to time for which they do not see the benefit.

#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	237	We owe them a great debt of gratitude.  It behoves all of us on whatever side of the House, regardless of the voting intentions of persons on State boards, not to seek to undermine their work and input on behalf of the State.The important aspect of the Bill is to ensure that the commercial ethos to which I referred develops.  Of the various ports, the port with which I am most familiar is the Shannon Foynes Port Company where there is considerable potential for development.  Notwithstanding the recent difficulties which the Minster referred to and which have been alluded to by others, the potential for development in and around that port is great.  It is a particularly deep port that has not been utilised to the fullest extent possible.  There is great potential in the future and this is clear because of the current economic situation in which we find ourselves.  It is often difficult for some to understand why we should be making provisions for increased activity or usage.  However, as Deputy Tommy Broughan stated, our current economic situation is very much part of the cyclical approach to the economy and I have no doubt that over time it will emerge again.  It is important that we are putting in place the foundations and the legislative framework to allow these companies to seek and develop that commercial mandate.On the Shannon Foynes Port Company, there is great potential usage not only from a freight perspective, but also from tourism which has largely been unexploited.  There is an opportunity to develop a much greater working relationship between the Shannon Foynes Port Company and Shannon Airport.  The two, working together, could put in place the necessary infrastructure to allow the mid-west region to be seen as a hub for the distribution of cargo.Up until recently a significant amount of freight has emanated from Asia, particularly from China, and entered both Europe and the United States.  There is, in my view, potential for the Shannon Foynes Port Company to provide a significant resource to accept the freight inwards from Asia and be part of breaking down the cargo, either for onward shipping to Europe or the United States or, more particularly, for onward air transfer using Shannon Airport.  There is the potential to develop a significant hub in the region and that will require vision.  It will require the involvement of the various stakeholders.  I would hope that over time the passage of this legislation will allow the board of that port to work with the Shannon Airport Authority on how the significant infrastructure of the port can be best utilised not just to generate business, but also to reach the tourism potential of the region.As I stated, it is a deep port.  Its access to the west and the mid-west could provide a useful base for the further development of tourism.  Over the past number of years Dublin has seen a significant growth in the number of visits by various cruise liners.  There is no reason the west coast, and the facilities it provides through Limerick and Ennis, and, indeed, further south into Kerry, could not be appropriate locations to provide the various requirements of people who travel on cruise liners.  The fact that the region includes the Cliffs of Moher, one of the finest tourism spectacles anywhere in the world, would make it an attractive offering to people who use these cruise liners or travel on such holidays.  It is an area which needs to be exploited.However, that will only come about if we can put in place the necessary incentives to allow the boards of directors of the various harbours to think outside the box in a way which enables them to develop their businesses along commercial lines and not see themselves as merely operators and stevedores, and also to develop a much greater level of commercialism.  In doing so, Shannon Foynes Port Company can become part of another stated Government policy, that of balanced regional development.  While there has been considerable investment in infrastructure in recent years, particularly in roads and rail infrastructure, the Minister has also played a major role, together with the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív, in the reopening of the western rail corridor.  This is another significant piece of infrastructure which could go hand-in-hand with the development of the Shannon Foynes Port Company and that type of approach has the capacity to allow the mid-west and west to act as a counter balance to the east coast.  It would also assist in achieving greater balance of development across the country, taking away some of the pressures on the east coast's port infrastructure.  It would put in place a necklace of critical infrastructure on the west coast, allowing the region to develop.  This would also assist in the country's social and infrastructure development becoming more balanced and cohesive.  The Bill is important in addressing these issues.It is important the port companies work together.  Although the Minister referred to competition, it must be noted that the island is relatively small and we must ensure the ports co-operate with each other.  I am interested in the make-up of the port boards.  Many of those on the boards have done sterling work in developing various ports.  It is important that we continue to appoint the right people.  It is their qualities and standards that will develop the ports.I welcome the Bill's changes to pilotage districts and charges which were necessary for some time.  This will facilitate the successful completion of proposals to other investments in the port companies outside of their existing harbour limits and outside of the State.  The tie-up of various harbours with ones outside of the State has the potential to develop a much greater level of business than before.  It was good to see Dublin Port's approach to this and I hope others will follow suit.  Through these strategic partnerships, they can make various different contacts to develop ports.Will the Minister examine a proposal from the Institute of Engineers in Ireland in its blueprint, Looking Towards 2030, to build a bridge from Shannon Foynes Port to Shannon Airport.  It is appropriate to give such large scale projects consideration in these economic times, when we are seeking various initiatives to stimulate economic growth and to reduce costs in the economy.  They have several benefits, creating jobs and providing infrastructure for future development.  A development of this nature between Shannon Foynes Port and Shannon Airport could develop a significant hub for freight and tourism.I hope the Bill will have a safe passage through the House.
#PJSheenan	unknown-#PJSheenan-party	unknown-#PJSheenan-dob	unknown-#PJSheenan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	238	I do not have any problems with many of the provisions of the Harbours (Amendment) Bill 2009.  However, I must speak out on behalf of the people of Bantry, south-west Cork and south Kerry, and their right to own and operate their own harbour board.  Section 18, in a cursory manner, dismisses the Bantry Bay harbour commissioners with a sleight of hand.  I speak with an inner knowledge of this harbour board having had the honour to serve on it for more than 20 years following its formation by the then Minister for Transport and Power, Mr. Peter Barry, in the Harbours Act 1976.  I attended each of its monthly meeting religiously.  No member claimed expenses then but it is a different situation now.Peter Barry, a public representative of distinction from Cork city, had the insight and vision to see its importance to the locality.  He ensured the local population and businesses were involved in the ownership and running of Bantry Harbour.  Local commercial and industrial sectors each had two members on the board while Cork County Council had two representatives.  Two other representatives were ministerial appointments.The advantages of Bantry as a harbour were first recorded from the sea by a French trading vessel in 1253.  Bantry Bay is located in the south-west corner of Ireland.  The bay runs approximately 35 km from north east to south west into the Atlantic Ocean.  It is approximately 4 km wide at the head and 10 km wide at the entrance.  The bay is a deep, approximately 40 m in the middle, and large natural harbour with one of the longest inlets in south-west Ireland.  It is bordered on the north by Beara Peninsula, separating it from Kenmare Bay.  Its southern boundary, Sheep's Head Peninsula, separates it from Dunmanus Bay.The main islands on the bay are Bere and Whiddy.  Prior to the start of World War I, the British admiralty boasted that Bantry Bay had the capacity to hold the entire British fleet.  Whiddy Island, which is located half way down the bay near its southern shore, is Ireland's main petroleum terminal.  The harbour is ideally suited to large ocean going tankers.  The biggest tanker afloat docked at Whiddy Island and unloaded its cargo.  No other harbour in the world has the capacity of Bantry Bay or the capability of its harbour authority.  It is important the authority remains in operation.  ConocoPhillips maintains a single point mooring at the Whiddy Island oil terminal.I guarantee the House that Bantry Bay is no pond.  Its entrances do not need dredging, although the inner bay around Bantry town needs to be dredged.  A promise was made many moons ago on dredging but was never met.  Bantry harbour is sound commercially and financially.  It is not a burden on the State and, indeed, contributes its rightful share of taxes.  This was recognised by a previous Fianna Fáil Government when it gave a solemn commitment in the week preceding the 2002 general election to invest £9 million to extend the pier and dredge the inner harbour.  It was no joke to face that kind of promise one week before an election but it was yet another unfulfilled commitment.  The harbour authority is a self-supporting and viable body which enjoys a sound turnover.We have seen the effects of this Government's previous decisions to amalgamate small local and democratic bodies into autonomous organisations.  Do we want another disaster like the HSE when we replace our small harbour boards with two or three huge authorities?  This is an unwise decision and I advise the Minister to reconsider because otherwise we will be forced to submit amendments.  This type of thinking has passed its sell-by date and we need to go back to the drawing board.  The Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners were put in place following the 1976Betelgeuse disaster.  The explosion of the Betelgeuse tanker caused the loss of a number of lives and inflicted significant damage to the harbour’s jetty.  The Minister should examine the recommendations of the Costello inquiry before he even dreams about abolishing the Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners.  I want the commissioners to be retained as an autonomous authority in view of their capabilities and potential for future generations who will live in south-west Cork and south Kerry.Does a conflict of interest arise in that oil terminals are located in both Cork and Bantry harbours?  If investment is needed will the new board based in Cork invest in Whitegate or Whiddy?The arrival in Galway at the end of this month of the round the world yacht race is expected to bring millions of euro to the western region.  I understand that more than 100 harbours around the world are bidding to host the race when it is next held.  Bantry harbour would be ideally suited to hosting this international event, which could bring significant benefits to a tourism starved area of south-west Cork.  Cork Harbour rather than Bantry Harbour will make the bid if the harbour authorities are amalgamated.Section 18 of the Harbours (Amendment) Bill 2008 states:(1) The Principal Act is amended by inserting the following section after section 87:"87A. — (1) In this section—‘relevant harbour commissioners' means—(a) in relation to the Port of Cork Company, Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners, and(b) in relation to the Shannon Foynes Port Company, Tralee and Fenit Pier and Harbour Commissioners;‘relevant port company' means—(a) in relation to Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners, the Port of Cork Company, and(b) in relation to Tralee and Fenit Pier and Harbour Commissioners, the Shannon Foynes Port Company;‘transfer day' means the day appointed by the Minister under paragraph (a) or (b) of subsection (2).(2) (a) The Minister may, subject to paragraph (c) and after consultation with Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners, the Port of Cork Company and such other persons (if any) as the Minister considers it appropriate in the circumstances to consult, by order appoint a day as the transfer day for the purposes of this section in respect of Bantry Bay Harbour and, with effect from that day, the Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners are dissolved.This is incorporated in this Bill, which was passed by Seanad Éireann.  It copperfastens the Minister's authority to proceed and transfer the responsibilities of Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners to the Cork harbour board.  The section contains many hidden agendas but the transfer is a  fait accompli.An Oireachtas Member boasted that the insertion of the provision would underpin the principle of Bantry harbour authority operating as an independent authority.  There is no reference to an independent authority in the legislation nor is there evidence of preserving the rights of Bantry harbour to have its own board, as it has had since 1976.  The Member to whom I refer filibustered for seven hours in the Seanad and nothing resulting from his actions is incorporated in this section.  Bantry's opportunities will be denied again.As Bantry is 220 miles from Dublin, it is 220 times harder to create a job there.  The public consultation process provided for in this section is a complete joke.  Not alone is it not worth the paper on which it is written, it is not worth the paper that will be wasted going through this process.  It took an Oireachtas Member five days of stonewalling and filibustering to have this worthless amendment accepted but he wasted his own and the Seanad's time, and he is fooling nobody.I will table a number of amendments on Committee Stage to secure the independence of Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners.  The Bill has been described as a further nail in the coffin of Bantry harbour authority but, if the Bill is passed, the Minister will allow the harbour to silt up through neglect, lack of investment and the abandonment of the people of south west Cork.Tourism is a major asset in west Cork.  In the past, passengers on international cruise liners would disembark at Glengarriff in Bantry Bay.  Let us hope the day is not too far away when the same will happen again and such liners will not have to visit a port that does not have its own independent authority.  We cannot live on fresh air and cold water in west Cork but we can live if we are given the right and opportunity to do so.  The Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners must be retained.  I will table amendments on Committee Stage.
#CharlieOConnorFF	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-party	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-dob	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	239	I wish to share time with Deputy Blaney.I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  It is always a demanding exercise to follow the previous speaker on any subject, but my knowledge of Bantry Bay and Cork Port is not as strong as his.  It is a long time since I visited the area but I recall looking at the wonderful natural beauty of Crosshaven from Camden Fort.  In three years we will commemorate the terrible tragedy of the sinking of the Titanic, which sailed from Cork harbour.When I told other Members I was contributing to this debate, they wondered what I might have to say about Tallaght.  However, when I contributed to the debate on the fisheries Bill, I reminded the House that I eat fish.  I visit harbours and it is important to take an interest in these issues.  We should not be categorised and I do not claim to be an expert on anything but I have an interest in the natural beauty of our country.I refer to a link I can make to Tallaght.  The Square opened there 19 years ago and one of the initiatives management took over the years to attract visitors from the UK and, in particular, Wales was to promote the Stena Line ferry crossing between Holyhead and Dún Laoighaire, with passengers being transported to Tallaght through the city by bus.  In these bleak and challenging economic times, we should be innovative as much as possible in job creation.  If jobs can be created in tourism and related industries, we should do that.  The lack of a second Stena Line daily sailing is an issue in my constituency and this could be examined and highlighted in the context of the Bill.  I expect my colleagues, the Minister, Deupty Mary Hanafin, and the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, would want us all to support that.  I hope Members will do so, as it is of concern and interest to people in my constituency.The Bill is considered necessary to give effect to aspects of the Government's policy set out in the ports policy statement launched in January 2005.  It complements the commercial ethos given to the ten port companies by the Harbours Act 1996.  Among the principal objectives of the Bill is the provision for the transfer of functions from the Minister for Transport to An Bord Pleanála in the context of the compulsory acquisition of land by port companies.  The Harbours Act 1996 provides that port companies have regard to any relevant Government policy or guidelines on the acquisition of land.  It is considered appropriate in the interests of consistency and best practice that the provision should apply also to the disposal of land by such companies.  The number of directors on a port company board is being reduced from 12 to eight.  The statutory representation of local authority directors on boards will cease and the number of employee directors will be set at one per company.  It is also proposed to cease the practice of appointing port users to port company boards to avoid any potential conflicts of interest.  I suspect that change will be welcomed.The Attorney General has advised that there are not sufficient principles and policies in the 1996 Act to allow for future alteration of the harbour limits.  An amendment is considered necessary to address that issue.  The Bill makes provision for a clear legislative basis to underpin investment by port companies outside the current harbour limits.  The amendment is considered necessary to facilitate the development and successful completion of proposals relating to investment by port companies outside existing harbour limits and outside the State.The provision for widening the borrowing powers of certain companies to facilitate port capacity expansion is also included.  The Bill also amends a number of provisions relating to pilotage.  It also introduces an enabling provision to allow for the potential transfer of Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners and Tralee and Fenit Pier and Harbour Commissioners to relevant port company control in line with the Government's ports policy statement.  I already made reference to Deputy Sheehan so I will not rise him any further.  He has expressed views on the latter issue and I expect the Minister will take account of that.I should have said at the outset that I welcome the attendance in the Chamber of the new Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Áine Brady.  She is a former neighbour on my corridor.  I wish her well.  Her appointment is a progressive one and I hope she does well.

If my colleagues want me to make a speech about Tallaght I could rise to that.  Tallaght is a great place.  It is the third largest population centre in the country and it has great facilities it never had previously.  I only wish we had the capacity to have a harbour facility.  Deputy Blaney suggested to me earlier that perhaps we could find space in Tallaght for another lake close to Blessington and perhaps we could have a little harbour there.I wish the Minister well with the Bill.  Colleagues around the House have a great interest in the matter.  It is good we are discussing it.  Everybody in the House should have an interest in all legislation.  Just because there is no harbour in our constituencies does not mean we are not interested or that we do not have strong views and are not prepared to make those views known.  I will continue to do that.  I look forward to supporting the Bill.

I have no doubt she will do well in her portfolio.  I look forward to working with her.  It was mooted on the corridor this morning that there was a new man-made lake on the way for Tallaght along with a new harbour if Deputy O'Connor spoke on the Bill.  Time will tell whether that is true.I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  It is worthwhile acknowledging the contribution harbours have made to the success of the State in recent years.  The Bill enhances the commercial ethos conferred on ports by the Harbours Act 1996.  The Bill is necessary to give effect to certain aspects of Government policy, as set out in the ports policy statement launched in January 2005.The principal objectives have been outlined by the Minister, namely, to introduce the enabling provision to allow for the potential transfer of Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners and Tralee and Fenit Pier and Harbour Commissioners to port body control in line with the Government's ports policy statement.  There is also provision to widen the borrowing powers of port companies to facilitate port capacity expansion and to amend a number of provisions relating to pilotage.The Attorney General gave advice on insufficient principles and policies in the 1996 Act to allow for future alteration of the harbour limits.  An amendment was deemed necessary to address that issue.  There is also provision for a clear legislative basis to underpin the investment by port companies outside their current harbour limits.  That amendment is considered necessary to facilitate the development and successful completion of proposals relating to investment by port companies outside existing harbour limits, and outside the State.The Minister is also transferring powers to An Bord Pleanála in the context of the compulsory acquisition of land by port companies.  The Harbours Act 1996 provides for port companies to have regard to any relevant Government policy or guidance on the acquisition of land, as considered appropriate.  In the interests of consistency and best practice that provision should apply also to the disposal of land by such companies.The Harbours Act 1996 provides for the boards of port companies to consist of 12 members, comprising three directors appointed on the nomination of the relevant local authority, one or two employee directors, depending on the size of the company, either directly elected by employees or appointed by the Minister to represent employee interests.  The chief executive officer and the remaining directors were to be appointed at the discretion of the Minister.The amendment proposes to change the number of directors on the port company boards from 12 to eight.  That is a necessary and welcome change.  The statutory representation of local authority directors on boards will cease and the number of employee directors will be set at one per company.  In addition, it is proposed to cease the practice of appointing port users to port company boards to avoid any potential conflicts of interest.It is worth noting the amount of money that has been spent on piers and harbours in recent years.  Much development work has been done and I would like to put a few items on the record, as these issues do not arise very often in the House.  I refer specifically to a number of piers and harbours in my own constituency in Donegal.We have a pier in Rathmullan that is one of the deepest sea ports in the country, but that pier is currently in a very poor state, and heretofore was never a funding priority.  While I know that times are tight at the moment, it now is a priority with Donegal County Council.  When we are in such a position to provide funding for piers and harbours again, this pier should be made a priority.  While Killybegs at the other end of the county is a very important pier and harbour for Donegal and the country as a whole, much of the trade there comes through Rathmullan.  However, in its current state, Rathmullan cannot do the business of which it is capable.  If we got the required funding to upgrade the pier — currently estimated at €2.4 million, but it could be less if it was reviewed in a few months — then it would add greatly to the area by way of jobs and activity on the pier.There have also been developments in recent years on ferry services in my constituency that link us with Derry, particularly the Greencastle to Magilligancar ferry.  While it has been up and running for a number of years, finance is an issue just as it is with so many other things recently.  As it is a cross-Border ferry, there are security issues involved which mean it costs much more to run than is deemed necessary.  In light of the peace process and developments in Northern Ireland, there needs to be a review between the Minister for Transport and his Northern Ireland counterpart regarding security on this ferry service.  At present, the service is in doubt and if this issue was addressed it would continue for some time to come.I again welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  It will enhance our piers and harbours and the commercial traffic in the harbours, and I commend the Bill to the House.
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	259	Like most speakers in the House, I welcome the general thrust of this Bill.  It seeks to allow port companies to invest, develop and expand to their maximum potential in a range of ways which allow them go outside their own areas.  The harbour limits enhance their ability to borrow and develop.  However, there are a few fundamental amendments tacked onto the Bill which are certainly a cause of concern, including the amendment that seeks to reduce the number of members from 12 to eight.  While I would agree with that in principle, it would be better if there was an odd number for the purposes of achieving vote results.  By allowing the Minister appoint the members from the local authority, it bypasses the role of the authority.  Any local authority that is properly elected should be in a position to nominate its own members.  It would be preferable if there were two members from each party.  That is a personal opinion, but I believe it is important.I am not sure about the role of section 20, which amends the Irish Maritime Development Office of the Marine Institute, and which substitutes the "Minister for Transport" with "the Minister".  Does that mean that some other Minister at some stage may be responsible?  While it is commendable that the Minister for Transport is the initiator of this Bill, we still should have a full Cabinet position for a Minister for the Marine.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	260	Hear, hear.
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	261	There are currently nine different Departments with a toe in the marine sector.  It is not the best way to run that sector.  Deputy Dooley spoke about critical infrastructure and mentioned a bridge.  When he went over his time allocation, I thought he had strayed over to speak on behalf of the Opposition, as that is what we have been saying for so long.Like every other Deputy, I must focus on amendment No. 17, which will have major implications for the future development of Arklow Port.  Why is this amendment being included to address the situation directly at Arklow?  It is basically because there is not enough commercial activity taking place, which justifies the downgrading of the port.  Will the Government let an ancient thriving port go to the wall, purely due to a lack of interest?  It is true that the level of activity has decreased, and the RNLI lifeboat has had to move from one side of the pier to the other because there is sand silted in the harbour that does not allow it get in and out safely.  This is an example of inertia and an unwillingness to address a critical piece of infrastructure for the marine sector, as it has been left there to hang for so long.The dredging of the harbour has been held up for ten years, while the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government determines how to dispose the contaminants from the mine further up the Avoca River.  Commercial traffic involving fishing, the fertiliser business, marine transport and boat building have all but ceased for one reason or another.  The ancient tradition of fishing out of Arklow has been gutted by reductions in quotas for east coast boats.  Tyrells boat builders operated since the last century and built the recently ill fated Asgard  in 1981, and this represented a tradition and expertise that is being lost.  Arklow Shipping, a very successful shipping company, is now based in Holland, even though it still has an office in Arklow.The marine tradition in Arklow still lives on.  The commissioners have been developing the harbour and docks for the 21st century, including facilities for marine leisure and support facilities for the new wind farm on the Arklow bank, which is expected to grow when access to the grid is accommodated and newer wind turbines become available.  The new low VAT rates for shipping companies is a positive incentive for investment.Why is there no commercial traffic through the port?  There has been a ten year delay in the dredging programme due to new disposal rules that have resulted in part of the harbour being silted.  Port business had to be turned away, so it is not that it is not available.  Negotiations with the Marine Institute are at an advanced stage and we hope that a new licence to dredge is soon to be issued.  The last time it was issued was August 1986 when Hurricane Charlie cleaned it out.  Another hurricane like that would take care of the problem.A 16 year court case concerning the siting of a new sewage works for the town has resulted in development programmes and inward investment being stalled.  This matter remains unresolved and on appeal to the Supreme Court.  While I appreciate it commenced prior to the enactment of the Critical Infrastructure Act 2006, it being in limbo means Arklow remains in limbo until such time as the matter is sorted out.What is needed is not, as provided in section 17, the transfer of the harbour commissioners to the local authority — a local authority already strapped for cash and that does not have the wherewithal, interest or money to come up with a plan to redevelop that port — but a ten year plan for development; investment incentives for port and marine services; port and quay access road improvement; an annual dredging programme; and a water treatment plant.  A question arises as to why this port has not been designated a commercial port.The Government is silent on small port management, coastal zone management of recreational activities and other marine activities despite the great potential of every coastal region and harbour to provide economic activity and jobs.  I say this in light of the fact that Arklow is perhaps the blackest spot in Wicklow in terms of unemployment, with long-term companies such as Allergan, the IFI and AirGas having left the region.  Arklow has great potential.  There have been mootings from Cement Roadstone Holdings, CRH, that it is interested in developing the port facilities in Arklow.  This would allow the existing port to once again become a fishing and tourist port and a services port for the windfarm project.  Why is this not happening?  I referred earlier to inertia.The last move by Minister of State, Deputy Tony Killeen, was the establishment of a co-ordinating group which included the Departments of Transport; Agriculture, Fisheries and Food; Communications, Energy and Natural Resources; Enterprise, Trade and Employment; Defence; the Environment, Heritage and Local Government; Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs; Arts, Sports and Tourism; and the Taoiseach.  We are a country surrounded by water whose first occupants came here by boat.  Why is it that nine Departments are required to determine what is best for our ports and harbours?  There is no Department or Minister responsible for co-ordinating Government policy on the management of the marine sector despite the coast and oceans being one of Ireland's key natural resources amounting to 220 million acres.The Marine Institute headquarters in Galway — Deputy Ciarán Cuffe will be aware of this — has on display in its offices a real map of Ireland on which it is difficult to determine the land mass, approximately 97% of which is considered a resource covered by water.  We have some of the greatest potential to monitor future trends in climate, in ocean current and weather changes.  Also, we have the greatest potential — I have stated this in other contexts — to develop sustainable renewable ocean, wind and tidal energy around the coast of the country, yet no Department has overall responsibility for this matter.  Instead, the matter is left to nine Departments that must come up with a plan that suits everybody and works for nobody.I appeal to the Government, whenever the next reshuffle takes place, to create a full Ministry for the marine, which we had before and which was effective.  This requires political will.  The Government appears unwilling to take the lead on marine affairs and is content to let the political will drown in multi-departmental co-ordinated talk shops.  The Department of Transport is willing to let Arklow port go without a fight despite the fact that the port has the best potential for economic development in the region.  Tasks forces are to be set up everywhere jobs are lost.  It would be more beneficial if audits were undertaken of the potential for job creation in these regions, taking into account what we have by way of natural resources.I will be opposing section 17 which proposes to allow the Arklow harbour commissioners to be transferred to Wicklow County Council.  I appeal to the Minister to respond positively on this matter.  I hope the Minister will see merit in my argument, thus meaning I will not have to table an amendment in this regard.  Rationalisation is fine, but rationalisation which seeks to transfer the remit of one authority to another, a move that will sound its death knell and destroy any chance it has of creating employment, is not forward thinking.  It is not the type of thinking we need in the current economic climate.  We have the potential to develop places like Arklow harbour and port.As I stated earlier, Airtricity's windfarm at Arklow Bank is to be developed and will require servicing and a host port.  The nearest port by far is Arklow harbour.  The Arklow life boat plays a critical role and function in this area.  It is one of the busiest sea lanes along the Irish Channel.  I ask that the Minister reconsider any proposals to downgrade this critical port.The Bill, as passed by the Seanad states: ". . . to carry out policy, as may be specified by that Minister, . . .".  Does this mean it is envisaged that this role and function will be removed from the Minister for Transport and that, as a result of the new talking shop of the Minister of State, Deputy Tony Killeen, some other Minister will be assigned the role?  Can we live in hope and assume a Minister for the marine will eventually be appointed?While the provisions relating to workers do not relate to harbour commissioners, the proposal that staff representation be confined to one regardless of the size of an authority or company is one that appears to have worked in the past.  I wonder why it is necessary to introduce this measure?  Is it that the Minister is on the one hand trying to completely control the companies while on the other giving them power to determine their own future and is setting them up in a structure that allows them to do so?The Minister in his press release on 5 August 2008 announcing the publication of the Harbours (Amendment) Bill 2008 stated that the Bill will grant all port companies the power to invest outside their current harbour limits and to pursue opportunities outside the State.  He also stated that with this Bill the ten State port companies can pursue a robust, commercial agenda, thereby boosting the commercial mandate given to them by the Government in the Harbours Act 1996.  That is all very laudable and worthy.  However, some of the amendments seek to undermine these companies.  Wolfe Tone would be proud of Deputy P. J. Sheehan's articulation of the importance of Bantry harbour.  While we welcome the Bill, some of the amendments seek to undermine its general thrust.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	262	Some €1.6 billion has been invested by the Government in drinking water infrastructure in the period since 2000 and substantial additional funding is being provided this year from the total Exchequer provision of €500 million for the water services investment programme.  In the period since 2000, additional drinking water treatment capacity and additional water storage capacity equivalent to the needs of a population of 855,000 and 1.5 million, respectively, has been provided.  A review of the water services investment programme is being undertaken this year to ensure that investment continues to be targeted at priority works.  A value for money study on the programme will be also completed this year.Under the European Communities (Drinking Water) (No. 2) Regulations 2007, water services authority drinking water supplies are subject to supervision by the EPA.  Additional resources have been provided to the agency to back up its new enforcement powers.  Under these regulations, water services authorities are obliged to ensure that any failure to meet quality standards in a water supply is investigated immediately to determine the cause.  My Department has been also working closely with water services authorities, which are generally responsible for the management of public drinking water supplies, and the EPA to ensure that the management structures for the supply of drinking water are of the highest standard.The recently published report, The Quality of Drinking Water in Ireland — A Report for the Years 2007 and 2008, shows that overall the quality of our drinking water is good and that further progress has been made in improving quality in recent years.  The report indicates that the number of detections of e.coli in 2007 was down compared with 2006.  To ensure the effectiveness of the disinfection procedures required to remove e.coli from water supplies, the agency has recommended the installation of chlorine monitors and alarms on all water supplies.  My Department has been working intensively with local authorities in recent months to ensure that all public and group water supplies are equipped with monitors and alarms.  I understand that good progress has been made and the remaining supplies will be equipped in the coming months.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	263	I thank the Minister for his reply.  The EPA report is a serious indictment of the manner in which people cannot rely on the safety of drinking water in many parts of the country.  According to the report 118,000 people had to boil their drinking water last year.  Notwithstanding that, the Minister achieved a reasonable level of support from the Government in October for the 2009 Estimates he had shaved a little — some €40 million — off when it came to April.  Galway of course has been high profile, but there are other areas that might not have got the attention they deserve.  I seek an assurance that the people in areas affected will not need to continue to boil water for drinking or buy bottled water in shops.  Fine Gael recently suggested making some investments under the Irish water company that we proposed to establish.  Does the Minister have any similar plans?  I ask the Minister to study our proposal.  If there is an agreement between us on that proposal, would it be of assistance in ensuring that we get more schemes operational in the next year in order to meet our water framework directive requirements that are fast coming down the track?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	264	I agree with the Deputy that it is very important to invest in good quality drinking water.  I consider this as an absolute necessity.  In a country such as ours there is no reason for people to be drinking contaminated water.  While I accept there have been boil notices, I am pleased that there has been a reduction in the number of such notices.  The EPA has identified 341 public water supplies that it has put on its remedial action list.  These supplies require detailed profiling from catchment to consumer to determine whether the supply needs to be replaced or upgraded, or where operational practices need to be improved to ensure the water supplied to the general public is clean and wholesome.That a water supply is on the list does not necessarily mean the water produced by the supply is unsafe to drink.  Where a health-related parameter is exceeded, the EPA and the HSE must be notified and follow-up action must be taken.  A water supply is included on the remedial action list for one or more of the following reasons: failure to meet the e.coli standard at some point in the past two years; inadequate treatment, for example no treatment other than chlorination, poor turbidity removal or excessive levels of aluminium in the treated water; showing elevated levels of nitrate; being unable to meet the new bromate or THL standards that came into force at the end of 2008; monitoring results or compliance checks by the EPA that indicate a lack of operational control at the treatment plant and the supplies identified by the Health Service Executive where improvements are required.  This is the list on which we are working, and I consider it a priority list.  We are doing everything we can in this regard.The Deputy has stated that there was a slight shaving off.  While that is true, the most important thing is that, despite very severe economic difficulties, we have increased the budget for water services infrastructure.  That will remain the case because water quality is a priority.  It is a priority for the people who need to drink water and use it.  We also need to do this because we want to avoid fines.  I believe the Deputy has raised this matter in committee meetings.

Some €20 million has been set aside by my Department in 2009 to support the leasing of at least 2,000 houses by local authorities for social housing purposes.  The cost of the scheme in future years will be dependent on the number of homes leased, the rental payments involved and the length of time for which leases are procured.  It is intended that authorities will procure dwellings for periods of ten to 20 years.The cost to a local authority of a leased unit is determined by a variety of factors, including type and size, location and the average rent of properties in the area.  Costs can be also influenced by rent reviews, which my Department has advised should follow market conditions.The primary focus in negotiating leasing costs will be the delivery of value for money and I expect that authorities should be able to secure leasing costs of at least 20% below market value.  This reflects the element of risk, such as the vacancies, and management and maintenance responsibilities, being transferred to the housing authority.  The property owner will remain responsible for any structural matters.On that basis, by way of illustration, a Dublin authority might lease a dwelling at €1,000 per month, assuming a current market rent of €1,250 for a 3-bedroom property.  Over a 20-year period, on a fixed-price basis, this would cost the authority approximately €240,000 as compared with the current average cost of €330,000 to purchase a new home in the Dublin area.  This of course excludes the financing cost to purchase such a unit.  When this is factored in, the total cost to the State would be more than €520,000, which would be more than double the cost of leasing the unit.Social housing tenants accommodated in leased properties will be charged a differential rent in the normal manner.  This rent will be used by the authority to defray the costs of management and maintenance of the property.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	268	I thank the Minister of State for his response, which indicates that the average lease arrangement will cost €10,000 per year, which works out at €200,000 over the 20-year lease period and that the rent accrued during this period will be offset against the maintenance of the properties.  Based on a rent of €100 per week on the differential, this goes into sums of nearly €100,000 over the period of the property lease.  The sums involved in the Minister of State's proposal amount to approximately €300,000 per unit on a lease basis over 20 years, after which time the property will be handed back to the developer at an increased market value.  The maths do not add up.Will the Minister of State review the situation?  He has confirmed my suspicion that the rents being accrued by the properties will, instead of going to local authorities, be ring-fenced in the leasing arrangements.  The market and cost values of the properties are significantly different.  The Minister of State would have spent less had he chased their cost value.  He might even have got them for below the €200,000 he cited, perhaps for €150,000 or €140,000.  Is this a proposal to help people on social housing lists or is it a bail out for developers who cannot get rid of properties?  Is the State stepping in to stand over them?

To purchase and finance a house over the same period would require €520,000.  These are the figures on today's costs, which are available on the website.The old hairy chestnut of bailing out builders has been pegged out time and again.  Were we to buy houses tomorrow morning, who would provide them other than builders?  This year, builders will provide the houses my Department has supplied €1.2 billion to construct and acquire.  This is the long and the short of it.  There is no bail out.  My job is to try to get as many houses as possible for the 55,000 people on our housing lists.  Were I to take the road mentioned by the Deputy, I would need €4 billion to deal with 20,000 houses.

For example, we might decide to move to rent to purchase.  Today's options allow us to avail of properties on the market, in respect of which I have set aside €20 million.  People can rest assured that this option will be supported over the ten or 20 years.  Since we are in discussions, I may vary the scheme.  For example, I could include the incremental purchase scheme.  These are some of my considerations and I will inform the House as soon as I make decisions on them.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	283	The leasing arrangements have no opt-out clauses.  They are ten year or 20 year leases.  Other schemes are different, but the Minister of State is committing the taxpayer to paying €400 million over 20 years.  It is unbelievable and inexplicable that the properties' rents will not be held by the local authorities.  Rather, they will be ring-fenced so that the developers can maintain their profits.

This is where the €20 million will go.  It is good value for money.  The uptake from local authorities is excellent, as is the general public's support.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	286	In February, my Department set out details of the financial requirements for local authorities relating to the overall management of their capital and current accounts.  These requirements flow directly from the requirements for Government finances as a whole to be managed in accordance with the Stability and Growth Pact established under the Maastricht treaty and the associated limitation on budget deficits.  In this regard, the Government set a limit of €200 million for the contribution that the local government sector can make to the deterioration in the general government balance in any one year.  This is not a new requirement for 2009, but the downturn in the economy and the substantial pressure on funding require a sharp focus in all sectors, including local authorities, on tight control and management of public finances.To stay within the overall limit for the general government balance, it is necessary for local authorities to manage their finances so as to keep their current and capital accounts in balance for 2009.  Within this broad requirement, there is provision for borrowing by local authorities for capital infrastructure.  In aggregate and allowing for repayment of €50 million in existing loan principal, loan sanctions amounting to €250 million are being allocated for capital projects on a prioritised basis this year.  I appreciate that these requirements impose a particular degree of financial discipline on local authorities.  However, it is essential that all levels of government contribute to the necessary action to restore order and stability to the public finances.These requirements do not conflict with the continuing emphasis on capital investment in necessary infrastructure critical to economic recovery and sustaining the economy at local level.  The Government and local authorities will continue to progress capital investment projects that can maximise economic, social and environmental returns.  Accordingly, the prioritisation of investment opportunities and the targeting of available resources to labour intensive activity and the support of economic recovery will continue to be the key focus of capital expenditure in the local government sector.The overall level of resources applied by local authorities remains significant and, taking account of Exchequer and local sources of finance, it is expected that total capital investment by these authorities, notably in housing and infrastructure as well as other community supports, will exceed €6 billion in 2009.My Department will continue to work closely with local authorities to ensure that, within the overall financial limits to be met, decisions on these matters will be taken in a way that gives the necessary prioritisation to environmental, economic and social infrastructure as part of the overall contribution to economic recovery.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	287	The Department and the Minister have advised all local authorities that they are required to ensure expenditure is funded by income received or due within this year.  This is a serious instruction.  Will the Minister spell out its implications for schemes that have been announced for 2009 and contracts that have been signalled to local authorities for 2009?  Will they go ahead this year?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	288	There has been controversy in some quarters, but only four local authorities are affected in terms of development levies etc.  The figure amounts to approximately 14% of total spend.  As the overall capital spend is approximately €6 billion, I do not anticipate a significant impact.I will supply some details.  The general state of the economy and the need for prudent management and control of the public finances impose a deeper level of discipline in and management of all areas of public investment.  Local authorities, like other parts of the public service, must manage their operations within these constraints.  In this context, a key requirement is to advance and manage projects in a way that takes account of environmental, economic and social priorities.The overall capital spend will be in excess of €6 billion and local authorities will contribute significantly to economic renewal.  The spend comprises an investment of €2 billion in housing, more than €1 billion on roads and several hundred million euro each on water, the environment and local amenities.  I do not anticipate a major problem.  There will be some degree of difficulty, but it can be exaggerated in some quarters.  However, I do not anticipate there will be a huge difficulty regarding some of the main infrastructural projects such as, for example, those discussed earlier like water infrastructure.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	289	Fingal County Council has €70 million in development levies available to it that it cannot spend because of the restriction the Minister has imposed and the announcement that has been made.  Will the Minister review the position of those local authorities that have funds available, such as Fingal County Council, with a view to maximising their output for contractual obligations on essential water and infrastructural facilities that all Members wish to proceed?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	290	The local authorities and their managers in particular are in constant contact with my Department.  As this is done on an aggregate basis, it must be calculated to ensure that certain local authorities can borrow sufficiently and this probably constitutes a bigger problem.  I understand that only four local authorities are in a position to spend those development levies.  However, and I believe the Deputy's party agrees, it is essential to exercise financial prudence and fiscal rectitude in all those matters.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	291	Welcome to the real world.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	292	I have been reading the highly interesting document on local government that Deputy Hogan published today on the Internet.  However, the Government must abide by what has been set down in the Stability and Growth Pact under the Maastricht treaty.  As the Deputy is aware, Ireland has received considerable latitude from Brussels in respect of exceeding the 3% limit, and we have gone far beyond it.  However, we must abide by the pact and those criteria are set down both by Brussels and subsequently by the Department of Finance.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	293	Local authorities have a central role to play in supporting economic development and enterprise at local level.  They do this in a number of ways including through their capital and current budgets, economic planning and development and the provision of goods and services, as well as community infrastructure.More recently, local authorities have taken direct action to reduce the burden on business and promote employment, including by keeping the increase in commercial rates for 2009 to just over 1% on average and undertaking an examination of their costs to maximise efficiencies.  In addition, local authorities have been working with my Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on support for businesses and employment at local level.  In this context, the Tánaiste and I recently met the County and City Managers' Association.  Arising from this meeting, a number of steps were agreed including developing arrangements for engagement at national level between local authorities and the enterprise agencies.  At local level, local authorities will focus on streamlining the way in which they respond to businesses in areas such as planning, water and roads.  Local authorities also work closely with all relevant agencies at local level, including through their leadership of the multi-agency county and city development boards in respect of economic planning and the promotion of enterprise at local level.I am satisfied that with the steps being taken, local government is well placed to play a key role in supporting local business and employment in these challenging economic times.  I will, however, ensure that my Department, in consultation with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, continues to engage with local authorities to achieve the best ongoing support for enterprise at local level.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	294	I wish to make three suggestions to the Minister and I ask him to support Fine Gael on these three matters.  Does he support the establishment of a business and employment section in each local authority to bring together all the agencies that are involved in enterprise, some of which reside in various Departments and more of which operate through local authorities?  However, no co-ordination takes place between them.  Does the Minister agree it is now essential to bring together all those groups to make a concerted effort at local level to enhance the prospects of employment?Second, will the Minister ask local authorities and the managers he meets on a regular basis to freeze commercial rates for the next five years?  The easiest option available to such managers is to increase commercial rates to balance the books and councillors sometimes fall into that trap.  Third, there is an issue regarding five years being the termination date for planning applications for major works.  It is essential to extend this limit to seven years to reduce costs to applicants and to remove the existing backlog in An Bord Pleanála.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	295	As for the Deputy's point on commercial rate increases, at my request commercial rates have been kept down and the increases for 2009 were approximately 1%.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	296	The Minister will note I also issued a letter in that regard last October.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	297	Yes.  It is significant that 34 local authorities held their rates at 2008 levels.  This constitutes significant progress because, as the Deputy appreciates, the business sector is under extreme pressure and I am highly aware of that.I have undertaken a number of measures and some of the Deputy's suggestions are constructive.  I have asked local authorities to examine rigorously their costs to maximise efficiencies, which in turn will have a positive impact on business, and to focus on streamlining the ways they deal with business in areas such as planning and water.  For example, Galway County Council has established a business support unit, which is exactly what the Deputy has suggested, and I have asked other local authorities to do likewise.  I have asked them to lead on the soon to be completed reviews by county and city development boards on strategies to promote economic development in their own areas and to take steps to ensure that reductions in staffing levels do not focus on front line service.  As for overall capital investment by local authorities, as I noted in my response to the previous question, this will exceed €6 billion this year.I have also taken a number of specific actions to promote economic development.  I have asked local authorities to do all they can to reduce development contributions or to defer the payments.  My Department is facilitating discussions between certain local authorities in the greater Dublin area and An Bord Pleanála with a view to those authorities acting on an agency basis for the board in processing some of the board's caseload.  The Deputy may recall we discussed this issue at committee level.  I expect this arrangement will be in place shortly.  As I stated in my initial response, the Tánaiste and I met the county and city managers to talk about reducing the cost to business.  I have asked the county and city councils to streamline the manner in which they deal with businesses, including, as I stated, the support units.  Finally, each county and city development board, led by local government, has now established an economic subgroup to promote economic and enterprise development.  In many instances, this group also acts as a special taskforce to provide a co-ordinated response to business closures in their area.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	298	The Minister will agree there is a very disjointed approach to promoting enterprise in local authority areas at present because of the current plethora of agencies.  I ask the Minister to bring forward proposals, together with his colleague, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, to bring them together to a greater extent under local government.In respect of An Bord Pleanála, a huge backlog of potential employment generating proposals has built up before the board, which must be released from decision-making.  Does the Minister agree that to assist in removing the backlog, existing planning permissions that last five years could be extended to seven years?  This proposal might meet some of the requirements in respect of major infrastructural projects.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	299	On the Deputy's last point, this matter can be addressed in the forthcoming planning and development Bill.  However, this must be considered carefully.  One cannot give a full blank cheque as all the existing permissions must meet the new energy standards.  In addition, one also must consider carefully what constitutes good planning and whether such proposals fit in.  Overall, however, and I have received representations from colleagues from all parties in this regard, it makes sense that if one wishes to continue to stimulate economic activity, something should be done in that regard and certain planning permissions should be extended.  For example, permissions relating to renewable energy are perfect candidates.

Within the regeneration programme, the redevelopment of Ballymun and regeneration initiatives in Limerick, Dublin, Cork and Waterford cities will continue to receive support, while works will commence at Mitchel's Crescent, Tralee.  Planning for projects at Cranmore, Sligo and Cox's Demesne, Dundalk will also receive support.  Overall, funding for regeneration projects in 2009 is being increased by 5% to €135.9 million.  Funding for the remedial works programme will increase by 3% this year to €54.9 million, supporting 47 projects, including two new projects at Mullaghmat in Monaghan and Townspark in Navan.  Following a call for new remedial works proposals late last year, six further projects have received approval in principle, and I expect progress to be made on these over the course of this year.  Housing authorities have also been asked to revise plans on an additional 16 projects, with a view to inclusion in the programme in due course.In addition, a further 2,100 local authority dwellings will benefit from the final year of the national central heating programme in 2009.  A new programme to improve the energy efficiency of local authority housing will also get under way this year, with some €20 million being provided towards the cost of improving the energy efficiency rating of vacant local authority units prior to being relet.  A number of pilot retrofitting projects will also be funded.  Housing authorities will continue to fund a range of housing maintenance and improvement activities from their own resources and this is expected to be approximately €100 million.
#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	301	I thank the Minister for his response.  The record of the Government on social housing is appalling.  This is no direct reflection on the Minister of State but many projects are underfunded.  In the recent budget there was a €314 million cut in the social housing budget and people in communities awaiting regeneration are suffering.  They are living in appalling housing developments.  Deputy Catherine Byrne referred to rental accommodation two weeks ago as kips.  These should not be out there.  Five PPPs, which were given to one property developer, were abandoned last year.  The Minister announced a review of PPPs.  What is the result of that review?The Minister of State referred to Ballymun regeneration, a project that came in massively over budget and late.  What lessons have been learned from this?  Many towers in Ballymun are in an appalling state.  There is much crime and community gardaí do not police the areas.  These are no-go areas and it is important that we get these areas regenerated as soon as possible.
#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	302	In our programme of housing support in 2008, we supported some 19,000 households, a substantial figure.  While there is trimming back of €290 million in the housing capital budget for this year, that figure would meet between 400 and 500 houses.  I am providing for 2,000 extra houses under the leasing programme.  There will be a net gain of 1,500 or 1,600 houses under the social housing programme.Regarding standards, there are laws and local authorities are obliged to deal with inspections.  I understand an increase in inspections has taken place.Deputy Flanagan referred to Ballymun, which is an example of success.  I supported that success by allocating €45 million to Ballymun for 2009.  An enormous amount of development has taken place, six of the landmark towers have been demolished and 2,800 of the existing flats are demolished or are under contract to be demolished.  Some 1,400 new homes are there, along with a new street, two hotels and a whole neighbourhood of facilities and amenities.  The new IKEA store will open in July with 500 new jobs.  Ballymun is a success story to date although it may have taken longer than expected and gone over budget.  We can aspire to finish it to a high standard.The PPP model has been debated in this House.  One of the first matters on my desk after being appointed Minister of State last May was that PPP projects were under scrutiny because developers were not in a position to go ahead with them due to the downturn in their finances and the economy.  A review has taken place and Dublin City Council has come forward with new proposals for St. Michael's Estate.  My Department is examining these proposals at this time.  I am hopeful progress will be made in the coming year.I have also set aside moneys for works to be carried out, namely, the relocation of people from O'Devaney Gardens flats.  Dublin City Council is working on this and examining other areas of development in those complexes.  I do not want those areas to go back to monotenure developments.  This is a difficulty for the city council because these monotenure developments caused social problems.  A mix of public and private developments is important.  Private development is not coming forward but hopefully that will change.  I do not want to allow monotenure development to take place.  I want a mix of sustainable communities so that we do not generate the social problems we are dealing with in other regeneration areas.

Local authorities were asked to resubmit a cost-benefit analysis.  Can the Minister of State give us an update?  One area earmarked for regeneration in my constituency is the Buttercup estate in Darndale.  Can the Minister of State re-examine this?  It has gone on for many years and regeneration should have taken place by now.  It is the only estate in Darndale that has been forgotten.The Minister of State has set aside €500 million for the home choice loan scheme.  Can the Minister of State set aside some of the money to deal with regeneration and social housing problems?
#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	304	The areas we continue to support are Ballymun, Bridgefoot Street, Queen Seán Treacy House and Lourdes House in Dublin city.  We also have regeneration projects in Cork, Waterford, Limerick, while Sligo and Cox's Demesne in Dundalk are at the planning stage.  Tralee town council has a new project.  I will check up on the estate in Deputy Flanagan's constituency.The sum of €500 million is a facility under the housing finance agencies.  It is for local authority loans and is not money set aside in a package.  Money up to that limit can be drawn down under the home choice loan.  It is available to local authorities if those type of people draw down these loans, not to me.  I am not in a position to grab the money and put it elsewhere.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	305	I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 26, 43, 120 and 121 together.As I indicated in reply to Question No. 1, my Department co-ordinates and finances a major programme of investment in improved drinking water supply infrastructure, active leakage control, telemetry and rehabilitation of water mains, on which some €1.6 billion has been invested by the Government in the period since 2000.  Substantial additional funding is being provided this year from the total Exchequer provision of €500 million for the water services investment programme.  This level of investment reflects the priority assigned by Government to meeting EU standards for drinking water and providing critical water supply infrastructure, which has seen additional drinking water treatment capacity and additional drinking water storage capacity equivalent to the needs of a population of 855,000 and 1.5 million, respectively, provided since 2000.A rigorous supervisory framework has also been put in place to ensure good quality drinking water is provided and that effective mechanisms are available to deal quickly and effectively with problems where they arise.  My Department has also been working closely with water services authorities, who are generally responsible for the management of public drinking water supplies, and the EPA to ensure that the management structures for the supply of drinking water are of the highest standard.  The recently published report, The Quality of Drinking Water in Ireland — A Report for the Years 2007 and 2008, shows that overall the quality of our drinking water is good and further progress has been made in improving drinking water quality in recent years.  The report shows that monitoring of water supplies increased by 8.1% over 2006 and details the agency's enforcement activities, including the first prosecution of a water services authority under the drinking water regulations of 2007.The report highlights, however, the need for further improvements if high standards of drinking water quality are to be maintained.  It identified a number of public water supplies that require detailed profiling from catchment to consumer to determine whether the supply needs to be replaced or upgraded, or where operational practices need to be improved to ensure that the water supplied to the general public is clean and wholesome.  The fact that a water supply is on this list does not necessarily mean that the water produced by the supply is unsafe to drink.My Department and the EPA developed an action programme in response to a similar remedial action list identified in 2008.  In the case of some 60% of the supplies, the safety and security of supply could be addressed through abandonment of existing sources, better operational procedures or relatively small-scale improvements to the treatment processes.  I made available a fund of €16 million in 2008 to deal with these small-scale improvements.  The balance of the supplies require new or updated infrastructure and these are included in the water services investment programme.  My Department will be reviewing the additions to the list in 2009 with the EPA and relevant water services authorities to identify the appropriate solutions in these cases.I am satisfied that the combination of the rigorous supervisory framework which I have put in place and the resources being devoted to the water services infrastructure will ensure continuous improvement in the quality of our water supply.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	306	The main progress which has been made with drinking water is that it is now being monitored very substantially by the EPA and we have had reports for the past couple of years.  The progress made on the issue has been very slow.  There were 339 supplies on the risk list last year with 83 being removed and 62 added.  Almost a third of our water supplies are still considered risky by the EPA, meaning there is a problem with the water and something needs to be done by the local authority to take it off the list.  It is important to make that point.With regard to the money that the Minister spoke of investing, is €500 million enough and does he expect that sum to be spent?  Will he guarantee that all the money will be spent?  In view of the embargo on council staff recruitment, will councils have enough staff to spend the money and will they have the capacity to carry out necessary works?When the EPA launched the report, it stated there will need to be a corresponding upskilling of those charged with the operation and management of drinking water treatment plants.  I presume this referred to both public and private facilities.  Do the councils have enough staff with the necessary skills and will the Minister guarantee that by the end of this year, the €500 million will not be left languishing in local authority accounts or not drawn down by local authorities at all?At a recent conference of architects the Minister stated that domestic water charges were inevitable.  I put a question to the Minister last month on whether Ireland had opted out of implementing domestic water charges under European Union law and his reply was that we had.  The Minister did not indicate in the reply that he intended to change that and he pointed out how the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act 1997 removed the authority of water authorities to implement water charges for domestic users.  He also indicated there was no requirement for the Government to take steps to opt out of article 9(1) of the water framework directive with regard to the requirement to charge domestic users for water.Where does the Minister stand on the issue?  There is no point in indicating this is the responsibility of the Commission on Taxation and at the same time linking the matter with the quality of water.  Water charges are a revenue-raising measure and it is not the way to get funds for water infrastructure.  We have an income taxation system which should be operated fairly.Water is equivalent to a food product in that a third of food products would not be on shelves if they were risky.  Unfortunately, this is the case with water.  Water is not dispensable; a person can stop eating food for a certain time — people have gone on hunger strike — but we cannot stop drinking water as it is next to the air we breathe in terms of its vital importance to our health and well-being.  This is even more relevant for children and elderly people.If there is a threat of charging for water, there is the possibility that some people who should drink water would restrict their usage.  What is the Minister's position on water charges and what does he believe is the right way to proceed?

The Deputy put other questions, initially regarding the amount of money involved.  The €500 million for 2009 is a substantial amount.  Although there has been reference to a reduction of €60 million on the €560 million envisaged in the 2009 Estimates, it should be stated very clearly that the provision represents an increase of 1% on last year's outturn, even taking into account a very difficult economic position.  This reflects the Government's ongoing commitment to the water services sector.This year's provision can be compared to previous years.  In 2008 and 2007 the outturn was €496 million, in 2006 it was €465 million and in 2005 it was €419 million.  There has been substantial progress and I am very proud, as a Green Party Minister, that we have managed to target that investment on a critical area.Some €100 million of the €500 million has already been allocated to the water services authorities, mainly for works on group schemes, leaving €400 million for the continued financing of major schemes under the water services investment programme.  Investment under the programme will support over 4,000 jobs in the construction sector this year, which is essential, and many additional jobs in the manufacturing and operating areas and maintaining new infrastructure posts.Although the 2009 provision has been reduced, this must be set against the background of much more competitive tendering.  We are getting very good value for money, with up to 20% of a reduction in costs.The last issue referred to by the Deputy was the public service embargo and the need to upskill staff.  There have been some erroneous reports that we are stopping certain recruitment.  There was a recent report that lifeguards could no longer be employed but that is untrue.  We will ensure that the people required for this very important work will be put in place.  The commitment is real and can be seen in the amount of money we will invest.

#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	309	To return to water charges, I understand the Minister stated to a group of architects or people of a related profession that water charges are inevitable.  Why is it inevitable that we will have water charges for household water users?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	310	I gave an interview after my speech to engineers.  I was talking about rainwater harvesting and the recycling of water, which is essential, and the conservation of water.My comments were made in the context of climate change.  The EPA report to which I referred indicates that as a result of climate change there will be higher precipitation in certain areas of the country and drought in others.  I clearly indicated that we must ensure we treat water as a valuable resource.  Treated water costs money and people in this country are already paying for water.  As already stated, there has been no change with regard to the latter.  The commercial sector and, quite controversially, schools are paying for water.  Some schools have done tremendous work in this area and have reduced their costs to a substantial degree by investing in rainwater harvesting.  This underlines the value of the green schools initiative.  The investment in this regard was made in the aftermath of direct assistance from my Department.  A school can save up to 28,000 litres of water by making the kind of investment to which I refer.  We must impress on people the message that water is a resource which must be reserved.

#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	320	The Minister addressed the Institution of Engineers and flagged as an issue the introduction of domestic water charges.  He can make as many statements as he wants at conferences or in schools.  However, he is in the House now and he should indicate whether he is in favour of introducing domestic water charges.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	321	The Deputy is being deliberately disingenuous.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	323	How unequivocal must I be?  All the statements I have made in respect of that matter in the House are completely accurate and they stand.  I made reference at the conference in question to the Commission on Taxation, which is considering all of these issues.  As matters stand, there is no plan to introduce domestic water rates.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	324	The capital provision for water services infrastructure in 2009 is €500 million, which represents an increase of 1% on last year's outturn and reflects the Government's ongoing commitment to the sector.  In the period since 2000, the Exchequer has spent €2.5 billion on the provision of wastewater infrastructure, with 144 major schemes completed.  These schemes include the construction of very large wastewater treatment plants in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Wexford, Drogheda and Dundalk.  New wastewater treatment facilities were also provided in many other smaller urban areas.  The increase in wastewater treatment capacity over the same period was equivalent to the needs of a population of 3.6 million.Compliance with the general requirements of the EU urban wastewater treatment directive in respect of secondary wastewater treatment has also increased significantly over the past decade, rising from a compliance level of 25% in 2000 to some 92% at present.  All of the remaining schemes are included in the water services investment programme 2007-09.The wastewater schemes included in the programme are based primarily on regular assessments of needs, undertaken by water services authorities at my Department's request.  Water services authorities will be asked to undertake updated assessments of needs in the middle of this year and these will be used as a key input to a review of the water services investment programme.  Priority objectives for the new programme will include the need to deliver infrastructure required to expand and improve our wastewater treatment capacity in order to ensure the highest emission standards from our municipal wastewater treatment plants, to anticipate future economic and social development needs and to maintain progress towards compliance with the requirements of the urban wastewater treatment directive.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	325	I recently visited Dublin City Council's wastewater treatment plant, on which a great deal of money was spent.  Does the allocation of €500 million also relate to wastewater treatment?  In the context of current capacity to deal with wastewater treatment, how many further plants will it be necessary to construct?  When will these plants be delivered?Section 49 of the Planning and Development Act contains a provision which allows local authorities to require developers to build infrastructure.  As far as I am aware, local authorities have used this provision only in respect of transport infrastructure.  Has the Minister considered asking them to use it to require those responsible for major developments to either build some of the required infrastructure or to fund its construction?  The latter would have to be done specifically and not by means of a general levy.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	326	The Deputy inquired with regard to the capital provision of €500 million.  In the context of the water services investment programme, some 150 schemes are currently in progress.  Of these, 90 are wastewater schemes.  It is expected that 40 schemes will be completed this year.  Of these, 30 are wastewater schemes.  It is anticipated that construction will commence on some 50 new schemes.  However, when these schemes were originally planned, some €560 million was made available.  As the Deputy is aware, the amount had to be reduced but we continue to make good progress.  It is anticipated that such progress will continue into 2010 and beyond.  Up to 160 schemes will be in progress at the end of this year.As a result of our EU commitments, we were obliged to move rapidly in respect of the provision of wastewater treatment plants.  Since 2000, the Exchequer has spent €2.5 billion on the provision of wastewater infrastructure alone and some 144 major schemes have been completed in the interim.  These schemes include the construction of very large wastewater treatment plants in Dublin — to which the Deputy referred and with which I am extremely familiar — Cork, Limerick, Galway, Wexford, Drogheda and Dundalk.  New wastewater treatment facilities were also provided in many other smaller urban areas.  In addition, some 105 wastewater schemes were provided under the serviced land initiative.  The latter has been discontinued in light of the changed housing market.Good progress has been made.  The Deputy's point with regard to the delivery of infrastructure was highlighted elsewhere in recent times.  Proposals on how we might invest pension funds in respect of the provision of infrastructure would give rise to a number of advantages.  Wastewater treatment plants were specifically mentioned in this regard.  The advantage of such investment is that it is off balance sheet and there is a great deal to be said for it.
#LucindaCreighton	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-party	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-dob	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	327	Deputy Tuffy referred to the wastewater treatment plant in Ringsend, with which the Minister and I are extremely familiar.  With regard to the proposals to extend the plant, is it planned to engage in a new tendering process or is it envisaged that the same failed consortium will continue to operate the plant?  Is the Minister of the view that there might be a change in respect of how the contractual agreement might be arrived at?  The scenario relating to the construction of the existing plant was bizarre because the company involved failed to deliver a suitable facility and to provide an efficient and adequate service for the city.  However, it was rewarded when the Minister signed a document which allowed it to be paid €38 million or €39 million, even though it had failed to honour its contractual agreement.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	328	It was not quite as straightforward as that.  I am very familiar with this plant.  I live very close to it.  In fact, if Pigeon House Road is the starting point, I live on the same road.  The problem is that both parties, Dublin City Council and the contractors, were blaming each other.  The contractors were blaming Dublin City Council because in their own document they did not give adequate information and, likewise, we had criticism of the contractors.  The net result was that the people we represent were caught in the middle and were faced with this dreadful odour.It is correct that I invested money to deal with the problem.  The odour problem has improved substantially on the basis of my own nose, but it returns intermittently.Regarding the expansion, that is a matter for Dublin City Council.  I understand the planning permission is extant and that it can go ahead and expand but on what contractual basis I cannot tell the Deputy at this stage because that is a matter for the local authority.  I agree with the Deputy, however, that valuable lessons must be learned from what I can only describe as a debacle on the last occasion that should not be repeated and which, unfortunately, has given the whole idea a bad name to the extent that there are communities throughout the country that do not want a sewage treatment plant in their area.I supported the idea, as did all the local representatives, of getting away from "NIMBYism" and having a sewage treatment plant that gives us a clean bay.  That is one of the measures I supported.An aspect I am very disturbed about is the fact that as a councillor and a local authority member I tabled an amendment which called for tertiary treatment and was supported by all of the council members at the time.  This was a reserved function and despite that, and the fact that the plan was amended by the councillors, it was ignored by the management.  In my view that is an affront to local democracy and completely unacceptable.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	329	Since its establishment in 1997, the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, which operates as a commercial entity and is funded entirely from its own resources, has engaged in the purchase, management, development and sale of lands in the Docklands area.The authority, through its involvement in a joint venture company, Becbay Ltd., made a significant investment in the acquisition of the old Irish Glass Bottle Company, IGBC, site in Poolbeg.I understand the authority took the view that the IGBC site was very significant in terms of the regeneration of the Poolbeg peninsula and that the manner in which this site was developed would set the tone for remaining development in the area.  Accordingly, it decided to secure an interest in the site to achieve, in full measure, its overall objectives for the Poolbeg area as set out in its master plan.This is regarded by the authority as a long-term investment.  It is anticipated that the development of the Poolbeg peninsula will take place over five to ten years.  Previously, the authority has been very successfully involved in extensions to the Irish Financial Services Centre area and the redevelopment of the former Bord Gáis site at Grand Canal harbour.
#LucindaCreighton	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-party	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-dob	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	330	Significant concerns have arisen about the way this deal was originally arrived at and how it has been conducted over a period, particularly given that the payment of the interest on the loan has effectively stopped.  It raises questions about the liquidity of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  The fundamental question that merits further investigation, and on which I hope the Minister agrees with me, is that the initial sum paid for the site was €411 million.  That was, at the very least, €42 million more than the highest valuation of the site.  It beggars belief that a public body, which essentially is what the Dublin Docklands Development Authority is, could justify that kind of expenditure and consider it in any way feasible.  The site is now devalued at a minimum by 60%; that is probably a conservative estimate.  Some valuers now value the IGBC site at €90 million.  The problem is that with the establishment of the National Assets Management Agency and because Bernard McNamara and the other investors have essentially washed their hands of it in terms of paying the interest on the loan, the taxpayer has been lumped with paying the tab.Does the Minister plan to review the ethical guidelines for the operation of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority?  We saw a huge conflict of interest in terms of directors of Anglo Irish Bank, directors of the board of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority and the sellers of the IGBC site to the Becbay Ltd. consortium, many of whom had business interests with existing directors on the DDDA at the time.  Does the Minister support the call from the Oireachtas committee for the Comptroller and Auditor General to investigate not just the corporate governance aspect, but the specific property deals over which there are major question marks?  Will the Minister give a commitment, as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, that he will not sign the development plan for the Poolbeg peninsula because that is linked to this issue?  Ultimately, it will be in the Minister's hands.  The deadline for submissions is this week but it is the Minister's call.  He has the power not to sign the plan.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	331	The Deputy's essential question is whether it merits further investigation.  The answer is "Yes".  That is one of the primary reasons I appointed someone who is an expert in corporate governance and who has great expertise in all of these areas, Professor Niamh Brennan, who will be assiduous in examining all of these matters.  I agree we must examine them in great detail.  Again, I am very familiar with this area, which is close to where I live.On the Deputy's second question, I welcome the fact that the matter has been referred to the Comptroller and Auditor General and look forward to any findings that emerge from that process because we must have public confidence in this body.  It is important to record also, lest we give the wrong impression, that the Dublin Docklands Development Authority has done very good work.  The Deputy's colleague, Deputy Phil Hogan, who is a member of the particular committee, which I understand visited the area, said that the area in general had made massive strides when one considers the level of unemployment in the area years ago.  He said it was a map similar to many other places throughout the country and that there was a blight there.  I recall what the area was like before it was developed.  The Dublin Docklands Development Authority has made tremendous strides but that cannot take away from the fact that this particular acquisition must be examined in detail.
#LucindaCreighton	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-party	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-dob	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	332	The Minister did not answer my question on whether he will sign an order for the development to go ahead.  I raised this matter on the Adjournment but unfortunately the Minister was not present in the Chamber.  I welcome the appointment of Professor Niamh Brennan.  She is a person of integrity but it is not feasible that she is in a position as head of the board of the DDDA to conduct an independent inquiry.  That would be a bizarre situation.  It would be worthwhile for the Minister to consider an independent inquiry.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	333	First, the Minister mentioned an investigation.

Does the Minister agree with the Fine Gael view that Dublin City Council should ultimately be responsible for that area and that this quango should be abolished?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	335	It is far too early to come to such a judgment.  We must await the outcome of these inquiries.In reply to Deputy Tuffy, the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General is an independent body.  No Minister has, or should have, any influence on it.  It will come to its own conclusions.  It will inquire into whether the matter merits investigation.  However, I welcome the fact that the matter has been referred to it.On any planning matters, all of those issues must be properly scrutinised, when sensible decision can be made.

A protocol governing the assessment of the individual accommodation needs of certain people with a disability has been in operation since July 2007.  Further protocols governing the funding arrangements between housing authorities and the HSE on ongoing support costs for social housing tenants and for the strategic assessment of the housing needs of people with a disability are currently being progressed.Part M of the building regulations was amended in 2002 to include requirements on access to all dwellings by people with disabilities.  A comprehensive review of Part M has since been carried out, in consultation with stakeholders, with a view to improving and broadening the scope of the relevant guidance.  The outcome of this review will be released for public consultation shortly.A wide range of supports are provided to meet the specific accommodation needs of people with a disability.  These include the housing adaptation grant for persons with a disability, the adaptation grant for new houses and the mobility aids grant schemes, adaptation works to local authority houses and up to 100% grants to support the provision of specific accommodation by voluntary housing bodies.  Notwithstanding the more constrained fiscal environment, meeting the housing needs of the most vulnerable sections of society, including persons with a disability, will continue to be prioritised by Government.

We set down some of the protocols and the others are for consultation shortly.  We have the back-up in the areas of grants and Part M.  I would hope that the local authorities, and local authority members, will ensure that takes place.I understand the housing grants have been notified to local authorities this week.  They are with the local authorities today, or if not, tomorrow.  They have an allocation of almost €80 million for those grants for 2009.The simple reason local authorities have not been notified of the grants until now is that we have only recently had the Revised Estimates.  Having said that, I am pleased to say that we have almost €80 million available for housing grants for 2009.

He stated that the delay in the budget has to do with the Revised Estimates.  It is the fifth month of the year.  Is the Minister of State stating that the reason for this delay is because of the Revised Estimates?  If that is the case, it would mean that the Department was looking at a revised budget estimate in January and February of this year.  This is of critical importance to the House because it means that the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste have given us false information in reply to other questions.  Is the Minister of State stating that the reason for the delay in this budget being issued is because of the Revised Estimates?  If that is the case, how early in the year was the Department discussing that there would be Revised Estimates?  The reply given by the Minister of State is a nonsense.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	360	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for granting time for this important issue which affects so many people.  I have been seeking to raise on the Adjournment for some days the position in which prospective adopters find themselves with regard to the possibility of adopting in either Vietnam or in Russia.Under our adoption system, under the Adoption Act 1991 for which I was responsible as it was a Private Members' Bill, provision was made for the first time for the recognition of foreign adoptions and for an arrangement to be put in place whereby the Adoption Board can grant what are known as declarations of suitability for inter-country adoptions.  There are many people currently in the State who have been deemed suitable to adopt and who hoped or anticipated that they would effect adoptions in either Vietnam or in Russia.I wish to first briefly address the problems with regard to Vietnam.  For five years we had in place a bilateral agreement with the Vietnamese to facilitate the adoption by Irish people of children in Vietnam in circumstances in which our own authorities were satisfied that children were being properly protected and all proper and appropriate procedures were applied.  It has been known for some considerable time that the arrangement would expire by 1 May of this year and it was an issue that I raised by way of parliamentary question on a number of occasions.It was not until 6 March 2009, some seven weeks prior to the expiration of the agreement, that the Minister of State's office forwarded to the Vietnamese authorities a new draft bilateral agreement, which, essentially, is an international treaty.  As I understand it, a delegation went from the Minister of State's office on or around 20 April last to Vietnam to see whether whatever difficulties had arisen could be resolved.We have now passed 1 May but no new bilateral agreement is in place.  The Minister of State, on 28 April, issued a statement in which he detailed from his perspective the background and which contained a most disturbing sentence.  He stated that it is not possible to indicate at this time whether or when that process, that is, the process of reaching a bilateral agreement, is likely to successfully conclude.  In other words, the Minister of State indicated there was a possibility no such agreement would be effected.  Many people across the country hope to adopt in Vietnam.  They are anxious about their circumstances.  I am aware of some people who intended to depart for Vietnam at the end of April with a view to adopting in May or June.  There is an urgent need for the Minister of State to clarify what is being done.  He must also explain why he has been so slow in dealing with this matter.The new draft bilateral agreement should have gone to the Vietnamese authorities last autumn.  It is unreasonable to have expected that in seven weeks of its being forwarded, the matter would be complete.In the case of Russian adoptions, there is equally a large number of couples who wish to effect an adoption there.  However, difficulties have arisen in that the Russian authorities want post-placement reports forwarded to them but the HSE is now not providing these type of reports.  As a consequence, many individuals who expected to adopt in Russia and have had children identified to them as being available for adoption, are not able to proceed with adoptions.  What is the Minister of State doing about this?To date, 636 adoptions have been effected by Irish couples in Vietnam, almost 13% of the total adoptions of an inter-country nature effected since 1991.  There have been 1,229 effected in Russia, almost 30% of the total 4,690 adoptions recorded as having been recognised at the end of December 2007.  The Minister of State must give a detailed explanation as to the current position and put on the Dáil record the nature of the current difficulties impeding the conclusion of the necessary agreement with the Vietnamese authorities.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	361	I first sought to raise this issue on the Adjournment on 3 March, three days before the agreement was forwarded to Vietnam.  On 30 April I submitted a parliamentary question about the matter.  I join with other Members in expressing concern at the position into which parents and children have been put.  I also want to be positive.  It is absolutely urgent that a Minister visit Vietnam and the conclusion of the new agreement be achieved at a level that is acceptable to both sides of the protocol.  The same issue arises curiously with Russian adoption.  An administrative readjustment is not acceptable to those on the other side of the signing process.I have read with care the previous replies from the Minister of State.  Every Member in the Chamber shares his concern that children be given the maximum protection at the highest international standard.  That should not be set against the rights of children to have a life other than in an institutional setting or the right of parents to provide a home for a child.Another issue arises with the manner in which there has been an administrative drag in this matter, separate from the Minister of State and Parliament.  We are now at a stage where the matter is extremely urgent.  With the absence of a new agreement, the whole adoption process has shut down since 1 May .  Those with existing adoptions registered, those waiting for registration and those in process are all affected.  In his last detailed reply, the Minister of State gave assurances about some of these categories which are not at risk.  What about those places where negotiations have been initiated but not concluded?  Will the Minister of State take this matter in hand and resolve it?The Department of Foreign Affairs arranges the signature of international agreements, the text of which has been brought to conclusion by the lead Department.  The lead Department, however, is not the final arranger to the assent of both sides at the signing of protocols between countries.  One must respect the other side of the agreement, in these cases the Vietnamese Republic and Russia.  The advantage of this is that one would have a completed agreement that could be used as a model, not just in content but as a process for conclusion.  We want to achieve a resolution to this matter as soon as possible.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	362	Considering the importance of Vietnam as a country for adoption by Irish couples and families, it is an absolute disgrace the Government allowed the bilateral inter-country agreement between Ireland and Vietnam to lapse on 1 May 2009.  The Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, is the one most responsible in this matter.  He was warned by supporting NGOs, prospective adoptive families and Members of the House on numerous occasions in recent months that time was running out on renewing the agreement.  However, he showed no sense of urgency and took no urgent steps to ensure a fresh agreement was in place by 1 May.In this case, the blame cannot be laid at the door of the recession.  It was plain, old fashioned negligence and laziness.  If the Minister had travelled to Vietnam last year, undoubtedly everything would have been resolved by now.  It was not until the week commencing 20 April 2009 that the Minister bothered to send an Irish delegation to Vietnam, a week before the expiry date on 1 May.  Too little too late.France had no difficulty negotiating a new bilateral adoption agreement with Vietnam.  Why should Ireland be different?  If only the effort had been made.Now over 1,500 prospective adoptive families who are at various stages of the adoption process are left in the lurch.  They do not know when, or if, a new agreement will be reached.  Their efforts to adopt have been stopped dead at various stages of the process, short of the referral stage.The hundreds of Vietnamese children, most of whom are living in orphanages in poor conditions and had the expectation of a new life in a family environment in Ireland, have had their hopes, and perhaps their futures, dashed.  The very minimum the Minister should have done was to put in place an interim agreement to continue the process pending the negotiation of a new agreement.As a mitigating factor in his defence, the Minister of State claims the need to ensure the principles of the Hague Convention are adhered to.  That is not the case.  It is simply another reason he should have acted with alacrity and circumspection to resolve the matter.Issues with other countries regarding the Hague principles, particularly Russia, have yet to be resolved.  It is high time the Minister of State fulfilled his responsibilities to all concerned at home and abroad.

I hope he can put on record the facts surrounding the current negotiations between Ireland and Vietnam.  Of course the issues in question are complex but prospective adoptive parents need to have the most up-to-date information made available to them.Obviously, families have real concerns about a difficult process which can take four or five years to complete.  Perhaps the Minister of State will outline what he is doing to bring the negotiations to a conclusion.Another issue that has arisen from this debate, particularly in the Dublin area, is the need for staff to speed up these assessments.  Perhaps the Minister of State can outline the communications his officials have had with Vietnam and Russia regarding future bilateral adoption agreements.  I hope for a successful outcome in this.It is important to express our concern about the HSE's role.  Obviously, international agreements are complex and other countries are seeking post-adoption commitments from Ireland.  The HSE should be pulling out all the stops to make this happen so that children are protected.  I do not think it is focusing closely enough on the issue at present, however.  At the heart of the matter are children living in faceless institutions who deserve the comfort of a family home.  If the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, is required to travel to Vietnam, I urge him to go.  The Department of the Taoiseach should get involved if representation is needed at a senior level.  We should bring all the force of the State to bear on this issue because the wait cannot be allowed to continue.  The complexities can be ironed out and I recognise that the Minister of State is working diligently on bringing the issue to a satisfactory conclusion.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	364	I thank the Deputies for raising this issue and affording me the opportunity to outline the current position on this sensitive matter.  I will begin by putting the subject of inter-country adoption into context.  Inter-country adoption has become an increasing phenomenon in recent years.  The International Social Service has estimated that between 30,000 and 40,000 children around the world are adopted annually.  These children generally come from developing countries or those in transition and are received by families living in industrialised countries, particularly in Europe and North America.  This trend is reflected in Ireland, as requests for inter-country adoption assessments are continuously increasing.  A study on inter-country adoption undertaken by the children's research centre in Trinity College revealed that Ireland has one of the highest rates for inter-country adoption in Europe.It is against this background that my office is working to create the appropriate legislative, policy and administrative frameworks to ensure a well regulated regime of adoption.  Our aim is to support and protect prospective parents and, more important, the children for whom adoption services are devised and provided.Deputies will be aware that the Adoption Bill 2009, which will give force of law to the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption, was published on 23 January 2009.  A core principle of the Hague Convention is that inter-country adoption should be child centred, that is, in all stages of the process the child's interests must be paramount.  Legislating for inter-country adoption is essential to give protections to children in the process of adoption.  The Hague convention has put in place the equivalent of a contract between states to regulate the standards that will apply in each jurisdiction.  It is an additional safeguard for a receiving country like Ireland regarding the standards that are applied in a sending country over which we have no jurisdiction.  As a receiving country, it is especially important to have confidence in the process of consent to the adoption, the status of the child as adoptable and the guarantee of no improper financial gain from the process.  The convention is based on the premise that inter-country adoption should only be considered when a suitable family cannot be found for the child in his or her country of origin.  Accordingly, a series of options such as the child being cared for by relatives or in a family within his or her own country are primary considerations.  The convention does not oblige a sending country to engage in a particular number of adoptions; rather countries are advised to engage in only as many inter-country adoptions as they can reasonably control.  The Department of Health and Children fully supports this approach.Despite the situation in individual countries, on a global scale fewer children appear to be available for inter-country adoption.  Many developing countries are no longer able to release enough children to respond to the adoption requests of receiving countries and this situation can create pressure on sending countries which jeopardise the paramount interests of the child.I firmly believe that legislation and specifically the regime of the Hague convention provides an assurance for individual children, their families and the State that appropriate procedures have been followed and that an adoption was carried out in the best interests of the child.  As such, it is our intention that all inter-country adoptions will now meet the standards of the Hague convention.  Under the proposed new legislative regime, prospective adoptive parents will be able to adopt from countries which have ratified the convention or from those countries with which Ireland has a bilateral agreement based on Hague standards.  As part of the preparations for the likely passage and entry into force of these new legislative arrangements, my office has been liaising closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs to identify and negotiate with countries seeking homes abroad for children in need of alternative care which cannot be provided domestically.  We are working actively to assess the possibility of entering into bilateral agreements with a small number of countries, including Vietnam and the Russian Federation.In the case of Vietnam, we have a foundation in the form of the agreement which expired in recent days.  We have no agreement in place with Russia although many Irish applicants adopt from that country.  We understand there may be issues on the Russian side regarding placements with Irish applicants.  This matter appears to pertain to the provision of post-adoption reports in respect of children already adopted in Ireland.  I am examining the matter and will report separately and in detail to the House on it.  A meeting has taken place today between my Office and the Russian Embassy regarding the removal of the HSE from the blacklist issued by the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	370	It is a problem which I would not like to say is entirely the fault of the HSE.  Indeed, I would say it is not the fault of the HSE in most cases.  It would be inappropriate to use the word "fault" in this instance.  I think it is simply a practice that has developed but the Russian authorities have put their foot down and we need to respond accordingly.  My office is undertaking preparatory work on the contents of an agreement with the Russian Federation which includes anticipating its likely requirements.Work on a bilateral agreement with Vietnam has been ongoing for over 14 months.  During this period, three visits have been made to Vietnam by officials from my office, most recently to discuss the draft text of an agreement.  As Deputies will be aware, the current agreement enabling inter-country adoption from Vietnam to Ireland expired on 1 May.  The Government considered the agreement and the possibility of a roll over for a five year term but, in view of the pending adoption Bill 2009 and the serious concerns raised in other jurisdictions regarding adoption in Vietnam, it decided it would have to negotiate a new and strengthened agreement.  This decision was communicated to the Vietnamese Government through the appropriate diplomatic channels and a draft bilateral agreement was provided to the Vietnamese side.  In order to progress the matter, an Irish delegation travelled to Hanoi on the week commencing 20 April 2009, which was the earliest opportunity to meet with the relevant Vietnamese Ministries, for an intensive round of discussions on this draft bilateral agreement.  Although significant progress was made on the draft agreement, a number of issues remain outstanding.  These negotiations are ongoing and have not yet concluded.  I reiterate my personal commitment, and the commitment of the Government, to continue with these discussions with a view to bringing them to a conclusion at the earliest possible date.  It is anticipated that further proposals to advance the discussions will be made to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam in the coming week.  It is also anticipated that the Vietnamese side will revert with proposals shortly.I do not wish to speculate on the timeframe for or the outcome of these negotiations as these factors are genuinely difficult to determine.  I can say, however, that efforts on the Irish side are intensive and will continue in the coming weeks.  There has been a high level of engagement and it is clear from progress so far that there is a willingness on both sides to bring these matters to a successful conclusion if at all possible.My colleagues in Government and I are conscious that prospective adoptive parents find the lack of definitive information extremely frustrating.  However, it should be remembered that another sovereign Government is party to the discussions and consequently it would be unwise and inappropriate to air the issues or negotiate this very sensitive matter in the public domain.  As doing so may jeopardise the prospects of concluding a new agreement, further details are not being made available at this time.  Furthermore, it is also the case that speculation on the either the nature of the issues or the degree of progress being made is unhelpful and may prove misleading and distressing to those applicants currently waiting.The situation in which we find ourselves arises through no lack of effort on the part of the Government or engagement by the Vietnamese side.  These are complex matters and the Government is aware of the concern and anxiety this process is causing to prospective adoptive parents.  It is also firmly committed to ensuring that arrangements between Ireland and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam protect the best interests of the children, their families and prospective adoptive parents.  As Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs, I have communicated at every opportunity updates to prospective adoptive parents and their representative groups on these matters and I have committed to continue with this process.  While every effort will be made to conclude a bilateral agreement with countries from which children have traditionally been adopted by Irish applicants in advance of any of the proposed changes in Irish law taking effect, it must be acknowledged that these matters will be determined to a considerable degree by the governments of these sovereign states.The adoption of any child, either domestically or from abroad, involves a legal process and has emotional and social considerations.  Although the process can be lengthy, it is important rigorous systems are in place in which we can all have confidence.  However, we in Government have a responsibility to ensure the best interests of these children and all other children being adopted by Irish people are promoted and protected.

The Government has said repeatedly child care is a priority and providing child care opportunities for low income families and parents is a critical part of the programme for Government.  Nonetheless, this crèche, which has provided a valuable service for the past ten years, will close its doors at the end of June.  We have listened to endless lectures from the Government about how child care facilities, particularly for low income or unemployed parents, are absolutely critical to allowing them to continue at work or to return to education and training.I fear the threatened closure of this crèche will be the first of many, as funding cuts bite and confusion reigns about Government policy in this area.  I am informed by the management committee that the changes put in place by the Government last July in funding and staffing such crèches has made the Mountview crèche financially unviable.  I am advised by the committee that the changes in the funding structure and the new subvention scheme have greatly reduced the income of the crèche and, despite strenuous efforts, the committee has been unable to secure future funding for the crèche.  It has exhausted every available avenue in its efforts to secure the future of the crèche, including engaging with the enterprise officer of the Blanchardstown area partnership, drawing up a new business plan, which resulted in a substantial increase in fees to endeavour to meet crèche costs, reducing unnecessary expenses for food from the account, reducing staff numbers by one in 2008 and exploring collaborations with other organisations to save the crèche.I call on the Minister of State, who has specific responsibility for this area, to bring the parties together to see if a rescue of this important facility can be effected.  In particular, the Minister for Finance announced the early childhood subsidy would be replaced by a new scheme providing for a new preschool year in early childhood care and education.  If the details could be made available, perhaps the initiative could help to save the crèche or some of its activities and make the balance of its other activities viable.  The Minister of State must bring all the parties involved in such community crèches, the county child care committees, the partnerships and sponsors and funders of such community facilities together, otherwise the closure of the Mountview centre will become the first of many.It is ironic that the letter to parents advising the closure of the facility is on notepaper headed, "National Development Plan — Your Plan, Your Future".  All the funding was apparently provided for but now it is not.  Lone parents and members of low income families who have taken up some work, in particular, will experience a double whammy.  Their early childhood subsidy is being withdrawn by the Minister for Finance while, at the same time, crèche fees are increasing.  The early start initiative, which the Labour Party introduced in Government in 1994, has never been expanded.  It is the only full State scheme providing early childhood education.  Billions of euro have been poured into various initiatives under the national development plans and into the decentralisation programme, yet money is being withdrawn from child care services.I would like a serious response because while this crèche is important to the community in Mountview and the surrounding area, it will be the first of many closures the Government and the Minister of State's Department will initiate.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	374	I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.  Under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006, EOCP, which was co-funded under the European Social Fund, ESF, targeted support was provided through the EOCP staffing support grant scheme.  Community-based not-for-profit child care providers with a strong focus on disadvantage were awarded grant aid towards their staffing costs to allow them to operate reduced fees to disadvantaged parents.  Funding under this scheme was originally awarded for a limited period during which services were expected to move towards sustainability.  This funding was subsequently continued to the end of 2007, where it was considered necessary to enable services to remain accessible to disadvantaged parents.  This continuation funding was subject to the condition that tiered fee structures were implemented by the services in question.  However, in approximately half these services, it appears this was not the case.Under the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010, the community child care subvention scheme continues to support community-based not-for-profit child care providers.  Funding amounting to €158.2 million is expected to be allocated to the scheme between 2008 and 2010, a significant increase on the €37 million allocation in 2007 for the support scheme under the EOCP.  While many services are in receipt of substantially increased levels of support funding under the CCSS, all services have been guaranteed funding of not less than 85% of the level of support they received under the EOCP in 2009, and not less than 75% in 2010.Funding levels under the CCSS are calculated following the child care services making an annual return of parental declarations, which allows the level of disadvantage being catered for by the individual services to be established.  The service in question has been notified by the child care directorate of my office that its funding level in 2009 totals €52,132, which consists of a subvention based on parental returns of €37,440 and a top up of €14,692, to bring the funding up to 85% of the annual funding level which previously pertained under the EOCP.  The group had applied for capital funding of €720,000 under the NCIP to construct an extension to the facility and renovate and equip two existing rooms.  It was notified recently that the programme's 2009 capital allocation had been finalised and the capital commitments made under the NCIP is sufficient to fully utilise the programme's funding in both 2009 and 2010 and that, therefore, that it was not possible to approve its grant application at this time.I understand the group has notified Pobal, which administers the CCSS on behalf of the child care directorate, that the facility is due to close on Friday, 26 June 2009.  A Fingal county child care committee development worker has spoken with the group and has informed Pobal that the main reason for the closure is the family resource centre is moving out of the building to new premises but is not bringing the child care element with it.  Pobal's understanding is that the family resource centre was covering the general overheads of the building, which the child care service will now have to cover to stay in operation.

Certainly, on the basis of projected 2009 costs the group provided to Pobal, its unit cost per place would be €260, despite having no rental costs, which would potentially make them the most costly service in the scheme.  To date, the group has received 50% of its 2009 CCSS approval amount to bring it up to its proposed closing date.Fingal county child care committee has agreed to go back to the group to discuss the new options it may have under a combination of the new free preschool year in early childhood care and education, ECCE, which will be administered under the auspices of my office and the CCSS.  It is my hope the additional support that may be available to the group under the ECCE scheme will help it become sustainable.  The child care directorate of my office will give consideration to any proposals that may be put forward to assist this service to remain in operation.

As certain aspects of the new regulations could necessitate significant refurbishment works, the application of the provisions concerned to existing tenancies will be subject to a 4-year phasing-in "window", allowing landlords adequate time to make the necessary remedial improvements. However, all provisions of the new regulations are applicable immediately for any rental properties being let for the first time after 1 February 2009.My Department is in ongoing communication with the Department of Social and Family Affairs, which is responsible for the operation of the rent supplement scheme, through the Community Welfare Service, regarding the need to ensure that rent supplement–supported private rented accommodation meets the requirements of the minimum standards regulations.  In addition, my Department has written to all housing authorities to emphasise the importance, in this context, of regular liaison with, and appropriate action between, housing authorities and Community Welfare Officers at local level.Of course, effective enforcement of the new regulations is critical to their successful implementation. The number of inspections of private rented accommodation by local authorities more than doubled between 2005 and 2007, from 6,815 to over 14,000, supported by dedicated resources provided by my Department from the proceeds of PRTB tenancy registration fees.  While the data for 2008 are not yet fully finalised, the available information indicates a further substantial year-on-year increase of more than 20% in inspections last year.  I am committed to building further on this progress in the years ahead.

Given the more constrained resource environment, it is more important than ever that we continue to adapt our approaches to social housing delivery to ensure that we make best use of the resources available in terms of both meeting housing needs and achieving good value for money outcomes.  Long term leasing, now also being introduced, is designed with these objectives in mind.  I expect it to deliver at least 2,000 new homes in 2009 and I believe it has the potential to play an increasingly significant part in meeting social housing needs in future years.Addressing the housing needs of the most vulnerable sections of society has been the focus of particular attention by the Government and will remain a priority in the years ahead.  Specifically in relation to homelessness, considerable progress has been made, with a new homelessness strategy, The Way Home, adopted by Government in 2008.  The recent completion of a comprehensive Implementation Plan for the strategy and the provision of increased funding for homeless services provide further strong foundations for continued progress towards meeting the strategy's key objectives.

This decision is effective from 31 March 2009 and stands until the end of 2010.  My Department has, accordingly, written to all local authorities requesting their compliance.  However, in recognition of the priority attaching to the maintenance of key frontline services, my Department is consulting with the Department of Finance in regard to the management of relevant staffing needs.  The needs associated with local authority water treatment infrastructure will be considered in this context.In regard to the staffing requirements in each local authority, it is the responsibility of each county and city manager, under the Local Government Act 2001, to employ such staff and to make such staffing and organisational arrangements as may be deemed necessary for the purposes of carrying out the functions of the local authorities for which he or she is the manager. The matters raised in the question are, accordingly, appropriately determined at local level.The capital provision for water services infrastructure in 2009 is €500 million. The provision represents an increase of 1% on last year's outturn and, given the very difficult economic circumstances against which the 2009 estimates were framed, reflects the Government's ongoing commitment to the sector.  Good progress will continue to be made under the Water Services Investment Programme in 2009. It is expected that 40 water and waste water schemes will be completed this year and that up to 50 new schemes will be able to start; a total of 160 schemes are expected to be in progress at the end of this year.The majority of water and wastewater treatment plants are delivered under "Design Build Operate" contracts, maximising efficiency in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of this infrastructure.  In addition to increased capital funding, water services authorities can avail of ongoing training courses under the auspices of the Water Services Training Group in order to support and develop expertise in the water services sector.

The Programme for Government includes a commitment in regard to a scheme of support for the replacement and upgrading of septic tanks older than fifteen years with newer systems.  While my Department has been examining the conditions which might attach to such a scheme, the timeframe for pursuing this commitment will remain under ongoing review, having regard to current budgetary constraints. The Environmental Protection Agency has finalised an updated code of practice for waste water treatment systems for single houses which will incorporate the requirements of new European Standards due to come into force on 1 July 2009. I will incorporate the new Code of Practice under Part H of the Building Regulations as soon as possible this year.

Under section 60(3) of the Waste Management Act I am precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to the performance in particular circumstances by a local authority of a statutory function given to it under the Act.The Programme for Government clearly sets out the approach to waste management that will be reflected in national policy in the years ahead. It is firmly grounded in a continuing commitment to the waste hierarchy with a renewed drive towards the achievement of international best practice in the reduction, re-use and recycling of waste. This, coupled with an increasing emphasis on technologies for the mechanical and biological treatment of waste, will significantly reduce potential reliance on landfill and incineration. This commitment to the waste hierarchy has added significance in the context of the requirements of the EU Landfill Directive to divert waste from landfill. Meeting this obligation will entail doubling the existing level of diversion from landfill by 2010 and further increases in diversion in subsequent years.To assist in ensuring that our waste management system can act in support of these objectives my Department has initiated the major review of waste management policy foreseen in the Government Programme. This will be designed to support the necessary legal, institutional and policy framework to achieve international best practice in the management of waste and will involve a comprehensive examination of a broad range of waste management issues, including in respect of regional waste management planning and infrastructure provision.  I anticipate that the study will be completed by mid-2009 and published shortly thereafter. In the context of its recommendations I will bring necessary policy and legislative proposals to Government.

Where units delivered under Part V are no longer required for their original purpose, for example as affordable housing, they may be used for another purpose connected with the authority's functions.While the priority remains to sell affordable homes to eligible purchasers, where this proves not to be practical in current market conditions, housing authorities have been asked to undertake a comprehensive evaluation of the options for dealing with these properties, including their deployment for social housing purposes, where appropriate having regard to the principles of sustainable communities.  The options in this regard include sale under the Incremental Purchase Scheme, use of the units to provide social housing supports for an initial period of 5 years, or the  transfer of unsold affordable units into permanent social housing stock.In terms of the future implementation of Part V arrangements, it will continue to be a matter for individual planning authorities to decide, in the context of their housing strategies, the proportion, up to 20%, of lands to be reserved for social and affordable housing purposes.  My Department has indicated to authorities that it would be advisable for those that have not recently done so to undertake a review of their housing strategies to take account of the changed economic circumstances, including changes in the housing market, and likely developments in the period ahead.

On 23 April 2009, I announced that the Government have decided not to proceed with the implementation of electronic voting in Ireland.  A process will now be put in place, including discussions with the supplier, to address the disposal of the electronic voting and counting equipment and termination of storage arrangements.Responsibility for the security and safe storage of manual voting electoral materials (such as ballot boxes, stamping instruments and stationery) is a matter for the Returning Officers, who are statutorily responsible for conducting the polls.  Accordingly, similar responsibility was assigned to Returning Officers to make the necessary arrangements in relation to the storage of the electronic voting machines and equipment. Returning Officers undertook the task of procuring suitable accommodation for the electronic voting machines and ancillary equipment, and the detailed contractual and other arrangements put in place by Returning Officers reflected the varying circumstances applying at local level.In 2007, over 60% of the electronic voting machines (some 4,762 in total) were moved to a central storage facility located at Gormanston Army Camp.  The Government decision to centralise storage of the electronic voting equipment was made taking into account a range of factors, including costs of local and centralised arrangements and the likely benefits to be realised.  The Government decision to proceed with the movement of the electronic voting equipment to centralised premises was the right approach in the circumstances.My Department engaged consultants with valuation expertise in May 2007, following a competitive tendering process, to examine individual lease arrangements and to make recommendations as to termination of the leases where appropriate.  In May 2008, I accepted the recommendations made by the consultants and these recommendations are in the process of being implemented.  It is expected that, in certain instances, the termination of lease arrangements will give rise to buy-out costs and these will be dependent upon the outcome of negotiations. Work on the termination of local lease arrangements, including relating to Cavan/Monaghan, will now continue in the context of the decision taken to conclude the electronic voting and counting project.

The Government's housing policy statement, Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities, emphasised the Government's firm commitment to respond to the needs of households who face difficulty in resourcing home purchase on the open market.  The statement highlights the number of paths to home ownership already in place, such as affordable housing and tenant purchase schemes, and a number of paths that are currently under development, including the development of arrangements to allow for the tenant purchase of local authority apartments, which I am aiming to provide for by way of Committee Stage amendments to the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008, and the new Incremental Purchase Scheme.The objective of the incremental purchase model is to provide an affordable route to homeownership for households that are renting social housing, including from voluntary/co-operative bodies and under the Rental Accommodation Scheme, or households that are, for the first time, being allocated a new house provided by a local authority.  Incremental purchase offers social housing applicants the earliest possible start on the path to home ownership for those willing and able to undertake a house purchase.  This is in keeping with the graduated, flexible, housing support model, which is at the heart of Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities and also is in keeping with the Government's broader social policy objectives, particularly the life-cycle approach set out in the Towards 2016 social partnership agreement.  Provision has been made for this scheme in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008, currently before the Oireachtas.I also recently introduced new regulations to underpin local authority lending.  Housing loans are provided by local authorities for those who wish to build or purchase their own home but cannot access finance from private institutions, including affordable housing purchasers.  The Housing (Local Authority Loan) Regulations 2009 replace the previous regulations, providing for a new loan limit of €220,000 and a maximum income of €75,000 in the case of joint applicants and €50,000 for single applicants.  The regulations also provide for the introduction of a formal credit policy to ensure prudence and consistency of approach for all local authority mortgage lending.

I am confident that the financial provision for housing for 2009 will enable us to maintain a continued high level of momentum in meeting social housing needs.  Taking all the social housing programmes together, including those of the voluntary and co-operative housing sector, and having regard to the capacity to access suitable housing available in the current housing market, including through the recently announced long-term leasing initiative, some 7,000 completions are expected to be achieved this year, with a similar level of starts.My Department continues to explore all options for increasing the availability of social housing by optimising the use of available Exchequer supports and exploring alternative solutions to address housing needs.  Local authorities are encouraged to vary the supply options according to prevailing market conditions in order to optimise the delivery of social housing in accordance with the principles of Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities.  The evolution of social housing programmes over recent years can be seen in the manner in which the traditional social housing construction programme has been supplemented with other supply options including design/build contracts, Part V acquisitions, second hand acquisitions, turnkey projects and lease options under the Rental Accommodation Scheme.  The introduction of new long-term leasing arrangements this year is a further significant step in the expansion of social housing supply mechanisms and will play a significant part in enabling local authorities to meet housing needs.

The BER system was implemented on a phased basis as follows:in the case of new dwellings, with effect from 1 January 2007, subject to planning-related transitional arrangements which have now expired;in the case of new buildings other than dwellings, with effect from 1 July 2008, subject to certain planning-related transitional arrangements, which remain in force until 30 June 2010; andin the case of any existing building offered for sale or rent, with effect from 1 January 2009.It is the responsibility of a person who commissions the construction of a building or who offers a building for sale or letting to obtain a BER certificate unless the building is specifically exempted under Article 3 of the Regulations.  The Regulations also require the owner, or any agent acting on their behalf, to produce a copy of the BER certificate to any person expressing an interest in purchasing or taking a letting in the building and, on demand, to the local Building Control Authority.  I understand from Sustainable Energy Ireland that a total of 4,178 BER certificates for dwellings were issued last year.  To date this year over 29,000 BER certificates for dwellings have been issued indicating a substantial increase in BER related activity since the scheme was extended to the sale and letting of existing dwellings from 1 January 2009.I am aware of concerns in relation to compliance with the requirement for BER certificates within the private rented sector.  As stated in the reply to Question No. 197 of 30 April, 2009, my Department will keep the potential role of the Private Residential Tenancies Board in this matter under review.  The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive is under review by the EU and when this is finalised, amending national legislation will be introduced, if necessary.

As these projections were based on economic growth forecasts which were quickly overtaken by events, the EPA was asked to apply a sensitivity analysis which might better reflect the changed economic situation. This analysis, based on the ESRI's Economic Shock scenario, was published in March 2009. The updated figures indicated a Distance to Target for the Kyoto period 2008-2012 in the range of 1.3-1.8 million tonnes per annum, a reduction of around 3 million tonnes from the projections of last Autumn.In the current economic climate, an unusually high degree of uncertainty attaches to all projections.  It is now clear that the economic contraction will be deeper than assumed in the ESRI's about-mentioned scenario. It is quite possible that Ireland will now meet its Kyoto target for the non-trading sector without using carbon credits.  It is important to emphasise that the effect of the recession on our emissions is a short-term one and it would be a serious mistake to ease off on our efforts to address the underlying trend.  When economic growth resumes, so too will our emissions, growth unless we have the measures in place to reduce business.  The Government remains focused on this work through the Cabinet Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security, the most recent meeting of which took place just last week.

It is up to individual housing authorities to plan the composition, management and delivery of their social housing investment programmes having regard to the specific social housing priorities in their areas and to the Exchequer funding allocated to them, which is based on their identified 2008 statutory assessment of housing need.  Preliminary findings from the 2008 assessment are available on my Department's website, www.environ.ie.Information in relation to activity under the range of housing programmes in 2006, 2007 and 2008 is set out in my Department's annual and quarterly Housing Statistics Bulletins, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas library and on my Department's website.  In recent days, local authorities have been advised of their housing programme allocations for 2009.  Over €1.3 billion is being provided for the broad range of social housing programmes this year, with €760m of this earmarked for the main local authority housing programme, including €20 million for long-term leasing arrangements.  Taking all the social housing programmes together, including those of the voluntary and co-operative housing sector, and having regard to the capacity to access suitable housing available in the current housing market, including through the recently announced long-term leasing initiative, some 7,000 completions are expected to be achieved this year, with a similar level of starts.Based on the recently announced allocations, it will be a matter for housing authorities to finalise their plans for the composition, management and delivery of their programmes, taking into account existing commitments, identifying priority projects and proposals and providing a time line for delivery and a sustainable funding plan for each project and their programme as a whole.

In preparing a planning scheme, the Authority is obliged to have regard to its Master Plan, consult with Dublin City Council and other relevant statutory bodies, have regard to the Dublin City Development Plan, and arrange for submissions by interested parties.  The draft plan is then submitted to the Minister who, following consultation with the Minister for Finance and consideration of any objections from Dublin City Council, may approve it with or without modification.The 1997 Act provides that a planning scheme shall not include any class of development in respect of which an environmental impact assessment is required, other than industrial-estate development projects, urban development projects and seawater marinas. The draft Poolbeg planning scheme does not, therefore, encompass the area where it is intended to locate the proposed waste thermal treatment facility.  Following requests from interested parties, the Authority has extended the date for submissions, comments and questions on the draft Planning Scheme and the related Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) until Friday 8 May.

Both blanket bogs and raised bogs are protected habitats under European and Irish Law and representative examples have been designated as Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) under the Habitats Directive or as Natural Heritage Areas (NHA) under the Wildlife Acts. Ireland has some of the most ecologically important examples of bog habitats in the European Union.  In 1999, when the first of these sites was designated for nature protection, all commercial cutting on these bogs was stopped and the then Minister granted a ten year grace period for those who were cutting turf for their personal domestic use to find alternative sources of fuel.Blanket bogs, which occur predominantly on the Western seaboard but also in Wicklow and the midlands, can tolerate a certain amount of turf extraction without compromising their value as habitats. It is envisaged that cutting on Blanket Bog SACs and NHAs can continue, except in very sensitive areas, under the current restrictions, which prohibit commercial extraction and the use of "sausage" machines.  Raised bogs occur predominantly in the midlands. There are over 1,500 raised bogs in the State and only 139 of these are designated for nature protection as SACs or NHAs. The continued cutting of turf, by hand or machine, and associated drainage on these designated raised bogs, is incompatible with their preservation. Even with the restrictions in cutting that were introduced in 1999, over one third of the best bog habitat on these sites has been lost in ten years. It is clear that more needs to be done if we are to meet our obligation to protect this important habitat.The Habitats Directive imposes a legal obligation on the State to take measures to ensure the protection of this essential and irreplaceable part of our natural heritage. Therefore, in the light of the scientific evidence of continuing damage to these valuable habitats, it would not be appropriate to review the designations in these areas.  It is necessary to put arrangements in place to provide for more effective protection of these habitats, which will necessitate the transition to a cessation of turf cutting on the small number of designated raised bogs.I have established an inter-Departmental working group to consider how best to achieve this and to assess the resources that will be required. This group will consult with interested parties and representative groups, and report back to me later this year.  In the meantime, the voluntary bog purchase scheme will continue, subject to the availability of financial and administrative resources.  Under this scheme, priority will be given to acquiring turbary rights on the 32 raised bog SACs on which cutting is to end this year.

Success in addressing issues of anti-social behaviour is critically dependent on a co-ordinated effort involving all stakeholders, including An Garda Síochána, Government Departments and State agencies, local authorities, Joint Policing Committees, Local Drugs Task Forces and the local communities concerned.From a housing policy and operational perspective, the Government's housing policy statement, Delivering Homes Sustaining Communities, places actions on renewal and regeneration of social housing estates, and prioritisation of good estate management, at the core of housing services. These objectives are supported by significant Exchequer finance under the Social Housing Investment Programme.  While specific action to deal with anti-social behaviour is primarily a matter for An Garda Síochána under legislation within the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, a number of legislative measures are in place to assist local authorities to fulfil their responsibility, as landlords, to address anti-social behaviour issues in the context of the management and maintenance of their housing stock.The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1997 provides for a range of measures to assist authorities in addressing problems arising on their estates from drug dealing and serious anti-social behaviour. In addition, the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 extended to the Shared Ownership Scheme, the 1999 Affordable Housing Scheme and affordable housing delivered under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, the existing local authority power to refuse to sell a house under the Tenant Purchase Scheme to a person it has reason to believe is or has been engaged in anti-social behaviour or that a sale would not be in the interests of good estate management.A number of new legislative provisions in relation to anti-social behaviour are contained in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008, which completed Dail second stage  at the end of April. The Bill updates the definition of anti-social behaviour contained in the 1997 Act, to include damage to property, graffiti and significant impairment of the use or enjoyment of a person's home. In addition, provision is made in the Bill for changes to the terms and conditions of a tenancy agreement to specifically reference anti-social behaviour.At a more strategic level, housing authorities will be required to adopt anti-social behaviour strategies, providing for co-operation with other relevant bodies, particularly An Garda Síochána and the Health Service Executive; procedures for the making of complaints; and initiatives for the prevention and reduction of anti-social behaviour. Furthermore, the Bill extends the existing anti-social behaviour powers of housing authorities to cover a broader range of accommodation, including accommodation provided through rental or leasing arrangements.  In conjunction with the Attorney General's Office, I am examining the scope for additional changes to existing legislation to enhance the role of housing authorities in addressing anti-social behaviour. Any further measures arising from this examination will be incorporated in the Bill at Committee Stage in the Dail.

A planning authority may attach a condition to a planning permission requiring the giving of adequate security for the satisfactory completion of the proposed development and, if necessary, may apply any security given towards the satisfactory completion of the development in question.  Authorities have been advised by my Department that, in the case of residential development, planning conditions must require the giving of sufficient security prior to commencement of development.A planning authority may take enforcement action for non-completion of a housing estate in accordance with the conditions of the relevant planning permission.  Furthermore, planning authorities may refuse to grant planning permission, without recourse to the High Court, to any developer who has substantially failed to comply with a previous planning permission.  An applicant who wishes to have such a decision overturned will have to apply to the High Court.  While I am satisfied that planning authorities have substantial and adequate powers to compel the completion of residential developments in accordance with the relevant planning permissions, I will keep this matter under review.

The strategy must be informed by the best available scientific research in order to enable the various sectors to plan ahead and develop policies and strategies to enable Ireland cope with the likely impacts of climate change. The Department will be consulting with stakeholders, including local authorities, in developing the strategy.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	396	I refer to the reply to Question No. 81 of 11 March 2009.  Development plans provide the over-arching strategic framework for development within their areas.  As such, the development plan must offer clear guidance on sustainable development policies and objectives, both national and local, which address the full range of sustainability issues such as climate change, waste management, transport, urban development, sustainable communities and the use of natural resources.In June 2007, my Department published Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Development Plans.  The Guidelines state that it is imperative that the objectives and strategies set out in development plans are compatible with the Government's commitment to reducing energy consumption and modifying the impacts of climate change.  Development plans should be consistent with the objectives of national initiatives that will address energy and climate change issues such as the National Climate Change Strategy 2007-2012, which builds on the commitment to sustainable development set out in Towards 2016 and the National Development Plan 2007-2013.The Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) carried out as part of the development plan process should also improve the overall sustainability of plans by identifying and appraising environmental issues.  In order to assist planning authorities in the SEA process, the EPA has recently produced a draft manual on Geographical Information and Strategic Environmental Assessment (GISEA) which will allow planning authorities to overlap geographical information to particular areas.Furthermore, building on existing guidance and highlighting best practice examples of plans at different scales, my Department is also preparing new planning guidelines on local area plans.  A key element of these guidelines, which will be published later this year for public consultation, is the development of a "sustainability toolkit" which will focus on practical ways in which local planning policies can bring about better energy efficiency in new developments and how best to protect and enhance habitats and biodiversity, to integrate waste management into planning new development and support more use of sustainable transport modes, including public transport, walking and cycling.

The National Waste Prevention Committee, which operates under the aegis of the EPA, is the oversight body responsible for the coordination of actions to implement the National Hazardous Waste Management Plan.  In general terms my policy approach is to promote waste management approaches and methods in line with the EU waste hierarchy, with prevention and minimisation as the most favourable options.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	398	The report on the assessment of site conditions on Haulbowline by White Young Green (WYG) was made publicly available on my Department's website in December 2008. Hard copies were also made available where requested.  Furthermore, Professor Phillip Morgan (Sirius Geotechnical & Environmental Ltd) and Dr. Marcus Trett (Physalia Limited, Consultant & Forensic Ecologists) carried out a peer review on the WYG report which was also made publicly available. The WYG assessment found that there was no immediate health or environmental threat posed by the site and did not suggest a risk to the health of people on site undertaking normal activities or to those in the Cork harbour area including the Naval Base. The peer reviewers considered that the WYG report represented work of a quality consistent with good professional practice for such projects.Recommendations arising out of the WYG and Peer Review reports have informed my proposals in respect of the future management of the site which I will shortly bring to Government. These proposals are at present the subject of consultation with other relevant Government Departments, including the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment which has a current Government mandate to look at future re-development options for the site. A small number of works have recently taken place on site. These mainly relate to normal care and maintenance including the demolition of some old huts near the main entrance to the site, the cleaning of a castor pit which was being used to store hazardous liquid waste and the disposal of small quantities of waste materials from the main industrial part of the site.
#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	399	Estimates obtained from a number of local authorities and the Affordable Homes Partnership during the first quarter of 2009 indicated that the number of affordable units on hands nationally was in the region of 3,700 units.  Many of these are already in process of sale or are expected to be sold in the coming months.  Factors affecting the housing market generally, including availability of mortgage credit, have, inevitably, impacted on the purchase of affordable housing. In light of analysis by my Department and the Affordable Homes Partnership, and engagement with local authorities, my Department issued a circular to authorities recently setting out guidance on the approach to be followed in addressing the stock of affordable homes.  The circular also indicated that the local authority annuity loan limit has been increased to €220,000 to assist relevant purchasers in the current market, where private finance has become more difficult to access.The majority of affordable units on hands or likely to be transferred to local authorities this year flow from Part V agreements between developers and the authorities.  The price of these units primarily reflects the costs negotiated, in accordance with the relevant legislation, between authorities and developers. These costs are based on the sum of the site costs, calculated at existing use value, actual construction costs as agreed between the local authority and the developer, plus reasonable profit on those costs.   In the case of units which are due to be transferred to local authorities, the scope to re-negotiate agreements in light of current market conditions, including price or method of compliance with Part V, depends on the nature of the contract entered into with the developer in the context of the Part V agreement.Local authorities have been advised that, in the context of reduced open market prices, they may reduce the sale price of any affordable home through further subsidisation using Part V monies or other clawback proceeds on hands, where this is considered appropriate taking account of relevant factors in individual cases, particularly the continuing need to ensure value for money outcomes.  Local authorities are best placed to judge, on the basis of local circumstances, whether this is appropriate. My Department will continue to monitor and support local authorities' work to address these challenging issues, and will adapt and develop the approaches involved, as necessary, in the evolving housing market and economic climate.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	400	I refer to the reply Question No. 20 of 27 November 2008.  The Planning and Development Act 2000 updated and modernised planning legislation and introduced a range of measures to ensure sustainable development through the forward planning and development management processes and the enforcement of planning legislation.Development plans, prepared and adopted by local authorities under Part II of the 2000 Act, as amended, currently provide the over-arching strategic framework for development with a view to ensuring its sustainability in economic, social and environmental terms.  The legal provisions in relation to development plans are underpinned by statutory guidelines issued by my Department in June 2007 entitled Development Plans — Guidelines for Planning Authorities. More recently, Planning Guidelines on Sustainable Residential Development in Urban Areas were published in December 2008 and outline how planning authorities can ensure that, through the development plan and local area plan processes, quality new residential developments are planned and delivered in such a way as to be sustainable into the future, incorporating the highest design standards and providing a co-ordinated approach to the delivery of essential infrastructure and services. Both sets of guidelines are available on my Department's website at www.environ.ie.The Government's legislative programme, published on 22 April 2009, indicates that the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill is due to be published in the summer session. The Bill will aim, inter alia, to ensure a closer alignment between the National Spatial Strategy, Regional Planning Guidelines, development plans and local area plans. In addition, the Bill will require the preparation of a ‘core strategy' in development plans which will: set down the demographic and economic evidence basis for the plan including the location, quantum and phasing of land zoned for development purposes; identify the linkages to national and regional planning priorities; indicate the plans for provision of necessary infrastructure and how such plans are aligned with national infrastructure programmes; and indicate how the plan supports cross-cutting sustainable policies such as those addressing climate change and sustainable travel.

It is their duty to ensure, as far as possible and with the cooperation of the public, the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the Register.  In working to compile the Register for 2007/08, local authorities undertook and completed, with assistance from my Department, the most extensive registration campaign in decades.  On the basis of the work undertaken, I am satisfied that local authorities achieved a significant improvement in the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the Register compared to previous years.  The task for local authorities, in relation to the Register for 2009/10, was to maintain and build on the progress made to date.Authorities were required to publish the Final Register for 2009/10 by 1 February 2009 and this is now available for checking.  Individuals not on the Register can avail of the supplement to the Register up until 15 days before the next polling day i.e. Monday 18 May in the case of the elections being held on 5 June 2009.Looking to the future, the Programme for Government contains a commitment to establish an independent Electoral Commission.  The Commission's responsibilities will include taking charge of the compilation of a new national rolling electoral register.  My Department appointed consultants to carry out preliminary research on issues arising in relation to establishment of the Electoral Commission.  I published the relevant report for consultation on 10 February 2009, with a closing date of 26 June 2009.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	402	In line with the Programme for Government the energy efficiency requirements for dwellings specified under Part L "Conservation of Fuel and Energy" of the Building Regulations 2005 were improved by 40% in 2007 and will be further upgraded to yield a 60% improvement in energy efficiency in 2010, relative to 2005 standards.  My Department is also working on the development of a strategy for achieving a carbon neutral building standard for dwellings from 2013, which will require further substantial amendments to the building regulations.  The introduction of such a standard would require the preparation of a Regulatory Impact Assessment which would, inter alia, consider the impacts on those on lower incomes.  Amendments to the Building Regulations generally apply to new dwellings and to existing dwellings only where major renovations are undertaken.My Department is committed to the improvement of the insulation and general energy efficiency of local authority houses and to that end has developed a comprehensive national programme for the ‘greening' of the social housing stock.  This programme includes a range of energy efficiency initiatives for which some €50 million has been set aside in 2009.The range of energy efficiency initiatives includes a programme of Towards Carbon Neutral demonstration projects, focussed on the construction of dwellings to achieve a minimum Building Energy Rating (BER) of A2, as well as a number of demonstration projects for the retrofitting of insulation and other energy efficiency measures in the existing stock of local authority housing to achieve minimum BER of B2.  It is our intention that the experience gained from these projects will inform our approach to both new construction and remedial works schemes in the future to ensure a viable and energy efficient stock of local authority housing into the future. The 2009 House Condition Survey will contribute to the overall strategy for efficiently and effectively delivering on this aspiration.Under the national programme, some €20 million will be provided in 2009 for an ambitious programme to achieve a BER rating of C1 in the case of dwellings due to be re-let during the year, as well as to address energy deficits in apartment complexes.  In addition, €14 million has been set aside within the range of initiatives to complete the National Central Heating Programme, which will deliver the installation of central heating and associated thermal insulation improvements in some 2,100 units in 2009.

Statistics on enforcement of the Regulations, furnished by local building control authorities to my Department for 2008 (the latest period for which figures are available) show that thirty four enforcement notices were served by building control authorities under the Building Control Act 1990 for non-compliance with the various Parts of the Building Regulations. In addition, nineteen summary prosecutions were taken by the authorities. The statistics do not provide details as to the reason for the enforcement notices or prosecutions, or the individual developments concerned. However, my Department understands that no enforcement notices or summary prosecutions were undertaken in relation to the use of pyrite.

On 23 April 2009, I announced that the Government have decided not to proceed with the implementation of electronic voting in Ireland.  In announcing the decision, I stated that significant additional costs would arise to advance electronic voting in Ireland and that the decision had been taken to avoid such costs, especially at a time of more challenging economic conditions.  The financial and other resources that would be involved in modifying the machines in advance of implementation could not be justified in present circumstances. I also stated that the public in broad terms appear to be satisfied with the present paper-based system and this must be recognised in decisions on the future steps to be taken with the electronic voting system.A process will now be put in place, including discussions with the supplier, to address the disposal of the electronic voting and counting equipment and termination of storage arrangements. Proposals made to my Department in this regard will be considered as part of the process.  To date, there have been no contacts with other jurisdictions along the lines referred to in the questions.The total expenditure on the development and roll-out of the electronic voting system to date is some €51.3 million, the bulk of which has been incurred in purchasing the voting machines and ancillary equipment. These costs are set out in the following table.Expenditure itemCost€mVoting machines43.941Ancillary equipment (Ballot Modules, Programme Reading Units, PCs, trolleys, tables, etc.)2.330Awareness and Education campaigns2.566Voting Machine development, election software development/training etc.0.828Consultancy/testing0.731Miscellaneous (staff training, freight,)0.924Total51.320Based on figures received in my Department from Returning Officers, the total annual costs for storage of the electronic voting equipment (including the cost of insurance, service charges, rates and heating) for 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 were some €658,000; €696,000; €706,000; €489,000; and €204,000, respectively.  In 2007, over 60% of the electronic voting machines (some 4,762 in total) were moved to a central storage facility located at Gormanston Army Camp.  Costs incurred in respect of the movement and storage of this equipment are some €328,000.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	407	I propose to take Questions Nos. 48 and 52 together.Funding is available from the European Globalisation Fund (EGF) for workers in EU Member States made redundant as a result of major structural changes in world trade patterns due to globalisation and subsequent market impacts within the European Union.  Until now at least 1,000 workers had to lose their jobs in a single enterprise within a reference period of 4 months as one of the key eligibility criteria under the EGF.  However, the Regulation governing the EGF is being revised at present in order to ensure that it better responds to the needs of affected EU workers.  The proposed revisions include the halving of the current threshold number of redundancies to 500, an increase in the co-financing rate from up to 50% to 65% and doubling of the permitted period for use of co-financing from 12 to 24 months. These new measures, which were strongly supported by the Government in the course of recent negotiations at the European Council, will make the Fund more accessible and will apply to applications made by member States between 1 May 2009 and 30 December 2011. The revised Regulation is in the process of being adopted by both the European Parliament and the European CouncilIn this context and with a view to pursuing the making of an application under the revised EGF Regulation in respect of redundant workers at Waterford Crystal, my Department has been in contact with the European Commission.  Apart from any application that might be made under the EGF, the Government has already put in place supports to facilitate those workers made redundant at Waterford Crystal to benefit from retraining, upskilling or the availing of educational opportunities in order to assist in their eventual reintegration into the workforce. In this regard FÁS has put in place a dedicated team to assist workers at Waterford Crystal with individual skills assessment, occupational guidance and advice, job search assistance and training. FÁS is also working collaboratively with other statutory agencies and educational institutions in the South East Region. Since November 2008 it has provided guidance sessions for 520, and training for 336, of the former employees of Waterford Crystal.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	408	Unemployment is increasing across the country due to the downturn in the economy and this has impacted on the Tallaght area also.  This situation is unwelcome and is an indication of the challenges that are now facing the labour market and the economy as a whole.Employment/unemployment is measured by the Quarterly National Household Survey published by the CSO.  It does not provide data on particular counties but only on Regions.  Employment in the Dublin Region, which includes Tallaght, has dropped by 19,800 and unemployment has increased by 15,000 in the year to Quarter 4 (September — November 2008), the latest period for which data is available.  The number of persons signing on to the live register in the Tallaght region as at end April, 2009 stands at 8,787, an increase of 97% over the last twelve months.The Live Register, however, is not a measure of unemployment as it includes part-time, seasonal and casual workers who might be signing on from time to time. In response to the challenge of increasing unemployment my Department through FÁS, the National Training and Employment Authority, continues to prioritise the need to assist and up-skill those who have become unemployed as a result of the present downturn in the economy.  We have taken a range of steps to expand services to the unemployed.   In addition to the 51,000 FÁS training places announced on the 5th February, 2009 a further 18,725 training places for the unemployed were provided in the supplementary Budget to bring the total number of training and work experience activation places funded by my Department in 2009 to approximately 128,000.  Further measures announced in the supplementary budget are being prepared and details will be announced in the near future.In terms of job creation, Enterprise Ireland's (EI) activity in Tallaght is focused on the creation of new jobs through supporting entrepreneurs in manufacturing and internationally traded services companies. Enterprise Ireland activity, in terms of job creation, is focused on the retention and creation of new jobs in existing companies, and the creation of new jobs by supporting entrepreneurs to set up High Potential Start-Up Companies. The agency works closely with the Tallaght Institute of Technology in encouraging the commercialisation of research and has approved financial support of over €2.6m to the Institute for the development and management of a Campus based Incubation Centre.  This centre provides entrepreneurs with affordable space in an environment which provides support to them to research their new ideas and to afford them the opportunity to bring about new indigenous businesses.The agency has also approved support of €1.225m for a Centre of Excellence at the Institute of Technology Tallaght, the focus of which is Microsensors for Clinical Analysis.  Since the beginning of 2005 to date, Enterprise Ireland approved support in excess of €21m and made payments of over €12.3m to companies in South County Dublin to enhance their capacity, capability and performance.Over the past 5 years, IDA Ireland's focused strategy for South Dublin has been to promote the county as part of an integrated East Region with access to a population base of 1.5 million people.  Tallaght and South County Dublin are well equipped to compete with other areas for potential foreign direct investment, with superb infrastructural facilities at Citywest and Grange Castle, and a third level Institute of Technology at Tallaght. Both of these business parks are easily accessible to the population of Tallaght and the environs.In Grange Castle, the pharmaceutical company Wyeth Biopharma has established the world's largest biopharma campus facility investing €1.8 billion and currently employs approximately 1,300 highly skilled people.  Planning Permission has also been approved for an Advance Integrated Circuit Manufacturing and Research facility at Grange Castle — this is the largest planning application to date in the State. This will be an invaluable tool for the future marketing of Grange Castle as a potential source of high quality and large-scale employment for the population of the environs, including Tallaght.  Grange Castle continues to attract high level FDI and the announcement in November 2008 that Microsoft Corporation has selected Grange Castle as the location for its new European data centre is a further indicator of Ireland's standing internationally as a global knowledge based economy.  Microsoft plans to invest $500m in the construction of the data centre and will employ up to 75 people.  IDA, in conjunction with South Dublin County Council, will continue to market the County to new and existing client companies in the future.Finally, South Dublin County Enterprise Board (CEB) continues to provide support for small businesses with 10 employees or fewer in the start-up and expansion phases, to promote and develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level throughout South Dublin, which is inclusive of the Tallaght area. Business growth and job creation are inherent considerations in the activities of the CEB.  The CEB delivers a series of Programmes to underpin this role and they can provide both financial and non-financial assistance to a project promoter.  During 2009 South Dublin CEB will continue to support enterprise development in the area through the provision of both direct and indirect assistance and will ensure that available funds are targeted to maximise entrepreneurial development at county level.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	409	In 1992, under Section 42 of the Industrial Relations Act 1990, the Labour Relations Commission, following consultation with ICTU and IBEC, prepared a Code of Practice on Dispute Procedures including Procedures in Essential Services (S.I. No 1 of 1992).  The Code is designed to assist employers and trade unions in making agreements which recognise the rights and interests of the parties concerned and which contain procedures to resolve issues in a peaceful manner and avoid the need for any of the parties to resort to actions which will lead to a disruption of supplies and services.The procedures in the Code provide a framework for the peaceful resolution of disputes, including disputes in essential services.  The Code recognises that there is a joint responsibility on employers and trade unions to resolve disputes in essential services and employments without resorting to strikes or other forms of industrial action.  While the Code of Practice is voluntary in nature and is not binding on employers or trade unions, the Code is admissible in evidence in any proceedings before a Court, the Labour Relations Commission, the Labour Court, the Employment Appeals Tribunal, a rights commissioner or an equality officer.  Any provision of the Code, which appears to the Court, body or officer concerned to be relevant to any question arising in the proceedings, shall be taken into account in determining that question.In the National Partnership Agreement, Towards 2016, the parties acknowledged the importance of stable industrial relations and committed themselves to maintaining a well-managed industrial relations environment to prevent disputes affecting the level of service to the public. The parties accepted that providers of essential services and their staff have a special responsibility to ensure that they have well developed communication channels and to seek to resolve problems before they escalate into industrial disputes. It was agreed that if a problem cannot be resolved, all parties would take up all available dispute resolution mechanisms (both statutory and non-statutory). Complementary provisions were also agreed in the context of the Review and Transitional Agreement, 2008-2009.Accordingly, in the light of the general endorsement to date by the main representatives of employers and trade unions of the desirability, in the event of disputed arising in essential services, of recourse to the existing statutory and non-statutory dispute resolution mechanisms, I see no need for additional measures in this area, as suggested by the Deputy.

The Secretary General, Public Service Management and Development, has written to all Heads of Departments and Offices to ask them to ensure that the payroll arrangements are put in place in Departments and in the bodies under their aegis where public service pension schemes are in place.Regulations are in preparation in my Department on foot of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009.  These regulations will provide detailed instructions on operating and accounting for the pension-related deduction.  Parent Departments will have the responsibility to bring these regulations to the attention of the bodies under their aegis.  In the meantime, interim guidance on bringing deductions to account has issued to Departments providing them with the necessary information, which was also to be brought to the attention of the bodies under their aegis.  In the case of the company mentioned by the Deputy, the detailed implementation of these procedures in the health sector is a matter, in the first instance, for the Health Service Executive.

In order to provide assurance to the Russian Federation, the Health Service Executive (HSE) has furnished a letter to indicate their ongoing part in the provision of such reports and to their status as the statutory body with responsibility for child protection.  This letter was provided at the request of applicants who may have experienced queries in relation to arrangements for the provision of such reports.  The HSE has no statutory function in relation to the provision of post-placement reports, though it has and continues to facilitate the preparation of same.  The key commitment given is the legal affidavit to co-operate with the provision of such reports, required by the Russian authorities from all applicants.  Where parents do not co-operate there is no legal basis to enforce their co-operation with post-adoption reporting in this jurisdiction.My Office has been in touch with the HSE to clarify the situation in relation to any such list of outstanding reports.  The Executive has confirmed that reports continue to be supplied from all regions and that it is following up in respect of reports which may be completed but not yet transmitted.  Over 450 such reports were required in respect of 2008 and it is anticipated that around 400 will be required in respect of 2009 (not all due yet).  The HSE in all ten areas has conducted an extensive search for these alleged "missing" post-placement reports and, in total, some 34 have not yet been transmitted.  The majority of the outstanding reports have been completed and are with the adoptive parents for translation, apostilling and notarisation, that is, the social workers have already conducted the home visit and the report.In a small number of cases, parents have neglected or have been unwilling or unable to arrange for a home visit with their social worker.  Further contact has been made again to arrange for all outstanding visits to be undertaken and is being prioritised by the HSE Adoption Services to ensure that the parents can have the required reports forwarded to the Russian Embassy.  From information available at this stage, only one report has been "delayed" due to scheduling difficulties.  I am given to understand that a rescheduled visit is due to take place this week in relation to this particular case.  In this regard, it should be noted that while the Adoption Board facilitates the transmission of completed reports to the Russian authorities, there is no formal agreement nor obligation on the board to do so.Negotiations will be conducted with the adoptive parents support group to educate and encourage adoptive parents to process the Russian post-placements reports more expediently to ensure that this does not occur again.  In addition, the HSE social workers will further monitor the situation and actively encourage that parents co-operate more fully with the Russian Ministry of Education requirements.  I have also requested that this matter be raised directly with the Russian authorities.

The National Treatment Purchase Fund arranges treatment for patients who have been on a public surgical waiting list for more than three months.  It is open to the person in question or anyone acting on their behalf to contact the Fund directly in relation to their case.At my request, the NTPF, working with the HSE and the hospitals, has focused in particular on reducing the number of persons waiting for more than 12 months for treatment.  I am pleased to say that, as a result of the efforts made by all concerned during 2008, the total number of persons waiting over 12 months was reduced by 66%, from 4,637 to 1,576, between December 2007 and December 2008.  This improvement was also reflected in Letterkenny General Hospital, which reduced its total number of persons waiting over 12 months by over 75% during the same period.While these improvements are encouraging, I have indicated to the HSE and the NTPF that work must continue in 2009 in order to ensure that no patient has to wait longer than 12 months for hospital treatment.  It is possible that a number of those classified as waiting for more than one year are not in fact still awaiting treatment, or that they have declined an offer of treatment.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	439	As the Deputy will be aware I have responsibility for the implementation of the new scheme to provide a free Pre-School year of Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) which was announced recently by the Minister of Finance.  The scheme will allow children to avail of a free playschool place in their pre-school year, which will be provided for 3 hours per day, 5 days per week for 38 weeks.  It will also allow children in their pre-school year who are attending a full or part-time daycare service to avail of a free session of 2 hours and 15 minutes per day, 5 days per week for 50 weeks.  As the new scheme will be introduced from January next, the first full year will be from September 2010 and children availing of the scheme in January 2010 will have a reduced period of free pre-school provision.Participating children must, normally be aged between 3 years 3 months and 4 years 6 months on the 1st September of each year.  Exceptions will be allowed where children have special needs or it is necessary to accept children at an older age due to the enrolment policy of the local primary school.  Participating services will receive capitation of €64.50 per week where children attend for 38 weeks, and €48.50 where they attend for 50 weeks of the year.  Services will receive payments at the start of each term.  Where the child is attending full-day or part-time childcare, the service will be required to reduce the childcare fees by the amount of the capitation.  A participating service may also operate a pre-school service which is not within the scheme.A major benefit for pre-schools arising from the Scheme is that it will introduce certainty in their income, with payments being made at the start of each term. For many months now, I have had private pre-schools and their national bodies approaching me about high vacancy rates in services, often of 20-25%, with many on the brink of closure as a result.  For many, a significant part of their cost per place is to cover for unused places, and many pre-schools which had run 2 sessions per day have cut back to a morning session only, citing lack of demand.  This scheme will save these pre-schools, and allow them see out what are, in economic terms, tough times ahead for all of us.Certainly, I believe the suggestions from the Deputy that the scheme will push up fees for child day-care and close the majority of preschools are extremely wide of the mark.  The very large majority of services contacting my Office since the announcement of the Scheme have expressed their support for the scheme in strong terms, and many are considering expansion of their service as a result.  Similarly, I do not agree with the suggestion that services will increase fees for other children as a result of this new scheme.  In these circumstances, it is not credible that a significant number of pre-schools could increase their fees for such children without seeing an actual decline in total income, as their vacancy rates would almost inevitably rise further.  Such an outcome would benefit no-one, and so I do not expect it to come to pass.It is of course a national scheme, and whatever the level of capitation, it is inevitable that some services would have been charging higher fees prior to its introduction.  However, the level of capitation allowed for in this scheme is significantly higher than that proposed under the NESF's proposed free pre-school year scheme and is far higher than that allowed for under the scheme operating in Northern Ireland.  In the current Budgetary circumstances, I am glad that it is higher, not just than the fees charged in most services in Ireland, but by a great many in Dublin.  Services will also receive their payment at the start of each term, and will therefore have certainty about that income.Concerning costs, the figures provided to my Office by services, even those arguing that the capitation should be higher, indicate that services will be sustainable under the new scheme, and owner-investors will get a fair return on their investments, and owner-operators who are themselves working in the services will receive a fair income for the hours they put into their services.It is of course the case that some very high cost services may choose to stay out of the scheme, in much the same way as fee paying private Primary Schools choose to operate outside the national school system, but I believe that the very large majority of eligible services will participate in this scheme.  Participating services may charge for additional hours (e.g. when open for 4 hours per day), or for optional extras such as dancing classes etc.  However, the principle of free access for all eligible children in participating services will not be undermined, and all participating services must remain available to all in their community, regardless of the ability of parents to pay for additional services.

The 1961 Defamation Act provides that a person can be both fined and imprisoned for a maximum of seven years for the crime of blasphemous libel.  The Government is moving to reform that Act — for example by removing the possibility of imprisonment while respecting our Constitution, which requires specifically that blasphemy must be punishable by law.  I have also removed the possibility of private prosecutions for blasphemy.  It will no longer be a summary offence.  All prosecutions would have to be brought by the Director of Public Prosecutions.The intention is to strike a balance between the offence of blasphemy provided for in the constitution and the right to freedom of expression.  At Committee stage I would be prepared to consider an amendment to the definition of "grossly abusive or insulting" with a view to striking that balance.  I am also proposing the removal of imprisonment for the offence leaving a fine as the only sanction in the event of a conviction.

Her application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 28 November 2007, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her. She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State i.e. why she should not be deported.She was notified of her entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection pursuant to the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006. By correspondence dated 19 December 2007, an application for Subsidiary Protection was made on behalf of the person concerned by her legal representative. Following consideration of the information submitted, the application was refused. The person concerned and her legal representative were notified of this decision by letter dated 23 June 2008.Her case was then examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended, on the Prohibition of Refoulement. Consideration was given to representations submitted on her behalf by her legal representative for permission to remain in the State. On 9 July 2008, I refused permission to remain temporarily in the State and instead signed a Deportation Order in respect of her. Notice of this order was served by registered post requiring the person concerned to present herself at the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 on Tuesday 21 October 2008 in order to make travel arrangements for her removal from the State.I am satisfied that the applications made by the person concerned for asylum, for temporary leave to remain in the State and for Subsidiary Protection, together with all refoulement issues, were fairly and comprehensively examined and, as such, the decision to deport her is justified.  The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.  The enforcement of the Deportation Order is, and remains, an operational matter for the GNIB.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	447	I propose to answer Questions Nos. 95 and 96 together.As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the internet is an international and world wide phenomenon, it has no borders and no single organisation controlling it.  Therefore efforts to combat illegal and harmful materials and activities on it can often be hampered by the multiplicity of jurisdictions, differing legal systems and differing societal norms.  In this particular instance many of the major Social Networking Sites, including the site referred to by the Deputy, available here in Ireland are hosted outside this jurisdiction, principally in the United States.  As such they are subject to the US jurisdiction.While acknowledging these difficulties, I should emphasis that there is a robust self-regulatory framework for internet service providers (ISPs) in operation here in Ireland which actively encourages the adoption of best practice procedures aimed at limiting the proliferation of illegal and harmful content on-line.  The first thing someone should do if they are having issues with content on a Social Networking Site is report the matter to the website owners.  A person can use the website reporting tools to do this and should also contact the service provider through its Customer Care or Report Abuse facility.  The Internet Service Providers Association of Ireland (ISPAI) Code of Practice and Ethics sets out clear guidelines and minimum standards in respect of dealing with complaints regarding suspected illegal or harmful material on-line.  Members of the public may report such material to the ISPAI hotline.ie service.  If the material is hosted here and deemed to be illegal and in contravention of Irish law, ISPAI members are obliged to remove such materials.I wish to advise the Deputy that in 2008, the European Commission convened 18 of Europe's major social networking operators as well as researchers and child welfare organisations, to form a European Social Networking Task Force to discuss guidelines for the use of social networking sites by children.  These guidelines were to be adopted voluntarily by the European industry.  The Safer Social Networking Principles for EU were signed on Safer Internet Day, February 10 2009, in Luxembourg.  The Safer Social Networking Principles for the EU have been developed to provide good practice recommendations for the providers of social networking and other user interactive sites, to enhance the safety of children and young people using their services.  The Principles provide that social networking providers should, inter alia, provide a mechanism for reporting inappropriate content, respond to notifications of illegal content or conduct and should review their systems for examining reports of inappropriate or illegal content.  The European Commission has indicated that it will monitor on an ongoing basis the implementation of the Social Networking Principles.

In this regard, as I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, it would be inappropriate for me to have any involvement with an individual application.  However to be of assistance in the matter, I have had enquiries made with the Tribunal and I understand that the application is with a Tribunal Member for determination.  I can also inform the Deputy that when the decision of the Tribunal Member comes to hand, a copy will immediately be passed to the applicant's solicitors.

It is operated by the PRA and is available all year round and they will be pleased to deal with the Deputy's specific query in relation to this matter.

The aim of the Programme is to maximise participation in sport through the provision of modern high quality, safe, well-designed and sustainable facilities and sports equipment.  The provision of such facilities allows for increased numbers to participate in sport.A grant of €50,000 was provisionally allocated to the project in question under the Sports Capital Programme in 2006, and a further €50,000 in 2007.  The grant allocations were subject to the terms and conditions of the Programme, which include compliance with requirements relating to a deed of covenant and charge.A deed of covenant and charge provides, inter alia, for a refund of the grant in the event of the facility not continuing to be used for the purpose for which the grant was allocated.  The Department’s legal adviser, the Chief State Solicitor’s Office — CSSO — deals with the grantee’s solicitor in relation to the deed.  I understand that the CSSO recently received documentation regarding the case from the solicitors representing the organisation dated 5 May 2009.  The documentation submitted has been examined by the CSSO, who wrote to the grantee’s solicitor yesterday requesting further documentation regarding the deed.The position at close of business yesterday (6 May) remained that the CSSO awaits the submission of the outstanding documentation and will examine it expeditiously upon receipt.  If the documentation is in order then the legal issues can be concluded and, subject to compliance with the Programme's terms and conditions, a grant payment will follow.

One of the conditions of her assignment, as outlined in her contract of employment, is that she remain in location for a period of at least 12 months.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	460	There has been no change in the conditions for the jobseekers' schemes for part-time firefighters.  Social Welfare legislation provides that a person must satisfy the conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking work in order to be entitled to jobseeker's benefit or allowance.  Any person who fails to satisfy these conditions on an on-going basis is not entitled to a jobseeker's payment.Part-time firefighters are entitled to a jobseeker's payment in respect of days that they are engaged in fire-fighting or training.  However, they must continue to be available for and genuinely seeking work.  In this respect, Deciding Officers do not treat them differently to any other jobseekers.  In applying the legislation, Deciding Officers have regard to the availability of job vacancies in the locality, the age and educational qualifications together with the family circumstances of the claimant. The legislation does not impose any restriction or limitation on the right of a person to the opportunity to engage in the employment of his or her choice.  Where a person is seeking work in his or her usual employment and there is a reasonable prospect of securing work of that nature they would normally satisfy the conditions for receipt of payment.After a period of unemployment, a person must be prepared to accept any employment for which she or he is qualified.  It is a principle of the availability for work condition that a person's unemployment must be involuntary and it is not possible for a jobseeker to hold themselves available exclusively for employment that is within a restricted distance of a fire station where they are employed as a part-time firefighter. Such action would be taken as placing an unreasonable restriction on availability for full-time employment.  While the importance of retained firefighting personnel is fully recognised, the introduction of special arrangements exempting them from the requirements to fulfil any of the statutory conditions for the jobseeker schemes would raise equity issues vis-à-vis other jobseekers and I have no plans to introduce any such special arrangements.

The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support to eligible persons living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.Rent supplement is subject to a limit on the amount of rent that an applicant may incur.  Rent limits are set at levels that enable the different types of eligible household to secure and retain basic suitable rented accommodation, having regard to the different rental market conditions that prevail in various parts of the State.  The objective is to ensure that rent supplement is not paid in respect of overly expensive accommodation having regard to the size of the household and market conditions.The Executive has advised that rent supplement in excess of the current maximum rent limits, applicable to the household circumstances of this particular case, was paid as an exceptional measure for a three month period from 12 January 2009 to 4 April 2009.  The person concerned was advised on 2 February 2009 that rent supplement in excess of the relevant rent limits was being paid for a period of 12 weeks in order to allow him time to secure accommodation within the prescribed maximum rent limits.  The person concerned was also advised of his right to appeal against this decision to a HSE Appeals Officer.  To date, no appeal has been received.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-07 00:00:00	Prelude	462	Defined benefit (DB) pension schemes such as the scheme to which the Deputy refers are required to comply with the Funding Standard provisions set out in the Pensions Act.  This requires DB pension schemes to maintain sufficient assets to enable them discharge all accrued liabilities.  Where schemes do not satisfy the Funding Standard, the sponsors/trustees must submit a funding proposal to the Pensions Board to restore full funding within an agreed timescale (minimum of 3 years).Where a DB scheme winds-up, the order in which the liabilities of the scheme are discharged is also determined by the provisions of the Pensions Act.  Up to now, this meant that the future increases in benefits due to retired members were discharged before the accrued benefits of active and deferred members (i.e. current and former employees who have not yet reached normal retirement age).As the Deputy is aware, just last week I brought forward legislation to alter these priorities to effect a more equitable distribution of assets on the wind-up of an underfunded scheme.  While those already in receipt of a pension from the scheme and those who had reached normal retirement age at the date of the winding up of the scheme will not see their pensions reduced under the new priority order, the changes to the Pensions Act will see that benefits to active and deferred scheme members will be discharged before any post-retirement benefits are calculated.Although the amount of pension that individual members will receive on the wind-up of a scheme is dependent on the resources available, my Department  does not keep details of individual pension schemes.  However, I am not aware of any situation where a person will be completely cut off from their pension.  On the contrary, last week's changes to the priority order will ensure that those scheme members who have not yet reached normal retirement age at the date of wind-up will receive a more equitable slice of the assets of the scheme.The new Pensions Insolvency Payments Scheme (PIPS), also announced by the Government last week, will support the pension schemes that have wound up due to the insolvency of their sponsoring employer.  PIPS will work by allowing pension fund trustees to purchase pension payments from the State at a cheaper rate than by going to the market, thereby ensuring more fund resources are left to defray the liabilities of those active and deferred members who have not yet reached retirement age.Although there are no plans to extend PIPS to support the underfunded pensions of employers who are not insolvent, the Government is very conscious of the pressures on both sponsoring employers and pension scheme trustees, arising from the very significant losses incurred by pension funds over the last 18 months.  We are anxious to ensure, in so far as we can, that those involved have sufficient time and space to fully assess the implications of the current difficulties for their schemes and the remedial action they can take.  The Government is continuing to consider a number of options in relation to the ongoing security of pensions.  Any decisions in this regard will be made in the context of the National Pensions Framework which will be finalised shortly.

The EPA also provides details of the quality of urban waste water discharges and sewage sludges in its reports on Urban Waste Water Discharges in Ireland.Local authorities are responsible for the operation and maintenance of public waste water infrastructure and operate under the general supervision of the EPA, which can issue advice, recommendations and directions to local authorities. The EPA reports provide authorities with guidance in relation to any shortcomings in performance in individual locations.

I have no function in relation to the price at which particular units are sold. The sale price of an affordable home is determined largely by its cost.   For example, the price of units transferred to local authorities under Part V reflects the costs negotiated, in accordance with the relevant legislation, between authorities and developers. These costs are based on the sum of the site costs, calculated at existing use value, actual construction costs as agreed between the local authority and the developer, plus reasonable profit on those costs.  The scope for local authorities to re-negotiate prices in light of current market conditions would depend on the nature of the contract entered into with the developer in the context of the Part V agreement.Where authorities consider it appropriate, in the context of reduced open market prices and the continuing need to ensure value for money outcomes, they have the option further to reduce the sale price of any affordable house by further subsidisation utilising Part V monies, clawback or other internal capital receipts on hands.  Local authorities are best positioned to make judgments in this regard based on local circumstances.  In approving an affordable house purchase, local authorities must also consider the ability of applicants to make the necessary mortgage payments and satisfy themselves that the borrower's income is sufficient to meet the financial commitments involved under the scheme.Affordable housing is privately owned housing and, as such, is subject to the fluctuations of the market.   The current market value is used to calculate the level of clawback due in the event of resale of an affordable house and, where the gap between the sale price and market value has narrowed, the clawback reduces accordingly.  Where the clawback amount payable would reduce the proceeds of re-sale below the initial price actually paid, the legislation provides for the amount of clawback payable to be reduced to the extent necessary to avoid that result.

The course was not structured to deliver all the necessary skills for such a transfer of work and further training modules would be necessary before the trainees could undertake such duties.  In addition, such a reassignment would involve extensive consultation with the representatives of the staff concerned and the temporary veterinary inspectors.

The Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) in Ireland reflects the digitised details of land parcels as submitted to my Department under a number of area-based schemes. As well as the Single Payment Scheme, the LPIS supports Schemes under the Rural Development measures such as the Rural Development Protection Scheme (REPS) and the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme (DAS). These area-based Schemes account for some €2 billion payments to farmers annually. It is imperative, therefore, that the land details held by my Department are correct and up-to-date so that scheme payments are also correct and verifiable.In this context, the LPIS must be up-dated on an ongoing basis to take account of landscape changes, sales of house sites, land parcels being claimed for the first time etc. The LPIS is updated by way of maps received from farmers, findings of on-the-spot inspections of farm holdings, up-to-date ortho-photography and current satellite imagery.The contract for digitising onto the LPIS system is awarded by my Department following the completion of a public tendering process. Mallons Technology Limited holds the contract in the current year.  No additional costs have been incurred by the Department in the work undertaken to up-date the system.

The contract to carry out the developments of the eREPS system was entered into by Teagasc with software company Bizmaps.  The system, which was funded by the Department, is hosted by Bizmaps and is managed on the Department's behalf by Teagasc.  Bizmaps continues to be responsible for maintaining the system and for introducing new functionalities as requested by the Department.  A total of €1,494,413 has been paid to Bizmaps from 2006 to date for this service; €929,119 was paid directly to Bizmaps by the Department and €565,293 to Teagasc in respect of the costs incurred.I am advised that although there was a brief period on the 18 April 2009 when the system was unavailable due to a hardware fault, the issue was dealt with promptly and enhanced monitoring has been introduced by Bizmaps to avoid such disruption in future.

The person declaring the land for the single payment will be held responsible for any non-compliance with statutory management requirements under cross-compliance, or any failure to maintain the lands declared in good agricultural and environmental condition, whether this non-compliance was attributable to the applicant or attributable to the person to whom, or from whom, the land declared was transferred in the period between 1 January and 31 December 2009.  REPS applicants must detail all lands owned but leased out to others at the time of submission of an application to join the scheme.  As the closing date for receipt of applications for 2009 REPS is 15 May, any land leased out to a third party on that date cannot be declared by the owner for REPS payment.There are two categories under the 2009 national reserve.  Category A caters for farmers who inherit, lease or otherwise receive a holding free of charge or for a nominal consideration (not greater than €100 per hectare), where that holding was leased to a third party during the reference period, 2000-02.  The farmer from whom the holding is obtained must have retired or died before 16 May 2005.  Category B caters for farmers who entered farming for the first time after 15 May 2007.  Applicants under this category are required to meet other criteria relating to on-farm and off-farm income and certain farming qualifications held.  Applicants under the 2009 national reserve are required to declare the lands being applied for on their 2009 single payment scheme application forms.

The recently announced moratorium on public service recruitment prevents Teagasc from renewing such contracts.  The budgetary impact of the non-renewal of contracts is an operational matter for Teagasc.  My Department has allocated €132 million to Teagasc for non-capital purposes in 2009.  Subject to the level of resources available to the organisation, it is a matter for the Teagasc authority to prioritise its activities and to manage its budget accordingly.

It provides funding to students with disabilities, including visual impairment, who are attending courses in Irish and UK third level institutions and, since 1998, in post-leaving certificate centres.  The fund is administered on behalf of the Department by the National Office for Equity of Access to Higher Education.  The purpose of the fund is to provide students with serious physical and/or sensory disabilities with grant assistance towards the cost of special equipment, special materials and technological aids, targeted transport services, personal assistants and sign language interpreters.To be considered eligible for the fund, an applicant must meet the prescribed criteria.  Applications for assistance are made by the individual students through the disability or access officer of their third level institution, or by the principal of the student's post-leaving certificate college.  Students, on registration for their courses, should discuss their particular disabilities and the equipment or services required with the disability or access officer or the principal, as appropriate.

The progression of all large scale building projects, including the project in question, will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.  However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.

An approved college in the State, in relation to a year of assessment, is defined under section 473A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, to mean a college or institution of higher education in the State which provides courses to which a scheme approved by the Minister under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992, applies; or operates in accordance with a code of standards laid down by the Minister.  The college referred to by the Deputy has applied for approval for tax relief.  However, it appears from the information provided by the college to date that the college does not meet the definition of an approved college for the purposes of section 473A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  This has been confirmed by the Higher Education Training and Awards Council.

A great deal has been achieved in collaboration with the Department of Education of Northern Ireland.  The centre is delivering training programmes and commissioning research.The current economic climate has necessitated a thorough review of all educational projects and programmes requiring expenditure.  Given the competing demands within the education sector and the overall demands on Government finances, it has not been possible to provide additional funding to fully develop all projects that are under way.  The outcome of this process means that, unfortunately, my Department is not in a position to provide the funding required to expand the Middletown Centre as it intended this year, or to enable the capital project to proceed as planned.  I assure the Deputy that this decision does not mean that funding is been withdrawn from Middletown.  It will continue to be enabled to provide services and to develop some additional services.My Department is anxious to ensure the continuation of ongoing training and research programmes.  Officials in my Department will contact their counterparts in the Department of Education of Northern Ireland to work through associated details which may result from this decision.  The Department will keep the expansion of the Middletown Centre under review in the context of improved financial circumstances.
