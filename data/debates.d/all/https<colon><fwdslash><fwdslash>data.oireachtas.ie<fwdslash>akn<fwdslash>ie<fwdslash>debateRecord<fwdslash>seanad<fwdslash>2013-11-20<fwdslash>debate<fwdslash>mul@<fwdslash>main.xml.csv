I am proposing that we cancel business for tomorrow when we were due to take Report Stage of the Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. Committee Stage was taken yesterday, during which it was outlined that a number of new amendments were to be introduced on Report Stage. To give Members a chance to examine these amendments and, if they wish, table their own, I am proposing, at the request of Senator Thomas Byrne, that we take Report Stage next week, not tomorrow. Also, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, was due to come into the House tomorrow for statements, but I am told she will be delayed in the other House and unable to attend. As we do not have any other business ordered, I do not propose to deal with any business tomorrow.

While I understand the points the Leader has made, apart from what Senator Thomas Byrne said about the Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock, outlined clearly yesterday a substantial amendment to insert a new section into the Bill which those of us on this side of the House and other Senators deserve to have an opportunity to examine properly. I ask the Leader to arrange for an urgent debate on the fishing industry. The whitefish fleet is at crisis point. In the past couple of days 15 boats were tied up at Kilmore Quay at the request of the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA. That is ludicrous. Two boats had fish over quota, but the SFPA tied up the entire fleet, a total of 21 boats, and put 115 jobs at risk. Our whitefish quotas are totally inadequate. This is hereditary. I am not being political. In the past 40 years our fishermen have worked with their hands tied behind their backs. This is recognised by the fishing associations all the way from Rossaveal to the south coast and up to the Leader's county, to Kilmore Quay and Howth. If the SFPA and the authorities want to work rigorously within the law every boat from Donegal to Castletownbere to Howth will be tied up, day in, day out because we do not have the quota. In 2012 the French were entitled to take 24,000 tonnes of monkfish from our waters and the United Kingdom, 14,000 tonnes, but Ireland can take a mere 2,300 tonnes.

The United Kingdom did not use its full monkfish quota. Ireland caught 92% of its quota of megrim - a whitefish - in Irish waters, not the Bay of Biscay, the Mediterranean or the North Sea, whereas France caught only 43%. The French did not catch almost 60% of its megrim quota, but our boys are being tied up and criminalised for these offences.

In area 7, in our coastal waters, Ireland caught 104% of its prawn quota last year. Up to a few years ago prawns were not a quota species. As the French caught 11% of the quota, they did not take up almost 90% of their quota of the fish available around the coast outside our door, so to speak. Although there is scientific evidence that the fish are there, the Irish boats are being tied up day in, day out and jobs are being put at risk. It is crazy. This scientific evidence comes from the Marine Institute and from the European Commission which each year study the various species of fish. It is a disgrace. At a conservative estimate, 7 billion Irish fish have been taken from our waters in the past 40 years. When we were in financial difficulty the Commission was able to dictate exactly what we should do, telling us not to burn the bondholders and to support the banks, which we did, yet when we seek and demand a bit of extra fish quota to keep our fishermen and boats at sea and to sustain jobs we are given the thumbs down. It is about time we stood up and fought. I will seek an amendment to the Order of Business today on this issue, to ask the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to come into the House as a matter of urgency. The Seanad is not sitting tomorrow. I will demand that we sit tomorrow and have a long debate on fishing. It is crazy that 7 billion fish were plundered from Irish waters. Successive Governments have made mistakes. I have challenged Fianna Fáil Ministers year in year out.

Fishing is rarely raised here, but it is vitally important that we debate it from time to time. The result of the quota will be to decommission 50% of our boats if we comply with the law and that is a serious issue. Half of the trawlers and half of the fishermen have gone from the port of Castletownbere which is close to where I live. There are 700 employed in the fishing industry in the Castletownbere region, either directly or processing on the shore. Half of those jobs will go. It is a scientific and economic fact that a recent survey of Beara Peninsula showed that 70% of the economic output on the peninsula was due to the fishing industry. If we consider that, we can also consider Rossaveal, Kilmore Quay and Dunmore East in the same light. I will push very hard for an amendment to the Order of Business on this important issue. It is very serious that at any given time half of the whitefish fleet can be tied up at the behest of the SFPA. There is something ludicrously wrong in that. It is about time that the Minister demand extra quota or fair play from Europe for Irish fishermen in Irish waters.

There is a positive reason for this. We should not rush prematurely into Report Stage. Yesterday on the Order of Business I welcomed the fact that President Michael D. Higgins would make an official visit to Britain next year. It is great to see that this is finally happening. It is extraordinary on one level that it has not happened before now. The President spoke at the Hist. in Trinity last night and pointed out just how significant this visit would be for Anglo-Irish relations and the peace process. Could we have a debate in the new year, perhaps around the time that the President makes this visit, about the ongoing difficulties in the peace process? I am particularly concerned about the proposition made by the Northern Ireland Attorney General, John Larkin, that there be no further inquiries or inquests into murders that occurred before the conclusion of the Good Friday Agreement. The Tánaiste disagreed this morning with that proposition. It highlights the issues that recur in the peace process which is not by any means a smooth process. We need to review it and to consider the obstacles and difficulties that arise. I congratulate my Labour Party colleague, Senator Aideen Hayden, who will launch the annual report of Threshold, the housing organisation, today. The Senator does Trojan work as chairperson of Threshold. She has made a very important call for a much more rigorous certification process for the private rental market to ensure local authorities certify private rented accommodation and that people would no longer have to live in substandard accommodation. Will the Leader invite the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, to the House to debate that issue and the private rental sector generally and how best to regulate it in the interests of protecting tenants' rights?

It is the appropriate decision, but I am disappointed because this is the second time we were scheduled to have a debate on youth justice, which is a critical issue. I have prepared twice for this debate and look forward to it. Will the Leader reschedule that debate at the earliest opportunity? There are many critical issues for us to raise. I support Senator Denis O'Donovan's passionate and compelling call for a debate on fisheries policy. The special rapporteur on child protection, Dr Geoffrey Shannon, spoke at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children yesterday. He gave us a master class on children's rights and all that needed to be done and the committee fully agreed with him. He called for a ban on alcohol sponsorship of sport, based on the compelling evidence that he had seen in the review of child deaths that alcohol was seen as a risk indicator. We need to wake up to it as a contributory factor. I support his call. Will the Leader arrange a debate on alcohol-related harm, particularly on how Ireland could introduce minimum pricing in co-ordination with our colleagues in Northern Ireland? Senator Mark Daly mentioned yesterday the Protection of Children's Health from Tobacco Smoke Bill 2012 that he, Senator John Crown and I have brought forward.We had an excellent debate on it in the Seanad and I know we have cross-party support. Parallel to this Bill, the Minister announced yesterday he is bringing in legislation on plain packaging on cigarettes, which I support. He has asked the health and children committee to prioritise it and accelerate it through. While I am happy to do this, I am reluctant because we have a Bill sitting on the agenda here that will directly contribute positively to children's health and, for no reason that I can understand, it is being delayed. As Senators Mark Daly and John Crown and I have put a tremendous amount of work into addressing any of the issues raised by the Department, I ask the Leader to urgently ask the Minister when that Bill is to be brought before the House. It is an initiative that could be taken quite quickly to protect children's health.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-20 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	11	If it is agreeable to Senator Denis O'Donovan, I second his proposal for an amendment to the Order of Business. The fishing industry has over the entire period of my time in this House been treated with contempt. This is ridiculous and has been a very foolish strategy on the part of all Governments. With regard to the Order of Business, I agree with Senator Jillian van Turnhout, but I am even more outraged by the situation. It is not just a question of postponing legislation. It is the way this House is treated by the Government. Once again, we have no legislation, and the public sees this and the press may very well comment upon it when there are strange gaps. This is not the fault of the Leader. We had a leaders meeting this morning and it became absolutely clear it is because no Minister was available to take business in this House - not one single Minister. I do not believe the Government has learned the lesson of the referendum. The people put us back here and they said they wanted us to do work. Some of us pointed out that we have worked very hard but we have been hindered continually by the Government. This rotten, undemocratic practice is still continuing. We should not let this occasion go without letting the public know that this is the Government again deliberately obstructing the Seanad and treating it very much as a second-class House. We spent some time yesterday talking about our allowances and I suggested getting rid of the whole damn lot and giving us a wage for the job, letting it be taxed and all the rest of it. That is what I think should happen. We are talking smallish amounts of money and we now discover that people who are in the public service on €200,000 plus are getting another €40,000 or €50,000 out of the sweet shop. I wonder how many other areas of public life this is happening in. We should look into this matter. In these times we need to look at everything that can be done to create a decent economy. I would welcome a debate on the remarks of the North of Ireland Attorney General, Mr. John Larkin. It is an extremely difficult situation but at least he has the virtue of telling the truth and facing the facts. It is a huge ask for anybody who has been bereaved in the barbarous events that went on in Northern Ireland to draw a line under it and say we have to put that in the past. However, at some stage, that has to happen. I think the Attorney General is quite wise and speaking appropriately when he points out that, because of the time lapse, it is very difficult to get a conviction, and that because of certain agreements that were made, issues were fudged. For example, when the disarmament of the IRA happened and it destroyed its weapons and explosives, it was part of the agreement that no forensic tests would be done on any of that weaponry; therefore, a huge body of evidence was destroyed which could have been crucial in these matters. Again, in regard to the disappeared - what a horrible word and what a reproach that it should happen in this country to people like Jean McConville who were taken out and savagely murdered - when their families look for their bodies, there is an agreement that there will be no inquest, no autopsy and no forensic report. There is a complete absence of evidence in many of these cases. I believe we should have such a debate. It is an enormous amount to ask and I am not sure how many of us would be prepared to take that, but it would be such a step forward. On the other hand, however, we must continue to demand that the bodies of those who have been murdered and disappeared should be recovered. I believe the Attorney General of Northern Ireland made a series of extremely good, logical points. We have to try to assuage the natural emotions of others, but that is the way forward.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-20 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	12	I raise an issue of concern in regard to questions that are tabled at the health committee when I am looking for answers in the public interest. In September I tabled a question in regard to section 38 and 39 organisations which are receiving funding from the HSE and the Department of Health. Over €3.4 billion of the health budget is paid out to 2,680 organisations and I tabled a very specific question looking for specific answers. I am disturbed to find that I received a generic answer to the questions I tabled to the health committee in mid-October. I find that a report, which I understand was completed as far back as March this year, was not made available to me in that answer, yet it is now being made available to every member of the media who just writes a letter looking for it. I am appalled that the health committee was dealt with in this manner by the HSE and the Department and I am looking for answers as to why this report was not made available to the health committee in mid-October. We have an opportunity to table questions looking for answers and transparency once every three months. At least the Department and the HSE should have had the decency to advise us of the existence of the report and that it would be made available at some stage in the future. Not one sentence in that reply mentioned the existence of the report. I am appalled it is now being released to the media. As a member of the health committee and a spokesman on health for Fine Gael in this House, I still have not got a copy of the report. I am asking the Leader to raise this issue with the Minister and the Department in order that any Member of this House who tables a specific question at the health committee gets the answer.

I also remind colleagues there is a briefing today at noon by Kieran Staunton, the president of the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, in the Members Dining Room about the issue of the undocumented Irish who are currently residing in the United States and the legislative proposals before the US House of Representatives and the US Senate. I also support the call in regard to the statements by Mr. John Larkin, the Attorney General for the North of Ireland. I find it amazing that a man would propose such a thing when we consider the lack of co-operation from the British Government on the topic of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, the biggest crime committed in this State in the last 50 years. There is ample evidence that there was collusion by the British Government and the British state in those killings of Irish citizens and that elements of the British army were involved in assisting in the explosions that happened in Dublin and Monaghan. What we see is that he wants to sweep the issues under the carpet. Let us remember it is the British state that is not co-operating with the Irish State on this issue, yet he wants this all to go away because, if the evidence came out, it would show that the British Government and elements of the British state were involved in that atrocity. There is also the issue of Bloody Sunday and that of the murder triangle that was exposed by Anne Cadwallader in her book, where off-duty RUC men and off-duty reservists in the British army were involved in killing Catholics in Tyrone. The Unionist community too is feeling betrayed because its members were killed by paramilitary organisations simply for being Protestant. The reason I am asking the Attorney General to consider his position is he appoints the Director of Public Prosecutions and sets the tone in the prosecution office. If he is saying these things should not be pursued, that sets the tone for the Director of Public Prosecutions.He is saying it will prove difficult to convict the people concerned. In fact, he admitted on radio, which is beyond bizarre, that it will be more difficult to pursue paramilitaries than to pursue state actors. On the international stage, by contrast, people responsible for war crimes during the Second World War - Nazis who were in charge of gas chambers and concentration camps - are still being put on trial and imprisoned, rightly so. The same should apply to anybody who was involved in collusion and murder in the North.
#MartinConway	unknown-#MartinConway-party	unknown-#MartinConway-dob	unknown-#MartinConway-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-20 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	14	I take the opportunity to express my appreciation for the briefing we are to receive from Mr. Kieran Staunton, which Senator Mark Daly was instrumental in organising. The plight of the undocumented Irish in the United States can easily be forgotten on this side of the Atlantic. Given that a minimum of 50,000 of Irish citizens are affected, however, it is an issue that should always be at the top of the agenda. I welcome the agreement by the Cabinet yesterday, on the recommendation of the Minister for Health, to introduce plain packaging for tobacco products. We are engaged in a war with the tobacco industry, a ruthless body that will stop at nothing to promote its product. It was a brave decision by the Minister, Deputy James Reilly, to press this initiative. It has been done in New Zealand with some success, and we will be the first country in Europe to embrace plain packaging. The leader of Fianna Fáil, Deputy Micheál Martin, showed the same bravery when, as Minister for Health, he introduced the smoking ban in pubs and restaurants in the face of vigorous lobbying and a vicious campaign of opposition. In fairness to the then Minister, he stuck to his guns and did what was right. The current Minister is also doing what is right. Although I understand the frustrations expressed by Senators Jillian van Turnhout, John Crown and Mark Daly in regard to the legislation, I am totally supportive of what is being proposed. In fact, I would support an outright ban on tobacco products in this country. I hope it will happen at some point in the future, because cigarettes destroy people's lives and cost the State an absolute fortune. Will the Leader arrange for the Minister for Health to come to the House for statements on the various measures being taken to combat smoking and the interdepartmental approach in respect of the health issues, education strategy and incidence of tobacco smuggling? It is vital to educate young people on the challenges they will face in future if they embrace smoking. I would also like to know when it is planned to implement the proposal on plain packaging. It is a critical debate for the future health of the nation.

We have extraordinary expertise in this House in the person of Senator Denis O'Donovan, together with other colleagues. It is an issue on which we might well expect to make a unique contribution and on which we might usefully engage the public by way of the Seanad Public Consultation Committee. I welcome the publication of a briefing note by the Department of Justice and Equality on the family relationships and children Bill, which is a very positive and long-awaited development. I praise the Minister for his commitment to modernising the very outdated law in this area. Our laws must reflect the lived realities of families throughout the country. The publication of a briefing note on this very sensitive issue, which is relevant to large numbers of people in the State, will allow us to examine and review it before the heads of the Bill are presented for debate. It is a very constructive way of legislating. Last week I took part in a high-level workshop at King's College on effective parliamentary oversight of human rights. Several international experts and academics contributed to the discussion, from the Philippines, Australia, Canada, South Africa and throughout Europe. I presented a paper setting out my views on the effectiveness of our parliamentary oversight in the area of human rights. I will be submitting that document to the justice committee and hope to return to this House with some points for discussion. With that in mind, will the Leader indicate when we should expect to see the legislation establishing an Irish human rights and equality commission? The Minister indicated some time ago that its publication was imminent, but we are still waiting. The heads of the Bill were published in May 2012. It has been a month since the Taoiseach came to the House to hear our views on Seanad reform. Will the Leader provide an update on how the Taoiseach is getting on in terms of proposals for reform? Has he met party leaders and when are we likely to see progress in this regard?

It is understandable that the request from the Opposition should be acceded to, and I am glad it has been done. In putting forward his amendment to the Order of Business, Senator Denis O'Donovan makes an excellent prima facie case for an examination of fisheries policy. What has happened is maddening, with people needlessly tied up at ports right around the coast. It is happening not just in Castletownbere but also in Dunmore East, Kilmore Quay and Dingle Harbour. The Senator makes a great case for an examination of the matter. The Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, has done some great work on these types of issues in Europe in the past and it is important that we hear from him in early course. I assume, however, that it will not happen today. We should be careful not to get too caught up in what Northern Ireland's Attorney General has said about drawing a line under the past. As Senator David Norris said, we must consider the passage of time. Anecdotally, there is evidence available, but making it stand up in court after 25 years is another thing.

Of course, we hope for a satisfactory outcome to these discussions. Closer to home, the end of this month will see the publication of the report of the Smithwick tribunal, which is bound to raise questions in regard to collusion. I have no doubt there was collusion on both sides. Whether we like it, however, we simply must get real in regard to what happened in the past.

It would have been a shame to have to debate it tomorrow, given the number of unanswered questions from last night. I warmly welcome the Leader's intervention during that debate. Today it was announced that J. P. Morgan had agreed to pay out a record €13 billion settlement after admitting it had regularly overstated the quality of mortgages it sold to investors. That is exactly the type of practice we were discussing last night. I see that the New York State Attorney General, Eric Schneiderman, was involved as were Department of Justice officials. Perhaps our diplomats in the United States might report back to the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade on how the authorities in that country managed to secure a much more satisfactory solution than we have done in regard to the conduct of bankers and accountants. The press release from the United States Department of Justice indicates that it started these negotiations, which were concluded yesterday, in September this year. We began to investigate similar matters in this State in September five years ago without, as yet, achieving results. The Minister indicated that the Attorney General did not wish to prejudice hearings in the Anglo Irish Bank case. As we know, however, there are questions to be answered in regard to Ernst & Young and the EBS, PricewaterhouseCoopers and Bank of Ireland, and KPMG and AIB, Irish Life and Permanent, Postbank Ireland and the Irish Nationwide Building Society. All of these investigations are on hold. Another unsatisfactory aspect last night was the refusal of the Minister to answer the simplest questions such as what the cost savings were in his policy, which I support, of moving from the High Court to the Circuit Court. Worse than that, his officials advised him that it would be too much work and they did not want to answer the questions. A little more respect for Parliament is required. That also arises in respect of Senator John Crown's Bill on smoking. This House was not abolished; it is still here. This raises questions about the general unwillingness of the higher bureaucracy in Ireland to participate in freedom of information in the widest context. Last night was a bizarre example of it. I am pleased that this has been postponed so there can be extra thought and research. In this light, can we invite the Minister for Justice and Equality to the House to debate white collar crime, how to combat it and why it is taking so long to do so since 2008? Such a debate should include the role of accountants.

I am delighted there are strong moves afoot to introduce that type of packaging. Sometimes practical actions are what is required and the sooner this legislation is brought forward, the better. We must seriously address the issue of smoking. There is a higher incidence of smoking in Ireland than in almost every other European country, and that is a great concern, given the number of young people in this country. I support that action and the continued work by the Government and the Department of Health on making Ireland a smoke-free zone by 2025. It is obviously a very ambitious target but it is good to have that target. On Universal Children's Day I welcome the chief inspector's report on education in primary and secondary schools in Ireland. Covering 2010 to 2012, it is a huge piece of work and many people have taken part in it. What is more important are its findings. Will the Leader invite the Minister for Education and Skills to the House to debate the findings of the report? It is good to see that both primary and post-primary schools are largely well managed, most teachers are working effectively and the learning is satisfactory. Parents and teachers were questioned, along with teachers' representatives. Importantly, however, there are problems with the teaching of mathematics, Irish and English. As some of these problems are quite serious, there must be a debate on the matter to assess where we go from here. This type of information should not be just left in a book. We should use it to draw up plans and as a basis for offering our advice and suggestions.

Ní raibh mé anseo inné agus tá sé iontach í a fheiceáil ar ais. It is great to see her back here in full health. Ba mhaith liom tacú leis an Seanadóir Denis O'Donovan maidir leis an díospóireacht ar chúrsaí iascaireachta. Tá géarchéim ann faoi láthair agus tá sé an-tábhachtach go mbeadh an plé sin againn. Many people are mentioning various issues regarding the North, including legacy issues. That is right and it is important we debate it and do so in a rational manner. There are arguments both for and against, on both sides, on those issues. To refer to something I have not mentioned for a while, on a number of occasions I said that one of the ways to address this is to invite the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister from the North to address the House. Drew Nelson from the Orange Order came to address the House and Members considered that a positive move. I appreciate there have been difficulties getting a reply from the offices concerned, but perhaps it is something we should follow up on again. From our perspective we will do what we can to encourage the Ministers to come to the House. It would be important in the light of a number of things that have happened in the recent past such as different addresses by the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister on certain occasions and the Haass talks and in the light of implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. It would be a very important debate. Last July we sought a debate on vision health in Ireland on foot of a presentation we were given. More than 220,000 people in Ireland are blind or visually impaired, despite 75% of the blindness being preventable. It is estimated that by 2020 the State will be spending €2.5 billion per year in this area. It is an issue that affects many people and families and is costing the health service a great deal, yet it is quite curable in many cases. A focused debate on vision health in Ireland would be very useful at this juncture.
#TonyMulcahy	unknown-#TonyMulcahy-party	unknown-#TonyMulcahy-dob	unknown-#TonyMulcahy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-20 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	22	Senator Colm Burke raised a very important issue regarding section 38 funding. This issue has been close to my heart in the past two and a half years and I have been highlighting it since I became a Member of the House. Colleagues in the House often raise issues relating to the intellectual disability service providers and the various non-governmental organisations, NGOs. I have always asked them to ask one question, "How much is the chief executive officer and the management team being paid?", before they protest on behalf of that agency. The salaries in these groups are more than 40% higher than what the HSE pays these pay grades. We saw what emerged yesterday, but that is only the tip of the iceberg. It will be drip fed, which is unfortunate. Senator Colm Burke should have been given that answer a couple of months ago. I seek a special debate in the House on section 38 funding, the salaries paid to the people concerned and what level of control we have over them. I do not believe a CEO in any of these agencies should be paid more than a principal officer. That is a fair wage. It is beyond me how anybody can justify drawing a salary of €220,000 in the intellectual disability service sector and in excess of €300,000 in respect of rehabilitation care. I can name all of them, including the Brothers of Charity Services, Daughters of Charity Services, St. Joseph's, St. Michael's House and so forth. I have no fear of naming the people concerned. Senator Mary Moran has spent six to eight months trying to get a set of accounts from one group, but she cannot get it. This money is given by the Government to these people to spend on our behalf. They are spending a heck of a lot of it, and much of it on themselves. In addition to the salary I mentioned, there would be a new car every two years, more than likely, and a free telephone. They do not put their hands in their pockets to buy them. The Leader has heard me raise this issue repeatedly. In the past two weeks I put the matter down as a special subject for debate at parliamentary party level. We must stop this. A total of €3.4 billion is going to these groups. Another key issue is the advocacy groups. They provide no service at all. They advocate on behalf of the clients. I firmly believe all the money given to advocacy groups should be stopped immediately. It is going to pay the CEOs €150,000 to €200,000 and what they primarily do is tell the HSE or the Government what my daughter or, in Senator Mary Moran's case, her son, needs. There are many other parents in the House. We do not need anybody to act on our behalf. We can do it ourselves. We do not need an advocacy group. That money must be stopped now and spent more appropriately on the front-line services that all Members rave about in the House. I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to the House for a special debate on section 38 funding and what we are getting for it. There is €3.4 billion involved, which is serious money. The next time Members receive a representation from any of the people concerned, they should ask them how much they pay their CEO. They will be stunned at the levels of pay.

I also agree with the tone of caution in his contribution. I do not believe it is possible that those remarks were a solo run on the part of the Attorney General. I believe there is a choreography taking place to normalise political life in Northern Ireland, relationships between the Republic and Northern Ireland and relationships between Ireland and Great Britain. I presume the visit by the Queen was part of this and that the forthcoming state visit by the President to Great Britain is also part of it. The difficulty with the Attorney General for Northern Ireland's comments is that it has created a knee-jerk debate, as we have seen in the broadcast media this morning. This is a complex and complicated issue. There is still a great deal of raw emotion among the public and there are many bereaved people who have been condemned to suffering for life. As there are many such issues, I am not sure what the Attorney General for Northern Ireland felt he could achieve.When one considers that it would require legislation not just in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom, but also here, has there been any debate? I have commented here in the past on the vacuum that has been left in the peace process. I have seen it myself on my many visits to Northern Ireland. When there is a vacuum, that is the time difficulties will arise. I would have thought that this discussion initiated by the Attorney General for Northern Ireland would have taken place with all the parties and people involved. I also felt there should have been choreography attached to this. I can never understand why a truth and reconciliation commission was not set up because that should have been the very first thing that happened. As a result of it not being established, every day, we now see elements of this debate absolutely removed from the overview that we should have. That is not helpful to the peace process. I do not think the debate which began yesterday will be helpful to the peace process. That is why I feel this House can play a very definite, important and central role. It would not involve getting excited or emotional but if we had a rational and methodical debate realising that the net result can be negative or positive, this House will have made a major contribution. I appeal directly to the Leader because of its seriousness that he consider in the very near future - perhaps next week - initiating this debate but discussing with the other leaders the form of that debate, the methodology for doing it and how we hope to have any input into the debate, which I think will very quickly go off the tracks outside if someone does not try to focus it in the early stages.
#MichaelMullins	unknown-#MichaelMullins-party	unknown-#MichaelMullins-dob	unknown-#MichaelMullins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-20 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	24	I strongly support the call made by Senator Sean D. Barrett for a debate with the Minister for Justice and Equality in respect of white collar crime. People in this country are rightly outraged that it is taking so long for anybody to be brought to book for the hardships imposed on them through recklessness within the financial services industry. I hope the settlement by J. P. Morgan will provide some opportunities for the Government to look at options to reduce the burden on the Irish people. Senator Mulcahy made a very impassioned plea here for a debate on section 38 funding. The figures he quoted are certainly worrying. When one couples that with the top-up payments to senior staff at Irish hospitals, one sees that we need a very open and frank debate on how our finances are being spent in respect of the provision of health services.  In the past 18 months, people were rightly outraged at the loss of life in the garment manufacturing industry in Bangladesh given that we pride ourselves on health and safety within our factories and manufacturing systems. I am pleased to note that since the major outcry, there has been a speedy response and 112 brands and retailers have signed up to the Bangladesh safety accord. This now covers 50% of the factories operating in Bangladesh and has secured the safety of over 2 million garment workers in that country, mainly young women. The power of people and customers and the strength of politicians' voice have been heeded. However, there is one very disappointing feature of that accord. A very significant Irish-owned company operating in Ireland - Dunnes Stores - continues to ignore the calls of consumers, campaigners, public representatives and its own customers and has not signed up to the Bangladesh safety accord. Why is a reputable company and major employer not signing up to this accord? I ask every Member of Seanad Éireann to put pressure on Dunnes Stores to sign up to this accord, which is in the interest of poorly paid employees and ensures they are safe and have a living wage. It is most important that a company that is well regarded and strongly supported by the Irish people should sign up to this accord as a matter of urgency.
#JohnCrown	unknown-#JohnCrown-party	unknown-#JohnCrown-dob	unknown-#JohnCrown-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-20 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	25	A probably apocryphal story is told about a country which had been decolonised following a long association with the United Kngdom and decided as a symbol of its independence that it would move from having all the traffic driving on the left British-style to driving on the right as happens in most other countries in the world. Having had a high-level bureaucratic and civil service analysis of the implications of this, they came to the conclusion that the shock of doing it might be too great and that initially it should only apply to trucks, buses and heavy vehicles. I sometimes think the same philosophy is being applied in our attempt to reform the health service. The reality is that we are moving towards a model of complete independence for the health service from the bureaucracy of the HSE and the Department of Health if the programme for Government agreed by the two Government parties is initiated. If we move to a system where everything is based on insurance, I hope mostly but not exclusively not-for-profit social insurance, there will be a market of hospitals competing against each other, some of which are publicly owned, some of which are owned by charities like universities or perhaps professional associations and some of which will be owned by for-profit companies. My hope is that most of them will be owned by not-for-profit companies. As part of that, there will be a move from the current beauty contest used by the Department of Health in deciding where the funding goes to one based on productivity. Institutions that are good and high-quality and which attract more patients - patients who will have absolutely equal access based on a single-tier, freely negotiable insurance instrument which is equal in its access but not equal in its premium because rich people will pay more than poor people - will end up doing better because they will attract more business. With appropriate policing to prevent doctors from over-diagnosing, over-testing and price gouging and institutions from profiteering, the system can work. It is the German system, which works very well.  We must understand the - I guess the more polite word is half-baked - attempt to move us gradually towards a reform of the health service is like the country that is putting some of the traffic on the left and some of it on the right. We have a system right now where some hospitals are entirely funded by the State but act entirely independently in terms of their management and board structures. This is the ultimate reason that we have had this understandable reaction to the disclosures concerning the top up of executives' pay. We have in-built inconsistencies because these hospitals have their hands completely on public money but still have entire independence to appoint not only their boards, which are uninterrupted by freedom of information and are not appointed by Governments, but their research committees and entire management structure as they see fit. While we are looking at reforming our health system, we must have a very critical look in the short term at the board structure of hospitals, who appoints them, how answerable they are, who they are responsible to and how they make decisions without being answerable to anyone. Clearly, these were board-level decisions to top up these salaries. I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Health to visit the House to clarify this and to tell us if he has any remedial action to suggest.

Many tributes were paid to him yesterday. He has contributed so much to this House and is such a popular figure that I think we all wish him a very speedy recovery. I also welcome the announcement of the first State visit by an Irish President to the United Kingdom in April 2014. I look forward to discussing many aspects of this visit in the House in the coming months. I second and concur completely with the views expressed by Senator Tony Mulcahy on the need for a debate on section 38 funding.The Senator and I have worked on this matter during the past two years, and we have been astounded by some of the answers we received when we tried to inquire into funding, accounts and the money's destination. All of our salaries are public knowledge. It is only right and fair that we should debate the issue. We should be entitled to a breakdown of CEOs' salaries, particularly given yesterday's news about the top-ups to the top managers at some hospitals. During the past year, I told the House about my experience with one of my children at Crumlin hospital. The parents' quarters were in an appalling condition. So much could be done. Like Senator Tony Mulcahy, I am requesting a debate on this issue of value for money. Services such as respite care, catering, physiotherapy and occupational therapy are being cut. Let us examine what we are getting for our money.

I support Senator Denis O'Donovan's comments on the fisheries sector's difficulties. We have debated the Common Fisheries Policy, but it does not address many of the issues surrounding quotas. It is dreadful to think foreign fishing vessels can enter our waters and catch a fish species when our boats cannot and are tied up due to quota restrictions. The Minister must do something. He cannot continue to blame the European Union. There must be bilateral agreements or a mechanism through which our boats can continue to fish when the species are present. I hope Senator Denis O'Donovan's amendment will be accepted. An féidir leis an gCeannaire díospóireacht a eagrú ar an straitéis 20 bliain don Ghaeilge? Is beag dul chun cinn atá déanta i dtaca leis an straitéis sin. Ba mhaith liom go mbeadh an tAire Stáit ar fáil anseo sa Teach chun an ábhar seo - an easpa dul chun cinn i dtaobh an straitéis 20 bliain don Ghaeilge - a phlé go mion. Senator Tony Mulcahy and others raised the issue of the €3.4 billion in funding for NGOs. Since every other sector of society has taken a reduction in the current economic climate, we must review and debate this situation. We should examine strategically funding for NGOs, given its substantial level. A similar issue is that of top-up funding for public servants, including hospital consultants and managers. It is not exclusive to them, though, as ministerial advisers have been given top-ups also. The public lacks faith. Visitors to local hospitals try to purchase goods in their shops or pay car parking charges so as to support them. Now we are finding out that money is going to subvent salaries. It is unacceptable. We need to know what level of knowledge the Government had of these top-ups. I missed the Order of Business yesterday due to a meeting in the Houses. I pay my best wishes to our colleague, Senator Jimmy Harte, following his tragic circumstances. We wish him a speedy recovery. He is a good colleague and it is a difficult time for him, his wife, Mary, and their family. He is in our thoughts and our prayers. I welcome Jody Blake back. It is great to see her and I wish her well. She will keep us all in check.

I join Senator Denis O'Donovan's call for an urgent debate on the prices achieved by the fishing industry. If the Leader cannot accommodate such a debate today, perhaps he will be able to do so tomorrow. I commend the Leader for acceding to my colleague, Senator Thomas Byrne's request for a postponement of the Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2013 until next week so as to facilitate colleagues in briefing themselves on that complex legislation. It is unfortunate that the statements by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, have needed to be postponed. I ask the Leader to arrange for that important and necessary debate as soon as possible. Will the Leader invite the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, to the House to discuss her plans regarding the demolition of so-called ghost estates? I understand the initial estimate was approximately 40 estates, but there are hundreds of such estates the length and breadth of the country. I take the opportunity to congratulate Gráinne Smith of Butlersbridge in County Cavan who was named the Intermediate Player's Player of the Year. I wish her well in the future.
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-20 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	29	The acting Leader of the Opposition, Senator Denis O'Donovan, as well as Senator Paul Coghlan and several other Members, raised the issue of fishing quotas, an issue to which I referred yesterday on the Order of Business. Following last year's negotiations, many people, including Senators on the other side of the House, lauded the Minister. Significant progress was made. However, the fishing industry has been suffering because of a lack of quotas for the past 40 years. A comprehensive meeting of EU industry stakeholders on mackerel quotas is under way in Clonakilty in Senator Denis O'Donovan's constituency. Actually, I do not know whether it is happening this week or next week, but the international mackerel industry is worth more than €1 billion. That said, the Seanad is overdue a debate on the issue. I have asked the Minister to attend today, but as I have not received a response, it is unlikely that I will be able to arrange it now. I have also asked him about attending tomorrow, but it is short notice. If we can manage it, we will. I will try to arrange a debate as soon as possible. Regarding Kilmore Quay, the Senator is aware that all matters relating to the operational enforcement of sea fisheries law are appropriate to the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, which I understand is in contact with the Director of Public Prosecutions concerning some issues pertaining to the situation at Kilmore Quay. The SFPA acts as an independent law enforcement agency of the State and it would be inappropriate for me or anyone else to comment on law enforcement issues that may be the subject of legal proceedings in due course. However, that is a side issue. The Senator is seeking a debate on the fishing industry which I will try to arrange. It is not for the lack of asking the Minister, but in fairness to him, he has attended the House several times to address agricultural and fisheries issues. I will try to bring him back to facilitate the Senator and everyone else who asked for this debate, but I cannot accede to the request to amend the Order of Business to that effect. Among others, Senators Ivana Bacik, David Norris, Mark Daly, Paul Coghlan and Labhrás Ó Murchú referred to the remarks made by the Northern Ireland Attorney General. Constructive points have been made by all Senators. This is what the Order of Business should always be. I noted Senator Labhrás Ó Murchú's point on the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and if the House can be of assistance, it should be.We are overdue a debate on Northern Ireland in the House. I will ask the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach to attend to address that important issue. Senator Jillian van Turnhout referred to the EU justice debate. It is regrettable that it has been postponed on two occasions, but I am sure we will find another date in early course with the Minister. I note the Senator's request for a debate on alcohol, including sponsorship of sports events by alcohol companies. I also note her point on legislation to ban smoking in cars which was introduced by Members of this House. As I pointed out yesterday, the Department of Health is seeking legal advice on one outstanding issue and will bring the Bill back. I agree with Members that it is unacceptable, given that the Bill was brought before the House almost two years ago, that it should take so long to get that advice, if there is one outstanding legal issue. It is simple but effective legislation to deal with an important item and it should have been brought before the House before now. I have brought the matter to the attention of the Minister and his departmental officials. It never ceases to amaze me how matters can be delayed for so long in the ether. I note Senator David Norris's points on the Seanad being an equal legislative part of the Oireachtas under the Constitution.  Senator Colm Burke mentioned the treatment of the Joint Committee on Health and Children by the HSE concerning questions posed to it. The answers to the questions are now coming out because of media requests. It is unacceptable that Members of this or the other House should not receive answers to questions when they are available. I will assist the Senator in any way I can in resolving that matter which should not have arisen. I have noted Senator Mark Daly's points on Northern Ireland and the murder triangle. This was an issue not alone in the book he mentioned by Anne Cadwallader but was also addressed comprehensively in the Barron report. Senator Martin Conway has notified the House that there will be an information seminar in the committee rooms today on the subject of the undocumented Irish. The Senator also referred to the plain packaging of cigarettes. This matter has been raised by Senator John Crown and other Senators who have outlined that there will be strong lobbying by the tobacco industry. However, they complimented the Cabinet on agreeing to proceed with the legislation. I hope we can debate the issue before the legislation is introduced, but if the Bill is due to be published early, that may not be necessary. Senator Katherine Zappone welcomed the briefing note on the family relationships Bill from the Minister for Justice and Equality. I will inquire for her when the legislation is due for publication. As regards proposals from the Taoiseach on Seanad reform, we have not yet had a meeting with the leaders, but I hope we will do so soon. I understand a number of people in the Department of the Taoiseach are working on the issue of Seanad reform, but we will await the Taoiseach calling the leaders together to see what the proposals contain.  Senator Paul Coghlan wished the US envoy, Mr. Richard Haass, well in his deliberations in Northern Ireland. I am sure we all hope the negotiations will go well. Senator Sean D. Barrett referred to the settlement by J. P. Morgan in the United States. This indicates the lack of progress made in reaching settlements here and bringing people to account. Whether it is the fault of the legal system or otherwise, it is unacceptable. The case was brought in the United States in September and there was a settlement in November, which points to the inadequacies in our system. I will try to arrange a debate on white collar crime with the relevant Minister. The same debate was requested yesterday by Senator Catherine Noone. Senator Susan O'Keeffe mentioned the chief inspector's report on schools, which is an important one. I know that the Senator has asked the Minister for Education and Skills to come to the House to debate it and I am sure he will do so in the near future. Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh referred to the Northern Ireland First Minister and Deputy First Minister. I have made exhaustive requests to have them come here and it would be wonderful if they could address the Seanad. I will continue to make representations in that regard, but the matter is outside my control. A Vision for Change deals with an important subject. I will request one of the Ministers at the Department of Health to attend the House to address the matter. Senators Tony Mulcahy and Mary Ann Moran referred to the funding of section 38 bodies in the health service. They have referred to the salaries the CEOs of NGOs in the disability and charity sectors receive. The salaries highlighted appear to be excessive and it is said many more have not yet been highlighted. The Senators also questioned the role of advocacy groups and their funding. This is something we need to discuss at length when we can get the Minister for Health or one of the Ministers of State at his Department to address the matter. Senators Michael Mullins and John Crown spoke about top-up payments to senior people in hospitals. Senator Michael Mullins also referred to the safety accord for Bangladesh. It surprises me that not all companies in Ireland have signed up to that accord which tries to secure the safety of poor people on low incomes. All companies should be encouraged to sign up to it. Senator John Crown made a good contribution on reform of the health service, including the inherent, inbuilt inconsistencies in the HSE. He called for a discussion on the accountability of boards. We could listen to the Senator on that issue for much longer than a minute or two on the Order of Business.

Senator Brian Ó Domhnaill talked about Straitéis 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge. I will ask the Minister of State, Deputy Dinny McGinley, to attend the House to discuss that matter again. Senator Diarmuid Wilson referred to ghost estates and called on the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, to address the House on the matter.A number of Senators yesterday requested a debate on it. I have made the request to the Minister of State who I am sure will be with us soon to debate it.

The last time we met on the Bill was early in October, even though he has been in the House on other issues. I simply note that it was a while ago. On Committee Stage we proposed an amendment to the Long Title to assist in the public understanding of the aim of the Bill. The Minister rejected our amendment because he said it could have the unintended effect of limiting the scope of the legislation and we do not want that either. He said he would take another look at the issue of the Title and asked me to do so also. I said I would try to come up with something better. Amendment No. 1 represents an effort to clarify the purpose of the Bill in the Long Title. We still feel the current Title does not give much of a sense of the purpose of the Bill to encourage transparency, and tackle maladministration and corruption, which is why we want to have a law to protect whistleblowers. This is why we have proposed the insertion of "TO PROMOTE THE PUBLIC INTEREST BY MAKING" as a way of trying to note what the Bill is about. We are making the point that we protect the whistleblower in order to protect the public interest. In other words, the primary aim is not so much the protection of whistleblowers but to promote the public interest and in doing so we need to protect the whistleblower. The Title of the UK Act is similarly vague. However, for example, the New Zealand Act has a slightly different and better formulation in stating that the Act is to promote the public interest. Similarly, the Australian Public Interest Disclosure Act 2013 provides that the Act is to facilitate disclosure and investigation of wrongdoing, etc., in the Commonwealth public sector. These both focus on the promotion of public interest, which is proactive rather than the protection of the whistleblower, which one could regard as reactive. I believe the amendment makes it clearer that the legislation is to actively promote the public interest while protecting those who act to do so by whistleblowing.

There is staidness with Long Titles. Having had our discussion on Committee Stage, I consulted officials in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to see if they could facilitate this change. However, they regard this as declaratory, almost promotional and outside what is the narrow scope of the Long Title, which is defined very clearly in our legislative process. I agree entirely that other jurisdictions have much more latitude with their Long Titles. I would have concerns over some, including the US Patriot Act, which many in the United States would regard as not being very patriotic. I should not have allowed myself to digress into these matters. In some jurisdictions the Long Title may be used at least to mask the intention of the contents of the Bill. We are very confined by tradition and the advice of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel that we do not state the purpose of the Bill in the Long Title. It simply encompasses for the reader the contents of the legislation. Despite my enthusiasm to accept the Senator's proposal, the principle of which I agree with, the strong advice of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to me is not to accept it because it would do damage to the tradition of confining the Long Title to the contents of the Bill simple.

In fairness, the lobby for immigration reform is meeting Members in the House today and I gather that is where many of my colleagues have gone. I will not delay the debate. We have had the discussion already and I am grateful to those in the Bills Office for their input. The Minister may recall that I had tabled these amendments in on Committee Stage, but as I was somewhat late, I decided to treat them as Report Stage amendments. Amendment No. 19 is Senator Katherine Zappone's amendment but the purpose of my amendments is to have a more frequent study or review. The review period of five years is perhaps somewhat long. I am giving the Minister an opportunity to reconsider the five year period and to consider review periods of two years and five years. I understand the need to have a somewhat longer period than one might normally have. I presume there will not be a significant amount of protected disclosures made. However, I believe the five year period is somewhat too long.

I will speak to my amendment. It is within the same content issue that we are discussing. What is the best way to ensure we provide the best evaluation and that the law works? I realise the Minister is keen on that. The period is important but the Minister will recall that we moved a similar amendment on Committee Stage. We suggested the Standards in Public Office Commission would oversee the effectiveness of the legislation. The Minister rejected that, which was fair enough, but he indicated an openness for the Oireachtas to have a role in this regard. My amendment proposes that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform receives notification of all whistleblowing within public bodies over a period and that this would then be reported to the designated Oireachtas committee. This serves the objective that systemic issues are identified. I know the Minister is keen to address this issue and, in doing so, more fundamental public reform will take place. The Minister indicated on Committee Stage that it could be reported to the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-20 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	44	Each of amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 19 proposes a detailed oversight role for the operation of the legislation to be given to me as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. I will address each of the amendments. As I indicated in our discussions on Committee Stage, I believe strongly that it is important to revisit the legislation periodically to see whether it is working. However, we need to have sufficient data at the time to make a reasoned and sound evaluation. As Senator Thomas Byrne has acknowledged, this legislation will not be the norm. It will cover a variety of different circumstances and a variety of workplaces. I do not believe there will be a great throng of cases to be reviewed. We must consider due process as well because people have to go through the labour relations machinery when it comes to these things. It would be problematic to have within a year or two years a completed process. That is my judgment on it and that is why, having thought on it good deal, we will have a better snapshot of these processes after five years. One can imagine that it would be traumatic enough for the whistleblowers who had to resort to this and, if so, they may well be in the middle of a process 12 months or two years from now. A new procedure has been adopted by the Oireachtas relating to post-enactment review of legislation. Whatever the case, this legislation, once it is enacted, will be subject to the new Oireachtas procedures. As Minister, I will be obliged to report to the House on the operation of the Bill in 12 months time. Under the new procedures, 12 months following the enactment of a Bill, except for the Finance Bill and the Appropriation Bill, the relevant Minister must lay a report before the Dáil which reviews the functioning of the Act. I am unsure whether there are similar guidelines in this House, but, if not, it should be before both Houses. Committees are empowered, including the committee referenced by Senator Katherine Zappone, to require the Minister to attend a committee meeting to discuss the report. That will happen in any event in all legislation as a matter of course from now on. We are going to have a rather more tentative reporting of whether everything is in place, whether the Labour Relations Commission guidelines have been circulated properly, whether everyone is aware of them, what the mechanisms are for promulgation by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and employers organisations and whether each line Department got its code of conduct and so on. That will be more structural and functional. What I envisage in my review after five years is far more content focused. It will relate to how the legislation is working. The structure may be in place but the question will be whether it is effective in doing the job that we intend it to do. There will be a duality of analysis. The review, post 12 months, will be required under the Oireachtas procedures and this will meet some of the requirements of the Deputies' amendments. Then, the five year proper root and branch analysis which I propose to be carried out by my Department will meet the longer term more in-depth analysis that should be carried out also.

I am keen to meet the objective of Senator Thomas Byrne. Once this definition is inserted any institution captured under the definition of a public body would be required to produce guidelines. As the overarching body, the Department of Education and Skills will produce guidelines which will impact on all schools and all schools will be expected to adopt them. As I have said, a code of conduct will be developed by the Labour Relations Commission. That will be promulgated and will impact on the guidelines issued to all State agencies and all bodies in receipt of State funding.

I knew about the Labour Relations Commission involvement and I am pleased to hear that the Department of Education and Skills will be involved also. That is important because the education system is a major part of the State and there is occasionally potential for wrongdoing in the educational system. We saw in the House when disclosures were made about wrongdoing in a particular school. I was pleased to hear what the Minister said and he has answered the point.

When I spoke on Committee Stage, I was particularly thinking of charitable organisations which might need protected disclosures. They may have volunteers who are effectively workers that are not being paid and they may have other consequences. I accept that the legislation relates to employment in many ways because it outlines how to deal with employees, but it can also have serious consequences. The issue of volunteers has not received the attention it deserves and the legislation could be particularly relevant for charitable bodies.

The issue was raised very well on Committee Stage. I have reflected further and received further advices on the matter. I referred to the importance of an institutional or employment connection between the whistleblower and the institution because the remedies relate to employment. I am now advised that the question has been reviewed extensively at international level. I am further advised that there is a strong consensus among experts that whistleblowing protection should not extend beyond the basis of the workplace. The reasons for the conclusion were examined in detail on pages 11 to 14, inclusive, of the Regulatory Impact Analysis that I published alongside the Bill. I can go them in some detail if Members are so minded. In short, two reasons were advanced by international experts in support of the position. Due to their employment role within an organisation, whistleblowers have access to information that may tend to show wrongdoing that would not be available to persons outside of the workplace. Due to their employment status and the risk of sanctions from breaching the duty of confidentiality owed to an employer, employees who make a protected disclosure may require specific legal protection against reprisals in order to encourage them to come forward. Other complainants, who are members of the public generally, and have the same access to information insights do not usually need the same level of legislative protection before they make reports of wrongdoing because they are not normally subject to workplace restrictions such as confidentiality, contractual arrangements or anything else. They are citizens. First, if citizens see wrongdoing there is no impediment to them reporting. Second, no sanction can be taken against them by an employer. That view has been presented to us and I have rechecked to make sure that we are robust in terms of international best practice.

However, I tabled my amendment because I wanted to highlight an issue. The Bill is about employment relations. My amendment does not cover every aspect that I wanted it to cover. There may be consequences for people involved in the political process who highlight a wrongdoing that may not necessarily be described in the employment relationship, for example, if a councillor or a Member of the Oireachtas reports corruption. The amendment does not cover councillors but it is that type of disclosure that is not protected by the legislation. I am conscious that the Bill is effectively employment legislation but it does not do anything to protect a councillor or State official who will face serious consequences if they highlight wrongdoing. Back in the times that we read about in tribunal reports - thank God, that was long before my time - politicians who spoke against corruption faced serious consequences. One person got physically assaulted at a council meeting for highlighting bribery. I tabled my amendment to highlight the issue. Perhaps we can deal with the matter on another day as it is not really an issue for employment. However, I still think that if a person elected to public office wishes to report wrongdoing that they are not protected against a dominant political system.

That is its import and intention. In considering the amendment, I believe it is worthwhile to take a step back and reflect briefly on the fundamental objectives of the legislation which, as Senator Thomas Byrne has said, is to safeguard workers in the workplace. Councillors would not be covered by the amendment and, therefore, I shall just deal with officeholders and Members of these Houses. As a constitutional privilege is available to Members of the Oireachtas in respect of utterances in the Houses, the outing of wrongdoing is uniquely protected to a degree that no other worker in the State would have. Let me clarify that officeholders are as defined in the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995 which states:(a) a person who is a Minister of the Government or a Minister of State,(b) a member who holds the office of Attorney General,(c) a person who is Chairman or Deputy Chairman of Dáil Éireann or Chairman or Deputy Chairman of Seanad Éireann, and (d) a person who holds—(i) the office of chairman of a committee of either House .... , or(ii) the office of chairman of a joint committee of both Houses, or the office of chairman of a joint committee not currently designated as officeholders by resolution of the Houses.These are very privileged people. I think they do not need workers' protection because I cannot envisage a situation where the employment rights of a Member of the Oireachtas or the Government would be affected by whistleblowing. One might be dumped by the electorate but I do not think this legislation can protect against that happening.

I tabled my amendment, even though I knew he would respond in the way he has and I did not expect him to accept the amendment. I shall outline the simple purpose behind it. Despite all of the tribunals, there is no protection afforded to an elected person who discovers wrongdoing that might disadvantage his or her party and, as a consequence, his or her party might impose sanctions on that person. We have seen Members suffer the consequences for voting against their party on particular issues. If a wrongdoing is discovered in the future - we have seen plenty of wrongdoing in the past - who is to say that it will not happen again? Of course, it will happen again and there is no protection. I do not know how we can provide protection and I accept that it cannot be provided as part of the legislation. However, we should be conscious of the issue.

My amendment is on the definition of wrongdoing. Even though I noted the Minister's reasoning for the definition, from the last time we debated it here I still think that my amendment is relevant and valid. He argued that the more one specified the definition then the more it was weakened. The proposed amendment is very similar to two preceding subsections, section 5(3)(f) and (g) which state:(f) that an unlawful or otherwise improper use of funds or resources of a public body .... has occurred, ... (g) that an act or omission by or on behalf of a public body is oppressive, ..... There is a broad range of categories covered in both subsections through the use of the words "improper use of funds or resources of a public body." However, they do not cover the class of a public official but only a public body. Those sections of the law are also additions and are part of the UK law. In addition, it could be argued - contrary to what the Minister put forward - that the inclusion of the words "improper use of funds" and the specific "act or omission" listed in paragraphs (f) and (g) could give rise to an interpretation that undue influence has been explicitly excluded from the legislation, given that the legislation troubles to mention the other elements explicitly.The OECD toolkit explicitly includes "abuse of authority", with the "mismanagement and waste of funds". If one were to interpret the Irish legislation against those international guidelines one could come to the conclusion that "abuse of authority" has been explicitly excluded because it has been included with the other two ways of defining wrongdoing that we have in the law. I argue that the need for the inclusion of the reference to undue influence is increased by a lack of definition of corruption in Irish law. The Minister has acknowledged that one of the aims of this legislation is to combat corruption but the current categories do not include the misuse of public entrusted power for private gain, therefore, there remains a gap in the legislation. As an aside, it is one thing to argue that the courts may interpret the legislation as including "undue influence", and the Minister referred to the Attorney General's argument on the previous occasion, but it is necessary that the whistleblower is aware that this is something that constitutes a protected disclosure, and that is clearly not the case.
#ThomasByrne	unknown-#ThomasByrne-party	unknown-#ThomasByrne-dob	unknown-#ThomasByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-20 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	72	These amendments are very important. There is a class of wrongdoing that does not rise to the level of criminal that needs to be included but has not been included in this legislation. I give some examples in amendment No. 9 in regard to the Companies Acts or the Competition Acts in that a breach of the Competition Act can be criminal but is not always criminal. I want to give the Minister the other example where I am changing section 5(3)(f) which refers to where there is "an unlawful or otherwise improper use of funds or resources of a public body, or of other public money ...". Regarding the hospital scandal that has arisen, no one is suggesting that anyone at a high level in a hospital has committed a criminal offence but it could certainly be suggested that they are improperly using charitable money or improperly breaching pay guidelines issued by the Department. No one is saying they will be hauled in before a judge and jury and convicted of crimes. If someone were to whistleblow that, for example, the chief executive officer of hospital X is getting €30,000 from the tuck shop, that is not a crime but it may well be improper and against all the guidelines the Minister issues, and it may well be against the Haddington Road agreement. That employee could suffer consequences but the protected disclosure may not fit within the existing categories. My amendment No. 7 would cover that because it is not a crime but it may be improper. I also believe there are categories of wrongdoing that are not criminal that need to be included in that subsection (3). I specifically mentioned the Companies Acts and the Competition Acts.

It is a difference of approach and I have been considering it in the run-up to Committee Stage. Having heard the reasons and reasoned position put by Senators on Committee Stage, I have been considering it prior to dealing with it on Report Stage. Having considered it again I am still convinced, in further discussions with the Parliamentary Counsel, that the more general all-encompassing definitions are better. The more specificity we put into the Bill the more risk we run of exclusions because if lawyers ultimately argue that it was not specifically mentioned, and this was specifically mentioned, it has the potential to do the reverse of what we want in terms of other things we would like and have envisaged encompassing in the legislation. In theory, it is possible to seek to specifically state every potential wrongdoing under the Bill but, in truth, that would be an exhaustive list and there would always be something that would occur into the future that would not be encompassed by it. I am reliably informed by the Parliamentary Counsel that the general catch-all provisions capture all the matters that have been proposed by the Senators. All three amendments are captured by the provisions laid out, and much more. Once we go down the road of specificity we are narrowing definitions because we leave it open to argue that that was not set out as opposed to a general definition which can be argued captures wrongdoing in all its dimensions. For these reasons and having taken the advices of Parliamentary Counsel again, I am told that the more robust, encompassing and therefore better definitions are the ones in the Bill as published.

If someone were to squeal about that, it is not covered. The Minister's argument about specifying things is correct except that he is already specifying seven categories of wrongdoing. He is already specifying all of these and is, therefore, arguing against himself. I believe he has to do this because there are various wrongdoings. I understand this Bill has yet to go before the Dáil and the Minister should examine it again because I believe there is a flaw in that respect.

I appreciate the Minister's re-examination but he has not offered any argument that takes account of the reasons I provided, and those given by the Senator. The Minister is saying this is what the Parliamentary Counsel has advised and that it is more robust despite the fact that the arguments we put forward challenge that to some extent.

We tabled an amendment on the previous occasion that was ruled out of order because it could involve a potential charge on the Exchequer.While we did not debate it, the Leas-Chathaoirleach graciously allowed me to comment on section 11. I noted that in section 5(7), in defining whether disclosure is protected, motivation is listed as irrelevant but section 11 shows it to be relevant in cases of unfair dismissal. That does not seem to make any sense. We propose this amendment to provide a bad faith standard, similar to that in the United Knigdom, rather than to bring in the issue of motivation. The UK legislation incorporates the bad faith standard alongside the 25% reduction as the Minister does in his own amendment to the section. I fully support his amendment because it potentially increases the amount of compensation the Minister had initially envisaged. The bad faith standard, however, provides a higher threshold of protection for the whistleblower than does a reference to motivation. There is a higher threshold of protection when one moves from 50% to 25% also. Our argument is simply that if an employee makes a public interest protected disclosure, and is dismissed as a result, the motivation should be irrelevant because the overriding principle is to promote disclosures in the public interest through ensuring that there is no penalisation.

I listened carefully to the debate and the positions presented and we had a good discourse on Committee Stage. Amendments Nos. 11, 12, and 21 are all linked to the issue of compensation and the basis on which that compensation is payable. I propose to address these amendments together. Amendment No. 11 proposes to replace the qualifying test in the proposed subsection (2B) of the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977, which states, "the investigation of the relevant wrongdoing concerned was not the sole or main motivation for making the disclosure", with, as Senator Katherine Zappone said, the in bad faith test. The effect of amendments Nos. 12 and 21 which I have tabled today is to lessen the penalty in compensation that can be awarded from 50% to 25% which is in line with the UK figure. Senator Katherine Zappone and others put their view on that strongly on Committee Stage. Amendment No. 12 relates to the case of an unfair dismissal whereas amendment No. 21 relates to penalisation falling short of dismissal. In considering the bad faith test proposal in amendment No. 11, I must of necessity refer to the difficulties which the good faith test caused in the UK and I referred to that when we last debated this Bill. The inclusion of this test opened up the avenue to exploration into the motivation of the whistleblower and a subsequent failure to attract the protections of the legislation on the grounds that such motivation was less than pure, so to speak. In the case of the Protected Disclosures Bill, after lengthy and detailed consideration I concluded, and the Government agreed with me, that I should proceed with the Bill without a good faith hurdle or the alternative public interest hurdle. I hope the House will agree that this was a progressive approach which puts the legislation significantly ahead of the UK position in this respect. In order to put the issue of the motivation of the disclosure beyond doubt in the Bill, I have included a provision at sub-section 5(7) stating that any consideration of the motivation of the discloser in assessing whether a disclosure is a protected disclosure is expressly stated to be irrelevant. I gave the example of my personal experience in this matter when as a public representative I sought an investigation into allegations of wrongdoing in the Garda Síochána in Donegal. The breakthrough in that instance was a statement made to the Garda by a relevant party whose motivation could well have been suspect but that was beside the point. The wrongdoing disclosed by that revelation was extremely important. It was of a criminal nature. Motivation in the British system up to now, when it had the good faith requirement, was shown to be very problematic where a defence then, when a matter reaches the court, centres on attacking the bona fides, the motivation and character of the informant or the whistleblower which I think is fundamentally wrong. I want to take that out of the system. I do not want to replace a good faith requirement with a bad faith requirement, the need to prove that a person does not have bad faith, which is the other side of the coin. The Office of the Attorney General has advised that when there is no loss of protection under the Bill as it stands on the basis of motivation - that is what I intend it to do - the awarding of compensation, which we are now talking about, is an area in which due account of the motivation can be taken into account. This issue is left to the deciding body, which can hear the full evidence and make a decision that is fair between the parties, depending on the circumstances. It should be stressed, however, that the adjudicating body is not bound to reduce the award, it simply has the capacity to do so on the merits or demerits of the case presented to it. Amendments Nos. 12 and 21 address this issue. I have already indicated that I propose to lessen the penalty from 50% to 25% of what otherwise would be awarded if the investigation of the relevant wrongdoing was not the sole or main motivation of the person making the disclosure. The provisions reflect a similar amendment in the UK Protected Disclosure in the Public Interest Act 1998 which was enacted earlier this year in the British Parliament. It is a more reasonable diminution in the compensation payable and I accept the very clear case made by Senator Katherine Zappone and others on Committee Stage for that to happen. It significantly reduces the emphasis on motivation which I have always been concerned to ensure remains. What motivates one to tell the truth is a lesser matter if the facts one presents are true, or if one believes them to be true. They do not have to be true. If one has a firm and honest belief that wrongdoing is taking place one should be protected in bringing that to the attention of the appropriate bodies and, if there is no action, to a higher body. A bad faith test could open up similar avenues of exploration to those opened up in the good faith test. I do not want to go down that route, even by way of adjudicating on the compensation. For these reasons I will not accept amendment No. 11 and hope Senators will support the amendments I have put forward.

When we tabled this amendment we had not seen the Government amendment about reducing the 50% to 25%. The way in which the Minister links those two very reasonable and forceful arguments makes sense. I appreciate what the Minister says and the reasoning behind it, and agree that in light of his amendments there is no need to include the amendment we have put forward.

Long but very coherent arguments were made for them on Committee Stage. Senator Kathryn Reilly is not here but she put forward a good case for these points. This is the issue of interim relief. The purpose of amendment No. 13 is to provide for interim relief in cases where there is likely to be a substantial delay between a dismissal and an unfair dismissals hearing being heard by the relevant appeals body. International best practice recommends that such a provision should be included in whistleblowing legislation as it provides an important protection for workers, and the absence of a provision for interim relief is considered to be a disincentive. That case was made coherently and logically. I do not think that it will be any surprise that I was still engaged in discussions with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation on these matters because they have implications for wider labour law.I am very glad to say we have arrived at a consensus and agreement not only between myself and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation but also across the Government on this matter, which makes it possible to table these amendments today. Everybody in the House will welcome them on the basis of the old adage that justice delayed is justice denied. If one is dismissed, one should have recourse to having one’s case heard and have interim relief provided pending such a time, if there is a strong possibility that one’s case is valid before a full hearing and that one is not penalised in the interim to such a degree that nobody else would be encouraged to blow the whistle in the same circumstances.

As I said on Committee Stage, I think it anomalous for me, as Minister, to issue guidelines in tort actions in this or any other Bill. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, whoever that person happens to be, is not in any better position than the courts themselves, and many would argue is in a much lesser position than the courts, to decide on what the guidelines for damages for breaches of the Bill should be. This is a classic function of the courts as opposed to the Legislature. I do not believe it will add to the process for the issue of guidelines. In some instances, what are almost instructions have been given to the courts by the Oireachtas in some areas of law, but I am not sure that is a great idea. In my view, this is an issue that should be best left to the courts, which have the expertise in assessing damages and have enormous precedent available to them in that regard. The preparation of such guidelines would also, in my view, be an encroachment on the separation of powers, or could potentially be perceived as such. I have thought further on it but I consider it is wise not to accept the amendment.

This is important. When we had this discussion before, it was the week of the referendum and it seemed to me the Government was winding down the Seanad, and so the Seanad was forgotten about. I do not believe the Minister made any good argument in terms of restricting these procedures to Members of Dáil Éireann and I will certainly be encouraged if the Government accepts the amendments or if Senators support them in a vote.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	14959	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-20 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	117	I thank the Cathaoirleach for his invitation to address the House in regard to the recently published report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, entitled Report on the Grocery Goods Sector - Increasing Equity and Transparency in Producer-Processor-Retailer Relationships. The Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, cannot be here today to contribute to the debate as he is on an important trade mission to India. He sends his apologies. I welcome the publication of the committee's report, which considers a wide range of issues and makes a series of 13 recommendations which primarily fall for consideration by two Ministers, namely, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. As the report itself notes, it focuses on four key areas. These are the proposed code of conduct in the grocery goods sector, pricing and its impact on primary and secondary suppliers, support for local produce, and labelling. In my contribution I will concentrate on the issue of regulating certain practices in the grocery goods sector, which falls within the remit of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. I will also briefly address some of the issues raised in the report relating to policy responsibilities of other Ministers, namely, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Minister for Health. The Government is strongly of the view that it is important to ensure there is a balance in the relationship between the various players in the grocery goods sector, with a view to ensuring Ireland continues to have robust agrifood and retail sectors. This is a particular priority given the importance of these sectors to the national economy. Regulation of certain practices in the grocery goods sector is intended to achieve such a balance, taking into account the interests of all stakeholders in the grocery goods sector, including the consumer, and the need to ensure there is no impediment to the passing on of lower prices to consumers. As the joint committee's report notes, the issue of regulating certain practices in the grocery goods sector has been on the table for several years. The central issue has been the question of whether a voluntary code of conduct was required or, on the other hand, whether a statutory response should be pursued. Views differ on this aspect, as the report notes. In May 2011, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, published the Travers report, which addressed the issue of attempts to seek a voluntary code of conduct. The report found that there did not appear to be any likelihood of such a voluntary code being agreed. To this end, a draft statutory code of conduct was prepared as the basis of a public consultation process. The unlikelihood of a voluntary code being agreed was also recognised by the commitment in the programme for Government to regulate - I emphasise the word "regulate" - for certain practices in the grocery goods sector. At the time of the publication of the Travers report, the Minister recognised that regulation of the grocery goods sector was a highly contentious issue and there was an inevitable strain in the relationships between suppliers and retailers. These relationships should be built on solid principles of mutual opportunity and fair competition, which does not always happen. The Minister expressed his disappointment that there had been no agreement on a voluntary code, regulation by Government being always the option of last resort. He added that where regulation is contemplated, it should be forensically designed to avoid unnecessary costs for consumers and businesses and ensure a fair balance between them. As the report of the joint committee shows, these views remain as valid today as in 2011. The committee's report notes developments at EU level on the issue of the relationship between various parts of the food supply chain. In September 2013, a voluntary initiative on principles of good practice in the food supply chain was launched and adopted by certain European associations. However, not all elements of the supply chain signed up to this initiative, mirroring the different views on the value of a voluntary system that emerged in Ireland from the Travers report process. In a parallel exercise, the European Commission published its Green Paper on Unfair Trading Practices in the Business-to-Business Food and Non-Food Supply Chain in Europe earlier this year. The Commission also commenced a public consultation process to gather the views of market participants on the occurrence of these practices, their possible effects and the most effective remedies, if required. That consultation process was guided by a range of questions to respondents, including queries as to whether they considered unfair trading practices to be pervasive and whether there was consumer detriment in the presence of such unfair commercial practices. Given the diversity of respondents involved in the exercise, there was little consensus on any of the range of questions. The Commission is considering the results in order to decide whether it will initiate any proposals in this area. However, none of this precludes any member state from taking measures it considers necessary. Such complementarity between EU work and national work is recognised by the Commission. Obviously, we will all take an interest in the implementation of the voluntary initiative and the impact of its development over the forthcoming months. It will not, however, halt the implementation of the commitment in the programme for Government. To give effect to that commitment, work is at an advanced stage on the drafting of the consumer protection and competition Bill. That legislation will provide for the amalgamation of the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency, implementation of the recommendations of the advisory group on media mergers, and amendments to both competition and consumer legislation. It will also contain enabling provisions to allow the Minister to regulate certain practices in the grocery goods sector. It is hoped the Bill will be published by the end of the year for debate in the Oireachtas in early 2014. While the exact wording of the legislation is not yet been agreed by the Government, I propose to address several of its proposed provisions that are germane to the issues raised in the joint committee's report. The first point to make is that the Government, in accordance with its programme for Government commitment, will not be legislating for a voluntary code of conduct.Statutory regulation of certain practices will be introduced. Although not finalised, it is likely that these will take the form of a series of regulations, with associated sanctions, rather than a code of conduct. This links in with the main recommendation of the committee. Second, the report calls for the appointment of an independent ombudsman to oversee and enforce the regulations. As the House will appreciate, the establishment of a new stand-alone State body to oversee this issue would, in the current economic climate, not be feasible for reasons of scarce financial resources, duplication with enforcement of existing legislation in the Competition (Amendment) Act 2006 on activities that prevent, restrict or distort competition in the grocery goods sector, and the need to ensure there is no unnecessary proliferation of public service bodies. Hence, as has already been noted in previous comments on this matter in the Oireachtas, the amalgamated Competition Authority and National Consumer Agency, NCA, will be the independent body assigned the responsibility for overseeing and enforcing these regulations. This new body will be given the powers to enforce the regulations. However, in enforcing any regulations, the basic tenets of fair procedure and natural and constitutional justice must be upheld. It is important to note that the introduction of any regulations does not, and cannot, guarantee anything regarding the prices received by any given link in the supply chain. Negotiations on price will remain an issue between the contracting parties, as happens in any commercial relationship. The intention of the new regulations will be to regulate certain practices, not set prices. On the issue of disclosure of margins by retailers, the contents of the financial statements of companies are governed by relevant EU company law directives and regulations and by the applicable accounting standards. The requirements regarding the preparation and publication of the accounts of limited companies and groups are determined by the first, fourth and seventh EU company law directives and by the EU IFRS regulations. These requirements are largely reflected in the Companies Act 1963, the Companies (Amendment) Act 1986 and the European Communities (Companies: Group Accounts) Regulations 1992, as amended. The EU 11th company law directive, implemented as the European Communities (Branch Disclosures) Regulations 1993, addresses the requirements applicable to branches of EEA companies. Irish subsidiaries of EEA companies can submit the audited group accounts of their parent to the Registrar of Companies instead of their own individual accounts, provided certain conditions are met. EEA companies that have an Irish branch are required to submit only the company accounts to the Registrar of Companies. Irish companies that are subsidiaries of EEA companies and which are themselves parent companies need not produce consolidated accounts provided certain conditions are met. There are similar provisions for subsidiaries of non-EEA companies. In such cases the consolidated accounts of the EEA or non-EEA group must be submitted to the Registrar of Companies. There are no plans to amend this disclosure regime in respect of specific sectors in the economy as this would be open to accusations of discrimination and, were it to be required generally in the economy, it could have implications in terms of business costs and attracting foreign direct investment. Most of the other issues such as an all-Ireland market for contracted winter milk and closer relationships between the multiples and local producers are policy matters for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. However, on the first point, I understand that the supply of milk for processing, North or South, is being monitored with the ending of milk quotas in 2015. On the second point, I understand the development agencies have been active in promoting closer links between multiples and local producers. On the issue of minimum prices for alcohol, the House will be aware that the Minister for Health has proposed such a move in his recent initiative on the issue of misuse of alcohol. The Minister for Health also has a role in food labelling. I am sure both Ministers will take note of the points raised today in respect of their areas of responsibility. I look forward to hearing the reactions of the House to the report and its views on its recommendations. I will relay these to the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, on his return from India to allow
him to consider them in the process of finalising the proposed legislation. Of course, the issue will be debated further when the Bill comes before the Oireachtas for debate in the new year.

The report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Report on the Grocery Goods Sector - Increasing Equity and Transparency in Producer-Processor-Retailer Relationships, is based on extensive hearings by the committee on the draft statutory code published by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton. It is up to the Minister and the Government to make up their minds on this issue, taking account of the report of the committee, as well as the deliberations in Seanad Éireann. I commend the joint committee, particularly its Chairman, Deputy Andrew Doyle, on the seven days of hearings it arranged between March and July last which offered the key participants in the grocery sector an open and fair opportunity to set out their position and respond to the considered questions of the committee. I acknowledge the contribution to the committee of Senators Michael Comiskey, Paschal Mooney, Mary Ann O'Brien, Brian Ó Domhnaill, Susan O'Keeffe and Pat O'Neill. I speak with conviction today as I spent 16 years working for 24 hours a day, seven days a week with the grocery trade in Ireland. I know the trade intimately and am a big admirer of it. The Irish grocery sector impacts on every parish in the country as a source of employment and producer of food products and it impacts on every citizen as a purchaser and consumer. There is an inherent tension between our fellow citizens as suppliers, who are seeking the best price for their produce, and all of us as purchasers, who are seeking the best value and price in our purchases. The recession and the consequent cut in our disposable income have meant that consumers are looking for better value more than ever. A recurring theme from the grocery trade during the hearings was that consumers are strapped for cash and are intent on seeking out the best value. We, as consumers, are putting pressure on the retailers to give us cheaper prices and better value. It is a recurring theme in Ireland that the multiples and convenience groups are creaming off excess profits and that the grocery sector is not truly competitive. It is hard to argue that the sector is not competitive when we see the impact of the arrival and continued expansion of Lidl and Aldi and their steadily growing market share. Again, the case has been made that average food prices here were considerably higher than the European average, while ignoring the fact that we have the highest minimum wage costs in Europe aside from Luxembourg. We have seen Irish grocery prices which, in 2008, were 37% higher than the EU average drop to 18% higher over a period of two years. The narrowing of prices with our nearest neighbour, the United Kingdom, is even more dramatic. Our grocery prices were 62% higher than those in the UK in 2008, but that differential has dropped dramatically to just 4%. This was the testimony from the Competition Authority at the joint committee's hearings. A drop from 62% to 4% must be put on the radar. Of course, we all want a fair deal for the supplier, retailer and consumer.How much State intervention is needed and justified, given the actual fierce competition in the grocery sector and the significant lowering of Ireland's higher prices, by comparison with other European countries? This country is proud to operate an open economy with transparent pro-development laws. One of the benefits of this approach has been a consistent inflow of foreign investment, jobs and exports. As part of his work to promote foreign investment in Ireland, the Minister is seeking to ensure Government actions do not place Ireland at a disadvantage as a welcoming country for investment and enterprise. I am concerned about the possible implications for Ireland's reputation as a friendly country for foreign investment of the interventionist tone of some aspects of the committee's report. I have particular concerns about the sixth recommendation, which is "that legislation should be introduced to force the publication of profits and turnovers of the large multiples and large processors operating in this country". In page 21 of its report, the committee expresses "serious concerns about the use of own-brand products". Surely it is far too interventionist for legislators to become involved in the marketing strategy of retailers. The committee's report fairly sets out the arguments presented to it in favour of and opposing the introduction of a statutory or voluntary code of conduct or code of practice for the grocery trade. It ultimately comes down in favour of the introduction of a statutory code in its first recommendation. I have to admit the arguments are finely balanced. However, I have an overriding concern that we should not put our enterprises at a disadvantage by comparison with our EU partners generally. As the Minister of State has said, the preparation of an EU code is at an advanced stage. It will incorporate a set of principles aimed at achieving transparency and equity. Apparently, it is supported by the supplier and representative bodies at European level. Its publication is due shortly. I ask the Minister of State to set out his views on the proposed EU code. Does he think it might be more prudent to align Ireland with the EU code, rather than going it alone? It is easy to stereotype the convenience store groups and the multiples as baddies that are focused on ripping off all suppliers. I suggest members review the testimony and exchanges of the Musgrave Group, which includes the Centra and SuperValu stores, and of Tesco Ireland at the joint committee on 26 March last. The representatives of the Musgrave Group described how they work proactively and positively to source Irish food. My local Centra retailer, Ms Breda Cahill, has three stores and employs 74 people. She stated frankly at the joint committee meeting that "without our retail partnership with Musgrave, its integrity and the way it does its purchasing, I would not be here today." At the same meeting, the former CEO and current chairman of Tesco Ireland, Mr. Tony Keohane, described that company's positive programme of engagement with Irish suppliers. He mentioned that Tesco has "400 Irish suppliers", over 70 of which had been engaged in the previous year as part of a proactive programme with Bord Bia programme. He pointed out that Tesco's food exports from its Irish suppliers to its outlets elsewhere are worth approximately €700 million per annum and account for "9% of total Irish food and drink exports". Scores of Irish companies have got started in export markets through Tesco outlets abroad. One of those companies is Lir Chocolates, which would not employ over 200 people in Navan and spend €20 million in the Irish economy if it did not get started by selling to 700 Tesco stores in the United Kingdom. I thank my colleague, Senator Feargal Quinn, who gave us our first opportunity on the Irish market. I also thank Tesco for giving us our first opportunity to export. Connie and myself actually started in the North before going to the United Kingdom. I draw the Minister of State's attention to the forthcoming forum on revitalising retail, which I will host on 12 December next along with Don Nugent, who is the director of Dundrum Town Centre. The forum will be led by Sir Terry Leahy, who is a former CEO of Tesco plc and is currently a senior adviser at Clayton, Dubilier & Rice. Competition is fierce in the retail trade, which employs 250,000 people in this country. Companies and retailers have to cut prices. We tend to forget that a range of jobs and professions are involved in the retail trade.

#DeirdreClune	unknown-#DeirdreClune-party	unknown-#DeirdreClune-dob	unknown-#DeirdreClune-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-20 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	125	I am glad to have an opportunity to speak about the report prepared by the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine. When I was a member of the other House some years ago, I was a member of the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment when it examined this whole area. The document we are discussing contains some quotes from a report drawn up by that committee in 2010, which considered the impact the squeeze from the multiples was having on suppliers. There must be an emphasis on balance in this debate. Consumers must be to the fore. More so than ever, consumers are looking for value for money now. There must be a balance between suppliers, those involved in the chain, consumers and the multiples we are speaking about. Tesco currently has 26% of the grocery market, which represents a decrease of 2% on the figure from earlier this year. Dunnes Stores has 23% of the market. As we all know, Aldi and Lidl have a combined 14.5% of the market but are consistently increasing their share of it. It appears that as part of its latest drive to attract consumers, Tesco is targeting the Aldi and Lidl sector of the market by offering vouchers. I would not say it is a price war. While this is good news for consumers in the short-term, we must consider its long-term consequences. We have had bread wars and milk wars in the past. We will have such events in the future as individual retailers try to increase their market share by targeting their competitors. It is interesting how Aldi and Lidl have changed and adapted to the Irish market over the years. When they first came here, many of the products and lines on offer in Aldi and Lidl would not have been recognised by Irish consumers because they were foreign. They have changed and adapted. I constantly read reviews and comparisons of items. Aldi and Lidl consistently seem to do very well, inasmuch as their products get four or five stars. They are opening in every small town and urban area in the country, which shows they have a definite target, and the consumer is responding. I do not think anyone can argue with the voice of the consumer in this debate. Own brands were mentioned by Senator Mary White and in the report. There was criticism of the fact that own brand products are used and that they are giving more power to the retailers. I would agree with the point made by the Senator. One cannot interfere with what retailers put on their shelves. I know this is just a glancing review but when they give their customers an own brand alternative of which nobody knows the source, these products seem to rate consistently and strongly in surveys of quality and value for money. I know consumers respond to this. I do not know whether I would agree with that aspect of the report. Perhaps many own brands are sourced directly from suppliers in this country. What is being offered to the consumer is clear. I do not know whether the State can impose restrictions on that. I look forward to the debate we will have on the legislation amalgamating the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency. This proposed amalgamation has been discussed for quite a long time. It arose originally in an effort to reduce the number of quangos, but it serves a better purpose than that. It will be very important to have the balance between competition, which is very necessary, and consumer rights. Without competition, consumers certainly would suffer. The Minister of State outlined the value this new body would have, particularly as an alternative to the proposal that there would be an ombudsman. I know they have had set up an ombudsman for this area in the United Kingdom but there is a cost involved in it. We will have this agency that is independent and will regulate the industry. The Minister of State addressed the question of legislating for a code of conduct in this sector, which comes up time and again. I note that he said we are expecting legislation towards the end of this year. I suppose that will be in six weeks time. Perhaps it will be early next year at this stage. That legislation will regulate conduct and the relationship between suppliers and retailers. The content of that legislation will be very important and will probably give us an opportunity to debate this issue further. Senator Mary White spoke about the fact that costs have come down. It is clear they have come down here. Food prices are 18% above the EU average when they were 34% above it two years ago. I put that down to consumer demand and consumers looking for better value for money. I visit supermarkets regularly and retailers are definitely responding to consumers' demand and concerns regarding the price, not just of individual items but of their grocery basket as a whole, which remains the same for most households 80% to 90% of the time. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine were told that the cost of doing business here is high although the cost has come down, and the National Competitiveness Council will tell us on an annual basis how we are improving in that area. I do not think we will get transparency regarding pricing. I think the best way to do it is through consumer demand and awareness. The media plays a very important role in that regard. The issue of alcohol and minimum pricing is very important and I am glad it has been addressed in the report. I attended a conference on this issue. The figures show that if one can increase the price of alcohol, it will have a direct bearing on consumption, especially among young people. I do not think we can ignore the facts. I know the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Alex White, has proposed to do something in this area. We are looking to see how the Scottish proposals fare now that they are before the European Commission. It is a no-brainer. We need action and to address this serious issue. Perhaps the Minister of State can look at doing something in respect of loss leaders and retailers reducing the price of alcohol to a ridiculous price where in some cases it is cheaper than water. It is a serious issue that I hope will be driven home by the Government.

There is a very delicate balance in the supply chain between producers, processors, retailers and consumers. We are entering the big bad world of business, yet we are talking about our citizens who are paying tax, have voted us in and are paying for food. If there is any unfairness in that supply chain, this is where we feel we have to get involved but, again, I stress it is a very delicate balance. Rather than go through the report, which we have all read, I will give a few stories of my own experience in the market. We are a small company with 120 employees. It is easier for me to discuss retailers in the United States than those in Ireland or the United Kingdom because they are not so close to home and I can avoid a conflict of interest. A small food business today that wants actively to supply retailers must have the systems and processes in place to do so. If we go into a meeting with a retailer, we truly need to know in detail what we are about - our pricing, how it is made up and the retailer's pricing, expectations and margins. These things are easy enough to find. I again salute Bord Bia which helps any Irish producer that needs knowledge or training. Bord Bia goes as far as getting ex-buyers from some of the giant retailers in to train us as well as the buyers have been trained. There is much in place for Irish producers. One thing in the report that I thought was a bit nanny state-ish was the recommendation was that smaller suppliers should have a small amount of legal assistance in dealing with retailers. I am not sure that is necessary because Bord Bia is in place. I started with just myself. I was the only employee and did not have a clue. I had never even seen a retailer. Once again, Senator Feargal Quinn was the first retailer to give me a chance.

We recently held a very pleasant meeting with a retailer in the US. Beautiful products were presented and the retailer wanted to list them but they also wanted to know how much we were prepared to put forward to support it in its in-house foody advertising magazine. Did we know that four promotions had to be offered and funded by us per year? My product is in on the supermarket shelf of this retailer on the east coast of the US, but let us say there will be 20% off around St. Patrick's Day. I, as the supplier, am funding it. I just wanted to provide a reality check. It is a case of: "Yes, we'll list your product but we want you to contribute to our magazine, we'd like you to list out the promotions and also, by the way, there is a display fee at the seasonal times of the year where we're going to give you special new space in our seasonal fixture and there will be a cost to that." Retailers have ways and means. I am not complaining. I am just trying to let everyone know that this is business. We are used to it and are making good margins and good money but one needs to be strong and resilient. We are living in today's world and it is a tough one. Coming back to the report, I was lucky enough to be at the seven hearings. I will mention one thing I would like everyone to think about.I ask Senators to consider a foodstuff that is vital to each and every one of us, that being, milk. Between 1995 and 2011, the price of milk for the consumer increased from 77 cent per litre to €1.11 per litre. For the farmer milking the cows every day, the price decreased from 32.8 cent to 32.5 cent. Even if we take nothing more out of my contribution today than this, it says a great deal. I do not know the percentage differences. Not being an accountant, I am not very good with figures. However, if this is meant to be equity, it does not add up. The bangers demand that retailers' profits be published, but I listened carefully to the Minister of State's remarks on EU law. We must be grown up and straighten our shoulders. Slightly jokingly, I will ask the Minister of State to explain to the House again how Revenue knows exactly what taxes to collect from retailers if they do not publish their profits or accounts. I am sure he knows the answer. Obviously, there is some way of knowing, but it is not allowably transferable to the entire community of a country. It is an interesting issue, albeit not just in the context of retailers and supermarkets, but also in terms of Starbucks and other large global organisations that have been in the news. The Minister of State lived in Brussels for a few years. As the globe grows smaller, perhaps more transparency is necessary for each country's version of Revenue. It can be difficult. We all want to know whether a retailer is making more money in Ireland than it is in the United Kingdom. We do not want to know its business, only whether the prices paid by Irish consumers are unfair. I am not trying to beat the retailer. On the matter of increasing equity and transparency, was there equity in terms of milk? I do not believe so. I respect that I am a European and that we must have fair trade under EU law, but transparency does not come to mind. Perhaps we need to examine EU law. I welcome the committee's recommendation on strong local links. In particular, the Musgrave Group made a fantastic submission to us. Speaking as someone deeply embedded in the local artisan food market, SuperValu has sought to help locals, but so has Tesco. Aldi and Lidl are clever, and thankfully so, as they are engaging locally and trying to help people. We cannot beat them down for doing this. I was worried when I heard that an ombudsman would need to be created, in that it would require more money. At our hearings, retailers stated that costs would travel down the food chain. This sounds like an incredibly business-like approach to amalgamating the two bodies and installing the ombudsman beneath that level.

The dreadful horsemeat scandal occurred at the beginning of the year. Regardless of whether one likes my opinion, I could feel the pain. We will never get to the bottom of the situation. When retailers are under pressure to produce ever more cheaply, for example, when footfall demands the cheapest burgers, that pressure will collapse on the supplier. Look at what happened. I agree with Senator Deirdre Clune on alcohol as a creator of footfall. Regardless of whether we like it, cheap prices are presented in giant adverts in Sunday newspapers to get people to walk into shops. Alcohol must not be continued to be used as a way of creating footfall.

While we are awaiting some figures, research that has already been conducted, particularly from the University of Sheffield's alcohol research group, clearly showed that a policy of minimum pricing or price controls led to fewer deaths and hospital admissions. There is a price tag on both. We all agree that we need to tackle prices. We just have to work out precisely how to go about it, and the sooner the better. We in this country have a cultural and emotional relationship with alcohol that will cause difficulties for anyone trying to impose new rules. I will turn to this report and the proposed legislation. I am a member of the committee and, for us, one of two key elements is the facilitation of retailers that are independent of the multiple chains to compete on a fair and equal basis with their larger competitors. Surely this is at the heart of everything we are trying to achieve. The second element is the prevention of discriminatory practices by brand holders that are large monopoly or duopoly suppliers, as these might prevent independent retailers from getting foods on competitive terms for their customers. In addition, we want to protect jobs in the farming community. This is an important factor, given the fact that 40% of people live in rural communities. We also want to protect jobs in the valuable retail sector, where thousands of jobs have been lost and thousands more are employed. We do not want to lose sight of what we are trying to achieve, namely, some level of equality. As Senator Mary Ann O'Brien stated, it is a tough old world out there if one is in business. If one is balancing everything fairly well, one is hopefully making some money. One encounters such expenses as needing to pay for a brochure or publicity, but that comes part and parcel with the market in question. The Senator was not complaining about it, merely observing its existence. I welcome the statutory code suggested in the report. I am always disappointed that this debate about codes always seems to go one way. One side claims that it will cost money, make businesses less competitive and be impossible for them while the other side claims that, without it, businesses cannot compete. It seems to be a laborious statement of the position over a long period. I would have expected there to be a benefit for the retail sector in being subject to proper standards under a good code. The Senator mentioned horsemeat. Clearly, problems arise when there is not enough regulation of the food chain and price drives everything. I would love to know what went on behind the doors of some of the larger retailers in terms of what they said, did and knew about the cost of the burgers they were selling on their shelves. Surely be to goodness they knew that one could not make an edible burger from good meat for 8 cent. It is not possible. Evidently, someone knew something, but we have not got to the bottom of that situation. A statutory code to ensure equality between smaller and larger retailers is not before time. The Senator also referred to the price of milk and the return to farmers. This major issue arose at the agriculture committee. The fear is that we will eventually reach a point at which no milk is produced. For the chocolate makers among us, this would be a serious problem. It is okay for me, as I might be able to give up milk in my tea, but it might not be okay for the Senators. There is a serious problem with milk supply. Perhaps we do not-----

The committee's report refers to the own brand problem. I say "problem" because problems have arisen from the widespread use of own brands. I am old enough to remember when there were no own brand products. When they began to be introduced, people were circumspect about them until they embraced them greatly. When one company appeared before the committee, it was clear that most of its business came from own brand products.I do not know whose responsibility that is. How can the Minister of State intervene in the market place? How can the Government decide a business can only have 10% of own brand products?. I do not think that is possible. If we live in a market environment driven by the market that is the price we pay, yet, on the other hand, there is clearly a difficulty with the own brand product undercutting the branded product and being used to drive business by cutting the price of milk this week or the price of bread the following week. That is a question that any code may have to consider. I do not have the answer but it is a very big part of the mix of retailing in modern Ireland and in all countries. Own brands have been with us now for a while. They are very well developed and sophisticated. The notion that they are some kind of yellow pack goods is long gone. The report stated that no code could be implemented nor should it be. This will not be without taking into account what is happening in Europe. It is interesting to see that the voluntary code introduced in Europe turned out to be very voluntary - if such a thing could be so described - with very few people thus far signing up to it. The decision to have a statutory code here is welcome. Voluntary codes always have those difficulties. It is a question of how to align our proposed code with the European codes and regulations. On the question of whether the role of ombudsman should be carried out by the National Consumer Agency, I wonder how many questions have been asked in the United Kingdom of the decision there to set up an ombudsman. No more than anyone else the United Kingdom is not looking to spend money either. I wonder why the option was for an ombudsman. Was it thought that placing it under another structure would dilute the power and give a statutory code in name only but without teeth? While I accept there are always some reservations about an ombudsman because of the cost, the idea of an ombudsman would send a very clear signal that the Government is serious about this piece of legislation. What do we know of the UK decision to set up such an ombudsman, where it has been decided that it is not that expensive to establish one?

I think it was called a love apple. I welcome the Minister of State. I am very honoured that both Senator Mary White and Senator Mary Ann O'Brien had nice things to say about me. Like the Minister of State in his contribution, I will concentrate on the question of whether the code should be voluntary or statutory. I have a concern about every time the Government decides - no matter which government - to interfere usually on behalf of a vested interest. As Senator Susan O'Keeffe said, the vested interest could be the independent traders or it could be those who have a view on private labelling, such as the branded products who do not want private labelling. The market place decides this is what happens. We operate in a market place in which many thousands of individual decisions are made. The customers make a choice whether they will go to this shop, whether they will drive past that shop and perhaps go to another town, go to German-owned shop or British-owned shop or a local shop. These are thousands of individual decisions. One of my reasons for being concerned about a statutory code of practice that is geared at Ireland only, is that it will be very difficult to enforce. One may wish to find out how much a company paid or, as Senator Mary Ann O'Brien said about the American company, whether they ask a retailer to contribute to its marketing. This would probably be illegal now in this situation. How can this be investigated if one company's headquarters are in Herefordshire - Tesco - or another's is in Dusseldorf or in Frankfurt? Such legislation will only impinge on the Irish-based retailer or multiple. Musgrave or Dunnes Stores are told we are going to pass a law which will only apply to them because we cannot enforce it with companies whose headquarters are based elsewhere. We would be the only country in the world that would do this.  I refer to those countries that have interfered in the trade. I am not familiar with the current situation but some years ago in Holland the trade managed to say that a shop could not be opened without a licence and only one shop in each street will be licensed, for example. This was done to protect the existing retailers. That could not be in the public interest. Most countries allow competition and the customer will decide where to shop. In 1988 I went to Leningrad and I asked to see a supermarket. Through an interpreter I asked the supermarket manager how many customers he had, assuming that he would not know. He replied that the supermarket had 6,800 customers. I said that was very impressive because the way we counted our customers was by means of the electronic check-outs. I asked him how he had estimated that figure. He explained it was the number of people in this town. I questioned the fact that they would all shop in the same shop but he assured me that they did and if it was a bigger town they would have a bigger shop. The state decided on the size of the shop. On a subsequent visit to St. Petersburg I saw what happened when the market place changed. The consumers rather than the state now made the marketing decisions. We must ensure we do not interfere very much and only where it is necessary. I am wary of anything that has the potential to increase prices for consumers. That is my particular concern with regard to the introduction of a statutory code of conduct. It may put more costs onto retailers and therefore these will be passed on to customers. It is dangerous to introduce such a measure against the backdrop of a very depressed sector. As the report states, the retail sector employs a huge number of people. I am wary of the costs to business and the job losses that may result. I refer to the arguments made by Retail Ireland on the possibility of introducing a code of conduct in the grocery goods sector. That body made the very valid point that the Competition Authority has already stated that the retail sector is competitive. I know from my own experience as a retailer that it is an extremely competitive sector where one cannot stand still for a minute. I had to make sure that customers came into my shop instead of to my competitor down the street. That meant giving them the right product at the right price at the right time. We had to innovate to do that. That is why I do not understand how any vested interest such as the State, would say it wanted to discuss whether there should be private labelling or not; that is a decision for the individual customer.  EuroCommerce is the Brussels-based representative body for the 6 million retail and trading companies in the European Union. I was chairman of that body for three years and vice chairman for another three years. According to EuroCommerce, unlike other operators in the chain, retailers are under constant pressure from consumers who at all times vote with their feet for their favourite shops and they delegate their bargaining power to retailers. As a result, efficiency gains made by retailers are usually directly passed on to consumers. This translates into relatively small profit margins as compared to other operators in the supply chain they only make 2% to 3% on average. The suppliers and the manufacturers mainly make figures that are multiples of that amount.This is amazing to consider although it is something of which I am well aware. On top of that, there is a wide variety of European Union and national legislation in the area. To take one example, Retail Ireland has highlighted the Competition Act 2002, which it states "already prohibits or prevents the compelling or coercing of payment or allowances for the advertising or display of goods". In other words, we already are in a position whereby that which Senator Mary Ann O'Brien stated took place in America could not happen. I do not actually understand this as I believe the retailer has the right to decide that it wants the lowest price, regardless of whether the lowest price is coming that way. However, we have passed some of these regulations. Given the cross-border nature of retail, I have a slight concern that were Ireland to go it alone in this regard, we would be making ourselves less competitive. Our European Union neighbours would not have the cost burden of complying with a code of conduct while Irish retailers would have the associated costs. EuroCommerce describes this dilemma as follows:Trading relations are very complex [but] there are huge differences across [EU] Member States. This means how they are regulated needs to be different; the perceptions of what is fair and unfair may be different; and indeed the rules need to be related to these different trading patterns, perceptions and priorities.This complex area and the effect of globalisation must be stressed in this debate. Ireland going it alone with a statutory code of conduct may not be the best idea at present. Consequently, I urge members to reconsider the question of whether to have a statutory code. When Australia introduced a voluntary code, the authorities there indicated that unless it was made to work, they would then introduce a statutory code. This probably is the way to go, namely, to have a big stick but to talk softly. One should set out a voluntary code and tell people to make it work as otherwise one may be obliged to do something else about it.

I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him for all his usual courtesy and kindness, as well as for his overview of the position. He did not say a single word with which I could disagree. I compliment Deputy Andrew Doyle, Chairman of the joint committee that has produced this report. I agree with him that the farming and food sectors play a huge role in the Irish economy, having particular regard for rural communities. The Irish food and grocery market is a massive player in the economy with a total estimated worth of €7.1 billion in 2011. It is important to bring forward a statutory code to address the imbalance of power in the supermarket-supplier-producer relationship. The report is all about equity and transparency in the producer-processor-retailer relationship, which is vital. The statutory code of conduct is supported by the Irish Farmers Association, RGDATA, which is my nominating body on the Industrial and Commercial Panel, and Food and Drinks Industry Ireland. I am glad the report recommends that small to medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, should be given support regarding any costs that may arise from a statutory code as in many cases, SMEs would not have the resources to deal with such legal issues. A proposed code of conduct in the grocery goods sector is important in dealing with pricing and the impact on primary and secondary suppliers, support for local produce and labelling. As the Minister of State noted, ensuring a balance in the relationship between the various players in the grocery goods area is extremely important to everyone. Moreover, I accept that voluntary codes do not work. There has been huge strain in the relationship between suppliers and retailers. In previous Parliaments, when I was a member of the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, I had a lot to do with this issue and was a rapporteur a few times. In the committee's hearings, members found that large multiples had a huge dominance and unfair advantage over suppliers and in the agricultural area in particular, I can remember this with regard to vegetables and other products. In fairness to Senator Feargal Quinn, he probably was very honourable because I do not think his firm was mentioned but other large multiples certainly were. I will not go into that today. I welcome the Government's intention to introduce a consumer protection and competition Bill, which I consider to be vital, to provide for the amalgamation of the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency and the implementation of the recommendations of the advisory group on media mergers and amendments to promote competition and consumer legislation, as well as the statutory regulation of a practice that should have been introduced. Although not finalised, as the Minister of State noted it is likely these will take the form of a series of regulations with associated sanctions, rather than a code of conduct. I agree wholeheartedly and this of course links in with the main recommendations of the joint committee, which did very valuable work. I agree strongly with a point made by Senator Mary Ann O'Brien and my friend, Senator Deirdre Clune, as I believe do all Members, on minimum prices for alcohol. The use of alcohol as a loss leader must be stamped out. I am delighted the Minister for Health is so conscious and aware of the issue of the misuse of alcohol and understand he intends to take further steps in this regard. I concur fully with the previous speakers on this subject.
#SeanDBarrett	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-20 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	138	I welcome the Minister of State and like other speakers, I agreed with pretty well everything he said. When considering consumer protection in Ireland, some things about which Members were talking last night, such as the unproductive sectors, the sheltered sectors, services and so on obviously come to mind but I welcome the degree of competition in the retail sector. Data from the United Kingdom show that in the immediate post-war period, it took 30% of a family's budget to feed itself but that figure now is down to approximately 9%. This is an illustration of a competitive sector in operation. Sometimes, this will appeal to the consumers and I believe it mostly does. As Senator Deirdre Clune noted, as there is a strong wish for price competition, this kind of performance will attract business. Moreover, it annoys the suppliers and in this context, I think of one of our leading persons who has done this in producing a leading European brand and in building up an airline with 81 million passengers, namely, our friend and now the friend of the Taoiseach, Mr. O'Leary. He first achieved the highest productivity of any airline and the food industry always will be under pressure to increase its productivity. Second, he took on the suppliers by getting a 40% discount from Boeing, and while there is not an airport with which he has not had a row, the purpose is to reduce the price. Travel agents were eliminated altogether because it could be done more cheaply on the Internet and his was the first airline to dispense with the services of travel agents. This is what happens and, to paraphrase Adam Smith, bread appears in the shops not because a bunch of philanthropists got together but because of the blowtorch of competition. As Senator Feargal Quinn has noted, the reason one innovates is because otherwise the business will be gone. Pre-Gorbachev retailing was described by Senator Quinn well and I applaud Mr. Gorbachev. I believe Trinity College Dublin gave him an honorary degree, although it may not have been for changing Russian retailing as I believe he also had some other claims to fame. In this regard, however, the task for the Minister is that incumbents will always seek a way to keep out new entrants and will invent various reasons the competition is unfair and so on. In the research, most of these reasons do not stand up to scrutiny and there are ways in which producers can respond. I am delighted that a list produced by Bord Bia indicates there are 141 farmers' markets. Consequently, if one does not like Feargal Quinn or Hugh Mackeown in Musgrave Group and so on, there are 141 ways in which to deal with that. In considering the Members who are present, I note there are 23 such markets in County Cork, 19 in County Dublin and 14 in County Kerry - I believe Senator Paul Coghlan has left to go to one of them. One also has the alternative used in the past if it was believed that merchants, intermediaries and retailers were getting too powerful, namely, the co-operative movement. The Minister of State hails from the Blackwater Valley, which is one of the centres of it. It has 150,000 members and a €12 billion turnover. There are alternatives that people should consider rather than grumbling about Tesco, Aldi or Lidl. That is the way the economy operates. I support the decision not to appoint an ombudsman. The fear one has of bureaucracy is that people invent things to do - the so-called regulatory creep problem. We would be presenting a problem for the Minister's successor, namely, to abolish the position in the future. I commend the amalgamation of the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency. Where markets can do something, there is no need for bureaucracy also. The Minister of State said that the Government, through its programme for Government commitment, will not legislate for a voluntary code of conduct. That is quite right as a voluntary code of conduct is not legislation, unless one would like to legislate for a voluntary income tax. There is an internal contradiction built in there which I am sure the Minister of State has diagnosed himself. It will be very difficult to prove the loss leader situation. How come people allegedly selling things at a loss are profitable? I disagree with all of the complaints about the alcohol business. Alcohol consumption in Ireland is falling. Those applying the pressure for minimum pricing are the pubs, which are losing market share. How can one say to somebody who would like to sell one something for a certain amount that one insists one pays them twice as much? Consumption is falling and the younger generation is more responsible in its use of alcohol than my generation. It has become kind of a cause and I have grown rather tired of listening to people in the background say that the price of a bottle of champagne for the economic consultant should remain the same but the price of cider for the working class should be increased because they believe the working class is drinking too much cider. There is a patronising air about that argument in the context of falling consumption and I do not think Government intervention is required. Between now and next year, I hope to persuade the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Alex White, not to intervene. It also goes against European Court of Justice decisions. I thank the Minister of State and the Acting Chairman, Senator Pat O'Neill, for his forbearance.

As this report is outside my work area, it is great we can have this debate and that I can get an opportunity to hear my colleagues who have been able to provide such expertise in the drafting of the report. I thank my colleagues on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, namely, Senators Michael Comiskey, Paschal Mooney, Mary Ann O'Brien, Brian Ó Domhnaill, Susan O'Keeffe and Pat O'Neill. I join in the thanks and commendations to Deputy Andrew Doyle who chairs that committee and who brought all members together. Reading the transcripts of the debates and the report, the committee produced a final report endorsed by all. I am part of a group which includes Senator Mary Ann O'Brien who has yet again proved her expertise in her area and demonstrated that balanced approach. I am speaking only as a consumer but we are able to have the full package as others are able to speak about different areas. I would like to speak about a few issues concerning the recommendations contained in the report. Some of the issues were contained a Private Members' Bill entitled the Food (Fair Trade and Information) Bill 2009, but this report goes further than that. We have heard in this debate about the importance of the food sector to the economy from the perspective of the number of people employed in the industry and our ability to continue to grow exports, which is critical now but also in the years ahead. We want to ensure we continue to have that growth, but we need to look at the recommendations in the report. It is fair to say this report seeks to address one of the main issues in the sector which is the dominance of some of the large retailers in the grocery sector. This is the elephant in the room that we are discussing today. It is an issue we need to tackle head on. There are many positives but we also need to look at some of the negative consequences and find the way forward. I appreciate and understand that perhaps we have to look to the European Union and at an all-island approach, but will we be followers or will we take the initiative and a leadership role and say what we need to do, how we protect the consumer and the producers and that what lands on our tables is good quality food? As everybody wants to achieve this, how do we do it?  I refer to the example Senator Mary Ann O'Brien gave us about the disparity in milk prices. I have no doubt that if we were to drill down, we would find many other examples. That raises the question as to who is winning here. It is not the producers or the consumers. There needs to be a way where, to an extent, everybody can win and where nobody has the monopoly of winning the game every time. I very much welcome the committee's recommendation to amalgamate, under the consumer and competition Bill, the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency, which has been mooted for some time. I am glad that will come to fruition because to me, as an outsider, it makes sense. The directors of the authority and the agency have been planning for this and I am glad this process can get under way formally when the legislation is enacted. That move will benefit the consumer in the long term. Many Members spoke about profits and gave different perspectives, which is very healthy. Sometimes there is deliberate confusion in terms of people having to give their margins. Giving the profits of a company does not give one the individual price sensitivity of a margin. We need to be very careful. We expect small companies and retailers to disclose their profits and yet we are saying that large multiples can, in effect, hide them. In the United Kingdom, some major companies which have not paid their tax have been exposed. I want to know how we can be assured that Ireland gets its fair slice of the tax take for these companies. Do we connect up with the United Kingdom, Belgium and France to check if we are getting our fair share or do we rely on the companies to tell us what they are getting with no checks and balances? We have to go further on that issue and I do not accept the lobby from the large multiples on it. We could have a big discussion on alcohol. I do not agree with Senator Sean D. Barrett. We need to get serious. There is legislation in place which needs to be commenced on separating the sale of alcohol from other grocery goods. At the very least, we should commence that. We do not have to wait to discuss it or draft it.

I thank all my colleagues on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, in particular those involved in the drafting of the report, including Senator Mary Ann O'Brien, on the work that went into it. The report cannot be left sitting on the shelf; it must be dealt with and implemented. There are a number of areas, in particular in the food supply chain, which are under threat. If protections are not built in, some products will not be available to consumers in Ireland in ten years time. Milk is one of those products. I fully appreciate the retail sector's reluctance to go down the road of a code of conduct, an ombudsman, etc. I also appreciate the retail sector in Ireland has lost 50,000 jobs over the past five or six years and that it is the largest employer, with 250,000 people working in it. It is a profitable sector because the retail price of food in a supermarket in the Republic of Ireland is, on average, 18% above the EU average.As stated by Senator Jillian van Turnhout and others, most of the multiples do not disclose the percentage of profit they make in Ireland. It is all thrown into the one pot, so to speak, and an annual worldwide figure is given. That is wrong. The European legislation the Minister quoted must be re-examined. The Council of Ministers must examine this issue to determine if there is a way to allow member states to force multiples who operate within their area to publish the profits they make within that state based on the expenditure of the taxpayers who buy products in their stores. I am sure there is a way of doing that. This is all about the supplier, the small producer, getting into the big game and supplying the likes of Tesco, Dunnes Stores, Aldi and Lidl. The majority of retail sales in Ireland are in the small country shop or grocer but we have all heard the stories about them being driven out of business due to the huge buying power of the multinationals and that comes with added benefits for the consumer. We must recognise that because it has brought about competition in the retail grocery sector, which must be welcomed, but issues arise in that regard. I am fully supportive of a statutory code of conduct. It is the only way to give protection to the retailer and to the consumer but also to have checks and balances in place for the retailer, the producer and the middle man. I fully support the role of an ombudsman. There would be a cost but the cost in England was £5 million. With the economies of scale the figure would be much less here, but that is only 1 p per person for their weekly shop. We have to put this in context, and the retail sector must bear some of the cost. On the continuing issue of so-called hello money, although the Competition (Amendment) Act 2006 was to deal with that, it has not. I have spoken to small producers who are still being told by major retailers that if they want the prominent position in the supermarket, they must pay hello or "coerce" money. That issue is not being dealt with because the small producer is afraid that if they report it to the competition ombudsman or the consumer agency, they will lose the contract with the supplier. I agree with everything that has been said about the milk issue. There is a crisis within the liquid milk supply chain in this country. There is liquid milk and creamery milk. The liquid milk is the milk we drink year round, whether it is January or the middle of July, and there is additional cost because it is a year round production. Thirty-two per cent of the liquid milk suppliers have left the industry in the past ten years according to the National Milk Agency report of 2012. The farmer's share of the retail price has dropped over that ten years from 43% to 32%. While the retail price increases, therefore, the farmer's share, as referred to by Senator Mary Ann O'Brien, has dropped. Liquid milk producers are now producing milk at 7 cent per litre below the cost of production. That cannot continue. There are only 2,150 liquid milk producers in the State. If this issue is not dealt with, in five or ten years time, we will all be buying the UHT packets to provide the milk for our cereals, tea and coffee and to drink. That is something none of us wants to contemplate and unless this issue is dealt with on a statutory basis, we will no longer have the carton of milk available to us.

I should not name names but they have been in business and have a good deal to say to which we must listen carefully. I want to make three points, one of which is about profits. I support scrutiny of profits of multiples in particular. I have mentioned Tesco previously. The margin Tesco gains on sales in its Irish operations rose in 2010 and 2011 to 7.2% while at the same time the margin across Tesco worldwide was less than 6%. Even at a time of recession in Ireland, Tesco was pulling more cash out of its Irish stores than anywhere else, and one of its executives in England referred to Ireland as "treasure island" for Tesco. Second, it would be impossible to leave out the issue of labelling on a day when the Irish Farmers Association has revealed that various brands, which it has named, have been confusing consumers by using Irish labels that suggest they are using Irish pigmeat when the results from its DNA survey showed there is a mixture and that 52% of products are not Irish. I say that as a consumer who looks for Irish products when I go into a supermarket. I feel reassured, for example, when I see Glensallagh product in Lidl that I am buying an Irish product, only to I discover that I am not. Senator Feargal Quinn spoke eloquently about the free market, and he is right, but the free market can only operate where all actors have full information on all available choices. Where there are subtle psychological tricks or deals being done behind the scenes which push Irish suppliers off the shelves because of the "hello" money referred to by Senator Brian Ó Domhnaill, the least we must ensure is that people know what is going on. At an IFA meeting in Mullingar last night, a farmer made a throwaway comment but we all knew what he was talking about. He said the minute one complains to the retailer, one is gone. That is the fear. That fear has to be addressed and the only way it can be addressed, while fully respecting the free market idea, is by providing information to people about everything that is going on. That is why I support the motion.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	14959	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-20 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	147	-----and they were fantastic. I will go through the issues very quickly. Regulations will be based on the draft code published by the Minster in 2011. The main issue for competition in the grocery goods sector is entry into the market. In this context, the retail planning guidelines were one of the main issues identified. That is from an earlier contribution. There is a commitment in An Action Plan for Jobs to examine consumer price issues. A report on that will be issued by Forfás in the coming months which will examine the reason price levels are so high in certain areas within the market. The EU measures were a voluntary set of principles, not a code. They were adopted in September 2013. There are many players in the chain who have not signed up to those principles, which are similar to those behind the draft code published by the Minister in 2011. If a retailer or a supplier is not engaged in any prohibitive practice, they will have nothing to fear from the new regulations. The issue of dominance in the market came up in the debate. Dominance in the market is not illegal but an abuse of that dominance is illegal. I listened carefully to Senators Feargal Quinn and Mary Ann O'Brien on the issue of hello money and the subtle practices around trying to get a product placed on the shelves. We all appreciate that there are well established practices one engages in when one tries to get a product onto the shelf, but the Competition (Amendment) Act 2006 prohibits hello money being demanded. Natural justice demands, however, that defendants hear from their accusers. I am a former Labour Party spokesperson on agriculture and have dealt with the issues of hello money and sharp practices, but we appear to have a culture here where people are unwilling to challenge the type of paradigm that exists regarding pressures put on by certain multiples. If it is happening, somebody should come forward. There is legislation to deal with the issue but until somebody comes forward, what do we do? That is a rhetorical question.That explains the issue of profits in respect of some of the large multiples to which the Senator referred. It is well known that some large retailers are private companies and are not covered by some company law requirements. When I was spokesperson on agriculture, I regularly met the IFA which always states it is a price-taker. The IFA is the most powerful lobby in this country and I have always failed to understand how it is a price-taker. I have told the current and previous presidents of the IFA and others across the spectrum that I do not understand why the most powerful lobby in this country is a price-taker for the purposes of its interaction. I understand what happens inside the farm gate and the relationship with a co-op and we do not know what the dynamic of the market will be after 2015. As a personal opinion, I imagine that price levels will rise on the global market and will then stream off but I imagine there will be arrangements by which milk producers will strike a price with their individual co-ops to achieve stability within the price ranges for a guaranteed period. I am not on top of that matter as we speak but I take the point made about milk. I pay tribute to Deputy Andrew Doyle, Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine because the committee's recommendation No. 9, which is very interesting, speaks to an all-Ireland market for contracted winter milk and that should be encouraged. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, should take that on board. As there is legislation pending in this area my officials who are here and I will take on board the points made today, and the issues pertaining to agriculture and the food sector will be conveyed to the Minister. I hope I have interpreted correctly Senator Mary Ann O'Brien's point about the nanny state. I agree with the point. The retail sector is robust and if one has a good product it will make it onto the shelf but there is a subtlety about how that happens and how high up or low down the product will be. There is no sharp practice there. We all understand that but we have to distinguish between that practice, which is inherent to the retail trade, and hello money. I have not even begun to address all of the Senators' points. In the United Kingdom only one adjudicator was appointed. There are no full-time staff, the staff are sent in as required. The estimated cost was €5 million and I understand the point made about that but we propose including the role within the new NCA competition area and there will be a suite of resources available to enforce the role as required. On the issue of enforceability abroad, this applies to all member states that have codes or regulations. This is one of the issues raised in the EU Green Paper which the Commission is considering. It remains to be seen how that will emerge because I understand that it would not be part of the co-decision procedure but will be a function of whether member states take it on board. We have to acknowledge that there are two opposing lobbies within some of the employer and business representative organisations, to which members pay subscriptions. There is no specific recommendation on own brands, but I hail from a town that was once the bastion of the Irish sugar industry and during my college years I worked in Irish Sugar. I recall one day taking off the Irish Sugar label, placing it on the ground and putting on another own-brand label. The price differential was 10p at the time. Two packets of the same product sit beside each other in the same shop. Is that a consumer issue? Is it a marketing issue? Is it a question of the psychology of markets? If I buy a packet of SuperValu tea it is as good as some of the other brands that are synonymous with Cork. Does that come off the same line? I do not know. As a consumer, I am conscious of it, that is the point I am making. Consumers are very intelligent about their choices and we have to allow for that dynamic and not necessarily legislate for it. That is a personal opinion but we will see what the legislation will bring.

I welcome the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, and thank him for taking the time to deal with this matter today. I also thank the Minister for the work he has done to date in regard to reform in our legal process. Substantial reforms have been made in the past two and a half years and it is important we give recognition to it. In particular, the big reform is the constitutional change that has been made and which we will implement in regard to the setting up of the court of civil appeal. It is an important change in order to move appeals out of the Supreme Court, where there is currently a delay of up to four years. There have been a number of other changes such as the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, the Criminal Justice Act and, in regard to my own constituency, the Bill we put through to allow for the building of a new prison in Cork. Changes are occurring in the Department of Justice and Equality as a direct result of the Minister's involvement and influence, and I thank him for the work he is doing in this area. It is also important that I acknowledge the work of the justice committee in regard to missing persons. Its report in May 2012 involved a number of Senators, including Senators Ivana Bacik, Paul Bradford, Martin Conway, Rónán Mullen and Denis O'Donovan, and I acknowledge their contribution in dealing with this issue. I also commend the Law Reform Commission, which produced a comprehensive 160-page report in January last. When the Law Reform Commission comes forward with a report, it is important that we try to follow up on its recommendations. One of the people involved was Ms Marie Baker, SC, who is from Cork and with whom I have been in communication in trying to bring forward this Bill. As the law stands, if a person goes missing and it is clear from all the evidence available that they have died, there is no legal procedure available to allow for their estate to be managed. The records of the missing persons bureau of the Garda Síochána show that almost 20 people are reported as missing every day, amounting to over 7,000 missing person reports annually. Fortunately, in the vast majority of cases, the person who has been thought to be missing turns up safe. However, in 2011, of the 8,511 recorded reports of missing persons, 28 people remained missing at the end of that year. The Law Reform Commission produced the report, Civil Law Aspects of Missing Persons, in January 2013. Following on from the publication of this report and the proposals contained therein, I have published the Civil Law (Missing Persons) Bill 2013. The primary purpose of the Bill is to deal with the civil law status of missing persons. It puts in place a statutory framework which would provide for the making a presumption of death order in respect of two categories of missing persons. The first category is where the circumstances of the disappearance indicate that a death is virtually certain. The second category is where both the circumstances and the length of the disappearance indicate that it is highly probable that the missing person has died or will not return, which is where the disappearance occurred in dangerous circumstances or in other circumstances in which the loss of life may be presumed. The Bill is intended to clarify the legal position where a person is missing, who is entitled to apply to the court for an interim manager to manage the missing person's estate and what procedures must be complied with before the courts will issue a presumption of death order. It also places an obligation on those who are appointed to manage the estate of the missing person, including the requirement to effect a policy of insurance. Under the Bill, the definition of a missing person is clearly defined as a person who is observed to be missing from his or her normal patterns of life, where those who are likely to have heard from the missing person are unaware of his or her whereabouts or where the circumstances of the person being missing raise concern for the person's safety and well-being. The Bill sets out who is entitled to apply to the Circuit Court for a management order or for a presumption of death order.It may be the spouse, civil partner, cohabitee or any other family member of the missing person. Under the proposed legislation, a court registrar may make an order appointing a person as an interim manager provided the latter role is limited to such matters as accessing a bank account in order to pay utility bills or make repayment on a loan or mortgage. An order to appoint an interim manager may only be made where reasonable efforts have been made to locate the missing person and where, for at least 90 days, the person has not contacted anyone who lives at his or her last known home address or any relative or friend with whom the person would be likely to communicate. The interim manager must act in the best interests of the missing person at all times. The Bill also provides that the order must specify the exact powers being assigned to the manager and that the appointment is for a period of up to two years, which can be extended for a further two years. The manager will be required to file annual accounts with the court. In the event that the interim manager becomes aware that the missing person is alive, he or she must apply to the court for an order discharging his or her appointment. The Bill puts in place a statutory framework for the provision of presumption of death orders. Where a person is applying for such an order, he or she must provide specific evidence tending to indicate that the missing person is dead, including the circumstances surrounding the person's disappearance, evidence of an absence of communication with people who would be likely to hear from the missing person, and an indication of the last known correspondence or communication from the missing person and the length of time since his or her disappearance. Evidence must also be produced of the efforts made to find the missing person, including evidence from searching organisations showing the attempts that were made to locate him or her. A presumption of death order may be made by a coroner following an inquest held under the Coroners Act 1962 where the coroner is satisfied that in respect of the missing person, the circumstances of the person having gone missing indicate that his or her death is virtually certain. The Bill goes on to provide that a death order may be made by the Circuit Court where the court is satisfied that in respect of a missing person, the circumstances of his or her having gone missing are such that his or death is highly probable. The Bill further provides that prior to making the order, the coroner or court, as appropriate, may serve notice to any person who might be affected by the making of the order. I commend the Bill to the House. The Law Reform Commission report provides a comprehensive examination of the difficulties faced by the families of missing persons. The Bill takes account of these difficulties and seeks to provide legal mechanisms to assist the families. I thank the Minister for his announcement earlier this month that 4 December will be Missing Persons Day. This is the first year in which a day has been set aside to remember people who have gone missing and their families. I take the opportunity to acknowledge the work done by Davitt College in County Mayo which has won an award for its research in this area.

I thank my colleague, Senator Colm Burke, for bringing this Bill to the House. It was only after reading through it that I realised the huge difficulties facing families when a loved one goes missing for a long period. The Bill is intended to put in place a statutory framework for the making of a presumption of death order in respect of the two categories of missing persons, as outlined by the Senator. People are reported missing on a daily basis to An Garda Síochána and, in most cases, they turn up within a short timeframe. The verifiable statistic for missing persons in this country is 393 between 2003 and 2011. People go missing for a variety of reasons. Some want to break contact with their family for emotional reasons, financial reasons, because of mental illness and so on. Whatever the reason, their actions, which only they can justify, can cause enormous pain to their families and friends. As I said, 393 people are listed as missing in Ireland. Nobody in this House can articulate or understand the pain of the families of missing people, hoping each day for news and some type of closure to their ongoing pain. Their suffering is magnified in the limbo of not knowing what has become of their loved ones. When a person has been missing for a considerable period, certain issues must be dealt with, however painful this is for the family. The Law Reform Commission report entitled, Civil Law Aspects of Missing Persons, states that under the current law, there is no process by which those left behind can deal with the immediate practical and legal issues that may arise. As a consequence, those left behind often suffer a range of financial consequences. For example, the bank accounts of a family bread winner may become inaccessible. It may be difficult to claim social welfare benefits. Interest on any outstanding loans may increase. Mortgage arrears may increase and, in some cases, the sale of a family home may be prevented. It is important, therefore, that some type of interim manager be appointed to ensure there is an efficient system in place to protect the affairs of the missing person and his or her family members, as required. There are important issues to consider. For instance, what is the situation for spouses or civil partners who may wish to move on with their lives after a period of time? Are such persons classed as still married or being in a civil partnership? What will happen to any legal entitlement to any assets from the affairs of the missing person? The Law Reform Commission report states that the law should be responsive to the complexity of consequences that arise in these situations and is of the view that the current position does not meet the requisite standard. In considering this legislation we must be mindful of the anguish of families, while at the same time seeking to protect the legitimate interests of the missing person. Provision must also be made in the event of a missing person turning up after being missing for a lengthy period, although such scenarios are few and far between. The Law Reform Commission recommends that an insurance bond be taken out in order to cover any financial loss to the missing person that may arise. Such a measure should be incorporated into the Bill. There have been several high-profile missing person cases in Ireland over the years. These include the women who went missing in the Leinster area in the 1990s and the disappeared in Northern Ireland. Somebody knows something about these and other cases. I urge anybody with any information to notify the Garda and thereby help to put an end to the long-term suffering and pain of the families. I take the opportunity to commend the missing persons helpline for its work in supporting families whose loved one has gone missing. If there are people who do not, for whatever reason, want to be found, they might consider contacting the helpline. The people who run the service can act as intermediaries in passing on a message to worried families, thus relieving some of their anxiety and stress. This Bill will require a lengthy and comprehensive debate in this House. I thank Senator Colm Burke for bringing the issue of missing persons to the fore in order to protect their best interests and those of their families.
#LabhrasOMurchu	unknown-#LabhrasOMurchu-party	unknown-#LabhrasOMurchu-dob	unknown-#LabhrasOMurchu-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-20 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	151	I welcome the Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, and acknowledge the work done by Senator Colm Burke in bringing forward this finely balanced legislation. It is evident that the Senator and those who assisted him have given a great deal of time to considering the complexities and uncertainties which apply when it comes to missing persons and their families. I have raised the plight of people whose loved ones have gone missing on several occasions in this House. Each time I go to a railway station or walk the streets of Dublin and see the tattered bills hanging on poles with photographs of people whose families are seeking information on their whereabouts, I am struck by the limbo in which these people are living. It is not just the uncertainty of their loved one being missing or their not being able to grieve; it is the difficulties they face in trying to maintain some type of normal life. As we know, bureaucracy can be very obstructive, particularly where the relevant legislation is inadequate or non-existent. It is quite easy to walk away from issues such as these, uttering sentiments of compassion before moving on to the next story.Senator Colm Burke has got behind the headlines in this. He realises as well that there are different stories relating to missing persons, for example, young people who in care have gone missing and, in the case of families, a spouse might have gone missing. He has encapsulated all of those issues quite well in the legislation before us. My belief over the years, as I have said each time I have spoken on this in the House, is that I would first like to find some type of resolution for the people before we deal with legislation. I am not saying An Garda Síochána has not been doing good work in this regard, but having spoken to the families of people who are missing, and in some cases it appears they have been murdered, I began to realise that even from the point of view of investigating cold cases, a very urgent approach is required. There must be focused people involved in the investigation, and the investigation must be active at all times. Just because a long period of time has elapsed we should not take it for granted that answers cannot be found. Answers can still be found but what is required is a dedicated unit working on it, as well as whatever finance is required. I accept that a helpline, which is long overdue, is very important. It certainly brings comfort to the people concerned when they can speak to somebody. However, more than that is required. There should be constant contact between the forces of law and the people who are still waiting for answers. I am not suggesting there is anything contrary to that in the Bill, but I am taking it back a step because I believe a great deal can be achieved. At times, in some of these cases one reads in the newspapers that a new line of inquiry is starting, particularly in the case of the unfortunate women who disappeared in a particular area. It is sometimes suggested that there is a link between those cases, but I believe the families at this stage have given up hope of finding them alive. That said, as long as they do not know what happened, there will be continuing trauma for them. With regard to the detail of the Bill, it is very important to consider situations whereby if a family finds itself in that position, there is a legal opportunity for them to get their affairs in order. What we are discussing, without even going into the issue of life insurance or matters of that nature, is the legal opportunities they require. In most of the cases, the families have probably given up all hope and expect to be in a limbo until the end of their days. That is very sad. For that reason the legislation is very welcome. There are almost 400 people involved, which is a huge number. However, it is also an opportunity to work directly with them. If the Bill is accepted and goes through all Stages, although I do not know what the outcome will be, it should not just be a matter of passing legislation. There should be a personal forum for the people involved, in order that they can get advice on what can be achieved. They might still not be capable of understanding what the opportunities are and there might be extra information available once they start to consider what options they have. I hope there will be an opportunity to meet some level of the Government to discuss, as has happened in other cases, what the methods and costs are likely to be. Finance will be an issue for these people and they should be able to avail of any of the legal processes provided to them. That personal approach will not solve all the cases but it will help the families. I have spoken to some of the families and they are lovely people. They do not criticise anybody, they are just suffering morning, noon and night. Their family life has virtually come to an end. Even to get a letter, as I discovered when I wrote to some of the families, generates absolute gratitude simply because one made contact. I am not important enough to represent anything that might lead to some conclusion for them, but I hope the legislation will have that link to the community. There was reference to the disappeared in Northern Ireland. Ten bodies have been located but seven have not. I did not know I would be speaking on this legislation this evening but I spoke on the Order of Business this morning about comments made by the Attorney General for Northern Ireland. I made the point that if we want the peace process on this island to come to fruition, it is vital to realise that it is about far more than just structures and policies. It is about decency and humanity. In any conflict situation the people who are bereaved and left behind suffer for the rest of their lives. I have long believed that if there had been a truth and justice or a truth and reconciliation commission, we would have built much more carefully towards what should have been done after the conflict had finished. We missed that opportunity. There might have been reasons for that which we do not understand, but I still believe it should not be ruled out. However, the suffering of the people who are waiting for the remains of those seven people to be found has to be immense. As with all cases of missing persons, the fact that there is no body to bury or grieve over is like a second death. I hope and expect that in the near future progress will be made in discovering those seven bodies. There are many tragedies and many stories behind each tragedy, but one cannot walk away from any part of it. If one does not respond to each issue, whether it is the disappeared or missing, it will always be there and one will not have brought everybody along with the efforts being made. I compliment Senator Colm Burke on the work he has done. It is a finely balanced Bill. As we debate it further, it will become evident that many of the questions that arise about the complexities of operating legislation such as this are answered in the Bill.
#IvanaBacik	unknown-#IvanaBacik-party	unknown-#IvanaBacik-dob	unknown-#IvanaBacik-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-20 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	152	I welcome the Minister and commend Senator Colm Burke for taking the initiative in introducing this Bill. I am glad that it will have the support of both the Minister and colleagues on all sides of the House. All of us recognise the need to take action on this issue. Senator Colm Burke referred to a number of the other initiatives that have already been taken in this area. I am a member of the justice committee which produced a report on missing persons in May 2012, following a series of hearings the committee held with groups and individuals who had direct experience of the tragedy of a missing person and who had done a good deal of work on it. The Senator also mentioned the transition year students of Davis College, Mallow, who gave very impressive evidence to the committee. They had produced a forget-me-not calendar and had done a great deal of work on highlighting the issue of missing persons. Among a number of ways to address this issue was a recommendation of a missing persons day, a recommendation we adopted in our report. I am glad that recommendation is being acted upon and that there will be a national missing persons day. Members of the Law Reform Commission also appeared before the justice committee during the hearings. They had produced a consultation paper on this issue and subsequently, last January, produced a report on the civil law status of missing persons, which has greatly influenced and shaped Senator Colm Burke's Bill.The Bill is highly significant and a great deal of work has been done on it. It clearly deals with many procedural matters that were highlighted in the Law Reform Commission report, in particular the presumption of death order. There is a lacuna in the law in this area. Where a family member is missing, there is a difficulty in resolving the civil status of that person and the Bill would address that key issue. Our report dealt with a number of other issues. We were not specifically considering civil status because we were conscious that the Law Reform Commission was doing work on that issue. We were dealing in a more general sense with the challenges and difficulties encountered in the search for missing persons. When we were conducting the hearings, we were very conscious of the numbers involved, as others have mentioned. In 2012, we were told that the number of persons reported missing to the Garda over the previous five years was 40,500. Senator Hildegarde Naughton referred to different categories of people who went missing. At the time, we were told that, sadly, a large number went children missing from care but, happily, the majority of them were located and found to be safe within 24 hours. Other groups of people who go missing include those who have medical conditions and adults who wish to start a new life and do not wish to be found, which is clearly a very specific category. Reflecting on what the committee was told by gardaí and representatives of other agencies, State and voluntary, I think the Bill is applicable to adults who go missing. One of the issues we might address on Committee Stage is whether there should be a different way of treating the serious issue of children who go missing. Apart from the recommendation on having a national missing persons day, the other recommendations we made included the establishment of a helpline for those wishing to report a missing person. I know we have had debates in this House on that issue and a good deal of work has been done on it. We also recommended enhanced co-operation between the Garda, the relevant State bodies and the recognised NGOs, and the possible involvement of mobile telephone service providers in the provision of the amber alert which people mentioned. We also talked about the need for a public information process, which the students in Davis College had been strongly advocating. We called for this to include the delivery of a fact sheet to all homes in the State providing details of helplines. We also recommended the provision of a place of remembrance for the families of missing persons, which was recommended strongly to us by those who had had direct experience, as a way for them to mark the tragedy that had occurred in their family. Senator Colm Burke has done a great deal of work. The presumption of death order is the critical focus of much of the Bill. It would be vital to introduce rigorous tests before a court could make that order. On Committee Stage we will need to interrogate the process for application and the test to be satisfied in an application for a presumption of death order. I know we can work on that sort of detail on Committee Stage. It is great that the Bill is approved in principle by all Members of the House.

I particularly welcome Senator Colm Burke's initiative which has us all in agreement. His Bill addresses a clear lacuna in the law governing the management of the estate of a missing person presumed dead and is in keeping with the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission's report, Civil Law Aspects of Missing Persons, which was published in January. As Senator Colm Burke stated, between 7,000 and 8,000 people are reported missing each year in Ireland, which is almost 20 every day. Thankfully, the majority turn up or are found within a very short period. Less than 1% remain missing indefinitely. According to the most recent figures from the Garda missing persons bureau, of the 62,462 people reported missing between 2003 and 2011, 382 remain missing. The Bill deals with the civil law status of long-term missing persons and allows for the making of a presumption of death order in two cases: where the death is virtually certain or where the length of disappearance indicates that the person is dead and will not return. The Bill before us is important not just from a practical point of view in allowing a spouse, civil partner, cohabitant or other family member of the missing person to manage his or her estate and tie up loose ends, but also in facilitating the grieving process. All too often the family and friends of a long-term missing person are left in perpetual limbo with no movement or opportunity for closure, even in circumstances where death is virtually certain or the length of time missing suggests the death of a person. While cross-party support is very welcome, I hope it means we can progress the Bill through this House and the Lower House without delay. It must be unbearable to have a loved one missing. The Bill would allow the State to play a small supportive role in an absolutely unbearable time for a family. While the numbers seem relatively small, we know the effect each missing person has on his or her direct and extended family and local community. I wholeheartedly support the Bill and will support it throughout each Stage. I agree we need to ensure the process is robust. I welcome the initiative taken by Senator Colm Burke. All too often we see reports published without action. It is very welcome he has taken the initiative of bringing the Bill before the House.

I thank Senator Colm Burke for his Bill. Those of us who know the Senator know him for his thoroughness and conscientiousness, and those characteristics shine through in the Bill. Like the other speakers, I welcome what we are doing. Senator Jillian van Turnhout has just said how important these events are. I remember the little posters and scripts for Trevor Deeley throughout town as his family searched for him. I believe he disappeared very near this building. I also think of Jo Jo Dullard who was so liked by her family and wanted to be with them that she was trying to get home one night and was last seen near Castledermot. We should reach out to the families who so sadly miss people such as the two I mentioned. It is important we assist those who are grieving without confirmation or evidence of the death of their friend or relative. Senator Ivana Bacik mentioned a day of remembrance and perhaps a place of remembrance. Should we consider a section in graveyards and cemeteries for those who do not have a body but would like to go there to remember the spirit of those who they know in their hearts have departed? The importance of that was illustrated when the well-known broadcaster and graduate of UCC, Graham Norton, stated he did not really appreciate west Cork and Ireland until he came back for his father's funeral and realised that Cork meant much more to him than London where he lives for most of the year. It is important for our society that we assist those who have had this grievous loss and who are, as other speakers have said, left in that limbo for the seven years. I welcome the sections that provide for access to bank accounts to pay utility bills within 90 days and the manager to operate the estate for two years with the possibility of renewal for two years. Section 4(13) provides that a coroner can make a presumption of death, which is useful to the Minister and to us as a deliberative assembly. Coroners have experience and if they are able to make such a recommendation, I would reckon that in 99% of cases in these circumstances we may take it that the person could be safely declared as dead - virtually certain as outlined in the explanatory memorandum. The current situation is cruel because of the weight of the seven year requirement, which we are addressing.I welcome the indication that the Minister will also be supporting the Bill. That is commendable and shows again the valued role of Parliament in assisting people who badly need our assistance in these matters. What kind of things might we consider? The Bill provides for the Attorney General to keep a register of presumed deaths. Could the Attorney General review the long-term cases for the purposes of offering presumption of death orders to family members? How much of this process would he wish to be the guardian of and how much of it would the Minister want him to be in charge of? In respect of some of the ways in which banks operate, will this section deal with access to bank accounts to pay utility bills? We might look at that in the future to see if the legislation should oblige the banks to release the money to the family once an interim manager has been appointed. In respect of deaths abroad, if our expertise in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and consulates can assist this process by saying that person X was in the area where a tsunami, hurricane or typhoon took place, we could allow the Department in its reflective judgment to certify that a missing person was dead rather than putting the expense of visiting those countries on the relatives. We might consider letting the Department register a death overseas and issue a certified copy of the register to the General Register Office.  Those are just suggestions. It is an important part of life which Parliament can assist. We all agree that seven years is too long a period to wait in a situation of grief and stress. I am very proud to be associated with Senator Colm Burke's Bill which I commend to the House.

Ba mhaith liom tréaslú leis an Seanadóir Colm de Búrca, mar atá déanta ag mo chomhghleacaithe, as ucht na reachtaíochta seo a thabhairt chun cinn. Is mian liom a rá freisin go mbeidh Sinn Féin ag tacú leis an mBille. I might add a story from my own family to the debate. An aunt of mine disappeared. She was my mother's oldest sister who went to London when she was only 18 or 19 years old. We lost contact with her. My mother's family had absolutely no contact with her and we did not know what had happened. This continued for 30 years and a brother of mine made numerous attempts through the authorities, the Salvation Army and the Terry Wogan show in Great Britain to find my aunt. He had no luck whatsoever so in one sense, I can relate to that sense of not knowing what had happened. My mother always wondered what had happened to my aunt. Thankfully, we had a happy ending to the story. A cousin of mine happened to be at a bus stop in London one morning and often met this man who owned a carpet shop in London. She struck up a conversation with him one morning. He was Cypriot and asked my cousin where she was from and about her family. She explained that her family was from Connemara and he said "That's interesting. I'm married to a woman from Connemara." It turned out to be my aunt. It was a complete fluke of a meeting but it is a true story. My aunt did come back and, thankfully, she had been alive. There was no particular reason for losing contact. She just built her own life, got married and had two children who are older than me. She passed away recently at a ripe old age. She had been repatriated with the family.  In a sense, it gives credence to the opposite side of the argument that the disappeared, thankfully, do reappear in some cases and it can be out of the blue and through amazing experiences. We also obviously realise that there are cases where there is no happy ending to the story. Senator Colm Burke's Bill addresses that hiatus in the law and we support it. I am glad the Government will accept the Bill on Second Stage and possibly bring forward amendments on Committee Stage. The crux of the Civil Law (Missing Persons) Bill 2013 is to help families of missing persons to deal with the management of their estates. As the law stands, there is no legal procedure in place to allow for the management of the estate in cases where it is clear from all evidence that the person has died.  This change makes practical sense. We should be striving to make things easier for families of missing persons who have already come through so much trauma. The two categories of missing persons are well defined within the Bill and I welcome this as a means of making it easier to identify to whom this Bill relates. Earlier this year, the Law Reform Commission stated the need to have a statutory framework to deal with some immediate practical problems for family members. The commission pointed out that there was a particular need to allow access to a missing person's bank account, particularly where the account was in the person's sole name, in order that bills could be paid. The commission also recommended that legislation be enacted to allow the family left behind to apply to the Circuit Court after a person had been missing for 90 days to allow interim management of the missing person's property. This would allow the family to pay bills or renew insurance on a car or motor bike. This process could be in place for up to two years with a possible extension of two or more years. The commission's report also recommended the reform of the law on presumed death, in particular to ensure that families can, as far as possible, deal in the least expensive way with the emotional trauma of their loved ones going missing. I welcome the fact that the Bill is giving life to many of the recommendations in the Law Reform Commission's report on civil law regarding missing persons. It is very important that this Bill has been brought forward.  I will touch on the issue of the disappeared. There is quite a bit of innuendo around this issue when it is raised in the political arena and certainly in the media. On behalf of Sinn Féin, I state categorically that it is a massive issue. There is great trauma and hurt relating to the disappeared. I also wish to categorically state that any member of my party who had any information on the disappeared has given it to the relevant authorities and we have co-operated fully and will continue to do so if called upon. This has been backed up on numerous occasions by the independent commission. Everything we can do has been done. I know our leader has met the families of all of the disappeared, which has not been brought across in some of the media coverage. Ba mhaith liom tréaslú arís leis an Seanadóir a chur an Bille seo os ár gcomhair, agus freisin tacaíocht Shinn Féin don reachtaíocht a léiriú uair amháin eile.

One wonders what she thought the rest of her family was doing when she disappeared. This is one who disappeared to reappear 30 years later. It is an insight into the difficulties in this area. I congratulate Senator Colm Burke for taking the initiative to introduce legislation to address the civil law issues that arise when a person goes missing. This is an important area of law and I am pleased to announce that the Government has decided to support the Senator's Bill in principle. Obviously, there will be issues on which we will seek amendments when the Bill is considered in due course on Committee Stage. As Members are aware, I am a strong advocate of Private Members' Bills, having introduced many such Bills in the Dáil during my career and I look forward to bringing the enactment of this Bill to a successful conclusion during the lifetime of the Government and assisting the Senator in that regard.  It is a truly terrible experience for any family if a family member goes missing. The recent documentaries on the disappeared have shown us once again how the sense of loss reverberates within families for decades. It can be devastating for a family not to know what has happened to a loved one and to be plagued forever by uncertainty. The law cannot ease the pain of loss and uncertainty. However, what it can do is provide a mechanism for closure in legal terms. There is provision in Irish law to address some of the civil issues that arise when a person goes missing. The Coroners Act 1962 gives me as Minister for Justice and Equality the power to direct the coroner to hold an inquest where death has occurred and the body has been destroyed or is irrecoverable. As Members are aware, there is also a common law presumption that if a person has been missing for seven years and has not been in contact with family or friends and if reasonable efforts have been made unsuccessfully to locate them, the High Court may make an order that the person be presumed dead.As Members are aware, there is also a common law presumption that, if a person has been missing for seven years, has not been in contact with family or friends and reasonable efforts have been made unsuccessfully to locate him or her, the High Court may make an order that the person be presumed dead. As the common law presumption is rebuttable, it is not always necessary to wait seven years to make such an application. The court can make a declaration of presumed death earlier if the evidence suggests it is highly likely the person is dead. This declaration of presumed death is usually made for probate purposes. The order does not result in the missing person's death being registered on the Register of Deaths under the Civil Registration Act 2004. A death certificate is, therefore, not issued. Moreover, the person's marriage or civil partnership is not ended as a consequence of the declaration. Senator Colm Burke's Civil Law (Missing Persons) Bill, therefore, addresses an issue in which legislation is needed. His Bill enables a presumption of death order to be made when a missing person is understood to be dead but where the death cannot be confirmed or where the body is irrecoverable. As such, it responds to the principles agreed by the Council of Europe in 2009 whereby states should provide for a person to be declared dead where death is virtually certain or highly probable. The Civil Law (Missing Persons) Bill also conforms to the Council of Europe's principle that the declaration of presumed death, in this case through the presumption of death order, would have all the legal effects of death in terms of its impact on property, succession and relationships. The Bill also provides a mechanism for an interim solution to be put in place where a person's affairs need to be managed in the short-term but where the person's ultimate circumstances are unclear. This will enable a person's liabilities, such as for a mortgage or car loan, to continue to be paid. Evidence from the United Kingdom has indicated that families can fall into financial hardship if they are unable to access the missing person's bank accounts to pay essential bills, particularly if he or she has been the main breadwinner. Financial hardship compounds the deep emotional distress being experienced by families in these circumstances. The Law Reform Commission report on the civil law aspects of missing persons, published only in January of this year as mentioned by some Senators, launched the debate advocating further legislation in this area. I thank the Law Reform Commission for highlighting the need for action to tackle this issue. The commission's report suggested our current legislative provisions did not respond adequately to the situations faced by
the families of those who go missing. It proposed instead a statutory framework that would provide for a presumption of death order both for those whose deaths are virtually certain and for those whose deaths are highly probable. Stringent proofs would be required under a range of specified headings when an application for a presumption of death order would be made to the court. The court would also have to take account of additional circumstances, including, where relevant, the abandonment of valuable property and the presence or absence of a motive for the missing person to remain alive but to disappear. This is a highly complex and sensitive area. Declaring a person dead has wide-ranging legal effects in terms of a person's property and relationships. It enables the person's property and assets to be distributed to beneficiaries. It allows for life insurance policies to be cashed. It triggers the payment of pensions and social welfare entitlements in many circumstances. In view of the significant potential effects of a presumption of death order, we have to be careful to ensure such orders are issued in the appropriate circumstances. It is always difficult when we do not have irrefutable proof that a person is actually dead. It places an enhanced responsibility upon us to ensure a presumption of death order is issued only when it is evident the person is dead on the balance of probabilities. Those who go missing, however, are not always dead. We have heard a very stark illustration in that context in this debate in the Seanad. There are many cases each year of people who go missing but who are alive. These can be young people unable to deal with the dynamics of relationships in the family home, mature people seeking to escape stressful situations or people seeking a new life and quite prepared to establish one, cutting their contacts with neighbours, friends and relations. They may evaporate from their usual environment to sample a new life elsewhere, either temporarily or permanently. There may even be people whose whereabouts are unknown to their families but who use social media or other means to confirm they are still alive. While these people may come within the provisions relating to the interim management of property, they are a different cohort from those for whom presumption of death orders have to be sought. We have to be clear as to the intended purpose of this legislation. Is the legislation intended to provide legal closure for the next of kin of those who are missing, believed dead? Is it instead intended to deal with the immediate financial and legal problems faced by families when a family member goes missing and disappears but who may still be alive? The legal issues in both instances are very different. Other jurisdictions have separate pieces of legislation reflecting their view that the issues arising are sufficiently distinct as to warrant separate statutory provision. In British Columbia in Canada, for instance, the Survivorship and Presumption of Death Act 1996 focuses on missing persons who are presumed to be dead and sets out a system for declaring them dead. Meanwhile, the Estates of Missing Persons Act 1996 deals with the situation of missing persons whose situation is unclear. That Act gives the Supreme Court of British Columbia the power to appoint a curator, so-called, to manage the estate of a person who has been missing for more than three months. Similarly, the recently enacted Presumption of Death Act 2013, which applies to England and Wales, focuses on missing persons who can be presumed dead. Senator Colm Burke's Bill seeks to encompass both categories of missing person. We will need to consider the scope of this legislation carefully to ensure the respective needs of both categories are clearly differentiated. Our concern is to avoid persons being prematurely - or even incorrectly - declared dead. In this context, I believe the Bill's definition of a missing person is too broad. Its definition is that a "missing person" means a person who is observed to be missing from his or her normal patterns of life, that those who are likely to have heard from the person are unaware of the person's whereabouts and that the circumstances of the person being missing raises concerns for his or her safety and well-being". Our primary purpose in the legislation, however, is to deal with missing persons who are believed to be dead or whose disappearance is such that legal arrangements have to be put in place to deal with the aftermath. The legislation is not intended to encompass all missing persons, since many of those who go missing subsequently return home after short periods. Accordingly, I believe we should define the target group more clearly, drawing on the Council of Europe's definition that "a "missing person" is a natural person whose existence has become uncertain, because he or she has disappeared without trace and there are no signs that he or she is alive". An overly loose definition could result in premature applications being made to the court, particularly relating to the appointment of interim managers of the property of those who were not truly missing. The question of whether to impose a minimum waiting period requires careful attention. The Council of Europe has recommended that only where the missing person's death can be taken as certain should there not be a minimum waiting period. The Council of Europe's deliberations on this issue came in the aftermath of the tsunami disaster of 2004 and the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, where people were known to have been killed but where their bodies were irrecoverable. This is a very particular category of missing persons. For those whose death was likely, the Council of Europe recommended a minimum waiting period of a year. It also recommended that the seven year waiting period be retained for missing persons whose deaths were uncertain. Senator Colm Burke's Bill removes the requirement for a minimum waiting period. When deciding whether to issue a presumption of death order, the court's judgment will be based on the evidence supplied with the application. While it is desirable to streamline processes to the greatest extent possible and to facilitate the families of missing persons to achieve legal certainty as quickly as possible, we will have to consider carefully whether to dispense with a minimum waiting period. This is an interesting issue we need to tease out carefully. The absence of a minimum waiting period increases the risk of erroneous claims in which presumption of death orders are issued too quickly and the person is subsequently found to be alive. As the Bill essentially limits the degree to which a returned person can recover property once distributed under a presumption of death order, the premature declaration of death would be greatly to the disadvantage of a missing person. We must ensure the Bill safeguards constitutional property rights. Similarly, the streamlining of such mechanisms unfortunately also increases the risk of vexatious claims in which applications for a presumption of death order are wrongly made to acquire property, insurance or other entitlements. The legislation we enact must put a robust system in place that can address the civil law issues and be capable of withstanding challenges. After all, the legislation will have a significant impact on property rights, relationships, marriages and civil partnerships in particular. The presumption of death order allows for a missing person's marriage or civil partnership to be ended on the same basis as does a death certificate. However, the Bill also provides for a missing person who returns, to apply to the court to overturn the dissolution of the marriage or civil partnership. While the objective to protect marriage is understandable for constitutional reasons, the Bill offers no protections for the other spouse or civil partner. This issue requires more detailed consideration to ensure that their interests are adequately safeguarded. I have highlighted some of the questions that have arisen in my preliminary examination of the Civil Law (Missing Persons) Bill 2013. This is a complex area of law which requires careful consideration. We need time to consider Senator Colm Burke's proposals and to assess the potentially wide-ranging implications of this legislation. The Office of the Attorney General needs to be consulted on this legislation as do the Government Departments and State agencies potentially involved, such as in the registration of deaths. My Department also needs to consider the implications for family law and for succession. Matters relating to court jurisdiction and the powers of coroners also have to be considered. The Government proposes to examine the Bill carefully and to bring forward substantial amendments that are appropriate and necessary on Committee Stage. I hope both Senator Colm Burke and other Members of the House will understand when I say that this process will take a minimum of 12 months because of the complexity of the issues to be addressed and the importance of taking a careful and considered approach. In addition, the timescale is due to the current legislative priorities which include completing enactment of the Legal Services Regulation Bill, progressing and enacting the proposed children and family relationships Bill, the immigration, regulation and asylum Bill, and the courts Bill which is required to establish the Court of Appeal. However, I assure the House and Senator Colm Burke that it is my objective to ensure that this legislation, with appropriate and necessary amendments, will be enacted during the lifetime of this Government, I hope during the first part of 2015. I congratulate Senator Colm Burke on putting such an important issue on the legislative agenda and on starting the legislative process. He has proposed legislative remedies that will release families from the legal nightmares in which they are often currently trapped and that will enable them to move on with their lives. I thank the Senator, in particular, for his initiative and the work he has undertaken. I look forward to working with him to refine this legislation as it passes through the Houses of the Oireachtas. I draw the attention of Members of the House to our first national Missing Persons Day, which is scheduled to take place on 4 December. It will be marked by a ceremony which I hope can be live streamed on the web. We are laying a foundation stone in this State for an EU-wide missing persons day that will be joined by other member states in years to come. We are engaged with some of our EU colleagues who are watching our proposals in this regard. As was illustrated this evening, when people go missing in any member state, they may establish new lives in another member state. The objective of the Missing Persons Day is to draw people's attention to the fact that people are missing. The objective is also to encourage the print and broadcasting media to highlight the situation of certain selected individuals who have gone missing in the hope that the information will attract media attention across the European Union. If individuals from one member state establish new lives in another member state, they will receive notice that family or friends are still trying to make contact with them and are anxious to know of their whereabouts and well-being. The project will generate an EU-wide focus on re-establishing relationships with missing persons who may, for a range of reasons, have established an alternative life elsewhere. It will create the possibility for them to reconnect with lost relations and friends.  I again thank Senator Colm Burke for his welcome initiative. He has started an important legislative process and once the Bill is enacted, it will prove to be of assistance to families for decades to come.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-20 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	157	I thank the Minister for his comments. I also thank Senators who have contributed to this debate, including Senators Hildegarde Naughton, Labhrás Ó Murchú, Ivana Bacik, Jillian van Turnhout, Sean D. Barrett and Trevor Ó Clochartaigh, for their constructive comments. This is only the start of the process and I fully agree with what the Minister said in that regard. He said the legislation we enact must put in place a robust system that can address civil law issues and be capable of withstanding challenges. I fully agree with him that it is a complex area and constitutional issues must be examined carefully. I fully understand his Department's position that it will take time. In August I had the privilege of meeting Mr. Cooney from the Department of Justice and Equality, who has since retired. I had a discussion with him and he was extremely helpful. I wish to thank both him and other departmental officials for their observations at that stage.  I acknowledge the work of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality in this area. In addition, the Law Reform Commission has produced a comprehensive report. The legislation I have brought forward is very much based on the commission's own draft proposals. I wish to thank the commission's members for their contribution.  I have discussed the matter with Ms Maria Baker, SC, who has offered to give her assistance on this matter. It is important for us to work together on the outstanding issues. There is no doubt that there will have to be amendments to the Bill because it deals with a complex area. Once the Department and the Office of the Attorney General have carefully considered the legislation, they will be bringing forward constructive amendments. I do not think we will have any difficulty in accepting them. We need to deal with this area, although it only affects a small number of people annually. As the figures provided by Senators Jillian van Turnhout and Hildegarde Naughton show, however, in the past ten or 11 years over 382 people have gone missing without trace. It is important for their families that we should move forward with this legislation.  I thank everyone, including the Minister, for contributing to the debate.

Tá mé an-bhuíoch gur tháinig sé anseo. Táimid ag iarraidh an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn ar gach leibhéal - ag an leibhéal áitiúil, ag leibhéal an Stáit agus ag an leibhéal Eorpach. Mar is eol dúinn, tá maolú i bhfeidhm i leith na Gaeilge mar theanga oifigiúil de chuid an Aontais Eorpaigh i láthair na huaire. Bhí sé curtha i dtoll a chéile i dtosach báire sa bhliain 2004 go dtabharfaí stádas faoi leith don Ghaeilge ag leibhéal an AE. Bhí muid ar fad an-dearfach faoi sin agus cheap muid gur céim an-láidir chun cinn a bhí ann. Ag an am sin, mar gheall air go raibh deacrachtaí ann ó thaobh líon na n-aistritheoirí agus ateangairí, srl., a bhí ar fáil lena leithéid de sheirbhís a sholáthar, tugadh maolú faoi leith nach gcaitheadh an rud ar fad a chur i bhfeidhm. Sa bhliain 2010, de réir mar a thuigim, cuireadh an maolú i bhfeidhm é ar feadh roinnt blianta eile. Ciallaíonn sé sin go bhfuil athbhreithniú le déanamh ar an gcinneadh sin i láthair na huaire. Go bunúsach, tá deis ann, agus an Ghaeilge mar theanga oifigiúil de chuid an AE, 183 nó 184 post a chur ar fáil do dhaoine a bheadh ag obair sa Choimisiún agus sa Pharlaimint thall ansin ag déanamh ateangaireacht, ag aistriú cáipéisí agus ag déanamh cinnte de go bhfuil an leibhéal céanna seirbhíse á thabhairt don Ghaeilge is atá á thabhairt do gach teanga oifigiúil eile. Níl sé sin á chur i bhfeidhm againn de bharr an mhaolaithe seo, a d'iarr Rialtas na hÉireann. Caithfear cinneadh a dhéanamh go luath, i ndáiríre, an bhfuilimid ag lorg an mhaolaithe sin a choimeád don chéad tréimhse eile. Tá súil agam go n-inseoidh an tAire Stáit dúinn anocht nach bhfuil sé sin amhlaidh, go bhfuil gach rud faoi réir agus go ndéanfaidh Comhairle an AE cinneadh maidir leis an mhaolú seo roimh dheireadh na bliana 2015, tar éis an athbhreithnithe fhoirmiúil. De réir mar a thuigim, caithfidh an Rialtas cur in iúl don AE go bhfuil an tír seo ag iarraidh go mbainfear an maolú seo amach ionas go dtarlóidh sé sin. Tá a fhios againn go maith go n-oibríonn an Coimisiún agus na hinstitiúidí eile go mall ó thaobh próiseas earcaíochta a eagrú agus poist a chur ar fáil, srl. Tá súil agam go bhféadfaí an 180 nó 190 post a bheadh ar fáil do lucht na Gaeilge a fhógairt, ach tá sé ag brath ar an Rialtas a leithéid a lorg. Ní foláir go mbeadh an t-iarratas sin á chur go dtí an Coimisiún. Iarraim ar an Rialtas cur in iúl don Choimisiún go luath - roimh dheireadh na bliana seo nó ag tús na bliana seo chugainn - go bhfuil sibh faoi réir. Is minic a mbíonn muid ag caitheamh anuas ar an Rialtas deireanach, ach tuigim go ndearna siad infheistíocht mhór sa chomhthéacs seo. De réir mar a thuigim, tá infheistíocht de bhreis is €8 milliún curtha ar fáil chun cúrsaí a sholáthar dóibh siúd a bheadh ag déanamh ateangaireachta agus aistriúcháin, ionas go mbeadh an cumas sin aitheanta. De réir mar a thuigim, roimh dheireadh na bliana 2012, bhí 243 duine cáilithe sna cúrsaí seo agus aitheantas dá réir tugtha dóibh. De réir eolais atá curtha ar fáil dom, tá 157 aistritheoir creidiúnaithe don earnáil phoiblí ar phainéal Fhoras na Gaeilge, mar shampla. Beidh scrúdú eile i gcóir an lucht creidiúnaithe sin an mhí seo chugainn. Tá deis ann sa chomhthéacs seo. Nílimid ag iarraidh aon duine ón tír seo a chur anonn go dtí an Bhruiséil nó go Strasbourg. Tá deis anseo 183 nó 184 post ardleibhéil a chur ar fáil roimh dheireadh na bliana 2016, ach gníomh dearfach a ghlacadh. Is é sin an fáth go bhfuil an cheist seo curtha agam tráthnóna. De réir mar a thuigim, titeann an cúram go hoifigiúil nó go foirmeálta ar Roinn an Taoisigh an rud seo a lorg. Sílim gur iarr an Roinn Gnóthaí Eachtracha agus Trádála roimhe seo go gcuirfí an maolú i bhfeidhm. B'fhéidir go bhfuil an tAire Stáit ag féachaint ar an gceist ar son an Rialtais. Tá súil agam go bhfuil sé i gceist ag an Rialtas an maolú seo a tharraingt siar ionas go mbeimid in ann stádas iomlán a bhaint amach don Ghaeilge ag leibhéal an AE agus na poist ríthábhachtacha seo a chur ar fáil.
#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-20 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	161	Is mian liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an Seanadóir Ó Clochartaigh as an ábhar seo a ardú ar an Athló tráthnóna. Fáiltím roimh an deis soiléiriú a thabhairt faoina bhfuil ar siúl ag an Rialtas faoi láthair maidir leis an cheist thábhachtach seo. Bhain an Ghaeilge aitheantas amach mar theanga oifigiúil agus oibre de chuid an Aontais Eorpaigh ar an 1 Eanáir 2007. Bhí feidhm ag an gcéad mhaolú maidir le húsáid na Gaeilge in institiúidí an AE ar feadh cúig bliana, ón 1 Eanáir 2007 go 31 Nollaig 2011. Cuireadh síneadh cúig bliana eile leis sin ón 1 Eanáir 2012 go 31 Nollaig 2016. Is maolú é seo d'institiúidí an AE ón dualgas gach téacs dlíthiúil a aistriú go Gaeilge. Faoi théarmaí an mhaolaithe, ní gá ach dlíthe an AE a dhéantar faoi nós imeachta na comhchinnteoireachta a aistriú go Gaeilge. Mar thoradh ar theacht i bhfeidhm Chonradh Liospóin ar an 1 Nollaig 2009, is é nós imeachta na comhchinnteoireachta an gnáth-nós anois, seachas an eisceacht, i reachtóireacht an AE. Mar thoradh air sin, tá méadú mór tagtha ar líon na ndlíthe AE is gá a aistriú go Gaeilge. Éilíonn an maolú féin go ndéanfaí cinneadh faoi mhí na Nollag 2015 ar a dhéanaí maidir le síneadh a chur leis an maolú ar feadh cúig bliana eile, nó gan sin a dhéanamh. Tá sé curtha in iúl ag institiúidí an AE, áfach, go mbeadh sé inmholta go mbeadh cinneadh ar fáil ón Rialtas faoi dheireadh 2014 ar a dhéanaí, chun cibé pleanáil a theastóidh do riachtanais ar bith earcaíochta a chur sa treis. Agus an spriocdháta sin curtha san áireamh, tá comhráite ar bun le roinnt míonna anuas idir oifigigh mo Roinne agus páirtithe leasmhara éagsúla, institiúidí an AE ina measc, chun moltaí sonracha a cheapadh maidir leis an gcur chuige is fearr don todhchaí. Mar ghné lárnach de mholtaí ar bith maidir leis an mhaolú a bhaint, tá an fháil a bheadh ar dhaoine a mbeadh na scileanna riachtanacha acu chun dul i mbun poist in institiúidí an AE, chomh maith le giniúint téarmaí i gcomhréir a n-úsáide in aistriú cáipéisí oifigiúla. Sa chomhthéacs sin, mar atá ráite ag an Seanadóir, tá dhá thionscnamh maoinithe ag mo Roinn le roinnt blianta anuas: an tionscnamh InterActive Terminology for Europe agus an Tionscnamh Ardscileanna Gaeilge. Cuireann mo Roinn maoiniú ar fáil do Fiontar in Ollscoil Chathair Bhaile Átha Cliath chun téarmaí Gaeilge a aistriú do bhunachar sonraí téarmaíochta an AE, ar a dtugtar InterActive Terminology for Europe. Chuimsigh an maoiniú ó mo Roinn do Fiontar don tionscnamh seo ón bhliain 2007 go dtí an bhliain 2012 os cionn €1.85 milliún. Ina theannta sin, tá maoiniú ceadaithe do leanúint an tionscnaimh seo in 2013 agus in 2014. Tá os cionn 50,000 téarma Gaeilge curtha ar fáil ag Fiontar do InterActive Terminology for Europe, a chuimsíonn 9 milliún téarma i 23 teanga oifigiúla an AE. As an 23 teanga oifigiúla, tá an Ghaeilge anois ar an 14ú teanga is mó sa bhunachar sonraí téarmaíochta seo. Bunaíodh an Tionscnamh Ardscileanna Gaeilge in 2006 mar fhreagra ar an riachtanas sainaitheanta go méadófaí líon na gcéimithe le scileanna i réimsí sonracha i gcomhthéacs Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla 2003 agus an Ghaeilge ina teanga oifigiúil de chuid an AE. Tá soláthar daoine cáilithe le scileanna Gaeilge chun freastal ar riachtanais earcaíochta á bhaint amach tríd an tionscnamh seo. Faoin tionscnamh seo, cuireann mo Roinn maoiniú ar fáil do sainchúrsaí Gaeilge tríú leibhéal in Éirinn i réimsí ar nós aistriúchán, ateangaireacht, teicneolaíocht faisnéise agus dlí. Tá an ciste á riar ag an Roinn i gcomhar leis an Údarás um Ard-Oideachas. Tá os cionn €11 milliún caite ar an tionscnamh seo go dáta. Maidir le comhthéacs fostaíochta san AE i gcoitinne, ní miste dom a rá go n-aithníonn an Rialtas an tábhacht straitéiseach do leas na hÉireann a bhaineann le fostaíocht do shaoránaigh na hÉireann i bpoist san AE, poist atá Gaeilge-lárnaithe san áireamh. I samhradh 2013, cheadaigh an Rialtas socruithe nua atá dírithe ar fáil réidh le dídhreasuithe do Ranna Stáit chun oifigigh a chur ag obair san AE mar shaineolaithe náisiúnta ar iasacht. Is aitheantas iad na socruithe nua seo ar a thábhachtaí agus atá sé go gheobhaidh oifigigh ón tír seo an deis oibriú i réimsí polasaí laistigh d'institiúidí an AE. Ó tharla go n-aistríonn daoine a bhíonn ag obair i bpoist teanga - go háirithe iad sin atá ag obair mar dhlí-theangeolaithe - go réimsí polasaí AE go minic, ní féidir béim sách mór a chur ar an tábhacht a bhaineann le líonadh na bpost seo do straitéis fhoriomlán an Rialtais maidir le láithreacht na hÉireann san AE a mhéadú. Luaitear sa straitéis 20 bliain don Ghaeilge go n-oibreoidh an Rialtas "chun na himthosca a chruthú ina mbeidh go leor céimithe cáilithe ar fáil le freastal ar riachtanais earcaíochta an AE le go bhféadfar deireadh a chur leis an mhaolú sin le linn ré na Straitéise seo". Is léir ón méid atá ráite agam tráthnóna go bhfuil plé leanúnach gníomhach ar siúl ag mo Roinn agus na páirtithe leasmhara ábhartha maidir le ceist an mhaolaithe. Tá moltaí sonracha maidir leis an gcur chuige is fearr don todhchaí á n-ullmhú faoi láthair. Tá sé i gceist na moltaí sin a chur faoi bhráid an chéad chruinniú eile den choiste Rialtais ar an nGaeilge agus an Ghaeltacht, a thionólfar go luath sa bhliain úr.

Tá an freagra a thug an tAire Stáit doiléir go leor, dar liom. Mar Aire Stáit na Gaeltachta, atá freagrach as an straitéis 20 bliain don Ghaeilge, ar mhiste leis a rá liom go neamhbhalbh go gcuirfidh sé comhairle ar an Taoiseach le haghaidh an chruinnithe a bheidh ag an gcoiste Rialtas tar éis na Nollag gur chóir deireadh a chur leis an mhaolú seo?

#AverilPower	unknown-#AverilPower-party	unknown-#AverilPower-dob	unknown-#AverilPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-20 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	164	I welcome the Minister of State to take this matter on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn. I have tabled the matter on behalf of the adult and further education committee of the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, NAPD. The NAPD is concerned about the draft scheme of the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2013 and the associated regulations that the Minister has published with the scheme and how they will affect the further education sector in particular. Further education provision in Ireland has developed within the post-primary sector. It started off as a relatively small sector, but today it is a major aspect of the education system. More than 50% of students now in further education are over 21 years of age. Clearly, it has become in reality, if not in statute, distinct as a sector from the post-primary education sector. However, to this day, it is still classed by the Department as part of the post-primary sector and covered by the post-primary section of the Department. This has led to a good deal of incoherence. Under some grant schemes the further education colleges and post-leaving certificate colleges have been covered. Representatives from the NAPD informed me today about how, following the initial round of grant announcements issued in the summer, the post-leaving certificate colleges were not covered. When it was brought to the Department's attention that they should be covered, they were included in the second round. This has been the case often in recent years. The schools may be covered under the summer works scheme one year but not the next, and for one set of information technology grants but not the next. The schools were covered for broadband under the information technology grants but not for networking and so on. This has led to a good deal of incoherence in terms of how the post-leaving certificate colleges are covered. The NAPD is concerned that the incoherence seems to be carrying through into the draft legislation on admission rules for schools. We all agree that the admissions issue needs to be examined to ensure fair processes and that primary and second level schools are not cherry-picking students or disadvantaging those with special needs or Traveller children. While it makes sense that there should be no distinction made on academic achievement, interviews or any selection processes at second level, of course post-leaving certificate courses must be able to distinguish between students on the basis of prior attainment, portfolios, in the case of art courses, and interviews to judge their suitability for further education courses and so on. Rationally, it makes no sense that these colleges would be covered by this legislation in the same respect and by the same regulations. Given the general scheme of the Bill, the NAPD is concerned that this is the case because the definitions in the Bill relating to schools and the student body could be interpreted as including students in further education colleges. Will the Minister of State clarify whether that is the intention? The wording suggests that they are included and that is why the NAPD is concerned. The association is particularly concerned about the rules in the draft regulations which make it clear that it will not be permissible for schools to interview students as part of the admissions process. Regulation 2 states that it will not be permissible for schools to conduct any assessment or test of the academic or other abilities of students. Clearly, that will not work in a further education context. The NAPD is concerned because when the Government initially carried out a consultation process following a discussion paper two years ago, the NAPD sent in a response and set out clearly the concerns but this does not appear to have been taken on board. The NAPD believes there should be clear provisions in legislation stating that the law does not apply to further education colleges in the same way. However, that has not been done. The NAPD is seeking a clear commitment that the Minister for Education and Skills has heard these concerns and I have tabled the matter to establish whether the issue has been thought through. Perhaps the Minister of State can give a response on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills. I call on the Minister to meet the further education and adult education committee of the NAPD to discuss the issue and take on board the concerns. If it is appropriate to develop separate regulations for the further education sector, then it should be done in partnership with the NAPD. The issues I have raised should be considered in the context of the way the sector is now positioned. It has increasingly been recognised that with the scale of the further education sector and the fact that it is now offering programmes altogether distinct from the post-primary area, from which it grew initially, it should be recognised as a distinct sector. On the floor of the Dáil on 7 July 2011 the Minister said it was past time the colleges of further education had a separate identity. The context to bring this about is now in place with the establishment of SOLAS and the merging of the education and training boards and so on. Now is the time to recognise further education as a separate and distinct sector on a statutory footing. It is time to build up the sector and match it with our skills needs as an economy and so on. In addition to addressing the particular issues that have arisen with this draft legislation, I call on the Government to give priority to establishing the further education sector as a distinct aspect of our education system, to resource it properly and to ensure we do not end up with circumstances whereby legislation developed for post-primary schools is perhaps somewhat unthinkingly applied to a completely different sector simply because it is under the same section of the Department and has not been given a distinct focus.

As the Senator will be aware, in early September the Minister published a draft general scheme for the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2013, as well as draft regulations for discussion ahead of enacting the legislation. The heads of the Bill, which have been approved by the Cabinet, propose a new parent-friendly, equitable and consistent framework to regulate school admissions policy for all 4,000 primary and post-primary schools. If enacted, this framework will improve access to schools for all pupils and ensure consistency, fairness and transparency in the admission policies of all schools. The Minister's aim is to improve the admissions process to ensure that the way schools decide on applications is structured, fair and transparent. The Minister has referred the draft general scheme and draft regulations to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection to allow a full public discussion, including input from parents and the education partners. The committee has since invited and has received written submissions from interested individuals and groups, including, as I understand it, the submission to which the Senator refers. It will now consider the submissions received and may also decide to invite more individuals or groups to a public hearing should it take the view that this would be beneficial. The Minister is looking forward to considering the outcome of the committee's considerations of these important proposals in order to proceed to the next age of legislation as soon as possible. The draft regulatory framework applies to all recognised primary and post-primary schools and its primary focus is on the enrolment of junior infants at primary level and first year students at post-primary level. The Minister acknowledges that some adjustment will need to be made to the scheme to ensure no unintended consequences of the legislation on the arrangement for enrolment in post-primary and post-leaving certificate courses within such schools.Issues of this kind will be addressed before the draft legislation is finalised. It should also be noted that access to post-leaving certificate courses is subject to the access, transfer and progression provisions of the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Act 2012. I again thank the Senator for providing me with the opportunity to outline the position on the draft scheme of the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2013 and associated draft regulations.

At least it shows there is an awareness in the Department that there are issues. I appreciate also his reassurance that those issues will be addressed before the legislation is finalised. I reiterate that the reason the issue has arisen and the reason we end up with unintended consequences in the further education sector is that they are treated as post-primary schools, despite the fact that in reality the sector has grown into something different. That reality needs to be recognised and the sector needs to be set up properly as a distinct sector on a statutory basis. I reiterate my call that the Minister convey the matter to the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, that he meet the NAPD to discuss how the legislation can be improved to ensure there are not the unintended consequences that the Minister has acknowledged and to discuss the future of the further education and adult education sector and how it fits within his overall vision in terms of SOLAS and the education and training boards. He has acknowledged in the other House the need to recognise the distinct role the further education sector has to play particularly in the current economic environment and in the training context.

I ask the Minister to liaise with and support Galway city and county councils to ensure a base, as well as basic funding, is provided on the west side of Galway city for the Galway mountain rescue team. This, as the Minister may be aware, is a 999 emergency response service undertaken entirely by volunteers covering the Galway and Clare mountain ranges. The Galway mountain rescue team is a voluntary organisation which provides a 112 or a 999 emergency response service referred by the Garda. The response service is to the upland and remote areas of counties Galway and Clare. The service is available 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. The Galway mountain rescue team is a registered charity. The team comprises 34 active volunteers, male and female, ranging in age from 24 to 66 years, travelling from Letterfrack in north-west Connemara to the Burren in County Clare. Its members come from all walks of life from farming to engineering to teaching and are highly skilled selfless volunteers. The emergency response service it provides includes casualty care, rope rescue, search management and search and rescue operations. It works with a wide range of agencies such as the Ambulance Service, the Irish Air Corps, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, An Garda Síochána, mountain rescue teams throughout the country, the Irish Coast Guard, Civil Defence and Coillte Ireland. It is one of 12 rescue teams in the country. I have met the team. It is an amazing life-saving service, provided entirely by selfless people who are skilled volunteers. The very least they deserve is a base for their two vehicles, a jeep and a van and a place to dry their gear and recharge their batteries and some basic funding. It is very little to ask for a 999 service.  Within the past few weeks the team was instrumental in safely locating an old man who had been lost for a number of days in the Moycullen area and his family feared for his life. More recently they were involved in the high profile three day tragic rescue of the body of a climber in the Mweelrea mountain range. Their work is largely invisible and this in itself makes their situation problematic. Nobody sees the work they do and, as a result, they may not have as high a profile and benefit from funding in the same way, or even public funding as other groups. They are the brave ones who are out at night and day searching for life. This is our chance to rescue them and provide them with a suitable base for their basic gear.  A base to the west side of Galway city is highly desirable for easier and quicker access to the mountains. I have spoken to Ciarán Hayes of Galway City Council. Both the city and county council do not dispute the need and, in fact, are doing their best to try to locate a base. I am bringing this matter to the attention of the Minister to intervene to achieve a base, if possible prior to Christmas.  I met one of the volunteer leaders earlier this week, Mr. Jarlath Folan, who informed me that the team's current base was in the grounds of University College Hospital Galway, a base from which the team has to move. It is right that they move as there is total congestion. There are two parking spaces with no place for their gear to dry other than at the back of the van. Mr. Folan made the point, after they finished the three day search, that their gear was wet and sticky. They did not even have the proper facilities to recharge the batteries for the search lights. They take home the gear and wash it themselves. The gear would hang out and dry quite well if they had even a cabin. What struck me was the unsuitability of the current location for an emergency response team given the horrendous congestion and parking problems on the grounds of University College Hospital Galway. That is leading into a totally different Department because what is happening is not good from a health grounds position in terms of parking. Their need has been independently verified in 2012 when a team assessment was conducted by international experts who said that the lack of a base facility with sufficient space to store, inspect, dry and maintain rescue equipment and to properly house team vehicles is a serious impediment in providing a safe and efficient rescue service. A dedicated rescue base is a pressing requirement which impacts more across a range of sectors, including giving necessary assistance to visitors in Connemara and the national park and supporting an adequate wilderness emergency response generally. This is not just a life saving service. It is a huge service to tourism. For that reason I am pleased the Minister has given his time to be present to listen to this Adjournment matter. He knows as well as I do how much the west relies on tourism. We have always learned that it is an industry that spreads its net value across the region. When walkers and climbers are coming to the country, we need them to know that if they get into difficulty there is a service that can respond immediately.

Mountain rescue is a 24-7 voluntary emergency support service provided by 12 mountain rescue teams located in various regions throughout the county. These teams come together as a co-operative association under an organisation called Mountain Rescue Ireland, MRI, which was founded in 1965. At the local level, each team also develops its own administrative aid operational practices as well as its own training schedule to ensure its members are appropriately skilled and equipped when needed. The Galway mountain rescue team has been in existence for almost 40 years and I acknowledge the very important service provided by volunteer organisations such the Galway team and the eleven other mountain rescue teams around the country who operate in all weathers and conditions. The role of the mountain rescue teams has diversified greatly in recent years and they are now called out to assist in a wide range of incidents and circumstances, including air crash response in remote environments and animal rescue. From a tourism perspective, we welcome the growth in a range of leisure activities, particularly those such as hillwalking which attracts the interest of increasing numbers of both Irish people and visitors of all ages. The work undertaken by mountain rescue, cave rescue and water-based organisations, makes a tangible contribution to ensuring these visitors are safe and in supporting our bluelight services, particularly the Garda, which engages directly with mountain rescue services where there is an emergency event requiring their particular skills and local knowledge. As a voluntary organisation and a registered charity, MRI has developed a number of links and relationships with various Departments and agencies such as Civil Defence, the Irish Red Cross and the Order of Malta and is funded by a combination of public donations and Government grants.The Department of Justice and Equality holds primary responsibility for tasking the mountain rescue teams given that it is the Garda who call out these units in the event of an emergency. My Department's sole function in respect of MRI and its constituent teams relates to an annual grant scheme overseen by the Irish Coast Guard service. This role was assigned to the Irish Coast Guard some years back in the interests of certain administrative efficiencies. The Irish Coast Guard service has over 900 volunteers working in 46 units in various coastal locations around the country and I avail of the opportunity to pay tribute to the effort and sacrifice of all volunteers across the various organisations in this country. Without these men and women State organisations and agencies would not be able to respond to the various emergencies and demands placed upon them daily. It is important that we recognise and acknowledge the contribution these individuals make on an unpaid basis in terms of their time and skill. The Irish Coast Guard chairs two meetings per year with MRI and the Irish Cave Rescue Organisation which are also attended by An Garda Síochána, the Department of Justice and Equality and the Air Corps where operational and administrative issues are raised and discussed and information is shared. In 2013 mountain rescue teams and MRI received nearly €170,000 in grant payments from my Department. The grants provide assistance primarily for current expenditure. The 2013 grant to the Galway mountain rescue team amounted to €7,407. Despite the growing pressure on public finances, I am pleased to say it has been possible to retain the grant at this level in the past few years and it is the intention to do so for 2014 also. MRI, as an all-island organisation, avails of further support in Northern Ireland. Turning to the Senator's inquiry in relation to the Galway mountain rescue team, as I have set out, the role of my Department is confined to administering the grant aid scheme with limitations on its resources and, while I am not in a position to undertake the liaison role as suggested, the Irish Coast Guard service will in its current role as chair of the National Committee for Mountain and Cave Rescue continue to advance the principles of an ever-improving emergency response framework and operational and administrative quality enhancements in our volunteer organisations.

I appreciate that he acknowledges the important work done and that his Department has an administrative role, but I would not have brought this matter before him today if I did not think it needed a push. The team is battling many forces which are not visible because of the nature of its work and where it is done, yet the Minister and I acknowledge the incredible service the team provides. What role does the Minister have in monitoring whether units such as the Galway mountain rescue team are catered for in such a way as to allow them do their business effectively?

The Irish Coast Guard's only role is to administer this grant. I do not have a budget line or statutory responsibility for this. The budget we do have is very tight and the priority is to renovate one Irish Coast Guard station a year. Unfortunately, it is not possible to take on the capital costs of MRI in addition to this.
