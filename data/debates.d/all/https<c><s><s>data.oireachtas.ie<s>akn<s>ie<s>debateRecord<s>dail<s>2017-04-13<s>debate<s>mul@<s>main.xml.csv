#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-13 00:00:00	European Council: Statements	0	I am pleased to address the House ahead of the meeting of the European Council in Brussels on 29 April. The meeting has been scheduled following the formal notification by the UK of its intention to leave the EU. As provided for under Article 50 of the Treaty on the European Union, it will be a meeting of the 27 EU Heads of State and Government without the UK. We will discuss the EU guidelines for the upcoming negotiations with the UK with a view to their formal adoption. The Government has been clear from the start that the UK's departure from the Union would and will have significant economic, political and social implications for Ireland. For over two years, even before the UK referendum, we have been examining the issues and engaging with sectors across the island of Ireland to analyse fully our main areas of concern and to develop our negotiating priorities. These are to minimise the impact on our trade and the economy, to protect the Good Friday Agreement and the Northern Ireland peace process, including through maintaining an open Border, to continue the common travel area with the UK and to work for a positive future for the European Union. In my speech to the IlEA on 15 February, I outlined the Government's preparations, including the new structures and resources which have been allocated, the ongoing sectoral analysis and research throughout Government Departments, our engagement with industry and civic society, which has to date included nearly 280 separate meetings, and the all-island civic dialogue, which I convened with the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, and which to date has included 16 sectoral events and two plenary meetings with more than 1,200 delegates representing industries and organisations from across the country. We have also been very active at political and official level in engaging with our EU partners and the EU institutions, raising awareness of the unique circumstances in relation to Ireland and the need to address these in the negotiations. To date, we have had more than 400 engagements with partners, which have also, of course, enabled us to understand better their concerns and objectives. In addition to meeting my EU counterparts regularly at the European Council, I have had bilateral meetings with the leaders of France, Spain, Belgium, Cyprus. Malta, Croatia and Poland as well as with the British Prime Minister, Theresa May. Last week, I met Chancellor Merkel again, in Berlin, and next week I will meet the Dutch and the Danish Prime Ministers. I also had separate bilateral meetings recently in Brussels with the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, the President of the European Parliament, Antonio Tajani, and the chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier. In all these engagements I have expressed my strong view that any manifestation of a hard Border would have very negative consequences for our country and the peace process. This is a political challenge and we will have to be creative and imaginative to deal with it. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs have also had extensive programmes of engagement, while other Ministers have been engaging with their respective counterparts. Engagement at senior official level, including through our permanent representation in Brussels and our network of embassies overseas, has been very extensive. We have also, of course, had opportunities to discuss Brexit with London, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast via the long-established connections through the Good Friday Agreement, while clearly respecting the "no negotiation without notification" principle. Across the board, there is now a good understanding of our unique concerns and an openness to working closely with us in addressing them in the run-up to the negotiations. This was reflected first in the indication from Michel Barnier that Ireland's specific conditions and concerns should be addressed as a priority for the exit negotiations.On 31 March, the draft EU negotiating guidelines were circulated by President Tusk. I am pleased that these include a very strong acknowledgement of Ireland’s unique circumstances, the need to protect the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement and our intention to maintain bilateral arrangements with the UK, such as the common travel area. There was also a strong reference to our specific concerns in the resolution which was adopted by the European Parliament on 5 April. Prime Minister Theresa May’s letter of 29 March and her statement to the House of Commons the same day reaffirmed the British Government's objective of avoiding a return to a hard Border on the island of Ireland and its commitment to maintaining the common travel area. It is clear therefore that our extensive political, diplomatic and official campaign of recent months has been effective in ensuring that our unique circumstances, our specific issues and our special case are understood and acknowledged. We will continue to defend the Good Friday Agreement in its spirit as well as its letter and to make clear that, as an internationally recognised treaty registered with the UN, it provides a unique political and constitutional framework on the island of Ireland. Whatever happens in the Brexit negotiations, nothing should undermine the peace and stability in Northern Ireland that has taken so long to achieve and in which the EU has played such an important role. It is important to make clear that there will be at least two sets of negotiations. The first will deal with the UK’s official exit from the EU, covering issues such as the UK’s financial commitments and reciprocal rights for Europeans living in Britain and British people living in the European Union. The second will address the EU’s future relationship with the UK. This will be particularly important for our future trading relationship and any potential implications for our economy. The UK Government’s White Paper and the Prime Minister Theresa May’s letter and statement on 29 March provided some clarity around the UK’s objectives for the future relationship. These include the pursuit of a bold and ambitious free trade agreement, an outcome that would be in Ireland’s interests. It is in all our interests that the UK should maintain the closest possible links to the EU and I welcome Prime Minister Theresa May’s comment about wanting to have a positive and constructive partnership between the EU and the UK. Knowing more about their intentions will be important as we continue to prepare for the negotiations. From Ireland’s perspective, it is crucial that the negotiations are conducted in a constructive and orderly way and we will continue to encourage our EU partners and the UK to maintain a calm and balanced approach. We are now studying the draft guidelines carefully in terms of the overall approach to the negotiations and the many other issues that arise, beyond those unique to Ireland. The guidelines will be further discussed among the EU 27 member states at ministerial and senior official level before the European Council on 29 April. Once they have been agreed, negotiating directives for the European Commission will be prepared for adoption by the General Affairs Council in May. Negotiations with the UK are therefore likely to be launched in late May or early June. As Deputies will be aware, the day-to-day technical EU negotiations will be led by Michel Barnier and his team on the basis of the mandate from the European Council. Member states, however, including Ireland, will have control of the process. The European Council, that is leaders of all member states, will discuss the negotiations on a very regular basis and will take all final decisions. Of course, the European Parliament also has to give its consent to the eventual outcome. We are in constant contact with the Barnier team and are participating fully in all the EU 27 structures in preparing for the negotiations. We will be part of the EU team and look forward to working with our fellow member states in delivering the best possible results for Ireland and for the EU. Our priorities have been developed, opportunities are being pursued and risks and mitigation measures are being identified. Now that Article 50 has been triggered, we are preparing a consolidated policy paper which will be published in advance of the European Council on 29 April, and which will set out Ireland’s approach to the negotiations. At the same time we will continue to make the economy resilient and future-proofed. We have already taken important steps in this context, including in Budget 2017, the Action Plan for Jobs 2017 and our new trade and investment strategy. Looking ahead, a new ten year capital plan is in preparation, we are revising our Enterprise 2025 policy and we are in active discussions with the European Investment Bank on a potential increase in investment in the country. Our enterprise agencies will continue to work with exporters and potential investors, helping them to deal with issues as they arise, making companies competitive, diversifying market exposure and up-skilling teams. We regularly hear about the importance of this from those involved directly in the agri-sector. We met with the IFA last weekend and will continue to make this area a priority.  We have had some very positive outcomes to our efforts over the past few weeks. However, this is only the beginning of a complicated process which could take years to conclude. Our efforts will continue to involve all Ministers, Government Departments and agencies, extensive engagement with stakeholders and ongoing strong co-ordination from the centre. Before concluding, I would like to stress that Ireland’s place remains firmly at the heart of Europe. The Union has been central to the success of our small, open economy and the basis for much of the social and political progress we have achieved. We will be very much central to the EU team for the negotiations ahead. We will continue to engage with our partners calmly and patiently and to negotiate firmly but fairly in the best interests of the country and our citizens. The Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs, Dara Murphy, will deliver a wrap-up statement at the end of this session. I look forward to keeping the House fully informed of developments in relation to Brexit and repeat that the opportunity is open to the leaders of the different parties in the House to have a full up-to-date briefing at any time they wish.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-13 00:00:00	European Council: Statements	1	While this special summit is intended solely to address the Article 50 negotiations, people expect Europe's leaders to take some time to discuss and act on the recent events in Syria. Once again the Assad regime has committed a war crime against the people of Syria. The latest chemical weapons attack was another grotesque and inhuman act. This adds to the daily accounts of the targeting of civilian facilities and disregard for even the most basic standards of respect for the lives of people the regime claims to be its citizens. Syria is by some distance the greatest humanitarian crisis of this generation. Assad's actions are the direct cause of the refugee crisis and the escalating destruction and barbarity. It is not clear what further sanctions can be implemented on his regime. However, we should assert the basic principle that any entity that continues to trade with or aid Assad should, at a minimum, be completely banned from the European Union. The deeply dishonourable behaviour of Russia becomes starker by the day. Having directly enabled Assad and encouraged his aggression, Russia has even vetoed a call for an independent investigation of the use of chemical weapons which have been banned for well over half a century. These are also weapons which Russia assured the world four years ago that Assad had destroyed. The Taoiseach has a duty on behalf of the Irish people to issue a strong statement on credible action by the European Union against Assad and all who enable his barbarity. The summit discussion of the guidelines for the Article 50 negotiations marks the end of the beginning of the Brexit process. There is no positive outcome possible to these negotiations. Whatever emerges will be bad for Ireland, bad for Europe and, quite frankly, bad for the world. Irrespective of the bluster from London or the shrill jingoism of the anti-EU press, the UK is taking a step backwards towards a more unilateral, isolated and nationalistic approach to relations with other states. Damage from Brexit is inevitable; in fact it is already underway. All that can now be achieved is to limit the damage as much as possible. As far back as May 2013, on behalf of Fianna Fáil, I first laid out our policy on the threat of Brexit and Ireland’s role in the future of the EU. Since the referendum result last year we have gone much further and have outlined a detailed approach to the main issues and specific action which we believe should be taken. These short statements do not provide an opportunity to go into most of the issues. However, I want to repeat yet again that there are urgent actions required which can be pushed forward entirely independent of the Article 50 negotiations. We must not wait quietly until these negotiations are over before addressing the already evident impact of Brexit on many Irish businesses and communities. Whatever emerges from the negotiations we will need a major programme to aid those worst hit. They need support for diversification and innovation. There is no deal possible which removes all economic disruption. The UK is already funding businesses to protect supply chains – we need this action now and we need EU support in doing this. Through the course of last week’s debate on Brexit and the many questions tabled since Article 50 was triggered, the Taoiseach has refused to give any details on whether Ireland is seeking any changes to the draft text circulated on 31 March.We have to assume from his statements that he is fully content with the draft. Reports from this week's meeting of officials in Brussels have referenced the contributions of a number of different countries but Ireland is not one of them. Fianna Fáil believes this is a mistake and we should seek important changes to the negotiating text. We are supportive of the general approach proposed by President Tusk.  His proposals relating to sequencing and timing are reasonable. We welcome that he is proposing to make clear to the United Kingdom that the European Union will promote the interests of the 27 in these negotiations. The British Government should be told politely but firmly that we have no intention of being influenced by its usual approach to EU negotiations, which is to caricature and hysterically denounce anything which does not suit it. The UK has chosen to go it alone and cannot expect special treatment. It has eaten its cake and no longer has it. Separate from the text on these matters, the 27 should be asked to agree a general statement expressing solidarity and supporting the principle that the European Union will, in the negotiations and its other actions, seek to prevent countries from being damaged disproportionately.  This is important because of a potential pitfall in the negotiating text as it relates to Ireland. As I stated previously, we acknowledge Michel Barnier's positive attitude to Ireland and that of Donald Tusk. They are sincere statesmen who are friends of this country. However the current text is incomplete and raises some concerns. We welcome the commitment to finding "flexible and imaginative solutions" relating to Ireland. However, there is a serious problem where special measures relating to the connections between Ireland and the United Kingdom are required to be "compatible with EU law" and protect the "integrity of the Union legal order". This implies a significant inflexibility.  It is highly likely that any full implementation of the common travel area or any "flexible and imaginative solutions" protecting cross-Border activity will require new EU laws to permit them. Current laws relating to trade and customs are completely inflexible. As the Government has not produced an analysis of what is possible within existing EU law and what changes we may need to seek, these provisions in the draft are a serious concern. At a minimum, they should be amended to include the idea that changes to EU law may be required. The insistence on the applicability of the "integrity of the Union legal order" appears to be a reference to the legal roles of the European Commission and European Court of Justice in investigation and arbitration. Given the position of the British Government, we should seek a guarantee that unique arrangements will be considered. As I stated previously, we are deeply disappointed that the draft makes no reference to the fact that 1.8 million residents of Northern Ireland will continue to have the right to EU citizenship post Brexit. Simply referring to the Good Friday Agreement does not address this point. Recognising their citizenship upfront immediately sets a new tone and pushes all parties to greater flexibility. This is a unique situation and it should be explicitly referenced in the text.  It is simply inexplicable that the Taoiseach has refused to seek this small but important change. On a separate but important matter, Prime Minister May's Article 50 letter again fails to acknowledge that nearly half of her electorate voted to remain. Sixteen million people resisted the lies and anti-EU hysteria and remained true to the ideal of Europe. It would be symbolically very positive if the EU in its statement explicitly mentioned this and the fact that two devolved administrations voted to remain. While this is a matter for a separate process, a fast and generous approach to EU membership for Scotland, should it choose to become independent, should be agreed policy. One of the few changes to the text agreed already has been inclusion of the role of the European Parliament in the process. This is welcome because of the positive position the Parliament is taking on Ireland. Last month, I discussed this matter with the Parliament's lead negotiator, Mr. Guy Verhofstadt who I believe is very supportive of Ireland and eager to respond to the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland and its EU citizens. We welcome the Ceann Comhairle's positive response to our proposal that Mr. Verhofstadt be invited to Dáil Éireann in the near future. Whatever is agreed at this summit will not undo the harm of Brexit. However, in charting the course of negotiations we should start with clarity and a substantive commitment to aiding those who remain true to the European Union. To avoid significant difficulties during the negotiations and in the years afterwards, it is imperative that the Taoiseach seek small but important changes to the draft text.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-13 00:00:00	European Council: Statements	2	There is no doubt Brexit poses the biggest threat to the socioeconomic future of the people of this island. It also has the potential to do serious damage to the Good Friday Agreement. The British Government has ignored the democratically-expressed will of the people of the North. The majority of the people in the Six Counties voted to remain in the European Union. Theresa May is pushing on with her Brexit strategy as if this vote did not happen. The threat to Ireland arising from Britain's divorce from the European Union does not register in any substantive way with the British Prime Minister. London is intent on pulling a part of this island out of the European Union despite the dire consequences this will have for everyone across Ireland. We should not be surprised by the approach taken by a Tory government. However, the Irish Government cannot be excused for an approach to Brexit which ignores the rights of citizens in the North and abdicates its responsibility to uphold their democratic vote to remain in the European Union. The Sinn Féin president, Deputy Gerry Adams, asked the Taoiseach last week if he had stated to the British Government that it should accept the vote of the people of the North. It is clear he has not done so and will not do so. This approach is in line with his Government's failure to hold the British to account for their policies in Ireland. The letter triggering Article 50 and the European Council draft negotiation guidelines demonstrate the Government's negligence when it comes to representing the interests of the Irish people. The article relating to Ireland in the draft negotiating guidelines, Article 11, is vague, ambiguous and conditional. It contains little that would provide confidence that Ireland's unique position is appreciated or that the interests of the island as a whole will be protected. This is far from satisfactory. The people of Ireland have an expectation that the Government will demand more, argue for more and achieve more in these crucial negotiations. The Spanish Government has already shown what is achievable if one approaches the Brexit challenge with a concrete commitment to upholding national interests. The contrast in the language and substance of Article 22, which relates to the future of Gibraltar, when compared with Article 11 is striking. Article 22 is clear, committal and definitive. It states that after Brexit, no agreement between the EU and British Government may apply to Gibraltar without the agreement of the Spanish and British Governments. It is clear, when one compares the two articles, that the Government has a responsibility to adopt a much stronger negotiating position. Not to do so would represent a serious dereliction of the Government's duty to fight its corner on behalf of the people of this island. The veto achieved by the Spanish Government in regard to Gibraltar is exactly the type of substantive commitment that the Government should have sought in respect of the North. It would be in keeping with its responsibility for the North under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, yet the Taoiseach did not even raise this possibility for Ireland. In a continuation of the Government’s feeble approach, the Taoiseach has just returned from Europe with very little to show for his efforts. The Government's negotiating strategy is non-existent and the Taoiseach looks very weak because he has not adopted a solid and meaningful negotiating position for Ireland. He is happy to collect vague expressions of understanding of Ireland's unique position when it comes to Brexit and amass a catalogue of non-binding declarations of support. Pats on the back and thumbs-up from other EU leaders will not protect the people of this island from the impact of Brexit. The solid and meaningful negotiating position, which the Government must now formally adopt, is designated special status for the North within the European Union.It is the only solution that deals with the intricacies of the problem. It is the only way to stop a hard economic border on the island of Ireland.

It is the type of imaginative and innovative approach that has been called for by the European Union itself. Given the Government's obligation to uphold the new relationships within Ireland and between Ireland and Britain under the Good Friday Agreement, it has a duty to advocate for such a position. It is the position that has been democratically decided upon by this Parliament but the Taoiseach turns his face to it. Incredibly, the Taoiseach and the Government have refused to advocate for this position. We need to ask ourselves why.

Perhaps it is because the case of designated special status within the EU challenges the view of the Government that Ireland actually ends at the Border. That is despite the fact that every single citizen in the North has the right to Irish citizenship and the legal expectation that the Taoiseach's Government will uphold their rights, which also include the right to EU citizenship even after Brexit. My party leader, Deputy Adams, has written to the Taoiseach to urge him to support a motion that we have tabled which would commit the Government to seek a number of commitments from the EU in these negotiations. First and foremost, the Government must adopt the position of the Dáil of supporting special designated status within the EU for the North of Ireland. Yesterday we heard lectures from the Taoiseach about how democracy works. Fifty plus one he tells us. Let me remind the Taoiseach that we had a vote in this House. The Dáil has spoken and the Dáil has stated that the position should be special designated status for the North within the European Union.

Third, the Government should seek a veto to ensure no agreement between the EU and Britain may apply to the North of Ireland without the agreement of Ireland and Britain first. That is similar to what has been achieved by the Spanish Government. The European Union should also recognise that other existing bilateral agreements and arrangements between Ireland and Britain which were compatible with EU law would remain. The reality is that the Government needs to get serious about this issue. It needs to get very serious about the issue of Brexit. We all know that Brexit poses a major threat to Ireland, North and South. At the moment, the Taoiseach and his Government, his Ministers, are asleep at the wheel. The challenge posed by Brexit must be met with the urgency and with the strategic vision it demands. The approach I have outlined represents a logical strategy for representing national interests of the whole island of Ireland. This must be the goal of the Taoiseach and the Government. Special status will ensure that the whole island of Ireland can remain within the EU together. I urge the Taoiseach to make these points at the European Council meeting on 29 April. I note that in the Taoiseach's opening statement - in his first sentence - he speaks about the meeting of the European Council in Brussels. Yesterday when I challenged him on the issue, he denied that a European Council meeting was taking place at all-----

To judge by the previous comments, it is building up to feel rather like the time Michael Collins went to London. Lots of people are obviously getting the knives and the pickaxes ready. On behalf of everyone in Ireland, I wish the Taoiseach well at the summit. It is probably the most important summit for Ireland in the 44 years of our membership. That membership has been valuable. Notwithstanding issues with the EU, it has been in the best interests of the whole island of Ireland, North and South. The Brexit negotiating mandate is about our vital national interests and the vital interests of this island as a whole. Our first priority must be to protect the political and institutional arrangements established by the Good Friday Agreement. It is disappointing, to put it mildly, that there is still no obvious sign that the Government has settled on its policies towards these negotiations. Apart from a glossy sort of Ladybird guide to Brexit that would not detain any serious reader for long, there is as yet nothing published by the Government on its approach to Brexit. In fact, it states that it will not publish anything approaching a substantive position paper until 29 April, the very day the European Council meets and before this Dáil will have reassembled to have an opportunity to speak and address that particular paper.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-13 00:00:00	European Council: Statements	116	The Taoiseach has given us these answers continuously.I am basing this on his answers to me on numerous occasions. As expected, the draft guidelines published by President Tusk place a premium on an orderly, non-disruptive withdrawal. They also place a premium on the Union acting as one. These are important enough statements of principle. I wonder if we will achieve a common understanding of their interpretation and application, which is what this debate should be partly about. If insisting on an orderly approach means that we will not talk about the future relationship with the UK until we have signed off on the current one, then the EU is simply surrendering to that body of opinion that wants to punish Britain by imposing on it some form of economic isolation. If we allow that wing to gain supremacy, then we will also suffer economically. We will suffer proportionately far more than any other EU state. If the EU speaking as one means that Ireland cannot make that point as often and as loudly as is necessary, then this language of cohesion simply disguises what can be bully-boy tactics. I do not see the point of - and I would be minded to reject - the blunt insistence in the draft guidelines that, “So as not to undercut the position of the Union, there will be no separate negotiations between individual member states and the United Kingdom on matters pertaining to the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union”. In fact, an arrangement has already been agreed in respect of another member state in the case of the relationship between Spain, the United Kingdom and Gibraltar. I do not see how, in practical terms, there could be anyone better suited to debate future arrangements for the common travel area than the officials and politicians of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. If the negotiating guidelines do not permit such issues to be devolved to the relevant authorities by the main negotiators, resolved bilaterally and referred back, then that is a defect in the guidelines which the Taoiseach should highlight on our behalf. The guidelines should be improved. It is clear by that the integrity of the Single Market requires free movement of workers. The UK can no longer buy into free movement so it seems inevitable that the Single Market will be closed to it. Closed to it also, unless we come up with some radical solutions, will be the customs union. Ireland will be partitioned by an external frontier of the European Union, with the obligation to police it accordingly. I have spoken at length on the all-island related issues, and so has the leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Howlin. The Taoiseach is aware of our views; we have voiced them often enough here. We advocate an all-island, all-Ireland approach, taking guidance and using some of the models that are available from the Good Friday Agreement. I have no doubt but that solutions are available, provided there is goodwill and some imagination. To use diplomatic language, there will be talk of "variable geometry". Free movement of workers does not raise exactly the same issues as free movement of British and Irish citizens. They are not the same thing. There are parallels but they are not the same thing. Free movement of goods requires separate consideration again. It may be that some of this, for some purposes, will mean moving the Border into the Irish Sea. It may be that our ports and airports can be more effectively policed than the Irish land frontier ever could. We are all united in this House in not wanting to see a land frontier dividing the island of Ireland. As I have said, I cannot imagine anyone better placed to debate these issues with a view to resolving them than teams from Britain and Ireland. The common travel area and the effect of the EU’s new border on our island are by no means the only issues we have to face, although they are the most obvious. The draft guidelines, with their insistence on a firsts-thing-first approach, manage to postpone consideration of these vital issues. It would be a tremendous waste of time and resources if the negotiating teams spent two years locked in argument over disentangling the United Kingdom from the Union - and from Union rights and obligations - without any attempt to sketch out our future relationship. The Taoiseach should respond to that point because it is vital to how these negotiations go forward and their impact on us. It is important to provide clarity and legal certainty about the immediate effects of British withdrawal but that requires clarity and certainty about the day after tomorrow as well as tomorrow and about the position in March 2021 as well as in March 2019. It must be remembered that, under Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon, these talks are meant to be about negotiating an agreement with the UK, and "Setting out the arrangements for its withdrawal, taking account of the framework for its future relationship with the Union". The future relationship must, from the start and always, be to the forefront at these talks. It cannot be relegated to subsequent consideration, and certainly not to being considered only after bloody-minded infliction of punitive divorce terms and the extraction of a multibillion settlement. That is where there is such doubt about the Taoiseach's negotiating stance and his following, in detail, Mr. Barnier's approach without putting the Irish interest first, frankly. The sort of approach which still seems to appeal to many of our counterparts would do enormous damage to this country and this State. The draft guidelines state, "An overall understanding on the framework for the future relationship could be identified during a second phase of the negotiations". I have the charts in my office, as does the Taoiseach, of how the whole thing is to happen. We all have them. We need to discuss them because there are dangers inherent in the design of the architecture that the Taoiseach is building. The second phase can only begin once "sufficient progress has been made in the first phase towards reaching a satisfactory agreement on the arrangements for an orderly withdrawal." The authors are seemingly oblivious to the direct contradiction between insisting on this phased approach and the earlier insistence, set out as the second core principle-----

I am so used to the Labour Party not being here. I am sharing time with Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett, who is at a committee meeting but who will, I hope, be here shortly. A strong backdrop to the European Council on the 29 April will be the fallout from the first round of the French presidential election. I will focus my remarks on that election and the general situation in France because both serve to highlight the crises being faced by European capitalism. All the ingredients in the election are the result of a crisis in this system in the past few years. The election will be a historic one and in order to understand it, we must look at the context. The election comes after years of vicious austerity policies implemented by the outgoing Hollande Government and by the Sarkozy Government which preceded it. In the past year there have been huge attacks on the historic gains of the working class in France, on the retirement age and on the right of workers to enforce collective bargaining. There have been laws to create precarity and these have been combined with an attack on democratic rights, with protests and assembly being declared illegal. The racist and thuggish policing of minority communities has continued and was given the green light by a French Government that has attacked the citizenship rights of migrant communities and the right to asylum and whipped up Islamophobia. The corruption of the French capitalist elite is also on graphic display, highlighted by the right-wing candidates, Fillon and Le Pen, dipping into state funds to enrich their families and close supporters. Hollande has pursued an aggressive interventionist foreign policy with the bombings of Mali, Syria, Niger and Libya. These policies gave rise to a massive reaction on the part of workers and young people last spring, with a wave of strikes, mass demonstrations and the Nuit Debout movement. The election is seeing the collapse of the Parti Socialiste, the members of which are in disarray. Like their co-thinkers across Europe, they are paying the price for their wholehearted implementation of the policies to which I refer. Much of the commentary internationally has been on the potential breakthrough for the Front National, FN, a racist organisation which poses a real danger to workers and minorities in France. FN has tried to pose as a voice for ordinary French people and exploit the anger that exists to gain a foothold. Despite its rhetoric, however, the reality is that the FN is also a neo-liberal party. In every local authority area in which it holds power, there have been cuts to social programmes and to workers' rights. The FN is also deeply homophobic, opposes marriage equality and is against the right of women to choose. These are policies it shares with Fillon. The most significant development of the election has been the rise of Jean-Luc Mélenchon's campaign. He has electrified the election and attracted tens of thousands to his rallies across the country. Some 130,000 attended a rally in Paris and 70,000 another attended in Marseilles this week, while Macron could only muster 3,000. Mélenchon has stood against the neo-liberal status quo. In his programme, he calls for a reversal of the attacks against workers' rights and for workers to have the right to a democratic say in how their workplaces are run. He has called for €100 billion in state investment that would benefit the environment and society and he has challenged the logic of privatisation and the religious creed of neo-liberalism that beset EU bureaucrats by calling for state ownership and nationalisation of key sectors of the economy, such as banking, transport and energy production. He has also called for a ban on evictions, which our Government refused to entertain, and for free water and electricity, with a ban on cutting water from people's homes. He has called for free medical care and an end to two-tier medical treatment. He has also stood strong against racism, Islamophobia and division. He is currently in third place in the polls and is challenging for a place in the second round. The idea of a President who stands against neo-liberalism and defends the rights of workers is petrifying the establishment in France and across Europe. It is no wonder that, in recent days, a French Project Fear has been launched and has been whipped up in the media. Mélenchon has been labelled as dangerous and a potential dictator and billionaires have been lining up to say how they will flee the country. His candidature shows the potential to build a left. It also shows how Le Pen and those on the far right can be defeated. There have now been four solid weeks of general strikes in French Guiana in response to decades of exploitation, neglect, corruption and poverty. I would like to express our solidarity with the movement there. I also express solidarity with the campaign of Jean-Luc Mélenchon. Solidarity and the left in Ireland appeal to French workers and all those who have much to lose from the current system, and from the prospect of Le Pen coming to power, to come out in droves. We appeal to women, Muslims, young people and minorities to support the idea of a French President who would stand for complete change to the neo-liberal creed and to the policies of division and fear that have beset Europe.
#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-13 00:00:00	European Council: Statements	133	I want to move the discussion to a more global arena and look at some of the global aspects to Brexit. I hope these issues, some of which we have discussed recently at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence will be priorities for the European Council. My first issue is the implications of Brexit for the UK's contribution to humanitarian aid. This is not getting very much attention but the UK was a major contributor to the EU's development fund and its was a respected voice in the development of policy at times. There will be a major loss to the budget and we discussed the figures at the recent committee meeting. The question is whether the shortfall will be made up by other EU members. EU funding comes through the EU budget and the European development fund and Britain contributed 13.4% to this budget last year, amounting to €1.23 billion out of a total of €9 billion. The UK's share of the development fund was €4.48 billion out of a total of €30 billion. These are sizeable contributions and there are serious questions regarding what is going to happen if they are no longer going to be available to the poorest countries in the world. There are also questions in respect of the absence of Britain from the EU table when it comes to development policy. Britain's was a voice in the argument that development co-operation should focus strongly on the root causes of migration, which are poverty, abuse of human rights, land grabs and climate change. No one can deny the importance of those matters. People should have to leave their countries of origin because they are hungry, cannot find work, have had their lands taken away or are subjected to human rights abuses because of their gender, religion, ethnicity or sexual orientation. There are major questions regarding the EU development fund and the trust fund in the context of moneys going to countries that are instrumental in human rights abuses. Instead of tackling the root causes of migration, they appear to leave people in abject circumstances so that they do not intrude on our comfortable existence. We need greater transparency and accountability on exactly where EU development fund and trust fund moneys are going. We recently witnessed the regularisation of thousands of sub-Saharan African migrants in Morocco, where, I understand, they are very welcome. This, however, cannot be at the expense of the Sahwari people. A recent European Court of Justice ruling on an agricultural deal treated the disputed territory of Western Sahara as independent from Morocco and, suddenly, there was a bigger influx of these migrants into Europe. One area in respect of which the UK will not be missed is the fact that, under the past two Tory Governments, its policy has been leading to more privatisation of aid. At least Ireland is holding on to its reputation for untied aid. With the British Government gone from policy formulation, we might have a greater emphasis on untied aid, so that aid will be for the betterment of the receiver rather than for the economic benefit of the donor. British aid had become more and more tied to private finance. Irish NGOs have been much stronger in the context of trade deals and economic partnership agreements, EPAs, but there are major questions over Britain's trade deals and the issue of human and workers' rights. There are voices in Britain highlighting this and concerns are emerging about the appearance of a British empire part 2, in which deals will be done with dictators who abuse human rights. I read an article about Britain in The Guardian recently which states, "A ruling elite tortured by its inability to rule the world, which believes such a role is its birthright, can still make dangerous decisions."If the British are not in the EU, there is far more scope for them to do that. We are looking increasingly at the potential positive outcomes for Ireland from Brexit, including the possibility of international financial sector firms moving here. It was estimated recently that if 1% of companies moved here, it would mean an extra 6,000 jobs. It is good to see a growing consensus across Europe for further transparency on tax issues. That means public country-by-country reporting, which we seem to be resisting. We appear to be supportive of country-by-country reporting but not publicly. As such, there is a need for enhanced regulation and oversight of our tax policies because our reputation is already tarnished as a result of the term "tax haven" being applied to Ireland. Those financial and taxation practices have an impact on developing countries and, as such, the question is whether we and the EU are committed to tax justice and whether it will be a feature at Council meetings going forward. The EU is the largest contributor to ODA, but UN figures show that developing countries lose more money through tax dodging than they gain in aid. The figure in this regard is $100 billion annually. As such, the question is about policy coherence. In respect of refugees, Oxfam tells us that the wealthiest countries in the world host just 9% of the global refugee population. There are countries in the EU with very regressive policies on refugees. The mantra seems to be "good migration management", which means that the EU trust fund is being used for security and border management by states with appalling human rights records. This is at a time when certain African countries face the horror of famine. One country is already experiencing a famine and three others are on the brink. Where is the awareness and willingness to cope with these matters at European Council level? I am talking about northern Nigeria, South Sudan, Yemen and Somalia. The UN has designated what Yemen is experiencing as the worst humanitarian crisis across the globe, with 70% of the population depending on humanitarian assistance. The conflict in Yemen is fuelled by official arms sales by some EU countries and other western states, primarily the UK and the USA. Will that be raised at the European Council meeting this week as well as at UN level? Will Ireland be an influential voice to stop countries selling arms, which practice is fuelling the conflict, and will we condemn sales of arms to Saudi Arabia by the UK and other member states? Where are the voices of the EU and Irish ambassadors to Saudi Arabia and what is our embassy there doing? Is it making known the concerns about this? There will be a Yemen donor conference in Geneva this month and it is important for our Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to attend. If he does, will his be a strong voice on these matters? As of 15 March 2017, the humanitarian response plan is only 7% funded. Ireland has been very strong in its commitment to humanitarian disasters. However, while we are talking about narrow interests here, there are people in certain countries in the world who are starving. There are hundreds of thousands of malnourished children. Where stands the European Council on that? It is providing funding, but is that funding going to the right places? Finally, I return to Palestine. The EU is demanding that Israel put an end to the demolition of Palestinian homes in Area C of the West Bank at the Bedouin village of Khan al-Ahmar where there will be a forced transfer of residents in violation of the Article 49 of the Geneva Convention. Article 49 prohibits individual or mass forcible transfers as well as deportations of protected persons from occupied territories of the occupying power or any other country, occupied or not. Nevertheless, the European Council is not a voice in that regard. While it says the words, it is not taking matters further. What can the European Council do to protect these Bedouin people and to uphold and respect the Geneva Convention? Palestinian human rights organisations confirm that 97 Palestinian people, including 36 children, were killed in the West Bank and Gaza in the past year alone. A hunger strike by Palestinian prisoners is impending. I acknowledge those Israeli groups and individuals who do not subscribe to what has been going on in their country. However, the fact is that Europe is sustaining illegal settlements. There are a number of countries which do not have embassies in Ireland but whose ambassadors to Britain also present credentials here. That is an important link with those countries. Are there any plans to deal with that issue in light of Brexit?
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-13 00:00:00	European Council: Statements	134	The 2017 management plan of the EU Directorate General on Agriculture and Rural Development states:The last reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) was agreed in 2013. Since then, significant developments have taken place:First, falling agricultural prices have left farmers feeling highly vulnerable. Unfavourable terms of trade for the sector may well persist for some time.I note that it is not a question of "may" but rather that they will persist. The plan continues:Secondly, the Commission's 'Trade for All' strategy has led to an increased number of international negotiations which in turn increases the pressure on the EU agricultural sector.Thirdly, agriculture and forestry sectors need to play a key role in our new EU 2030 climate and energy framework, as well as to respond to ongoing global challenges such as migration and the new Sustainable Development Goals.There are huge issues here but the fact that - while probably an oversight - this meeting nearly slipped through without pre-Council statements taking place in the House raises the question of whether we are ready, thinking properly and focused. The head of Dairygold says that unless an EU plan to combat customs and tariff barriers is put in place, rural Ireland will be decimated. We can talk all we like about post offices, road traffic laws and other issues affecting rural Ireland, but this is a bombshell waiting to explode. It will explode if we fail to obtain meaningful respect for our vulnerable situation and, indeed, that of our counterparts in Northern Ireland who currently trying to form an Executive. Regarding the North, we must push the Border back to where it should be in the first place, around Ireland as an island off the west coast of Europe, surrounded by water. Now is our chance. I believe that passionately. We must do so in light of the prospect of tariffs and barriers. I think of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle who travels to the House from Donegal and who passes through the North, crossing the Border at many places where there used to be controls. I recall all of the skullduggery that went on in areas along the Border, including smuggling and God knows what else. We cannot have that. We have motorways connecting everything now and the existing position has to be maintained at all costs. I note the implications of Brexit for EU citizens, which is not being dealt with properly. The EU has been blasé about this and probably thought it would never happen, but it has. It is time for the EU to pinch itself, wake up and smell the coffee. This is coming down the track and it is not going to be derailed. There are huge issues and we need to get bang for our buck. We have been the exemplary Europeans and the good boys in class and it is now time we were supported by the EU 27 and got a bit of payback. Some may claim we have been supported well by Europe, but that is questionable. Nevertheless, if we are going to stay in the Union while our nearest partners go out, there will be huge consequences. That is not being engaged with properly. What is the point of EU Council engagement by Ireland if there is still a shortage of personnel in Departments to deal with the issue? This matter was also raised yesterday on Leaders' Questions. I ask the Taoiseach and the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, to outline what specific personnel have been put in place in Departments, what specific roles they have, what specific issues they have raised and what timeline of debate and discussion with EU counterparts has been set. We need a headcount on this to dispel the myth that they are not in place. We need to be told who they are, how they are earning their crust and what they are about to deliver or trying to deliver for our country. I see the Taoiseach conferring with his senior officials and I hope we get those answers, if not today in the Minister of State's reply, then in writing at a later time. This is serious stuff. We have never been at such a juncture before. I was going to school when we joined the EU and while we have been there for better or for worse, divorce is here now. Divorce was introduced in Ireland a long time ago and I see there was a Bill last week to shorten the time to get one, but Brexit is a divorce for which we are not ready.The two parties are going two steps forward and one step back. This is a divorce that is going to happen. There is a date and cut-off point. The article has been triggered, and it will be a very unholy and messy affair if proper planning is not put in place for it. It is kind of foisted on the couples without arbitration and without mediation, so now it is bitter warfare, to use the parallels of a couple separating. I want to raise the issue that was raised by Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, which is the financial contribution the UK was making to international aid and to different NGOs that are working in the most horrific of situations. I thank the Ceann Comhairle and Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing Deputies Noel Grealish, Michael Collins, Kevin O'Keeffe and me a debate this evening in Topical Issue matters about the persecution of Christians in the Middle East. That is happening and we are all turning a blind eye to it, or not turning our eyes to it, which we should be doing. I thank them for giving that time and hope that we get a good response from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. A huge contribution has been made by the NGOs and almost €2 billion will be lost from that fund. I also have concerns, like other Members, that some of these donors are donating the money for their own benefit. It is not because of moral ethics or humanitarian needs that they give it. They are pulling the strings. Big business in Europe, including the bankers and all those in the big high-rise buildings based around the EU capital in Brussels and elsewhere are pulling the strings. The tail is wagging the dog of the EU masters. The big businesses are calling the shots. There is an ongoing migrant crisis internationally, as we know. The inability of the EU to effect the international plan to deal with this has been dismal, appalling and a glaring example of how we have failed to handle humanitarian issues. The European banking sector is indeed in need of reform. It is stopping us from reforming ours. We know how bad ours is. German banks have community banking, as does Switzerland. Different models were put up for examination, and I compliment the Public Banking Forum of Ireland. We are not going to get a look in here. The pillar banks and the Central Bank, with its tentacles reaching in everywhere, are stopping that. People can get loans in European countries for 2% interest rates. We are paying between 4% and 7% here. We are being destroyed as an economy by the greed and the control of the Union and what it is doing. That is maybe why we got Brexit. There are very good business-minded people who thought it would not happen, so we let it drift on thinking it would not happen and, all of a sudden, it happened. The gun is loaded and is ready for the gunpowder to be ignited and for the bullet to be let out. It will not be a silver bullet for us. It will be a nasty bullet for us. We are sleepwalking into it - pardon the saying, and I do not mean to be disrespectful to anyone. We are not giving the due diligence and due concern that we should be giving it here. We have Dairygold and big businesses like that that are world-renowned. They might not have the best of practices and might need to be investigated but they are flagship developments. We need to sit up and listen when they are concerned and when other Europeans are concerned about the European nucleus that wants to hold on to the power. They are being cajoled on an hourly, probably a half hourly or even on a by-minute basis by the big business in Europe. We cannot be left with a hard Border, with an unfit for purpose vehicle for our exporters, for our road hauliers and goodness knows for so many other things. We are an island country. We export much of our produce both to the UK and to other parts of Europe and farther and we cannot have these tariffs. The European Central Bank, ECB, is still clinging on to an old model. The model is broken. We often say that if it is not broken, do not fix it. The UK has driven a coach and four through it. That is its democratic decision and there may be a good reason for it. It is broken, so we have to get that mindset away from the ECB and clinging on to that old model. The ship has sailed and if we do not get the life buoys and jump soon, we will all be left in the you-know-what. European policy is directionless on a whole host of issues. I mean that very honestly. The migrant crisis is one of the issues. It is a very obvious, pertinent and timely issue. European policy is directionless and has lost its vision, certainly since the founding fathers and what they set it up for. The EU seems to care little about us lesser minions here on this side of Europe, who have been the good boys in class, have done all the rights things and obeyed and accepted everything. We accepted many directions here without even contesting them, when there are chances here, and this is still going on, for us to get exclusions and derogations. We do not even ask for them. We just say to pile them on. What do we often do? We add more to directives here to make it more punitive on our rural community and our people. Rural Ireland is languishing in the depths at the moment. This could have astronomical effects on it if we do not step up and do our job.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-13 00:00:00	European Council: Statements	135	I want to return to a point I think I have made to the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, in the past. It is worth repeating that I think our interests in this European Council and in the upcoming talks around Brexit are that we play a constructive role in trying to get agreements on some of the standards and working arrangements that are not necessarily the big headline issues around trade agreements. We have to get the UK to buy in to existing and future standards and regulations from the European Union if we are going to minimise the effect of dislocation. To make that point and to give credence to it, I want to give a couple of practical examples of what I am talking about. The first area is energy. We have to think big and long-term for energy. We have to think of the next couple of decades rather than just the next two years if we are to get a relationship that is going to work. I would love for the UK to reverse out of this Brexit process, but that does not look likely. If we are going to think, let us think of decades rather than just the next couple of years. In that period, we are going to have to decarbonise our energy system completely. We are going to go to a variable power supply. It is clear now that renewables are winning. It is going to require an incredibly complex balancing system to allow that to provide for our industries. We know now that technology has come down in price. The key thing is around some of the standards and market rules to make it work. It is not in any trade agreement. It is about specific sectoral agreements. For example, in the area of energy, one of the projects that I think is going to come in the next decade or so is a big offshore development in the Irish Sea. Offshore wind energy has come down in price and is competitive. It is competitive with any other fossil fuel and is half the price of nuclear energy. People are now looking at the prospect of us building something like 3 GW worth of offshore wind power facilities in the Irish Sea and connecting it to the Isle of Man. I know this sounds slightly fanciful or scientific, but this is the reality of what people are thinking about now. It will use a converter station on the Isle of Man and ship that power. There will be a grid line coming from Scotland, a grid line coming from Ireland and a grid line going into Wales and England. That is what people are investing in and thinking about now. These are the projects that are real. The Danes recently showed that they can bring the cost right down. This can be done by getting the market rules conditions right, which takes uncertainty out. It is all capital costs, so by bringing uncertainty down, the costs come down. The Danes got bidding prices right down to 5 cent per kilowatt-hour. One of the things we need to do in the negotiations and which needs to be done reasonably quickly is to ask if we are agreed on the market rules around how these interconnectors work. Are we agreed on the half hour or 15-minute balancing arrangements to make this wider regional market work? Are we going to agree on the digital communications systems that will back it up? When power is being shipped over distances like that, it is run on a very complex network system which comprises not just cables but also a digital network. We need to get those standards right. The UK will want to do this. It just published a policy document saying that, going forward until 2030, its big investment is in offshore wind and in interconnection. It is short of power. Its only other options are expensive, so it will want to do it. It is in our interests to do it. If we get it right, not only do we get it right for east-west connections, but it will also help North-South connections, and it will help our economy because we have a very large sea area and very strong wind resources. I do not think the agreement on that set of rules can wait. Rather than wait until after Brexit and all the other stuff is done and then start talking about those arrangements, we are better off getting in early on that set of details. The second example, and it is related, is that I said that that energy network we are going to have to build is also going to be centred around a digital network. The switching on and off of devices for energy efficiency will be involved in this balancing system.That requires digital signals and the sharing of data. The second big area of critical importance for our economy is to get the rules on digital policy agreed, not necessarily in any trade agreement but we must agree on what will replace the privacy shield and the former safe harbour arrangements. Do we trust our data if it is over in the UK? It will affect the companies in the silicon docks here. Everyone is rightly concerned about agriculture but if we do not get those standards arrangements right, it will be the first shock. It will be a shock if, the day after Brexit, people are told they cannot buy anything online from the UK because we do not trust its entire system. Those standards around privacy, access to data and copyright are really complex legal areas where we need to adapt and change to make sure we have the public confidence to operate these systems. We saw in our debate last night on the water issue what the lack of confidence in sharing data and information can do. The capability to develop this new economy can be shattered. It is absolutely in our interest. I am speaking for my constituency of Dublin Bay South. We have 50,000 to 60,000 jobs in this industry. If we can get this right it will be hugely important for our industry here but it is wider than that. There are risks involved. The UK tends to be good at digital policy so it will be badly missed from the European Union for the formulation of digital policy. We tend to be slightly closer to the UK, because we are both common law systems, than we are to a German or French model. It is in our interest to make sure the UK is still involved in setting, adapting and abiding by those digital rules. One risk is that there will be complete dislocation if the UK is just shut out because then we will be on the far side of the UK in a very difficult way. The other risk is they may go and just have higher standards and better rules and we would lose some of the investment we get here. It is those standards we need to get right. When we discussed this a number of months ago, the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, said we will do the difficult Brexit stuff first and the divorce Bill, and six or nine months later, if it is going well we will maybe start to set up the talks around those further strands. I do not know if that is in our interest. It would be better for us to act in some ways as an interlocutor and to use our strategic position to create a safe space before we even start talking about this because it is incredibly complex stuff. In a sense, we hold the cards because I cannot see the UK walking away from digital, energy or environmental standards that the European Union sets. The UK is not big enough so it risks being cut off if it ignores those standards. I think it will opt in. If it opts in to those standards it is as significant as all the talk about trade arrangements and tariffs and so on. We need to get the standards and regulations right. In some way, it is an opportunity for us to look at where those standards in digital policy are going. In my mind, we need to go to a much more citizen centred standards approach on digital policy in the European Union and not just a system of big state control or one of huge state surveillance. There has to be trust in these networks. It should not be a system in which only corporate interests such as the Facebooks, Googles, Microsofts and Yahoos of this world are setting standards. It should be the European Union creating a citizen centred digital regulatory system. We have the opportunity in these talks to push that and to be seen as an ethical, high standard home of good digital policy. That is the opportunity if we take the interlocutory role in the negotiations. It is the same on energy. We should get those regulations right. The time is right because the European Union is revising its whole European governance market rule system so it is up for grabs. Why would we wait? Why would we not get in early and be seen to be an ethical leader in terms of moving to this cleaner digital economy? The same can apply in agriculture. If we set the standards on GMOs, steroids in beef and so on, they will protect our interests as much as the tariffs or other arrangements which have such prominence in our debate. I am not closely involved in the talks but we have a lot of political capital because people are very concerned about the all-island network. We should not expend all our capital just looking at our own island. We should think slightly bigger and broader. We should put our capital behind those standards negotiations and create a safe space for talks because we get on well with the British. It would serve our interests well. It would minimise the risk of a hard Border on this island. It also places us, as a country, in a forward thinking progressive new economy area. We have good contacts in the UK Government. The permanent secretary in the area of industrial strategy is our former communications regulator. The UK energy regulator is our former energy regulator. We happen to have good contacts and abilities to talk to each other. We have a similar common law system. We should not expend our political capital within a narrow focus. We should think big, think long term and think of where the real economy is going. That would be a better strategy to apply in the Council.

As the Taoiseach and others have said, this is a crucial meeting for Ireland as it will set the initial negotiating guidelines for the talks, which will begin subsequently in great detail. We know we must listen to all the voices from around this island, as the Government is doing and will continue to do, and to ensure there is an open and inclusive approach. It is the approach the Government has adopted from the outset. The Oireachtas has a central role to play. Deputy Haughey and others were at the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs yesterday when we had a very detailed and lengthy exchange. I wish them continued success. The Government has always been aware of the deep challenge that lies before us. As Deputy Martin and others have said, the potential for a good outcome for Ireland from this process does not exist so it is up to us to minimise the effect on our country and on the island. Our overriding priority from the outset has been to get the very best deal for Ireland in the negotiations ahead. The challenge is significant and many have called it the challenge of a generation. I agree with that assessment. I will address some of the contributions made and address some of the questions that came from Deputy Martin. We will look at this with respect to all of the guidelines. It is absolutely clear that changes to EU law will be required. It seems to me to be absolutely implicit. We will look at that when looking at the guidelines. The Deputy referred to the common travel area and the 1.8 million people in Northern Ireland who have the entitlement to an Irish passport and therefore a European Union passport. The guideline text is a concise document, therefore the elements relating to Ireland are also concise. This is why we have the phraseology we have within the text. We are very satisfied with the text. It is Irish text that we have supplied and worked with our partners in Europe to achieve. It does not mean there is not space for some further clarifications. Deputy Ryan is correct in his assessment of standards. It will be remarkably challenging for the United Kingdom, particularly given its public commentary about the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. If the UK chooses not to abide by European standards, it will cause significant difficulties for it if it chooses to continue to export into the European Union as we assume it must. The Deputy is correct. The future relationship, which will probably be a new trade deal not unlike CETA or a new version of TTIP, will not only involve the question of tariffs but the issue of standards. To date, Europe has shown leadership in global standards with respect to data and privacy and other areas. I will respond to the contribution made by Sinn Féin. I will meet the Scottish Minister in Cork next Thursday night. The other devolved assemblies and the British and Irish Governments are all working to promote their own needs and those of their citizens. Northern Ireland is sadly at a disadvantage because of Sinn Féin's inability to conclude a deal and put the Northern Ireland Executive in place.I had an exceptionally productive meeting with Máirtín Ó Muilleoir at a General Affairs Council, GAC, cohesion meeting at which the positions of two Ministers from the island of Ireland were put together to our colleagues. To now hear the hypocrisy of Sinn Féin talking about the Government not doing enough for the people of Northern Ireland in the context of there being no Northern Irish voice in these talks thanks to Sinn Féin and its inability to do its job having been elected by the people of Northern Ireland-----

#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-13 00:00:00	European Council: Statements	151	The Government is trying to manage many serious challenges on many fronts, some with little success and others with none. Housing remains a national crisis which is worsening by the day rather than improving. For the past 22 days, a bus strike has impeded people across the country and has had a detrimental impact on local and regional economies. A report yesterday confirmed that businesses across Cork lost up to €20 million in this period. Provincial towns such as Athlone, Mullingar, Thurles, Sligo and so on have felt the pinch. Businesses there have been down by approximately 20%. Retail Excellence Ireland, REI, predicted this morning that there will be job closures as a result of this strike. All of these losses and the strike itself could have been avoided if the Government had acted when it became aware of the financial difficulties facing Bus Éireann over a year ago. Banks are pulling out of towns across the country. There is a threat of 250 post office closures. The lack of broadband delivery will leave half a million people waiting until 2023 for a service. These issues sum up and justify how rural Ireland feels neglected by the Government. Worryingly, the chairman of Dairygold was quoted in today's edition of the Irish Independent as stating that if Brexit leads to customs and tariff controls, there will be decimation in rural Ireland with the cheese, beef, dairy, mushroom and drinks industry being seriously hit. If introduced, the World Trade Organization, WTO, tariffs on cheese will be €1,671 per tonne. The CEO of Dairygold said that this would be an appalling and frightening vista. The negotiations on Article 50 start at the end of this month. Whatever emerges from the negotiations, Ireland will need a major programme to aid those who are worst hit. The agrifood sector is critical to our economy and will be the sector worst hit. The UK is already funding their businesses to protect supply chains and Ireland needs to do the same.  Can the Tánaiste confirm that the Government is requesting assistance from the EU? Does the Government have a plan for the agrifood sector, which employs tens of thousands of people across the length and breadth of the country?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-13 00:00:00	European Council: Statements	152	Let me give another perspective to what Deputy Troy has said. The Irish economy continues to grow strongly. Growth is broadly based across the country and employment continues to grow in all sectors. Earlier this week, the Government published our draft stability programme update and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, will present that document to the Select Committee on Budgetary Oversight at 2 p.m. today. Everyone is aware of the uncertainties on which the Deputy has commented but despite those external uncertainties, the growth forecast for 2017 has been upgraded to 4.3%, having grown at 5.2% last year. These are not just statistics. They have an impact on families' lives because the figures indicate that people are now working. Our debt position continues to improve. The rate of unemployment has dropped from a high of over 15% when Fine Gael returned to power in 2011 to 6.5% today. That means something to individuals and families. It has an impact on the quality of their lives. It means there are opportunities. We are able to continue to invest in the services people need because we have a growing economy. When Fianna Fáil was in government, all investment stopped. Unemployment was growing, the economy was in freefall and we had lost our sovereignty. All of that has now changed. That is the broader context, notwithstanding the challenges the Deputy points to in regard to Brexit and the changing economic situation. There has already been a discussion in the House this morning regarding Brexit. The Government has a clear plan. The priorities of the Irish Government have been reflected in the draft paper which was published. There are certain sectors which will be particularly affected, including the enormous challenges which Brexit presents for the entire Irish agrifood sector. Negotiations are yet to begin but the Government will take a most robust approach to protecting vulnerable sectors. It has been recognised in what has been published to date that there is a special case and situation in regard to Ireland which must be considered in the negotiations. For example, in 2016, Irish agrifood exports to the UK came to €4.8 billion or 39% of the total agrifood exports. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, and his officials are working on these issues. They are looking at the potential impact of the UK vote, the areas where the greatest risks may arise and the areas on which we will need to focus once negotiations begin. As I have said, the negotiations have not yet begun but the preparatory work has been done. The priority for Ireland is protecting our economy, including the very valuable agrifood sector.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-13 00:00:00	European Council: Statements	153	It is typical of the Government that the Tánaiste comes into the House and tries to take credit for every positive event over the past number of years. The Tánaiste has ignored the favourable international conditions from which the Government benefitted, the sacrifices made by men and women over the past number of years and the business people who are creating employment the length and breadth of this country with little help from the Government. We are still waiting for the Government to take corrective action on the issue of commercial rates, which has faced businesses in recent years. The Tánaiste chose to ignore the issues I raised about post offices, bank closures and the strike at Bus Éireann. It is not funny. It is not funny for the people in rural Ireland who rely on these services day in, day out. I ask the Tánaiste a specific question about an EU stabilisation fund. Will Ireland be able to benefit from that? Will the agrifood sector, which generates tens of thousands of jobs but will be detrimentally affected by Brexit, be able to apply for that funding in the not too distant future?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-13 00:00:00	European Council: Statements	154	All the points I raised relating to increasing employment in this situation impact on rural Ireland as well. The Labour Court is expected to make a recommendation today, and we want to see our transport services in place again as soon as possible. The approach the Government has adopted to this is that we want to see a resolution while encouraging all parties to be part of that. The issue of post offices was discussed in detail here yesterday. The Government is taking a range of actions and initiatives, including on banking, in post offices that I hope will ensure that they will remain open in rural areas across the country. As the negotiations develop, it is essential that the vulnerability of particular sectors will form a key part of those negotiations. From an agrifood perspective and given the importance of the United Kingdom, UK, market for the sector, our demand will be for continued free access to the UK market without tariffs and with minimal additional customs and administrative procedures and to keep the UK market viable for Irish producers by minimising the risk for many UK trade agreements. That is clearly the approach we will be taking and in that context we will be discussing the very point Deputy Troy raised.
#LouiseOReilly	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-party	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-dob	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-13 00:00:00	European Council: Statements	155	The chaos caused by the Tánaiste's Government is starting to get out of control. Its mismanagement has led to chaos in our justice system, chaos in transport and chaos in governance, but perhaps the most stark and painful is the chaos in our hospitals. Waiting lists continue to soar. Exhausted and demoralised staff are leaving in droves, there is a dangerous lack of capacity in our ambulance services and there has been no let up. There has been no let up for the nurse finishing a 12 hour shift knowing that she has to go back to dealing with the consequences of this Government's mismanagement and chaotic attitude to health care. Figures have been published by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation. I want to thank it for publishing the figures because they are a valuable addition to our discourse on health. Very often, they inject facts which contradict the Government's spin. The figures show that March 2017 has seen the highest ever number of people on trolleys since 2006. For the benefit of those who have not heard, that is 9,459. In 2008, the figure was 4,700. Last month, 9,459 patients were admitted for inpatient care. A decision was taken by a doctor that they needed a bed and there was no bed for them. I remind the Tánaiste that it is only a short few years since her colleague, the former Minister for Health, now Senator James Reilly, gave a commitment that never again would we see 569 people on trolleys. In January, the Government was surprised by the influenza outbreak and the figure increased to over 600. I believe that if something needs to be fixed we should stop what we are doing and do that. Clearly, reviews do not work. Committees do not work. Kicking the can down the road, and God knows that is one of the Government's favourite pastimes, does not work. The Government's winter initiative has not worked. The National Treatment Purchase Fund, the practice of the Government giving money into the private sector, crossing its fingers, closing its eyes and hoping that somehow that will improve the public service, has not worked and will not work in the long run. People need solutions that work. Will the Tánaiste take the necessary steps to deal with the scale of this crisis? Will she listen to the voices of patients, carers, the workers and their representatives? Will she confirm for our elderly citizens sitting at home in fear that the Government will not means test the already overstretched home help service but that it will increase the number of hours available?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-13 00:00:00	European Council: Statements	156	This Government has been and is taking action. The Minister for Health has a series of initiatives to improve our health service. The first point I would make is that it is the highest health budget ever at €14.6 billion, demonstrating the Government's commitment to investing the gains from the recovering economy I spoke about to improving the health services. There is increased demand, as the Deputy rightly points out, from a growing and ageing population. We have a series of new developments in drugs, for example, and the Deputy will be aware of the very welcome decision taken this week on Orkambi to respond to the needs of people who have cystic fibrosis. As the Deputy knows, the Minister met with the INMO this morning, and it is worth putting on the record that over 80% of nurses voted recently to accept the Workplace Relations Commission recommendation. In terms of improving our health service, the key issue is the recruitment of more nurses. Part of the proposals was that 1,208 fully funded new posts for nurses will be in place by the end of this year. Both the INMO and the Minister are working to ensure that we have that recruitment and retention. That is absolutely critical. There is a new Bring them Home initiative, increased supports for nurses who return here and further pre-retirement initiatives to ensure that we can retain the nurses we currently have. The Minister and the INMO are agreed on that. Over 80% of the nurses are agreed on it also. I would point to other initiatives that have happened. We have seen the increased funding that has gone into home care for the very people the Deputy spoke about. Increased numbers of home care packages have been made available and there was additional funding of €18.5 million in budget 2017 to support the development of primary care services. This week, given the funding we now have for the National Treatment Purchase Fund, more than 2,000 people will get their appointments. That is now possible because that funding is available under the National Treatment Purchase Fund. Those are real people who need services. I would point out to the Deputy also that the trolley numbers are down approximately 5% in the year to date. There are huge challenges but progress is being made. With the exception of one day, there was a decrease in the numbers on every day in April compared to the same time last year. The numbers range from a 3.6% decrease in waiting time on one day to a 27.7% decrease on another day. Progress is being made but there are huge challenges in terms of extra demands on our health services. I totally acknowledge the distress that can and is being caused to patients and their families, and to front-line staff who have been working in extremely difficult circumstances, but a range of both budgetary supports and other supports are being made available. For example, with regard to an issue that was raised here frequently, in January and February of this year we had the lowest level of delayed discharges in recent years. Progress is being made but huge challenges remain.
#LouiseOReilly	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-party	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-dob	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-13 00:00:00	European Council: Statements	157	In January, the numbers on trolleys hit a record level. The Government is fond of setting records. Unfortunately, none of them is very good or useful. The Tánaiste paints a rosy picture of all the things she would like to do and all the developments she says are happening. Would she like to go down to any of the 409 people waiting on trolleys today and tell them about her great plan because they cannot see it? I have already said that what the Government is doing is not working. It is clear there is a crisis in our health service yet the Members opposite seem to be more interested in the next leader of their party. The Tánaiste's eye is off the ball and her Government is letting down the 650,000 people who are on waiting lists.The Government is letting down the 9,400 people who were waiting on trolleys in March. The Tánaiste cannot spin this as a good news story because it is not so she should not pat herself on the back for the Government's so-called achievements because it has achieved record numbers on trolleys. I again ask the Tánaiste whether the Government will commit to reopening beds, investing in primary care and recruiting the necessary staff. By that, I mean actually recruiting staff because between December 2016 and January 2017, the system lost 168 nurses. The Government's recruitment plan is not working.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-13 00:00:00	European Council: Statements	158	The initiatives announced by the Minister, on which he is working, have his full focus. The INMO met him this morning to focus on the key issue of recruitment and retention. The plan that has been accepted by over 80% of nurses is important. I am certainly not complacent about the challenges and have said that. I have acknowledged that the distress caused to any one patient waiting on a trolley is one instance too many, but clearly these problems cannot be solved overnight. What I am telling the Deputy is that the initiatives and actions are in place to ensure we have continual improvements. It is very challenging. We have an increased population and an older population but the bed capacity review is under way and will be completed later this year. Discussions are under way with the GPs regarding contracts. That is another important building block towards ensuring that the kind of primary care we want to see in this country is in place. This in turn will lessen the pressures on our acute hospitals. There is no complacency. I understand the distress caused to any one patient who is on a trolley, but the Government is acting proactively to make a difference and improve our health service on an ongoing basis.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-13 00:00:00	European Council: Statements	159	We in the Labour Party were critical of last year's budget, particularly the determination of Government to use a huge chunk of money to give the equivalent of a cup of coffee back to some people rather than investing it in urgently needed public services. Inevitably, this meant that progress ground to a halt on things we were doing. There was no reduction in class sizes, there was insufficient funding for home care packages, there was no extension of free GP care for children and there was nowhere near the amount of money we need for capital investment. Having boxed itself into that corner, the Government knew it needed at least one signature policy for the budget. For weeks in advance of the budget, we were told that this would be affordable child care. The overall direction chosen by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is correct. She believes in, and we support, the need to move towards a model of targeted universalism where all families get support, with additional support for those who need it most. It did not get enough funding to be truly meaningful, but some argued that we needed to start small to get it right. That would be fine but even this small limited start now lies in tatters. The Irish Examiner reports today that neither the legislation nor the IT system is ready. For weeks, I have been asking the Taoiseach for an update on this legislation. I never got a clear answer except to be told that it was urgent. Deputy Jan O'Sullivan warned back in February that the system was in trouble because Pobal had indicated that the IT systems were not in place to do the job. The Minister never answered that charge. The reason neither the Taoiseach nor the Minister would give direct answers is abundantly clear. Having made political capital out of promising a child care scheme that would be progressive and help families who needed it most, the scheme will do no such thing. The existing targeted supports for the lowest income families will be retained but that is not progress. That is standing still. Now all that families will get is €20 per month in child care supports compared with a monthly cost in excess of €1,000. I have two questions for the Tánaiste. What does she have to say to the tens of thousands of families who were led up the garden path by the Government in the lead-up to the last budget? Will she outline to the House the exact position regarding child care supports that will be in place and when they will be in place?

The Government will continue to honour its commitment to make child care more affordable for thousands of families - more than 70,000 children - by making a number of enhancements to the existing targeted child care schemes with effect from September 2017. We are determined to go from having one of the most expensive child care regimes to one of the best. Significant progress has been made.

Given the sheer complexity of this development and a number of other factors beyond the control of the Department, the Department will not now introduce the online system until a later date.

From September, up to 33,000 children aged from six months up to 36 months and availing of registered child care will benefit from the new universal scheme. All children under the age of three will benefit from that. This will be in place from September. The maximum weekly subsidy payable will be €20 for children attending full-time care, which is €1,000 per year for those children. From September, another 23,000 children who are availing of child care supports under the community childcare subvention, CCS, programme will benefit from significant increases. These will be up to 50% in the subvention rates provided under the programme. Up to 7,000 additional children are expected to benefit from the programme from September due to improved access through a greater number of community and private child care providers participating in the programme throughout the country. I would remind Deputy Howlin that we have also brought in a second free preschool year, which will benefit-----

That was clear in February. We knew there were going to be problems with the scheme because Pobal told the Government so during the pre-legislative scrutiny. The Government has had since February at least to be honest with people and tell them this would not happen in the timeline set out in the budget. I am still not clear about when this will happen for all targeted children. When will we have the announcement that was made in the budget on the revised child care supports that were supposed to be funded in 2017 and which will not now be delivered in 2017? When will they be delivered?

That is the first point. There is a scheme there that will benefit far more children and there will be a greater level of subsidisation, something which was allowed for in the budget. They are new policies and it is important that they are being implemented. In respect of the Deputy's question, we will need some legislation and an IT system. The Minister is examining that legislation and regards it as a priority. Work is being done on the IT system that needs to be in place to reach that group of families. When that has been done, using existing levels of investment, a further 9,000 families will benefit from more affordable child care through child care subsidies of up to €12 per week.
#CatherineConnolly	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-party	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-dob	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-13 00:00:00	European Council: Statements	177	Thirty-three years ago, in 1984, such was the concern about the mental health services that the central recommendation of the major new document, Planning for the Future, proposed a new model of mental health care. Between 1984 and 2006, there was concern at the slow implementation of the policy and in 2006 - nuair atá an Tánaiste réidh - A Vision for Change was published. This document detailed a comprehensive model of mental health service provision for Ireland for the ensuing ten years, including providing a framework for building and fostering positive mental health across the entire community and providing accessible community based specialist services for people with mental illness. In other words - má tá an Tánaiste in ann éisteacht - it told the Government exactly what to do. A Vision for Change told the Government what to do and how to do it but because its authors knew it would not happen, they made a strong recommendation that an independent monitoring group be set up because the Government, like all institutions, simply cannot be trusted. The implementation body was set up. It sat for two periods, that is, from 2006 to 2009 and from 2009 to 2012, when it monitored and assessed. It comments that the implementation of A Vision for Change was not up to scratch. The implementation body did such a good job in highlighting the slow and inconsistent implementation of the policy document that the body was disbanded. Separately, year after year the Mental Health Commission has drawn the Government's attention to the failure to implement properly, fully and comprehensively A Vision for Change. In its 2016 report, the commission confirmed that A Vision for Change remained the national mental health policy. The document is to be praised. It highlighted recovery, person-centred approaches, partnership, user and family involvement and the delivery of services in a multidisciplinary community basis. A Vision for Change ran until January 2016. The Mental Health Commission has pointed out that while the vision of the document is excellent, the implementation was certainly not up to par. More importantly, the commission reiterated the need for an independent monitoring of A Vision for Change. Five years have passed without any independent monitoring mechanism. We are one year and three months after the promised review of the existing A Vision for Change. I have no idea what the difficulties are in this regard. I have raised it with the Tánaiste and I have raised it in the Dáil ten times but we still do not have the promised review or the implementation body, which is absolutely essential.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-13 00:00:00	European Council: Statements	178	I thank the Deputy for raising this very important issue, one that is a priority for the Government. Mental health remains a key care programme priority for the Government. This is reflected in the fact that the mental health budget for the HSE has increased from approximately €826 million in 2016 to approximately €851 million this year. That is important because we know there are unmet needs in the State in respect of mental health services. Importantly, the stigma around mental health issues is decreasing and this is particularly noticeable among young people with the initiatives being taken in schools and by the supports these give to young people with mental health issues. There are some wonderful changes in the country in that regard. A Vision for Change was the first important seminal document that laid out what we needed to do and that described the kinds of mental health teams needed for children and adults. A Vision for Change is still being implemented. I acknowledge that Deputy Connolly has asked this question in the Dáil previously. I am glad to be able to confirm that the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, has informed me that the first stages of the review will be published within two to three weeks. Once published, the implementation group will be established immediately. This is currently under way. The review will identify current gaps and it will publish plans to move towards having services available for 24 hours every day of the week. This is very important as access to emergency help or out-of-hours services is a huge issue in mental health. These issues will be addressed. As Deputy Connolly knows, there have been a lot of developments. If one looks at what has been happening in the area of child mental health services, one sees that the funding prioritised by the Government has allowed new teams to be established. We now have 67 child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS, teams nationwide, which is a huge improvement compared with the situation some years ago. We have three paediatric liaison teams. These are a very important part of the service because they provide the link between paediatrics and the mental health teams. There are 66 operational CAMHS beds across the country and we are planning to have further inpatient beds for children and young people with mental health issues. The direct reply to the Deputy's question is that the review report will be available in two to three weeks.

It seems to be the first stage in a further long process. The seminal document on mental health goes back to 1984 so there are no congratulations here. When we are talking about stigma and what is available, the difficulty is that all of this was recognised back in 1984 and re-recognised in 2006. There was nothing wrong with A Vision for Change. It is a brilliant document. It sets out everything. It sets out the figures in respect of suicide, which were at crisis point in 2006 and are significantly worse now, particularly in Galway city and county. We do not need any more statements in the Dáil. Members have been making statements about mental health but want an implementation of the document and want the independent body to be set up. If the Tánaiste is confirming this, then it is progress and I welcome it. We need absolute clarity on the review process and we need an implementation body similar to the previous body - and independent of the Government - to monitor the implementation of the existing A Vision for Change and any new changes.

It was an excellent document and it provided the basic architecture for the development of mental health services in Ireland. More than 80% of the recommendations have been implemented but as with other areas of the health services, a key issue is the recruitment and retention of staff. I have already shown the Deputy the improvements that have been made in the areas of child mental health, for example. The same is true of the adult mental health services. There is further work to be done. The first stage of the review, to be published in two to three weeks, will address the issues. The review is an evidence-based report and is based on experience internationally and in Ireland. This will influence the further implementation of A Vision for Change. It is about continuing to implement what was originally outlined in A Vision for Change but bringing it up to date and accelerating some initiatives, especially the provision of a 24-hour service seven days per week.

Six weeks later I am still waiting for an update on the revaluation process that is under way in a number of provincial towns across the State. It is leading to increases in commercial rates of up to 400%. Will the Tánaiste's office finally respond to the questions I raised in the Topical Issue debate? Will the Tánaiste also indicate when Members might expect the consolidation of the commercial rates legislation to come before the Dáil? When that legislation comes before the Dáil, will the revaluation process that is currently under way by the Department of Justice and Equality's Valuation Office cease to exist?

Last November, a report on health care in Irish prisons produced by the late Inspector of Prisons, Judge Michael Reilly, was published. The report makes a number of recommendations on the provision of health care in prisons, including a review of prison health care. I understand the terms of reference are being finalised. Will the Tánaiste indicate when she expects the terms of reference to be concluded? Will they be published? How long does she envisage the review of prison health care to take?

We will not have any legislation in place to make it clear that all schools must be welcoming of all pupils. We will not have any ban in place on the charging of fees for applying for a school place. We certainly will not have anything in place to deal with the real concerns of thousands of parents whose children have not been baptised and who are desperately anxious for a school place.

There are a couple of Bills outstanding that deal with the representation of workers. Changes are also due to be made to allow gardaí more representation. Any amendment to the Act should outlaw the type of practices that we hear are being carried out by Tesco. It is bullying workers who took part in pickets of other stores represented by the same union. Those workers are now being called in and intimidated. This also happened to Dunnes workers after their recent dispute. They are not allowed representation by their own union on the shop floor. Tesco is apparently calling in workers who may have gone in their own spare time, not in work time, to show solidarity with their colleagues. They are now being victimised. We need anti-victimisation clauses introduced into industrial relations legislation. We need an Industrial Relations Act that is not anti-union but that actually protects workers.

People with cystic fibrosis and their families welcomed the agreement in principle relating to Orkambi and Kalydeco, as did everyone across the House. However, they have an issue relating to another matter in the programme for Government. I am referring to an opt-out register for organ donation instead of the current opt-in register. This was due to happen before the end of 2017 according to the programme for Government. However, there does not seem to be anything on the legislative programme on this matter even under the Bills listed further away. I want to find out when we will have an opt-out register. Such a register greatly increases the number of organs available not only for cystic fibrosis patients but for others as well. This has been shown in other European countries.

It is being delivered in my constituency by a private company called Seetec. For people in rural Ireland this is a major difficulty because many of them have to travel long distances to make the appointments. Recently, I was contacted by a woman from west Cavan. She is 30 miles from Cavan town. She was told that she would have to come three times each week for an appointment. She explained that there was no bus service and that she did not drive. She was told that she would have to get a taxi. She asked whether she would be compensated. The person in Seetec told her that was her problem. We have asked several times for this scheme to be scrapped because we believe it is inappropriate. Failing that, will the Government put in place some kind of travel fund for people who have to travel long distances?

The Bill seeks to end one of the most discriminatory laws on the Statute Book: section 7(3)(c) of the Equal Status Act 2000. Section 7(3)(c) allows schools to discriminate against children. It allows schools in their admissions policies to discriminate against children who do not share the same religious ethos as that promoted by the school in question. It allows schools to turn away four and five year old children purely on religious grounds. The Social Democrats believe such a law is fundamentally unacceptable. It is anti-child and anti-education. It is blatant discrimination. If such a law were proposed by President Donald Trump or Marine Le Pen, we would be rightly appalled at the proposal. No one here would fail to join the chorus of condemnation of such a discriminatory law. Yet, we still allow this discrimination in our country today. The Social Democrats believe that our education system should be designed with the interests of children at its heart rather than the interests of religious groups. That is why we are bringing forward this Bill. The Bill would eradicate one of the most blatant examples of discrimination in Irish society. It would repeal section 7(3)(c) of the Equal Status Act as it applies to all publicly-funded schools. It would mean schools that are over-subscribed would no longer be able to select children on the basis of religious beliefs. It would mean that parents would no longer have to get their children baptised simply to gain access to their local school. It would mean the so-called baptism barrier would disappear. In recent public consultation on this matter such an option was favoured by a wide range of civil society groups with an interest in the education system. These groups include the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, Equate, Educate Together, the Children’s Rights Alliance, INTO, Education Equality, the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland, ISPCC, EPIC, BeLonG To, Pavee Point and others. The public is tired of the procrastination from Government, the endless excuses and the blatant favouritism by the State of the rights of religious over the rights of the child. The public is tired of the distinct lack of courage at the heart of successive Governments. Our laws should reflect the diversity of Irish society and the variety of belief systems that exist in the country. Religion plays a deep and meaningful role in the lives of many people. The Statute Book should respect those beliefs. However, we need to be clear: our laws should not favour one belief system over another. There is no place in a tolerant society for the kind of discrimination currently permitted under section 7(3)(c) of the Equal Status Act. On that basis, I appeal to all Members to support the Bill. There is a chance now under this legislation to end this most blatant form of discrimination once and for all. I appeal to everyone in the House to support the Bill.

#CarolNolan	unknown-#CarolNolan-party	unknown-#CarolNolan-dob	unknown-#CarolNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-13 00:00:00	European Council: Statements	231	I move:That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to make provision whereby the Minister for Education and Skills shall publish an annual education impact study on the effects his or her decision to continue with the provision of guidance counselling within the standard staffing schedule on schools; such study to include details of the names of schools that have reduced their guidance counselling provision as a direct result of this arrangement, with particular emphasis on those schools that have DEIS status and the impact of the reduced provision of guidance counselling on those schools including the impact on student’s wellbeing and progression to further education and training.I wish to introduce the Education (Guidance Counselling Provision) Bill 2017. This is a very simple and short Bill, the purpose of which is to seek to compel the Minister for Education and Skills to conduct an annual educational impact survey for every year that guidance counselling provision is provided from within the staffing schedule for second-level schools. The Minister will contend that 400 guidance posts have been restored outside of the staffing schedule and that the pupil-teacher ratio has been reduced as a result. This contention is disingenuous. While I acknowledge that the pupil-teacher ratio has been reduced by 0.4 at second level, there is no clear requirement that this reduction must be used to provide guidance. The concern is that second-level schools may use this reduction to provide an additional teacher for other subjects in the curriculum or other posts within the school. Sinn Féin believes that schools must be given a specific allocation of guidance hours based on levels of enrolment. This was the norm in previous years before the system was changed on foot of budget measures in 2012. The Education Act 1998 requires that students have access to appropriate guidance to assist them in their educational and career choices. Removal of ex quota guidance counselling hours has put the responsibility on principals to determine appropriate guidance and effectively forces principals to choose between subject provision and guidance counselling. Given the many cuts to education in recent years, it is little wonder that guidance counselling provision has reduced as a result. Figures from the Institute of Guidance Counsellors show that there has been an overall reduction of 24% in guidance counselling, with a massive reduction of 59% in time for one-on-one counselling. In a study by the National Centre for Guidance Education on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills, it was recommended that the ex quota allocation for guidance to schools should be restored as a priority. Sinn Féin supports this call. Research by the ESRI shows that those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds are more reliant on the supports and guidance at second level and that these supports play a more significant role in the choices made by these young people. It also found that the cuts to guidance counselling provision impacted most in disadvantaged schools and that the provision of guidance counselling was not equitable across the board. DEIS schools report a 30% decline in guidance counselling compared to 26% in non-DEIS schools. However, fee-paying schools showed an increase of 1.7% in guidance, which clearly shows that not only is guidance important and valued by schools, particularly as they are willing to spend funds on the service where such funds are available, but also that vulnerable students fully reliant on the public system are losing out and being disenfranchised by such a move. This Bill will require the Minister for Education and Skills to comprehensively analyse the educational impact of the decision to retain guidance counselling provision under the current arrangements and publish the findings. Such a study would examine the impact on disadvantaged schools, the effect on progression to further education, which has become very topical and is an issue of great concern, training and details of schools that have reduced guidance provision as a result of the policy decision. While I recognise that, in itself, this would not solve the problem, it would provide the hard data to inform future policy decisions in this area and, hopefully, would improve accountability for all decisions that have such a profound impact on our students and give every student a fair chance to achieve his or her potential. I commend this Bill to the House.

An fáth go bhfuilimid ag cur an Bille Ceardchumann (An Garda Síochána agus na Fórsaí Cosanta) 2017 chun tosaigh ná chun aitheantas ceart a thabhairt do bhaill an Gharda Síochána agus na Fórsaí Cosanta mar oibrithe. The intention of the Bill is to remove the bar on a Garda Síochána or Defence Forces association from associating with, or affiliating to, any trade union or any other association and to remove the bar on those members becoming members of proper Defence Forces associations, such as the GRA, PDFORRA, AGSI, RACO or even the Reserve Defence Forces Representative Association. It is about allowing those associations to become trade unions in their own right and to apply for the negotiating licence that has been denied to them by the State. The impetus in respect of this Bill has been quite clear in recent times. However, most people are not aware that in October 2014, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the absolute ban on trade unions within the French armed forces was a violation of Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Article 11 states that everyone has the right to the freedom of peaceful assembly and the freedom of association with others, including the right to form and join a trade union for the protection of one's interests. The European Court of Human Rights found that while it is perfectly legitimate of the State to put restrictions on freedom of association, a blanket ban on forming or joining a trade union encroached on the very essence of this freedom and is, as such, prohibited under the convention. Obviously, Ireland is also bound by that decision. This Bill intends to address that anomaly as well as to give voice to the representative associations that have not been allowed to properly represent their workers, the members of the Defence Forces and An Garda Síochána, many of whom have suffered greatly in recessionary times. I have received numerous letters from members of the Defence Forces and their partners and families explaining the tragic circumstances of some cases and the horrific financial circumstances in which they find themselves. The associations that are supposed to represent them do not have the right to represent them in talks on pay and conditions. That needs to end, which means that Ireland must come into line with other European countries. That is why we have proposed this Bill.
#DavidCullinane	unknown-#DavidCullinane-party	unknown-#DavidCullinane-dob	unknown-#DavidCullinane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-13 00:00:00	European Council: Statements	237	This is a Bill to remove the bar on a Garda Síochána or Defence Forces association from associating with, or affiliating to, any trade union or any other association; remove the bar on a Defence Force member from becoming a member of a Defence Force association that may wish to reconstitute itself as a trade union; and prohibit the use of strike action by an Garda Síochána or Defence Forces associations and trade unions for reasons of public safety. We believe that the Bill and the restrictions outlined in it strike a balance between the rights of An Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces and the rights of the people to protection. This Bill would, for the first time, allow members of An Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces and their organisations to be classified as workers in law and allow members to join trade unions and engage in the State's industrial relations mechanisms in pursuit of improvement of pay and conditions. The only associations that members of An Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces would be able to join under this Bill would be those already established under existing legislation. These associations can apply to register as trade unions and then apply for negotiation licences. The Garda and the Defence Forces associations, once reconstituted as trade unions, would be allowed to engage in industrial action in pursuit of the protection of the pay and conditions of their members with certain restrictions. We believe that the Bill strikes a fair balance. I know that previous Bills have been introduced by Opposition parties in the past and that some concerns were raised about the lack of restrictions. We have taken all of those concerns on board and the Bill takes cognisance of them. I hope the Government will support the Bill when, at some point, we move it on Second Stage.

The purpose of this Bill is to confer an explicit power on Inland Fisheries Ireland, IFI, to bring and prosecute summary proceedings for inland fisheries offences. It achieves this by amending Part 4 of the Inland Fisheries Act 2010 by the insertion of a specific provision providing for IFI to have power to bring and prosecute summary proceedings for offences under the Acts specified. It will ensure that IFI can fully enforce the Inland Fisheries Acts. The Bill also makes some additional corrections to the Inland Fisheries Act 2010 to ensure that minor omissions in that Act, which could affect IFI's prosecution powers, are fully resolved. Before providing Members with an overview of the different elements within the Bill, I will share some background. IFI is the State agency responsible for the protection, conservation, development and promotion of Ireland’s inland fisheries and sea angling resources. IFI was formed on 1 July 2010 following the amalgamation of the Central Fisheries Board and the seven regional fisheries boards into a single agency. Ireland has over 74,000 km of rivers and streams and 128,000 ha of lakes, all of which fall under the jurisdiction of IFI. IFI's jurisdiction also extends to the 12-mile limit around the coast. The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment received advice from the Office of the Attorney General in February 2017 to the effect that IFI does not have a power to bring prosecutions under the Inland Fisheries Acts. It was advised that an explicit power to prosecute should be inserted into Part 4 of the 2010 Act as a matter of priority. The impact of this advice is that until the Inland Fisheries Act 2010 is amended, prosecutions brought by IFI for which proceedings have been initiated cannot be proceeded with. There are approximately 150 cases that fall into this category. It should be noted that cases that have already been finally disposed of by the courts are not affected. In light of this advice, the amendments to the Inland Fisheries Act 2010 are being pursued as a matter of priority. The short title of the Bill is the Inland Fisheries (Amendment) Act 2017. I shall now turn to the provisions of the Bill. The Bill comprises five sections, the main provisions of which I will summarise with the following definitions. Section 1 provides that “Act of 2010” means the Inland Fisheries Act 2010. The amendment of section 2 of the Act of 2010 updates the definitions section of the Inland Fisheries Act 2010 to clarify that references to the “Act of 1962” refer to the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 1962. In section 3 the amendment of section 77 of Act of 2010 provides for additional corrections to the Inland Fisheries Act 2010 to ensure that minor omissions in that Act, which could impact IFI's prosecution powers, are fully resolved. The amendments relate to the table in section 77 of the Inland Fisheries Act 2010. Part 2 of the table is amended to substitute "Section of Act of 1962” for “Section of Principal Act”. Part 2 of the table is also amended by the insertion of two news rows at rows two and three. These insertions make reference to section 28 of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 1962 and the associated penalties. Part 3 of the Table is amended by the substitution of “Section of Act of 1994” for “Section of Principal Act”. Section 4 deals with summary proceedings and amends Part 4 of the Inland Fisheries Act 2010 by the insertion of a new section 80A following section 80, which will allow summary proceedings to be brought and prosecuted by IFI for offences under the Acts listed. Section 5 contains general provisions relating to the short title, commencement and collective citation. I look forward to engaging with Deputies in the debate on the Bill on Committee Stage. As with all natural resources, inland fisheries must be managed carefully and responsibly. First, decisions on the management of fish stocks and the waterways must be made using the best available scientific evidence. Local knowledge is also important in helping to guide decisions. Decisions relating to fisheries and rivers may not always be popular but they are made in the interests of the different stakeholders and in the interests of the environment. Second, we must ensure that we have an organisation that can direct our policy of careful and responsible management of our inland fisheries. That organisation is Inland Fisheries Ireland, whose members work diligently to manage our inland fisheries for the benefit of us all. Our aim is to ensure that Inland Fisheries Ireland has the power to carry out this vital task and that is the purpose of this Bill. Poaching is not a victimless crime. Every time a person poaches fish, he or she is stealing from you and me and from the people. Poaching threatens not only the careful, responsible management of our inland fisheries but also the important angling sector. Angling is a hugely important rural recreation activity with benefits for local people and local economies in terms of the substantial tourism that it generates. This legislation will give Inland Fisheries Ireland clear and direct powers to tackle the crime of poaching. We also must acknowledge the problems of pollution crime and pollution caused by industry, which results in damage to our river ecosystems and in fish kills. This legislation will help us with the careful and responsible management of our inland fisheries natural resource and the legislation will help protect this natural resource for the benefit of anglers, local businesses and communities across the country. This Bill is important because it impacts on IFI's ability to bring prosecutions and fully enforce the Inland Fisheries Acts. IFI needs these powers to effectively conserve and protect Ireland’s inland fisheries and sea-angling resource. My intention is that amendments to the 2010 Act will be in place well within the statutory period of the six-month timeframe for the initiation of proceedings following the date of alleged offences. This will ensure that anyone who commits an offence will still be liable to prosecution and it is intended that there should be no period during which offences can be committed with impunity. All current provisions and offences of the Inland Fisheries Acts continue in full force and effect. I am happy to commend the Bill to the House.

Fianna Fáil will be supporting this Bill. It is a critical and urgent amendment to confer explicit powers on Inland Fisheries Ireland to bring and prosecute summary proceedings for inland fisheries offences. As the Minister of State has indicated, the IFI is the main body with responsibility for protecting Ireland’s inland waterways - and up to 12 nautical miles off the coastline - and the fish that inhabit these areas from illegal poaching, overfishing and other illegal activities. The Minister of State is correct when he says that poaching is not a victimless crime. In some parts of the country it was almost a badge of honour for people to engage in the illicit poaching of fish. It has a detrimental impact on fish stocks. It also has a very negative impact on the fishing experience of many people who visit different parts of Ireland to pursue their leisure, and who return fish to their natural environment. The fishing sector is, in many cases, the only attraction for tourism into vast tracts of our State. I believe it is a sector that has been under-supported by successive Governments, as is evident from the length of time it has taken to bring such a Bill to the House. There are many locations dotted throughout the country that with a little bit of investment and support from the State - in conjunction with other State entities, be they local authorities or other significant landholders - could be made into very attractive locations from a fishing point of view.Fianna Fáil has put on record its position on developing the fishing sector. Our fishing policy paper highlights the need to appoint a Minister with full responsibility for fisheries and to place all responsibility for fisheries, including inland fisheries and marine leisure, in a single Department. This would ensure a uniformity of approach with a view to developing the sector more fully and proactively into the future. It would then have the capacity to develop as a business that could be marketed abroad in addition to meeting domestic demand. It could act as a very significant tourism attractor without a need for massive investment. Our policy paper also highlights the necessity to prioritise fisheries and marine resources, such as harvesting high quality indigenous marine species, seafood processing, bio-marine ingredients, seaweed production and marine renewables, as key contributors to national economic recovery, job creation and balanced regional growth. Also included in the policy paper is the need to promote sustainable fishing and aquaculture practices to achieve long-term security of fish stocks and to secure the incomes of fishermen and related sectors. It is well accepted that there is a need for sustainability. The policies Fianna Fáil would bring forward would certainly ensure that is the case. Those who are involved in leisure pursuits around fishing recognise the importance of ensuring that sustainable practices are in place. They want to see changes to the law enabling Inland Fisheries Ireland to prosecute those who would undermine and impact negatively on the area for domestic users and tourists alike. In east Clare, where there are significant resources by way of lakes and fish stocks, local angling groups have struggled to maintain fish stocks over time because of pollution in the first instance and, in more recent years, because of the level of poaching. They tell me more bailiffs are needed. It is one thing having the legislative capacity to make a prosecution, but it is also vitally important that there is an adequate level of detection, which requires people working on behalf of the State. There is also a necessity to look at our entire asset base in the development of the sector. For example, the Tulla and district anglers are having difficulty accessing a lake they fish regularly. They are having a battle with Coillte, which will not give them access although it allows other clubs and entities onto its lands. It is unsightly and unnecessary. We need to instil a recognition of the importance of our inland fisheries and their associated leisure and tourism pursuits in all our State agencies. There is a very significant tourism benefit to the area. If we allow the culture to deteriorate over the years, we will no longer have the ghillies and other people who provide the basis for the tourism sector. We do not want to see the practice dying out or being discouraged. Those who work in restorative justice programmes helping to rehabilitate young people who, for one reason or another, have lost their way and find themselves before the courts, have identified fishing as a practice which has helped young offenders to get back on the straight and narrow. It is a pursuit in which they have found great capacity to interact again and pursue a meaningful existence. There are so many benefits to inland fishing and they are not harnessed enough by the State. I welcome the Bill and recognise its importance. While it does not go as far as Fianna Fáil would like in terms of developing a policy, it begins to ensure that we can at least deal with overfishing and other activities that would damage stocks. It allows the IFI to pursue wrongdoers through the courts. While we support the Bill, we ask the Minister to take a more holistic approach to the sector and that he looks to develop policies from which legislative proposals would flow. Those policies should aim not just to protect what we have but to enhance and grow the sector across the entire space. All State entities should work together in a cohesive way to this end. The true potential of this sector has gone almost unrecognised. I propose to share the remainder of my time with my party colleagues.

It is crucially important. We can have all the laws and Bills in the world but we need the leverage to implement them. We have seen continued depletion of our lakes and rivers. We need to urgently address the situation as we are leaving IFI vulnerable to legal challenge simply for doing its job of protecting the inland waterways and the fish that inhabit them. I come from the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan. In Cavan, we are renowned for having 365 lakes. Some 30% of overseas visitors who come to Cavan do so solely for the purpose of angling, which brings a huge boost to the local economy. Both Cavan and Monaghan are very dependent on the tourism that comes from inland fisheries. We depend on IFI to ensure that our lakes and rivers are protected from poaching and pollution. That is why I am so happy to see the Bill coming before us today. Inland Fisheries Ireland inform me that in the upper Erne catchment, which runs through Clones towards Three Mile House, Ballybay and on to Lough Egish in County Monaghan before moving into Bruskey and Lough Gowna in County Cavan, there were five on-the-spot fines for breaking the law of conservation last year. One prosecution was secured in February 2017 in respect of a case from last year. I have also heard first hand from some of the angling clubs about the challenges they face in terms of funding, the poaching of their waters and the lack of membership. This area needs further investment and could be very much improved upon. Midlands counties like Cavan and Monaghan do not have beautiful coastlines to attract tourists and are very dependent on resources such as lakes and rivers. This area has not yet reached its full potential. Angling clubs across Cavan and Monaghan are to the forefront of pushing for angling among young people and those in the autumn years of their lives. That is to be welcomed and encouraged. In 2013 Inland Fisheries Ireland published a study of the socioeconomic importance of recreational angling. The study concluded that up to 406,000 individuals participated in recreational angling in 2012 and that there was a total expenditure of approximately €550 million. That is vast for a small island like ours. Given that we are an island nation, it is all the more important. These are significant sums of revenue and job numbers. The jobs are often placed in rural areas that need economic development and a boost. Inland Fisheries Ireland plays a major role in eliminating and addressing any environmental issues. Unfortunately, we have often had oil spillages and other environmentally unfriendly incidents. Of course the organisation plays a major role in all of that. However, without adequate powers, Inland Fisheries Ireland is completely unable to do its job effectively. Like my colleague, Deputy Dooley, I believe it is important to have a Minister with full responsibility for fisheries. We should place all responsibility for fisheries, including inland fisheries and marine leisure, in a single Department. It is important that we promote sustainable fishing and aquaculture practices to achieve long-term security for fishing stocks and incomes for fishermen and related sectors. I will conclude now because I want to give my colleagues an opportunity to speak. It is important. I am happy to support the Bill.
#JamesLawless	unknown-#JamesLawless-party	unknown-#JamesLawless-dob	unknown-#JamesLawless-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-13 00:00:00	European Council: Statements	257	I am happy to be able to contribute to the debate on the Inland Fisheries (Amendment) Bill. The objective of the Bill is technical as well as urgent in terms of enhancing the prosecution powers of Inland Fisheries Ireland in order that it can enforce legislation. There is a lacuna in the law that prevents the organisation from doing so at the moment. Therefore, the Bill is urgent and important and we fully support it. It is important that the organisation has the powers to carry out its functions. That is a key aspect of what it needs to be able to safeguard the stocks. It is important to take stock, in every sense, of where we are in terms of fisheries and inland fisheries in the wider sense. Stocks are under severe pressure not only in Ireland but throughout the world. Our focus is here. There are some things that we can control and some things we cannot control. In the case of those things we can control, it is important that we do so. I note that salmon stocks globally have fallen from a peak in the mid-1970s of tonnage of 12,500 to approximately 1,500 tonnes now. There has been a 90% decline in salmon catch internationally since the mid-1970s. In Ireland, the decline is not quite as bad but there has been a 75% decline in salmon stocks and catch. Salmon in the rivers is down 75% from the peak of the 1970s. Our sea trout are under increasing pressure. Our eel population has been decimated in the same period, although for somewhat different reasons. It is along the same vein. What can we control? Netting and poaching are addressed in the Bill with provision for prosecutions. Inland Fisheries Ireland needs every power available to do that. Sea lice and global warming are factors as well. We can contribute to the mitigation of these factors but they are not things we can directly control. It is important to realise those factors arise as well. The fisheries industry is important to Ireland. Often, we promote ourselves as a food hub or green island centred on food, tourism and everything we have to offer the visitor. Our visitors include local visitors and those who come from abroad. I believe up to 400,000 people are involved in recreational angling every year according to the most recent survey. Half of these people come from abroad. There is a major tourism uplift in that sense. An economic benefit of up to €555 million was noted in the most recent survey in respect of direct spending. The figure is up to €836 million in terms of the value to the economy from the spend on fishing and fishing-related activities. These effects are being felt in areas that are not seeing the benefits of wider economic activity. These are rural and less populated areas in the regions. Fianna Fáil is supportive of enhancing the economic opportunity and potential. I imagine the Government takes this view as well. It affects everything from guest houses to pubs, restaurant, cafes garages and other services. All of this increases visitors to these areas and gives a major lift. I want to leave time for my colleague, Deputy Murphy, who will wrap up on our side. Fisheries are a great national asset, as are the fish. Those responsible for fisheries need to be proactive about managing fish and protecting the resource. They need to support that resource and be proactive by encouraging, enhancing and safeguarding it for future generations, because we do not miss what we have until it is gone. Let us hope we do not end up there. I very much support the Bill and I look forward to working with future versions of it.

We all know there is a considerable problem throughout the country with poaching. This is something that we should acknowledge. Communities have approached us. On numerous occasions in the past two or three years communities have approached me and brought me to the banks of the River Shannon. In one case they showed me ten pike laid out and being gutted. All the waste was being thrown back into the river. I was told that the fish would be exported and sold as a delicacy in a certain country. I have the proof, as do many people. We are as well to be upfront and honest about it: this is going on. I hope this can be addressed by the Inland Fisheries (Amendment) Bill 2016. My colleagues on either side of me have spoken about the number of people involved in recreational fishing. The figure is extraordinary at in excess of 400,000. More extraordinary is that 250,000 of this number are our people. We are told the expenditure involved is €555 million. That is a lot of money and it has a serious income impact of €755 million. Recreational angling activity supports almost 10,000 jobs in the country. I have no doubt that this figure could be increased to 15,000. I think we need to get even more proactive. In one way I was surprised that there was not more about this at the launch of the new rural programme. I accept that more money is being invested and a programme is in place. However, many communities are deprived - the Minister of State knows this as well - and this could be a lifeline for them. Many lakes are inaccessible. Many lakes could be restocked. This is the second part of that jigsaw given that we know we have the facilities and lakes and rivers. My home town is Strokestown. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle knows this - he knows the county well. There are 65 lakes within a ten mile radius. It was the envy of much of the country for many years. Sadly, much of that has died away. One reason is that we have not put the facilities in place. We have not developed enough lakes. The River Shannon runs from one side of Roscommon to the other, as the Minister of State is well aware. We have major opportunities there. I am keen to see a more hands-on and proactive approach. I want to see more involvement with communities. We need to consider all the other leisure activities that we can build around lakes and rivers, including picnic areas and walks. Much could be done from a tourism aspect to create considerable revenue for the State and create jobs in communities. That is something I would like to see developed further. I realise my time is up. Perhaps we will have a greater debate on this in time to come.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-13 00:00:00	European Council: Statements	259	I am sharing time with Deputy Martin Ferris. I will not need 20 minutes. I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. I know that we have been around the reasons for it. The purpose is to correct the flaws in the 2010 Act. It is important that our inland waterways, lakes and canals are protected and that the fish stocks in them are protected too. This is important for fishermen and the local angling clubs that do great work. It is important for tourism that we have a good system of enforcement in place. I welcome the fact that we got a good briefing on the matter from the officials in the Department. That was very helpful. A good deal of damage is done by illegal fishing. This includes wilful damage, flouting the law and flouting regulations. It causes many problems by destroying fish stock in inland waterways and canals.In my constituency, we want to try to ensure that the waterways of the Barrow and the Nore and their tributaries, such as the River Erkina and the River Goul, as well as the canal from Monasterevin to Vicarstown, are maintained. There is a huge amount of voluntary work being done right throughout the State by local angling clubs. They do a great deal of work maintaining rivers, streams and canals, stocking the waterways, ensuring that they are being maintained, protecting the native fish stocks and restocking brown trout, etc. They work with Inland Fisheries Ireland, local communities and local councils in that regard. What they are doing voluntarily plays a huge part in protecting the rivers, waterways and the environment, in improving the facilities for access to fishing and in providing a valuable recreational facility. There is also the financial benefit of tourism. While the State is tapping into that, I am of the view that a great deal more can be done. There is major potential there. I have seen figures over the years which indicated that one salmon caught is worth so much to the local economy. The figures are huge. They may be a little exaggerated but the amounts involved certainly run into hundreds of euro in terms of the benefit to local economies through bed and breakfast establishments, hotels, pubs, shops, car hire and everything else. That needs to be taken into account. It is important that Inland Fisheries Ireland continues to work with local clubs to develop that even more. Local councils have a key role to play as well, particularly in light of the demise of the drainage boards. The drainage board for the River Nore has been gone for a long time, as has that relating to the River Barrow. That is unfortunate but it is something that may be a bit of an add-on to the local councils. The matter needs to be given closer attention. The role of local authorities is important in circumstances where they have taken the place of the old drainage boards. It is very important that there is close co-operation with the officials from Inland Fisheries Ireland and that they have people out on the ground building up and maintaining good relations with the fishing clubs. We can pass whatever laws we want in this House but if they are not enforced or are unenforceable, they have no effect. Those networks and roots in each area are very important. The final matter I want to mention is the related ban on eel fishing since 2010. I understand that approximately 150 people are affected by it. These are individuals who were making genuine livelihoods from eel fishing. If this happened in any other area of employment - such as, in the context of agriculture, a ban being placed on sheep farming - there would be a compensation package or a hardship fund provided straight away. I ask the Minister to comment on this matter. I raise it today, although I know I have mentioned it to him in the past. What stage is that at? What is the likelihood of that happening? Is there any provision being made for it or what is the likelihood of it for those people whose businesses genuinely ended? Many of them are at an age and living in an area in which it is not easy for them to access alternative employment. I would appreciate a response from the Minister. What stage is it at and what hope is there for it? I know that Deputy Ferris wants to raise a particular issue as well. Overall, we welcome this Bill and will support it. We look forward to it progressing through the House and being on the Statute Book. The most important thing is that we do this with local communities, fishing clubs and anglers. We must not lose sight of that. It is like the Garda Síochána, in respect of which there has been a lot of discussion. It needs the local community on its side. If there is a separation between officialdom and the people on the ground, nothing happens and it will not work. We want to try to encourage that local co-operation.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-13 00:00:00	European Council: Statements	260	Like my colleague, Deputy Stanley, I am very supportive of the Bill. We will facilitate its passage through the House without any difficulties. Effectively, the Bill does little more than give actual powers of prosecution to Inland Fisheries Ireland. It puts the onus of responsibility on the latter to ensure that our rivers are properly policed, to protect the environment of those rivers and, I hope, to ensure that rivers in decline are facilitated and restocked through hatcheries and so forth. I was a member of the agriculture, marine and fisheries committee when the drift net offshore salmon fishermen were taken off the seas. At that time, I argued strongly against the move. I still believe that it was a retrograde step. They became the victims of an agenda to place all of the blame on drift net fishermen. My understanding since is that, despite counters on the rivers and so forth, the stocks have not increased. Obviously, the problem was elsewhere but nobody was prepared to face up to it. Instead, the easy victims were the fishermen and fisherwomen. However, that is for the past. Obviously, those in coastal communities paid a huge price and suffered a loss of income. I fully appreciate and understand the tremendous contribution to our economy of a very vibrant tourist angling sector. That goes without saying. The value of fish caught in rivers and put back has a huge impact on many parts of rural Ireland, particularly on the west and not least in Donegal. I had the opportunity of being in Donegal on the day after Mr. Martin McGuinness's funeral. I travelled all over the county and met local fishermen. I also with angling groups in Killybegs - people from the Rosses and Fintown angling clubs who fish the Gweebarra River. What I find very disturbing is that a case involving three of their members - John Boyle, Peadar Ó Baoill and John Boyle Reilly - has been before the High Court for some time. I am sure the Minister of State is as well acquainted with that situation as I am. There is support, I imagine, right across the divide in the House for giving Inland Fisheries Ireland legal powers to police and look after the rivers. However, pursuing this case certainly makes no sense if Inland Fisheries Ireland wants to build confidence and support in areas in which this is happening. These cases are sending out the wrong message. For many, it amounts to a form of bullying by Inland Fisheries Ireland. We also have to take into account the huge financial burden on the families of these three fishermen, as well as the emotional effects it has on their families and wider families. It would be a very good statement on the part of Inland Fisheries Ireland if these cases were not proceeded with. My understanding is that they will have no legal standing because we are only now giving powers of legal standing to Inland Fisheries Ireland There needs to be huge investment in the sector in order to restock the rivers. There is also a need to ensure that they are restocked in such a way that they will become increasingly vibrant for our tourism economy, as well as from a recreational point of view for Irish anglers and so forth. Therefore, the Minister of State has our support on this. I would like to see the cases of the three Donegal men currently before the courts dispensed with in order to facilitate a good environment going forward. We support the passage of the Bill through the House.

The Government had the ability to spend €400 million from the sale of Bord Gáis on housing and it was not able to spend it. I want to know why.
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-13 00:00:00	European Council: Statements	263	In the context of planning for the use of the proceeds arising from the State assets disposal programme, which included the sale of Bord Gáis Energy, my Department consulted with the Central Statistics Office, via the Department of Finance, in regard to the statistical treatment of the proceeds and their impact on the general Government balance. My Department did not have direct discussions or correspondence with EUROSTAT on the issue as it was a matter for the Department of Finance. The position in this regard is that, under EUROSTAT rules, the amount of any dividends received from a State company, including proceeds from asset disposals, which can improve the general Government balance is limited by reference to the entrepreneurial income of the relevant company in the previous year. In order to comply with the fiscal rules of the Stability and Growth Pact, the scope for the Government to use such dividends for additional expenditure on a general Government balance-neutral basis is limited to the amount by which the dividends paid actually improve the general Government balance. This has meant that in order to take maximum advantage of the asset disposal proceeds, they cannot all be availed of at once but must be remitted to the Exchequer over a number of years. It is for this reason that Ervia has, to date, remitted €350 million to the State by way of special dividend since the sale of Bord Gáis Energy was completed, that is, €150 million in 2014, €100 million in 2015 and €100 million in 2016. A further special dividend of €100 million is expected in this year. It is proposed that the remainder of the proceeds will be paid to the Government on a phased basis, as required by Government, and in a manner that is consistent with protecting Ervia's investment grade credit rating while also maximising the general Government balance impact of the payments.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-13 00:00:00	European Council: Statements	264	What I am trying to get a sense of is where this money is being spent. In budget 2015 the then Government announced that €400 million of the proceeds of the sale of Bord Gáis Energy was to be made available to establish an off-balance sheet financial vehicle to provide financing to approved housing bodies. In the words of the Minister, Deputy Coveney, "However, despite a high level of engagement with a wide range of potential providers and financiers of social housing, no new model of provision and-or financing of social housing on an off-balance sheet basis could be identified." That included consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, as per the Minister, Deputy Coveney's answer. The Government had €400 million on the table and despite all the best brains of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Finance and the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, and despite all the spin about the Government commitment to housing, the Government could not spend it, although there are people on our streets and children in emergency accommodation. What is this money being spent on? The Minister referred to all the money the Government is getting back from Ervia. What precisely is it being spent on and can people see where the disposal of State assets is going?
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-13 00:00:00	European Council: Statements	265	The broad answer to that question is that, over the last number of years, €1.5 billion has been received by the State that is the proceeds of State assets and the disposal of State assets. It has been used at different points. For example, in June 2013, €150 million was made available for investment in schools and roads projects. An amount of those disposal gains has been ring-fenced for the national children's hospital. A further €200 million was allocated in May 2014 for investment in a range of capital projects across the country. In regard to what has happened to the €400 million that has accrued from the sale of Bord Gáis Energy, that funding is available to Government but we have to use it in a way that is consistent with EUROSTAT rules, which we are working to do. More broadly, what we have been able to do is allocate over €5 billion to public housing in a conventional manner from the Exchequer to respond to the exact need the Deputy has identified.

What is actually being spent on housing of the money from Bord Gáis Energy is €10 million per annum. To spend €10 million is very different from spending €400 million and it exposes the spin of this Government in regard to housing. The money was there - the cash was on the table - yet the Government could not work out how to spend it. At the same time, Ministers can go around quoting examples from other EU countries which are spending money on housing in a way that is consistent with the EUROSTAT rules. What is going to happen in regard to AIB? If AIB is sold, what will happen following the disposal of that asset and where will that money go? What is the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform doing to ensure this Bord Gáis Energy money actually gets spent on housing?

I look at the progress being made in Dominick Street where a public housing project, long heralded and much needed, is now going ahead. I look at O'Devaney Gardens, a project that, when it collapsed over ten years ago, was emblematic of the beginning of the collapse of our economy. Later this year we will see the sod turned for the first phase of that project. With regard to Deputy Calleary's concluding point on the prospects for AIB, as he will be aware, and I have answered questions on this in the House before and am happy to do so again, under the EU rules that gain will be a redefinition of an asset on the balance sheet, so it will go from being a share that the Exchequer holds to being a value that we receive via a payment which we are required to use to reduce the value of our debt.

The question asks the Minister to inform the House of the guidelines which are issued by his Department relating to decisions regarding commercial sensitivity and the methods his Department uses to balance the public need to know with the need for commercial sensitivity.
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-13 00:00:00	European Council: Statements	271	Section 36 of the Freedom of Information Act 2014 sets out an exemption provision under which an FOI request can be refused where the requested information includes commercially sensitive information of a third party. This provision requires that decision makers should consider, before reaching a final determination, whether "the public interest would, on balance, be better served by granting than by refusing to grant the FOI request". The Deputy may also wish to have regard to section 35 of the 2014 Act, which provides for an exemption from release where information has been provided in confidence to an FOI body by a third party. This exemption is often of relevance where commercial arrangements exist between public bodies and third parties and is again subject to a public interest test. These exemption provisions were designed to protect the legitimate interests of third parties, in particular commercial interests, without placing a disproportionate restriction on the right of access to information.The FOI central policy unit in my Department provides advice and guidance for FOI bodies and the general public on the appropriate procedures for processing requests. The unit has published a number of guidance notes and manuals. Of particular relevance are FOI central policy unit notice No. 4 relating to information obtained in confidence by an FOI body, notice No. 5 relating to FOI and public procurement, notice No. 8 relating to third party consultation and manual Part 2, chapter 10, on commercially sensitive information. All of these notes and parts of manuals are available on my Department's website. Ultimately, it is the role of the Information Commissioner and the courts to reach authoritative determinations on the interpretation of the Freedom of Information Act 2014.

The problem is that while the theory of commercial sensitivity is to strike a balance between the public's need to know and private commercial objectives, it is not always achieved in practice. In fact, we do not have that balance. An example in the Minister's area, on which I have been doing some work in the Committee on Budget Scrutiny and the Committee of Public Accounts, concerns public private partnerships. Under the public spending code issued by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, it is the responsibility of the project sponsor to ensure post-project reviews take place. Very often, they do not. When they do, we cannot get access to them. They are not made public because we are told there are commercial sensitivities. In reality, that is not good practice because we need to be able to evaluate properly whether there was good value for money and whether the taxpayer got good value for money. The problem is that, at times, commercial sensitivity is actually used as a cloak or excuse to prevent proper scrutiny and the development of policy.

I was a member of the Committee of Public Accounts for a number of years. The issue in regard to the qualification of public private partnerships and the difficulty in getting information on them is one with which I am familiar. The reason, as I have alluded to, has two elements. The first is that where a semi-State commercial body which is subject to FOI legislation, as the Deputy knows, is competing with a private body which is not subject to it, the former can be at a competitive disadvantage. That is because there is a higher degree of disclosure. That is the reason for the caveat. Let me consider the second caveat. Given that it is the State that is initiating public private partnerships, in order for it to be able to get best value, it can be and is of help to it to make sure the terms on which we conclude agreements are not available to competitors or other companies with which we might have to deal. If the Deputy has a specific project or group of projects in mind, as I am sure he does, I will be happy to respond to him if he mentions them.

It was based on a genuine desire to ensure we had proper scrutiny, not only in having a look-back but also in the planning of public private partnerships. The arrangement has been used as an excuse at times not to allow us to get under the bonnet of some of the public private partnerships that have taken place. That is unfortunate because the more information we have, the more scrutiny we have. The more we evaluate projects such as this, the better it is for all of us. It was in that vein that the questions were put. I have no difficulty in corresponding with the Minister on any of these issues.

When I was commenting on the initial formulation of metro north many years ago, I raised similar points, stating it was very difficult to understand some aspects of the then project because every time one tried to gain access to some information, one was told it was commercially sensitive, to the extent that, at one point, it was actually difficult to ascertain how much the project was going to cost. I am very eager to ensure that, where possible, all information for which Deputies are looking will be made available under the FOI legislation. I spoke on this point at a conference recently. I pointed to the breadth of organisations that were subject to FOI legislation and the support we had for the office of the commissioner in making adjudications on the matter. There is a balance sought in making these decisions. It is a balance that, when maintained, is in the commercial interests of the State.

In line with this commitment, the Government agreed in principle in July last year to establish an independent advisory body to examine public service remuneration. This is always a complex matter involving, as it does, the State as employer, public service employees and, most important in many cases, the interests and needs of the public who support the funding of public services through taxation. The terms of reference of the commission were finalised after an open consultation process. This work is well under way. While the terms of reference provided that the commission would be advisory in nature, we asked for a report initially in quarter 2 of this year. With regard to the work the commission is doing, for its initial report it was asked to provide inputs on how the unwinding of the financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation should proceed, having regard to the evolution of pay trends; a comparison of pay rates; international rates, where possible; and the state of the national finances. In line with its current mandate, the commission will have regard to the national finances. I also understand it has received submissions from a range of interested parties on various aspects of public service employment, including the issue of new entrants which the Deputy and his party have raised on a number of occasions. The Government will continue to maintain the ability to negotiate directly with employees on pay. The commission's role will be to provide evidence that can provide a framework for the analysis of pay matters to provide the foundation for the approaching discussions. In answer to the Deputy's point, we did ask the commission to report in quarter 2, which means April, May or June. I understand the work is proceeding and that the commission will meet that deadline.

I am trying to get a sense of the timing. Does the Minister expect to receive the report early in quarter 2? Does he have any sense of the month in which it can be expected based on the engagement of his officials? We have to have the public service pay talks completed ahead of the budget. Does the Minister envisage them taking place throughout the summer? On new entrants, as the Minister knows, teachers will gather next week across the island for their various conferences. What message can we, as public representatives, give to new entrant teachers or new entrants in any grade of the public service or Civil Service on their status? I know that inputs have been made and that we have been strong on this issue. Will the new entrants' role be reflected in the Public Service Pay Commission's report and the talks to come?

Therefore, I do not expect the report to be issued towards the end of quarter 2. The discussions will be very difficult, as will all of the proceedings for the next year. The Deputy has made reference to where we stand from a resource point of view for next year. The answer is that, once the commitments the Government has made on increased levels of social welfare and funding our tax reform plans for next year are honoured, the net amount of currently unallocated resources, assuming current rates of growth continue, is around €500 million.That is a significant amount of money, but given the competing demands for additional spending, additional services and additional changes in our tax structure, it is an amount of money on which careful choices will have to be made. In answer to Deputy Calleary's direct point on new entrants, as the Deputy will be aware, progress was made in dealing with this area under the Haddington Road agreement where changes were made there. We will look to make the particular changes in that area as part of an agreement with the INTO and TUI.

The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, has just told the Committee on Budgetary Oversight of which I am a member that he will not be in a position to look at that properly and publish a figure until June but that he may be in a position to "modestly" increase it if these growth figures continue. Has the Minister any thoughts on this?

That will be purely a determination for Deputy Noonan's Department. In terms of any likely change, Deputy Calleary is correct to state that the growth figures for this year are higher than anticipated. We saw growth last year of approximately 5%. We should see growth this year of approximately 4.5% and we are expecting a growth rate next year of 3% to 3.5%. The key factor in it all, as the Deputy will be aware, is that as we are currently participating in the excessive deficit procedure of exiting from a bailout programme and under the fiscal rules, we must deliver the medium-term objective of having a balanced budget next year. When we deliver that, the position then changes significantly for subsequent years and that is the key factor in terms of the availability of resources for next year. I emphasise that those resources will be very scarce against the array of demands placed against them.

The unit oversees Brexit work across the Department and acts as the contact point with the Department of the Taoiseach and other Departments. It is represented on the interdepartmental group on Brexit and related groups, and supports me in my work as a member of the Cabinet Committee on Brexit. Brexit issues are also addressed by staff in relevant areas across the Department. Clearly, Brexit will pose significant challenges right across the economy. The Government is committed to addressing these challenges, to mitigating the impacts and to maximising the available opportunities. In the short term, the Minister for Finance and I were able to deliver a budget for 2017 setting out our approach to Brexit and to building a national response. For the third year in succession, it has been possible to increase resources for public services and infrastructure. Expenditure for this year will be €58.1 billion, an increase of 3% on a year ago. Resources have been allocated towards areas that may be significantly impacted by Brexit, in particular, enterprises dealing with the impact of Brexit and our regional and rural communities. In the longer term, the design of this year's spending review reflects the changed economic and fiscal context, including Brexit. Of course, while moderate and sustainable expenditure growth is planned over the medium term, increasing and competing public service demands will make the management of this expenditure challenging. The capital plan sets out a €42 billion framework to meet our needs. We have a review of the plan under way at present that we aim to conclude in the second half of the year. My Department is also responsible for EU funding programmes, such as INTERREG and PEACE. We have made progress on finalising their deployment up to 2020 and aim to deliver successor models for the period after that through our negotiation with the European Union.

Today, reports from the head of Dairygold suggest that, unless the EU plans to combat customs tariffs at the Border, rural Ireland will be devastated. We make similar statements about post offices and in many areas, and it is so, but this will be a further blow. A hard Border at the North crossing points cannot happen. The European banking sector is in deep need of reform. That has not happened. Is the ECB still clinging onto the old model that has failed? I am concerned that we may not have the right personnel with the vision and the enthusiasm to fight hard enough to ensure that we are not severely affected.

To back up that assertion, I point to the fact that our national interest in the Border in relation to the movement of people has now been recognised in the draft negotiation mandate that has been provided by the European Council and has also been recognised in a mandate that was drafted by the European Parliament. Not only the needs, in particular, of Border communities which the Deputy referred to, but the broader imperative of ensuring we do not return to a hard Border are recognised and laid out in each of those mandates. The negotiation letter that was issued from the British Prime Minister, Mrs. May, also made reference to these issues and the value of the relationship with Ireland. That did not happen by magic. It happened by persistent and hard work from the individuals whom the Deputy is understandably raising with me here today. We have much work to do - we have years of effort in relation to this - but those interests have been clearly recognised.

The proof of the pudding will be in the eating. I represent County Tipperary, a proud but rural county. We have issues right across the sectors, from beef to lamb, pork, corn, mushrooms and many other areas all of which involve exports, and dairy produce as well where Dairygold is concerned, and we have a lot of foreign direct investment as well. We want to protect it for all of the country's sake. I want to see tangible proof that we are stepping up to the plate and that we are engaging robustly with a Europe where we have been the good boys of the class. We have been an exceptionally proud and engaging member state and now the belief in many circles - the latest today from Dairygold and other co-ops - is that we are not robust enough in our battle to ensure that we will not be fatally wounded rather than damaged in our export markets, especially on the Border issue. We cannot see a hard Border across the Six Counties at the crossings we are used to, in Aughnacloy, in South Armagh and all the places, such as Pettigo. We must maintain our trade and no barriers. We were delighted to get rid of them because they caused considerable problems, including smuggling. The proof of the pudding will be in the eating, and I hope it is.

That Single Market and the support that those companies have received from Irish agencies has been crucial in allowing companies to grow and to the significant development that has taken place in the country over the past 40 to 50 years. The Deputy makes the point in relation to the Border. I repeat the point I made to him a moment ago. That Border, the risks of the Border, the needs of the common travel area and freedom of movement of people have been recognised in the negotiation mandates that have issued from the European Union. In particular, Mr. Michel Barnier, who will be the lead negotiator on behalf of the Commission and the broader European Union, has stated that he wants these issues in relation to Ireland dealt with in the first module of the negotiations that will be taking place.That is happening because of the work of the Irish Government and our ambassadors. Alongside this, the Minister of State, Deputy Murphy, is leading Government efforts to attract new foreign direct investment to Ireland in sectors such as financial services and put in a bid to host important European agencies here in Ireland, as indeed is the Minister, Deputy Harris.
#CatherineMartin	unknown-#CatherineMartin-party	unknown-#CatherineMartin-dob	unknown-#CatherineMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-13 00:00:00	European Council: Statements	290	This question relates to the capital plan 2016-21 and its use of the word "sustainability". It is often the case that despite the prolific use of the word "sustainability" throughout the document and particularly in the fiscal and policy context section, it seems to primarily and solely incorporate what could be termed fiscal sustainability rather than a wider definition which might include concepts such as environmental sustainability. Will the Minister outline for the House what role he believes environmental sustainability plays in the provision of capital expenditure as an underlying base concept and not just a discrete section of the capital plan?
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-13 00:00:00	European Council: Statements	291	The fiscal and policy context section of the capital plan, Building on Recovery, sets out the objectives of State investment in infrastructure. It emphasises the Government's commitment, through the capital plan, of supporting strong and sustainable economic growth and raising welfare and living standards for all. Promoting environmental sustainability is, of course, integral to achieving and maintaining sustainable economic growth. The incorporation of environmental sustainability as a key encompassing policy goal in the capital plan is demonstrated throughout the plan document and through progress made in the implementation of key elements of the plan itself, as well as through other important policy and legislative developments focused on environmental sustainability. It is important to stress, however, that there is a detailed governance framework already embedded in the allocation of capital resources through which significant investment decisions must be aligned with all Government policy, including environmental policy. For example, when the plan sets out the budget management framework, it explicitly states that all Departments are responsible for ensuring projects meet appropriate regulatory requirements, including environmental impact assessments. In addition, when outlining the drivers of long-term public investment requirements, the plan highlights environmental concerns such as developments in climate change and the need to meet EU emissions targets that require intervention in the areas of energy efficiency and renewable energy, as well as the need for investments in flood protection. Moreover, the area of environment and climate is allocated 7% of available capital resources in the plan, which amounts to €870 million over the course of the plan.
#CatherineMartin	unknown-#CatherineMartin-party	unknown-#CatherineMartin-dob	unknown-#CatherineMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-13 00:00:00	European Council: Statements	292	While I appreciate that the capital plan features a number of measures to tackle climate change and deal with environmental sustainability, regrettably, environment is still considered a "selected driver" of long-term public investment requirements. The importance of climate change within the Government's capital plan is currently considered as only requiring intervention in respect of energy efficiency, renewable energy and flood prevention, despite the fact that both the Climate Change Advisory Council set up under the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 and the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, have advised that what is needed is "a major societal and economic transformation". The Environmental Protection Agency today delivered the catastrophic news that we will fail to meet our 20% cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 and that we are completely off target for our low-carbon transition by 2050 set out in the climate change Act. While this is first and foremost an environmental disaster, it also has the potential to be an economic one which would have a major impact on our fiscal sustainability. How is the Minister's Department preparing for the possibility of up to more than €5 billion in fines if we do not hit our emissions targets, a possibility which seems all the more real after today's news? Failure to meet these targets will have a serious impact on the economy and must be accounted for in the public purse. Where will the Minister find this money?
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-13 00:00:00	European Council: Statements	293	I am making clear in all the engagement I have with other Government Departments that a vital consideration in any decisions we make is the contribution that public investment can make towards delivering our climate objectives. I have referred to this in the criteria that have been published to other Departments that indicate the way in which we will evaluate their proposals, and I continue to make this point in Cabinet sub-committees and Cabinet itself. This will be a very important element in decisions we make and is one of the reasons I believe investment in public transport, for example, is so important. Unless we provide fast, high-capacity public transport investment, the challenge the Deputy has described, with which I agree, will not be met by Ireland and our challenges will be even bigger. The kinds of considerations to which she refers form a very big part of how we will analyse any proposals to spend additional funding in the country in capital areas.
#CatherineMartin	unknown-#CatherineMartin-party	unknown-#CatherineMartin-dob	unknown-#CatherineMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-13 00:00:00	European Council: Statements	294	With respect, the report today from the EPA would suggest there is a huge gulf between the Government's words and the Government's action when it comes to climate change. It appears to me that the Government has reached a crossroads. It can accept the fact that, without a major turnaround in policy, we will not meet our emissions targets, which needless to say, for the sake of our children and grandchildren, is a road which should never be travelled, but in which case, for prudent fiscal responsibility and sustainability, the Minister's Department needs to provide a comprehensive plan as to how he will account for the money for significant fines imposed on the State for not meeting these targets. Alternatively, the Government needs a paradigm shift in how it thinks about sustainability. Environmental sustainability must not be confined only to the Department of the Minister, Deputy Naughten. Our public expenditure needs to be on sustainable infrastructure, for example, on the six cycleways proposed for Dublin instead of 1,500 km of roads, as IBEC has proposed. We are on a continuous upward trajectory on emissions, when we really need to be going in the opposite direction. Which will it be? Will we hit our targets or will we not? Does the Minister have an expenditure plan for either scenario?
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-13 00:00:00	European Council: Statements	295	I hope the considerations the Deputy has outlined, which I agree with, will be maintained across the coming period when many demands will be placed upon the Government for expenditure in different areas. As I referred to earlier when answering questions from Deputy Calleary, if one considers where we will be next year, while we do have resources available to make new investment choices, there are a huge number of demands in that regard. We face demands regarding the future development of our public pay bill, the position of taxation in our country and investment in education, which the Deputy correctly raised. The need to invest in our environment is another of those demands and it is one I want to meet. It is not just the prerogative of the Green Party to make sure we have an environment in the future that is good, safe and clean for those who will come after us, but also it is an agenda to which I am also committed. We have put support in place for that through prudent programmes such as the renewable heat initiative, incentives for the use of electric cars and investment in public transport. These are the kinds of choices with which I want to continue in the coming years.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-13 00:00:00	European Council: Statements	296	The Minister may recall that last Autumn, at a meeting of the Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, I outlined to him the absolute need in the review of the capital plan to take particular cognisance of the needs of the Border region as we face Brexit. There has been for historical reasons an underinvestment in infrastructure, particularly the road network, over the years in the central Border area. If we are to maintain employment and hopefully be able to grow employment, we need to ensure that out indigenous industries - by and large, our industry is indigenous - can remain as competitive as possible and maintain jobs.
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-13 00:00:00	European Council: Statements	297	I thank Deputy Smith for raising this matter. I remember very clearly the way in which he raised it at the Good Friday Agreement implementation committee where we had a discussion on it. Regarding our present position, in the capital plan, which Deputy Martin raised with me just a moment ago, we have laid out very clearly that a factor in decisions we will make is the effect that Brexit will have on our country and, within all that, what the regional consequences of Brexit will be. I am well aware of the issues to which the Deputy has referred. I am well aware that the communities to which he refers will feel the brunt of any disruption that may occur as a result of Brexit.In the capital investment choices we will make in the coming years I am determined to do what I can to offer support through capital investment and other funding choices to ensure the issues to which the Deputy refers are addressed. The situation will be very challenging and demanding. The issues relating to the nature of a border and the need to make sure we do not return to a hard border have been well recognised in the various texts that have been issued by the European Council, the European Parliament and Prime Minister May, all of which is being driven by the Government's recognition of the scale of the challenge the country faces, in particular the Border counties and communities.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-13 00:00:00	European Council: Statements	298	I thank the Minister for his reply, which again reflects the debate we had at the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. I welcome the fact that the Minister will have an additional €2.65 billion available for capital expenditure following the review of the current plan, which ends in 2021. I hope a clear message will go from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to the line Departments that the needs of the Border region must be reprioritised. The Minister is well aware from his colleagues, listening to debates in this House, and engagement both North and South of the Border, that there is significant fear in the Border region due to the uncertainty affecting business there. We must be able to send out the message that the Government will act, and that within the competences available to it, it will make decisions and prioritise the needs of the Border region. We are one of 27 member states negotiating with the British side on the terms of the EU-British agreement following Brexit. There are decisions the Government alone will make. The Minister and his colleagues in government will make the decisions on where capital expenditure goes. For historical reasons, due to the Troubles that maimed our country for so long, there was not investment in our area. Thankfully, since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 there has been a remarkable transformation but we are still some way behind in terms of the infrastructure we need. I again welcome the fact the Minister will have additional money available to him. I accept he faces huge challenges and plenty of demands but it is important to send a good message to the Border region, both North and South, about a reprioritisation of the capital funds that are available to him for the current plan and also in planning for post-2021.
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-13 00:00:00	European Council: Statements	299	It is a recognition of that fact and the points the Deputy has raised that drove my Department to move to deal with the maintenance of PEACE and INTERREG funding on the day following the Brexit referendum. I have discussed that with the Deputy previously. We know that funding plays a vital role in supporting projects in his community, and on both sides of the Border, that have contributed to the economic progress to which he refers, and also the social and political stability, especially in the North. We moved to address that. As the Deputy is aware, funding is now in place up to 2020. I recall that Deputy Brendan Smith made the point to me that 2020 can come very quickly. We are already working with other countries that participate in the INTERREG and PEACE funding and I will respond to a question on the issue later this afternoon. We are beginning to work to get a replacement for those funding streams. Deputy Smith recognised the competing demands on me. I will do what I can with the resources available to me to give a very high level of priority to the regional dimension of the consequences of Brexit because I well understand the issue the Deputy raised.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-13 00:00:00	European Council: Statements	300	I thank the Minister. As he is aware, unfortunately, we do not have a rail network in the south of Ulster. Our industry is predominantly indigenous and composed of agrifood and construction products. Those sectors of the economy are more dependent on the sterling export area than any other sector in this country. The Border region is more heavily dependent on indigenous industry, which is also more heavily dependent on the sterling area for the export of products. In order to assist enterprises in agrifood, construction and other sectors that have built up good businesses through very difficult times we must try to ensure that we assist those companies to remain competitive. The fluctuation in sterling, Brexit, tariffs and border controls will add to the costs for companies and in order to assist them to maintain their current employment levels, which they built up in very difficult circumstances, the Government must give a clear message by investing in particular projects in the entire Border region. The area I am concerned about is the counties of Cavan and Monaghan. I bring to the attention of the Minister that the road network there needs upgrading.
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-13 00:00:00	European Council: Statements	301	I take the Deputy’s point. I am aware that the level of support that is needed is multifaceted. Deputy Smith referred to the impact of currency change. We know that is already having an impact on the competitiveness of Irish exports, in particular in the food sector. My view is that the bigger impact to be faced will be the nature of the negotiations that will take place on the trading relationship with the UK when it is no longer a member of the Single Market. It is only as those discussions take shape that it will be clear to us what kind of intervention we need to put in place, if any, but I believe support will be needed for Irish companies that seek to sell goods, in particular food, into the UK. In response to the Deputy's point about roads, I have done my best to recognise the point by stating that in the criteria we have laid out for deciding where resources will go, we make specific reference to the regional consequences of Brexit. While I accept there are so many demands on the money and Deputy after Deputy raises different points each day – I do not refer to Deputy Brendan Smith – about where the funding should go – we have to try to make the wisest choices we can, which I will do my best to do, and I look forward to the support of the Deputy in doing that, if he can give it.

I wonder what has happened in the intervening time to deal with the critically dangerous and worrying situation of coastal erosion in the area. When we raised the issue previously we heard that on the one hand Fingal County Council was given money and it is up to it to apply for funding but on the other hand Fingal County Council has said it is not in a position to do anything. How can the heads be brought together in order to address the issue?

The council must assess the problem and, if it is considered that specific measures and works are required, it is open to the council to apply for funding under the Office of Public Works, OPW, minor flood mitigation works and coastal protection scheme. Any application received will be assessed under the eligibility criteria, which include a requirement that any measures are cost beneficial, and having regard to the overall availability of funding. Fingal County Council applied for and was approved funding of €57,800 under this scheme in 2012 to carry out a coastal erosion risk management study of Portrane to Rush. The funding was drawn down in 2013 following completion of the study. Following the severe storms of winter 2013 to 2014 and on foot of submissions made by the local authority, total funding of €200,000 was provided by the OPW to Fingal County Council under the Government decision S180/20/10/1272 of 11 February 2014 to allocate funding for the repair of damaged coastal protection infrastructure. Part of this funding was for a dunes repair project at Burrow beach, Portrane. This project was not proceeded with by Fingal County Council at the time and the council indicated that this would form part of a separate application under the minor works scheme. The Minister of State, Deputy Canney, visited Portrane on 21 February 2017 to view himself the effects of coastal erosion in the area. He met with local Deputies, local representatives, residents and property owners and he was impressed by the level of engagement locally and with the council officials in exploring options to address the problem. He knows that Fingal County Council is working hard to identify an appropriate and sustainable solution to the problem at Portrane in advance of submitting an application to the OPW for funding to carry out works. The Minister of State has been advised that his office is not currently in receipt of any application from Fingal County Council under the minor flood mitigation works and coastal protection scheme for dune protection works at Portrane. His office remains available to work in partnership with Fingal County Council to provide any assistance possible to alleviate the effects of coastal erosion at this location.

The reply seems to be very similar to the one we got in the previous round of Question Time, which also followed the visit of the Minister of State. I am conscious that he will be replaced by another Minister of State in a week or two when the ministerial rota shifts, and he will be the third Minister who has visited Portrane.In 2012, another Minister came out there and said the same thing. The problem is that in the intervening period the damage that has been done to the dunes and the threat to people's homes is becoming critical. I acknowledge that the local authority is being given responsibility for this matter. I also recognise that moneys have been made available, but that funding has not been utilised. I have not seen any evidence of a sufficiently quick, urgent or efficient response to what is a dire necessity. It is all right for a Minister - I know the Minister of State is just standing in - to say that he is working in partnership with the council, but it is not working. Can somebody deal with this situation urgently, so that we can get some works done on the ground there?

I was in the House on a previous occasion when it was debated with the Deputy and the Minister of State, Deputy Canny. Of course there is a need for urgency, but we must ensure that the right coastal and flood protection work is carried out. The correct process must be followed in this regard. Fingal County Council has to identify the appropriate sustainable and viable solution for the problems at Portrane. Once that has been done they can apply for OPW funding. If the funding is approved it is then a matter for the council to progress the necessary works. The solution that has been proposed in the risk management report, however, may not be the best one, or environmentally sustainable. The council is currently examining that matter but once it has made an application, the OPW will not be remiss in playing its part in this process to ensure that the protection works can take place at the appropriate time.

In works like this the indirect impact on the environment has to be considered, as well as other consequences and knock-on effects. That cannot outweigh the direct impact on people's lives and homes, however. They are literally hanging onto a cliff edge there. Do we have to see a house collapse before something is done? I accept that the local authority has a statutory responsibility, but it has not delivered on that. The Minister's Department should sit down and say listen lads, we have given you this money, you spent some of it on a study and you have not implemented anything from that and we still got nothing else done, although we have given you other moneys. When we raised this matter before, Deputies from other counties said hang on a minute, you have allocated money to them, but they are not drawing on it while we have a dire need in our areas yet we cannot get the money. It is absolutely ludicrous. Can we call the council in and get to the bottom of this once and for all? If this is not sorted out, there will be a house in the sea.

When one engages with councils on erosion they say they do not have the money. When one puts a parliamentary question in to the Minister, one is told that the Department has allocated the money. I think we should call in every council around the country and ask how they have spent their money or why they have not spent it. If they are not spending it and just sitting on it, it should be taken off them.

I am specifically addressing the issue of Bailieborough Garda Station because it is almost 18 months since it was first announced. We have heard rumours about where it will be located. Will it be a greenfield site or in the main street of Bailieborough? Can the Minister of State confirm exactly what premises are being considered for the main Garda station? It is the headquarters for the entire east Cavan district covering Ballyjamesduff to Tullyvin. The chosen site will be hugely important because it must be central to the district. We often see Portakabins being put into school grounds because the existing buildings do not have the capacity to house students and teachers. The same scenario exists in Bailieborough Garda station with gardaí, who are trying to do a good job, housed in Portakabins. Can the Minister of State confirm where the new Garda station will be located?

I can confirm that plans are well advanced. As she knows, the current station is in poor condition. Some minimal upgrading work was done to allow the station to tide over until the new one is built. The OPW is currently in the process of purchasing a property with a view to building a new Garda station and that site has been identified. The Deputy might be aware of the property and I can confirm that with her, but unfortunately not here in the Dáil. The purchase is being expedited and it is hoped that it will conclude shortly. Once the property is transferred the OPW will process the planning application under Part 9. However, the draft plans for the site have already been agreed.

Members of An Garda Síochána are doing their utmost to provide a good service.

#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-13 00:00:00	European Council: Statements	320	Expenditure ceilings provide Departments with greater clarity regarding available resources. They also help underpin significant engagement on expenditure priorities throughout the year rebalancing the previous focus on one single budgetary event in October of each year. The Estimates process and the determination of expenditure ceilings now take place as part of a whole-of-year budgetary cycle. The Summer Economic Statement sets out the broad fiscal position and the National Economic Dialogue facilitates engagement between the Government and stakeholders. The pre-Estimates departmental expenditure position is provided in the Mid-Year Expenditure Report, MYER. This sets the baseline for examination of budgetary priorities by the Government and the Oireachtas. Following detailed consideration, ministerial expenditure ceilings are published in the budget day expenditure report and are informed by a medium-term perspective on known expenditure pressures and developments. For example, the three-year ceilings for 2017-19 are informed by a number of pre-commitments as follows: demographics in the social protection, education and health sectors. IGEES staff in my Department conduct regular analysis of such trends to better inform the expenditure ceilings in the expenditure report. This analysis is available on the IGEES website. Just over €0.4 billion has been provided for these purposes in 2018; the Lansdowne Road agreement - some €0.32 billion is included for the LRA in 2018; scheduled increases in the public capital plan - €0.26 billion is included for capital in 2018; and the ceilings also include an amount of unallocated resources in 2018 and 2019, based on the fiscal projections at budget time last year. These can be utilised to meet the carryover impact of budget 2017 measures or for new expenditure measures. The flexibility provided within the ceilings allows Government to direct available additional resources towards key services at a time of increased demand and to new priorities. The management of the annual Exchequer funding provision allocated to Departments is governed by the rules detailed in Public Financial Procedures. As evidenced by the moderate, prudent and sustainable increases in public expenditure over recent years, the introduction of expenditure ceilings, as part of a series of reforms introduced in the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework, MTEF, has been a major innovation in strengthening expenditure control playing a major role in restoring the stability of the public finances.The pre-Estimates departmental expenditure position is provided in the mid-year expenditure report.

For example, the three-year ceilings from 2017 to 2019 are informed by a number of pre-commitments. One such commitment relates to demographics in social protection, education and health. Staff in my Department conduct a regular analysis of these trends to better inform expenditure ceilings. This is all available on our departmental website. For example, in 2018, €400 million has been provided for these purposes. Some €320 million is provided for the Landsdowne Road agreement in 2018. Regarding scheduled increases in the public capital plan, €260 million is included for capital ependiture in 2018. The ceilings also provide an amount of unallocated resources in 2018 and 2019, based on the fiscal projections at budget time last year. I am satisfied as to their robustness. The fact that overall gross expenditure in the first three months of the year was slightly behind profile, even though it was up significantly, by 5% or 5.5%, versus that in the previous year is evidence of this robustness. The issue of penalties does not arise because all Departments have to deliver their expenditure ceilings or below them. My Department and I track this on a monthly basis.

It states they have not worked effectively owing to continual upward revisions in spending. It quoted every expenditure report since 2012. To give an example, the Minister did some public service pay deals on the hoof, including the Garda pay deal and bringing forward increases under the Landsdowne Road agreement. At the Committee on Budgetary Oversight last week we questioned his Secretary General about where the money for the increases had been found. He said that had yet to be identified but that the money would be found. However, he could not give us any more detail. Does that way of doing business not breach the spirit of expenditure ceilings? If the Minister in charge is making policy and spending money in that manner, how does that reflect on other Ministers who are supposed to follow his leadership and guidance?

If anything, every day I face criticism for not increasing them enough. There are continual demands for more expenditure in many areas in which I know expenditure is needed, but as of yet I have not heard a single Deputy compliment me or praise the fact that we have managed to stay inside the expenditure ceilings, or criticise us when we change them at any point. As to where we are this year, the Deputy is correct. We made an adjustment in respect of the timing of a Landsdowne Road agreement payment and bringing it forward. The cost for the year, as is known, is €125 million. At the end of the first quarter, the net underspend as against profile was €150 million. Across the year, I will deal with how the adjustment is to be funded.

If the expenditure ceilings were right in the first place, the Minister would not need to change them. Again, I challenge him, as the Minister in charge of ensuring discipline on expenditure, to state whether that is a good way of doing business. How does it reflect on other Ministers? We can have this debate again. The health budget, in particular, has always proved challenging. It was within profile in the first quarter of the year. The Minister will not be in a position this year to bring forward Supplementary Estimates. Is he confident that the health budget is robust enough to face any challenge that may be ahead? I am looking strictly at waiting lists which are growing longer and longer. The waiting lists published in the past few days were the worst that had ever been seen.

They need, however, to be tracked every single month, as they are. I engage in this matter with the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, who is as committed as I am. In respect of maintaining discipline on overall Government expenditure, it is evidenced by the fact that expenditure in the first three months of the year was, as I said, below profile. Last year, after we had made a needed revision of health budget figures, expenditure came in below the Estimate for 2016 which, in turn, allowed us to make some decisions on, for example, payment of the Christmas bonus. The discipline and commitment are evident. The commitment in respect of maintaining discipline and making sure we meet our commitments will be particularly important in the light of the difficult decisions we will have to make on budget 2018.

Specifically, what is the cost to the Exchequer of all planned PPPs for the coming period? Has he given any thought, or paid any attention, to the plethora of research that has been carried out into whether it ultimately costs the State more to fund projects in this way than through other models? Will he, please, make a statement on the matter?
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-13 00:00:00	European Council: Statements	326	Aggregate information on the future cost of each PPP project is available on my Department's website, but I will take the Deputy through the figures she has requested.  My Department is updating the projections for the future cost of these projects, with the assistance of the various sponsoring agencies, as part of the regular annual updating of PPP statistics.  However, provisional figures indicate that the aggregate cost to the Exchequer of all outstanding unitary payments for existing PPPs is €6.6 billion.  Projects currently in planning or procurement will, of course, add to this figure. Once these projects are finalised, my Department will update the table to include the relevant costs associated with the new projects.      PPPs offer an alternative model for delivering infrastructure that can be effective in particular circumstances.  However, the long-term nature of these financial commitments arising from PPPs requires that the use of these arrangements must be carefully planned in order to ensure they meet needs in an affordable manner. It was for this reason that in 2015 the last Government introduced an investment policy framework for PPPs.  The purpose of the framework was to set a limit to the extent to which the annual costs of PPPs would pre-commit capital funding available to future Governments for investment purposes in terms of the overall capital allocation projected and made available in any single year. This applies to the future cost of payment charges in respect of both existing and new PPPs, together with the upfront Exchequer costs. I am aware of the debate to which the Deputy has referred and the different views on PPPs. The way in which I am handling it is to have a specific module which will carefully make a decision on whether PPPs can be of help in the future in the review of the capital plan we have under way. They do offer benefits; however, they also have costs. I am aware of both and it is for this reason that I have required the matter to be reviewed again this year in the light of decisions we might make for next year.
Additional information not given on the floor of the House
The current requirement is that, taken together, such future costs of PPPs should not pre-commit more than 10% of the overall aggregate capital funding projected to be available to future Governments in any individual year. On the research referred to by the Deputy that suggests PPPs ultimately cost the State more than alternative funding models, I do not know the precise research or the alternative funding models to which she refers, but I would be happy to have any such material reviewed by my Department and the NDFA.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-13 00:00:00	European Council: Statements	327	The Minister will probably second-guess my concerns and those of others in the House. We are concerned that, although PPPs may deliver key infrastructure, the State is becoming more and more dependant on them, noticeably in housing provision. For example, we are told that 1,500 housing units will be delivered by PPPs. They will be financed, built and maintained by private operators for 25 years. This is also true of schools, water infrastructure and transport, yet there have been numerous studies carried out, one as recently as 2013 by the University of Limerick, which show that there is no strong evidence to support the idea that PPPs deliver better value for money for the taxpayer.It is a bit like me as a householder buying my fridge or television on hire purchase rather than paying for it outright or borrowing money from the credit union to pay for it. The State is being forced into a model of PPP that is ultimately much more expensive for the taxpayer without delivering the results we need. We are being forced into it by having to borrow off-balance sheet and because we are being told that we cannot spend over a certain amount on our infrastructure.
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-13 00:00:00	European Council: Statements	328	I am aware of the debate that the Deputy is referring to and have read literature on the matter. I will be careful in the commitments we make in this area. The Deputy referred to the 2013 study. What has changed since then is that, in some cases, due to the difference in the rate at which our country can afford to borrow, sourcing projects through public private partnerships so that they do not come onto the State balance sheet has to be looked at. It is important that the House is aware of the following figures in regard to bullet payments in terms of choices that we will have to make. In 2017, the costs of PPP unitary payments, in other words payments we make to companies that have built public assets, is €224 million. This will increase until 2021, when it is expected to peak at €340 million per year. These are significant commitments. The other side of the coin, which is very significant, is these payments pay for the maintenance of the asset. If one looks at a school that was delivered via public private partnership, the payments to which I am referring pay for the maintenance of that asset over its lifetime. Not only are we able to build infrastructure in such a way that we can meet demands for current funding, we can use Exchequer funding for projects that the private sector might not want to build because the risk might be too high. That is the space in which PPPs need to be considered. They do have commitments, as I have shared with the Deputy, but they also pay for the maintenance of the asset. When it comes to roads in particular, that is a really significant benefit which has an economic value.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-13 00:00:00	European Council: Statements	329	Risk is a factor often given by those advocating public private partnerships as a method of building public infrastructure. That risk factor is a bit of a myth because there is no risk for the private operator in terms of public infrastructure. The risk lies entirely with the public element of it. That is shown by the failure of the project to regenerate St. Michael's estate headed by Bernard McNamara. When he pulled out of the project, it cost Dublin City Council at least €5 million and it cost Mr. McNamara €1.5 million. I see he is back up around the corner, rebuilding again. The State had to fork out €35 million on a PPP that failed to deal properly with odour alleviation at the Poolbeg incinerator. It had to pay that money to shore up mistakes made by the private operator.  There are other risk areas that I could talk about. Most sensible people would look at the question of risk and then say to look at the money made by the privately operated M50 toll bridge. The State built the M50 and then the bridge was built under a PPP. What risk was being taken by the private operator? It was taking no risk. It was on to a good thing and making hundreds of millions out of it for years.

That was the risk. The assessment the then Government got did not match up to the level of traffic that materialised on the M50. The Deputy has pointed to PPPs that have not delivered, but we should also point to the PPPs that have, such as primary care centres, schools and roads. We should particularly point to key roads to the south west of our country. They were built at a time when the State could not afford to build them. The funding model used means the State only has to pay for their maintenance. I want this matter reviewed in light of where we are now because PPPs have played a valuable role and can do so in the future. However, I am not rushing blindly into this. I am aware of the debate on the issue. I am aware of the attractions of this being done conventionally, that is, by the State directly building when it can, but we cannot always do that. That is why PPPs might well play a role in how we deliver some very big projects in the future.

The Government strongly recognised the need for increased investment in Ireland's public infrastructure and used economic growth at that point to increase capital expenditure. The provisional outturn of gross voted capital expenditure in 2016 was €4.1 billion. This was noted in the recently published end of quarter 1 of 2017 Exchequer returns. The report noted that expenditure pressures may arise in the transport area following the flooding at the start of 2016 which in turn was recognised in the outturns for capital expenditure in 2016. As Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, I am responsible for monitoring the deployment of Exchequer capital expenditure. Funding is made available to individual Departments. Each Department must ensure that individual projects and investment proposals are subject to all relevant appraisal processes. I make every effort to ensure capital funding made available to Departments is spent in the year in which it is made available. When a carryover is possible, it is facilitated, as we did this year for all Departments. However, with the social pressure we have to deal with, some of which can be attributed to the need to increase capital investment, funding is made available in a particular year at a particular point to deliver projects. It should be spent in the way it is committed. Public housing investment for the first few months of this year is many multiples of where we were last year. That is what I expect to see happen and I expect it to continue throughout this year.

That comes back to my first question in terms of what is happening in housing. The Minister leaves it to every line Department and tries to keep it within the budget, but how much of the €4.1 billion was actually spent? How much of it went into projects on the ground? Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII among other organisations, has raised the issue of the length of time it takes to initiate any capital project in this country at the moment. Is the Minister looking at the length of time it takes to get a project, be it a school or a road, from the planning stage, through the funding process and to site? Does he consider it a problem?
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-13 00:00:00	European Council: Statements	334	Overall levels of capital expenditure have been the subject of much debate in this House. The Irish Business Employers Confederation, IBEC, recently published a commentary and views on the matter. It is important that we are clear on what the figures are. In 2013, the State invested €3.4 billion in capital expenditure. For 2017, it is €4.5 billion. It is an increase of €1 billion over a four-year period. Next year, it will go up to €5.3 billion, which is an increase of nearly 50% on 2013. Our plan up to 2021 is to see that capital investment increase to €7.3 billion. The Deputy makes a fair point on the length of time involved in spending that money.There are two reasons for that timeline, first, the need for us to go through a public procurement and tendering process which must be done to ensure that Irish and international companies have a chance to give us the best value for the money I am referring to and, second, the planning process. While that is a matter for the Minister, Deputy Coveney, any change to that would be contested. A change has been made relating to housing projects above a certain size. It is the right of citizens who live near areas in which infrastructure or housing is to be put in place to make their views known, but I want to see the figures I referred to spent in the year in which we make the money available.

The Minister is currently in the middle of a capital plan review, but in terms of that pipleline, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, has told us there are not enough projects to go into that pipeline. In terms of planning for budget 2019 and the capital projections for that, will the Minister confirm that he will be making announcements this October pending the capital plan review in terms of budget 2018?

On the second question, it is my intention in the second half of this year, and it may or may not coincide with budget day as I have not made a decision on that yet, to make announcements on individual projects because there is a need for clarity on where we stand with existing commitments, let alone our ability to make new commitments.

The careful management of how we spend the taxpayers' money has played a vital role in stabilising our public finances, with the underlying Government deficit for 2016 estimated to come in below 1% of our national income. The Deputy will be aware that the economy continues to improve. The Central Statistics Office figures show the economy grew by 5% last year and unemployment fell to 6.4% in March. Improving budgetary conditions in recent years have allowed the Government to allocate additional resources towards its emerging needs, with Government expenditure increasing on average by approximately 3% per year since the end of 2014, with the prospect of continuing that rate of growth into the coming years. Departments are managing the figures so far this year inside available resources. We have resources for next year, which the Minister, Deputy Noonan, emphasised again today and on which I made a number of points during the day, but once we pay for the full year cost of our social welfare changes and honour commitments on tax reform, the net amount of resources available to the State are approximately €500 million inside what is defined as fiscal space. That means we will need to make very careful choices regarding how we spend that money next year. It strikes me that if we consider where our economy is now, in 2007 we had 2.1 million people at work. In 2017, we will have 2.1 million people at work. In 2007, we had tax revenue of €47 billion. In 2017, the corresponding figure is €51 billion. In many cases, therefore, our public finances and our labour market are now back to where they were a decade ago. Our deficit and borrowing requirements are not back to that point yet but in other areas the economic indicators are back. We have a clear choice ahead of us. We know what happened to the economy after 2007. We saw the huge damage that was inflicted on our country and the pain caused. To make sure we do not go through that again, we need to be sensible about the way we increase expenditure in the coming years, accompany that with reform to make sure we spend money better and then make wise choices regarding the way we manage tax in our country. If we can do that, the prospect of being able to increase spending by 3% each year and accompany that with reform year after year will offer our country a great chance to deal with the issues Deputies raise in this House every day.

They and their Departments are fully committed to doing that but a real risk we face in light of the economic fork in the road at which we find ourselves is that each day different expenditure needs are called for of this Government. Week after week it is asked to spend more money in different areas, and the areas change week after week. We need to ensure that the loser in all of this is not the taxpayer through commitments being made to expenditure that end up being unaffordable with our current levels of taxation. The taxation environment is changing. It could change further as a result of what might happen with Brexit, yet we have political party after political party calling for more money to be spent in particular areas or services to be delivered and arguing that they can be achieved at no cost. That is simply not possible. As we move into the second half of this year in particular, this will be an area in which we will need to make clear and sensible choices. I will do my bit in this regard and I hope the House will do the same.

I believe it was on the last day of the previous session. First, what is the status of the Bill? Will it come to committee soon? Second, will the Minister outline any further progress since that discussion on the roll-out of shared services as a function within the public service?

The Deputy and Deputy Fleming raised a number of points regarding it, although I believe he is broadly supportive of it. The National Shared Services Office has been in operation since 2014. As the Deputy is aware, the Bill does not propose any change regarding the operation of national shared services but rather looks to put that organisation on a more firm footing. In terms of progress made since 2014, we have set up two shared services centres. I visited their offices in Killarney and Clonshaugh. I am looking forward to visiting another office in this area in Galway in May. The office is delivering savings to us already. For example, in 2016, we estimate the savings that have accrued to the State to be of the magnitude of €7.6 million. In 2017, we believe the figure will be €9.7 million. Over the lifetime of the organisation we believe it will deliver savings of approximately €5.5 million per year that will then allow the redeployment of individuals who are currently working on payroll and human resource services to do other work across our civil and public service.

The situation in Letterkenny is critical. I am seriously concerned about the level of service available for patients in County Donegal. Due to limited time, I will refer to a letter sent by the breast surgeon in Letterkenny to the Minister for Health on 16 January. The letter warns of the need to address as an absolute priority the current waiting list or patients will have delayed diagnosis of cancer as a result of the length of time, some in excess of a year. We must take that seriously. These are the words of the only breast surgeon in Letterkenny. The Minister received that letter in January 2017 but has done absolutely nothing about it. What has the Government done since 25 January 2016 when the Minister of State from the county at that time, Deputy McHugh, delivered the decision of the former Minister for Health that there would be a second surgeon? That was a typical pre-election stunt and I make a charge against both Ministers who did that at the time. Advertisements for a locum continue. We want a permanent breast surgeon in Letterkenny. An advertisement for a locum will not attract any interest whatsoever. Anyone who is interested in the post will take it if it is permanent. I am making a charge here in the House that the half-hearted advertising of this position by the national cancer control programme, NCCP, and the HSE is contemptible. The continuous advertising of this post is a smoke screen. There is no interest. I was disappointed to receive a letter today from the Minister from which I will quote. The letter states that "Meanwhile, the requirements of the Letterkenny breast cancer service in the medium term are being assessed." A decision was taken in January 2016 that there would be a second surgeon and almost a year and half later, we are told it is being assessed. Why is it being assessed? The letter states "this is being done in light of the clear evidence that patients who are operated on by surgeons who carry out higher volumes of surgery achieve better outcomes". We are very happy with those who provide services in Letterkenny but they need support and we must ensure that there is no continuation of what we have been living with for the past number of years. If patients are not being diagnosed at an early stage, the delays will result in them having to travel to other areas. It has been suggested they can move elsewhere. We are not going to accept that. County Donegal is on the periphery. There should be a special package for regions. I have great respect for the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, but, obviously, the Minister, Deputy Harris, obviously has no respect. Whatever he is doing in this city today must be very important if it is more important than the appointment of a breast surgeon in Letterkenny. We are not going to accept this. The Government and its representatives are good at public relations and putting out statements saying they are planning to do this and that but no funding is provided for it. We could well be in a more serious situation. I know that the Minister of State has come in here to deliver the script on behalf of the Minister but we want to meet the Minister and I ask the Minister of State to do that on our behalf. It is not right and proper that Deputies from Donegal should be ignored by the Minister when it is such an important issue for Donegal. We will ensure that Donegal will have a second breast surgeon. For the Minister to do a U-turn at this stage is despicable and we will not accept it. I am grateful to have the opportunity to speak on this. This is important for Donegal.

The purpose of the Topical Issue debate is for Ministers to make themselves available to deal with the issues because they are important for the constituencies Members represent. In January 2016, the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, announced that the second breast surgeon for Letterkenny was approved and that recruitment would start straight away. We now know this was an empty pre-election promise because we have seen nothing happen since then. As has been said, almost a year and a half later we have seen no action. While this goes on, the number of referrals continues to grow. There is an average of 1,950 referrals to the breast clinic in Letterkenny every year that are dealt with by a single surgeon who does Trojan work and is so passionate about looking after the patients he sees and making sure the service in Letterkenny is maintained. I know it is hard for people in Dublin to understand but it is a four-and-a-half-hour trip from Inishowen to Galway to attend the clinics there. As these are patients who are ill or are worried that they might be ill and might receive a diagnosis of cancer, it is vitally important that this service in Letterkenny continues to grow. The way to do that is to appoint the second breast surgeon, which would allow the waiting lists to be shortened. I can only think that it is a deliberate policy on the part of the NCCP and the HSE to ensure this appointment does not happen and that the waiting lists continue to grow in order that the demand will be to move the entire service to Galway.  The Minister of State will state in her reply that not enough surgeries take place in Letterkenny to justify two surgeons because that is the response we constantly get, even though the Department has agreed to appoint a second surgeon. I point out to her that were the same figures to be used by the Department and enforced around the rest of the country, approximately one quarter of the breast surgeons nationwide would not be carrying out enough operations. A total of 96 new cancers were identified in Letterkenny in 2015 while the number in 2016 was 89. To my mind, that clearly justifies the need to appoint a second surgeon in Letterkenny. It is not enough to make excuses that there are difficulties around recruitment.

I do not know specifically where he is but I have been asked to take this matter on his behalf. In 2007, in recognition of the particular and unique geographical circumstances applying to Donegal, the Department set out a clear policy direction approved by Government that the Letterkenny breast cancer service should operate as a satellite centre of University Hospital Galway. Specifically, on a sole exception basis, the Government agreed that Galway should be permitted to enter into outreach service delivery in Letterkenny as an additional activity. This exception was subject to a number of conditions, including case volumes meeting the minimum criteria and all other quality assurance standards being satisfied on the same basis as for care being delivered in Galway. The Saolta University Healthcare Group remains committed to continuing the Letterkenny service as a fully integrated part of the symptomatic breast disease service in Galway, including through a joint multidisciplinary team approach. The Letterkenny service has been run by a single consultant who also undertakes general surgery at the hospital. Support is provided by Galway-based Saolta consultants who travel to carry out clinics in the Letterkenny service to meet needs arising. The Letterkenny service has been under some pressure to meet key performance indicators of late. While a particular focus has been maintained on urgent referrals, challenges are arising regarding addressing non-urgent breast cancer referrals in a timely way. A locum consultant surgeon will be in place for a period from mid-May and this appointment will help to alleviate the backlog. Meanwhile, the requirements of the Letterkenny breast cancer service in the medium term are being assessed. This is being done in the light of the clear evidence that patients who are operated on by surgeons who carry out higher volumes of surgery achieve better outcomes. In addition, efforts to recruit GP support and further advanced nurse practitioner support for the Letterkenny service are continuing. The possibility of medium-term requirements being addressed in co-operation with health services in Northern Ireland is also being explored, including the possibility of having a shared locum consultant. This would build on the co-operation already in place in the radiation therapy services at the North West Cancer Centre in Altnagelvin Area Hospital. This centre opened in November last year and is providing access to radiation therapy services for people from both jurisdictions. A radiologist post for Letterkenny University Hospital has been advertised. A locum radiologist is also being sought to provide cover for the radiology service. Radiographer numbers in Letterkenny have increased and the hospital will continue to develop its radiography service to meet the needs of patients. The Minister recently met patient representatives from Donegal to discuss cancer services in the north west and further such meetings are planned. He remains committed to the continued provision of high-quality, timely services for patients attending breast cancer services in Letterkenny University Hospital.

We are very proud of the service that has been provided at Letterkenny University Hospital and I pay tribute to all of those who are involved. However, they are under serious pressure. Until Deputy Pringle and I received this letter, we were of the view that it was only a matter of time before the appointment of a breast surgeon to Letterkenny University Hospital. Then we are told that there would be a locum from May until we do not know when. Now we are told the situation is being reassessed. This is a U-turn. I make the charge against the then Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, and his Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, who announced the post weeks before the election. There was no sincerity there. Both must stand up and tell the people of Donegal why they deceived them. These are the people we represent and we are not going to accept this. We want to ensure the Government fulfils its commitment on this post. We talk about numbers and outputs but it is no different to any other part of the State. We believe Donegal to be a special place - it is a special place and it deserves this recognition. All I ask is for the Government to deliver on its commitment.

The response states:[T]he requirements of the Letterkenny breast cancer service in the medium term are being assessed. This is being done in the light of the clear evidence that patients who are operated on by surgeons who carry out higher volumes of surgery achieve better outcomes.Perhaps the Minister of State will indicate where this clear evidence is to be found. As I said earlier, some 25% of surgeons across the service in the so-called centres of excellence actually carry out less than the 50 operations touted as being the desired number to justify having a breast surgeon. The figure of 50 operations is not backed up by any clinical evidence or any research internationally. Clearly, it is an arbitrary figure picked by the HSE to stifle the development of services at facilities such as Letterkenny University Hospital. This is wrong. The Ministers need to deliver on their promises. I have attended some of the meetings that took place with previous Ministers regarding the cancer services at Letterkenny University Hospital. We hear plenty of kind words and sentiment at those meetings but we see no delivery. To my mind, there must be something going on behind the scenes. Is it that the system is being allowed to run down to such an extent that people will be happy to go to Galway and that the HSE will then have achieved what it wants in closing the service in Letterkenny University Hospital?

Deputy Gallagher has requested a meeting with the Minister and I will certainly pass on that request. It is my understanding from the reply that every effort is being made to fill the post but, unfortunately, it has not yet been filled. The Deputies have clearly indicated their concerns in respect of the service in Letterkenny University Hospital. As a woman, I want to add my voice to that. I really believe that it is important to give women peace of mind. It is an awful time in a woman's life when she is asked to attend a breast clinic and the only thing that can quench the fear is the fact that she can get a speedy diagnosis, one way or the other. I understand perfectly that when women are in the position of going to breast cancer clinics, they need to be given peace of mind. I will relay the Deputies' points on to the Minister. I cannot comment on the Deputies' comments about an announcement regarding a consultant post prior to the general election. I have no comment on that but I do not believe that anyone would try to deceive anybody on such a serious issue as the appointment of a senior breast consultant coming up to an election. I thank both Deputies on behalf of the Minister, who sends his apologies for not being in the Chamber. I will make sure that he has a copy of my notes when I return to my office so he can respond, and especially to the request by Deputy Gallagher for a meeting to take place with Deputies in Donegal.

I am not looking for a change in foreign policy but for more emphasis to be put on this issue, which my colleagues Deputies Mattie McGrath and Noel Grealish join with me in raising today. Ireland was once known as the land of saints and scholars. This arose from our conversion to Christianity centuries ago. Europe has come a long way with its multicultural society but there are still major Christian values in place. The Middle East - including Syria - was the birthplace of Christianity and when its population came under attack centuries ago, we had the Crusades, which involved multinational armies drawn from countries across Europe such as Britain and Ireland. Those involved played no small part in ensuring that Christians could live where they were born, as was the case with their ancestors. There have been many attempts at systematic extermination since then. It is ironic that, under previous dictatorship regimes in the Middle East, Christians were afforded some reasonable protection and lived in harmony with the Muslims and the other minority religious groups. Deputies Mattie McGrath, Durkan and I attended a conference at which we were well briefed on what is happening in the Middle East. We met some of the authorities from the Christian communities and the stories they told us of what is happening in there would make the hairs stand up on the back of the neck. What has happened is shameful. It is six years since the crisis erupted in Syria, but it took the washing up of the body of a little boy on the shoreline of a European country to bring home what is going on in the Middle East. Ireland and the EU opened their borders for the influx of refugees. I commend the Ministers and their Departments on making available the ships of the Naval Service and I commend the crews of those vessels on the good work they have done to provide protection for people who are trying to escape from these hostile communities. We should, however, be doing more on the ground in the Middle East to ensure that the Christians to whom I refer are protected in order that they can survive in their own homelands, which constitute the birthplace of Christianity. I ask that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan give serious thought to this matter.

Open Doors has noted that 2017 is the fourth year in a row in which the level of overall persecution has risen. North Korea is still the number one offender. Islamic extremism continues to strangle the expression of the Christian faith. Millions of Christians around the world now live their lives in the shadow of varying levels of discrimination, violence and unrest. I wish to outline some of the key facts in terms of international persecution of Christians. Islamic extremism fuels persecution in 14 out of the top 20 countries and in 35 of the top 50. It is North Korea, however, that is the number one offender, as has been the case since 2002. Worldwide persecution of Christians has risen for the fourth year in a row. Asia, in particular, is showing a rapid rise. Pakistan rises to fourth on the list, with levels of violence even greater than those in northern Nigeria. As Hindu nationalists batter the churches, India has climbed to its highest ever ranking of 15th. In Bangladesh, Vietnam and tiny Bhutan, things are getting more difficult for Christians. Buddhist nationalism returns Sri Lanka to the top 50 persecutors of Christians. Sudan rises to number five as President Omar al-Bashir seeks to fulfil his 2011 boast to the effect that "Now we can impose Sharia here." Turkey rises to 37 as President Erdoan uses the failed coup of 2016 to purge opponents and push the country towards increased Islamism. Christians continue to be caught in the crossfire of wars in the Middle East. War-torn Yemen returns to the top ten, while Christians in Syria and Iraq continue to be targeted by Islamic militants.

Ar an chéad dul síos ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an Cheann Comhairle as an motion inniu. I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to speak and I thank the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, for being here. I know he is very busy. I thank him for his engagement with myself and Deputies Grealish, O'Keeffe and Michael Collins on this issue. We have had a number of meetings but we will need a follow-up meeting after Easter. Christians and other religious minorities in Iraq and Syria will be exterminated or forced to migrate, solely on the basis of their religion, by Islamic State - also known as ISIS or Daesh - and other militant extremists. Christians and other religious minorities in Iraq and Syria have been an integral part of the region's cultural fabric for millennia. Since 2003, minority groups in Iraq and Syria have been the target of systematic violence, with millions fleeing their ancestral homes. Christians and members of other religious minorities - I stress other minorities, including minority Muslim groups - in Iraq and Syria have been murdered, subjugated and have suffered grievous bodily and psychological harm, including sexual enslavement and abuse inflicted in a deliberate and calculated manner in violation of the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. These atrocities were undertaken with the specific intent of bringing about the eradication and displacement of their communities and the destruction of their cultural heritage in violation of that convention. Genocide is a crime under international law that shall be punished, whether committed by "constitutionally responsible rulers, public officials or private individuals" as provided by the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. Article I of the convention, signed at Paris on 9 December 1948 - all that long ago - states that "the Contracting Parties confirm that genocide, whether committed in time of peace or in time of war, is a crime under international law which they undertake to prevent and to punish." Article II states:In the present Convention, genocide means any of the following acts committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:(a) killing members of the group;(b) causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;(c) deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;(d) imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; and(e) forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.Article III affirms that the following acts shall be punishable: (a) genocide;(b) conspiracy to commit genocide;(c) direct and public incitement to commit genocide;(d) attempt to commit genocide;(e) complicity in genocide On 13 March, 2015 the United Nations Committee on Human Rights reported that ethnic and religious groups targeted by Islamic State include Yazidis, Christians, Turkmen, Sabian Mandaeans, Kakais, Kurds and Shias and that it is reasonable to conclude that some of the incidents in Iraq in 2014-2015 may constitute genocide. I appeal to the Minister to do something. This is happening right under our noses. Like my colleagues, I salute the Government and the Minister for Defence for sending in the rescue ships of our proud Naval Service. The number of people they have plucked from the water and saved is astonishing. Sadly, many have also drowned. I travelled to Lebanon with Deputy Grealish and Senator Rónán Mullen and I visited the camps. I will quote from one poor woman I met in a camp at 10 o'clock one Sunday night. She recalled the harrowing story of her family, which was turned upside down in the blink of an eye when their home town in Syria was overrun by Islamic State forces. The family I met living in this camp is a retired couple. He is 82 and his wife is 73. She was crying as she told me what happened to them and their 40 year old daughter who has two children. They were a regular Catholic family living an ordinary regular life in their home in Syria. When ISIS came to town, all the Christian houses were, unfortunately, marked with a cross, which is so sad. Then the knock came on the door in the morning and they were told by ISIS they had to convert to Islam within a week, leave within half an hour or be shot on the spot. When the ISIS soldiers returned, the daughter's husband refused to leave. Who would blame him? He was executed on the spot in front of the family - shot dead for refusing to agree to their terms to leave or convert to Islam. The family then agreed to leave. They had to leave their house with the clothes on their backs. ISIS took over their house, car and all their property. They had to walk in excess of 200 km to the Syria-Lebanon border, where they now live in a refugee camp a few miles from that border. That family is typical of huge numbers of Christians driven from their homes in Syria and Iraq by ISIS. They were a self-sufficient family, working and carrying out their ordinary lives in their home country. The man who was executed had a well-paid job on an oil rig. The mother is a retired nurse and the father had worked with the local authority. They are not economic migrants. They are fleeing the most awful persecution and terror of their lives. They do not want to stay in an Army barracks in Mullingar or any other country to which they might be sent, particularly in light of language barriers and everything else. It was so sad. We met the children. The poor little children came out to meet us and had a little cáca milis, a welcoming party for us in the dark and they did a special dance for us. To see in that camp only grannies, very old people and children under ten or 11, no sign of the men and no sign of the mothers. Christianity has been a stabilising factor in the Middle East since the first Easter but now it is being undermined and driven out. It is going to be a less safe place and the world itself will be a most dangerous place. His Holiness - we met him, as Deputy O'Keeffe said - pleaded with us to go back to our parliaments. Some parliaments, such as the United States Congress and the Parliament in the UK, have passed motions in this regard. I await the Minister's response.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-13 00:00:00	European Council: Statements	352	I thank the Deputies for raising this important issue. There is a grim timeliness about this Topical Issue debate. It is deeply dismaying that we should need to discuss continuing violence and persecution against Christians in the Middle East as we prepare to commemorate the Easter holidays. I must begin by expressing my horror at the attacks on two Coptic churches in Egypt on Sunday, and to extend my deepest condolences to the victims and their families. The political turmoil which has overwhelmed many countries in the Middle East in recent years has led to increased concerns about the safety of many religious minorities and other minority groups. Christian communities have indeed suffered greatly in many of these countries. In Syria and Iraq, notably, they have been caught up in a general collapse of state control and authority, and increasingly sectarian violence which has made all minorities vulnerable.This has culminated in both countries in the murderous bigotry of Daesh and other terrorist groups that have attacked and murdered many communities and groups of people for their religious beliefs and way of life. The attacks in Egypt and similar earlier incidents were, in all likelihood, a deliberate attempt to provoke similar sectarian divisions in that country. However, thus far the reaction of Egyptians has been exactly the opposite. Even when the current violence is brought to an end, as it will be, many of these ancient communities will be permanently diminished. Over half of Iraqi Christians have fled the country. While some may return, many are now settled in the United States and Australia and they will not return. These tragic events are the result of crises of governance and legitimacy and, in some places, the collapse of state authority. The grim reality is that the only means of securing the protection of Christian communities and other minorities throughout the Middle East is through the promotion of sustainable political solutions to the conflicts that have for so long destabilised the region and have been the key factor in the promotion of radical and extremist ideologies. Ireland has consistently called for inclusive, democratic solutions to the unrest in the Middle East and north Africa. Deputies will be aware that we have been to the fore under successive Governments in trying to focus international attention and effort on these problems. We have actively supported and encouraged successive political efforts to achieve ceasefires and to advance and progress peace agreements. We have worked to discourage outside interventions that have worsened these conflicts. We have worked to urge mechanisms of accountability for those guilty of war crimes. Irish peacekeepers and professional staff have served with UN missions in Lebanon, Syria, the Palestinian territories and Iraq. We have supported efforts to establish humanitarian corridors. We have significantly increased humanitarian aid in addition to the marvellous efforts of Irish NGOs throughout the region. I pay tribute to Irish NGOs and peacekeepers for the manner in which they conduct their business and for their experience and expertise in some of the most challenging regions in the world. More broadly and in view of the longer term, Ireland engages in international work to combat the persecution of Christians and other minorities in the Middle East. There is not time in this short debate to cover these in detail. However, I acknowledge the importance of these issues to the Deputies who have raised the matter. I was pleased to meet Deputy McGrath and others, as he evidenced. Ireland has made freedom of religion and belief a priority of our engagement. At the United Nations General Assembly I have condemned all forms of persecution, intolerance and discrimination based on religion or belief. Ireland has consistently supported resolutions on freedom of religion or belief at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, including co-sponsorship of the resolution at the most recent session of the Human Rights Council some weeks back in March. In addition, Ireland frequently raises the issue of the persecution of Christians through our bilateral contacts in the region. We stress the responsibility of governments to protect all citizens and minorities, irrespective of their religion or belief. I assure the Deputies that Ireland will continue to play an important role in this area and actively support freedom of religion or belief across our foreign policy.

I agree with what he has said. I acknowledge the good work of the NGOs, our Defence Forces and the Naval Service. However, we believe more could be done. Europe has learned its lesson from the Yugoslav war. It was a neighbouring country of EU countries. We should remember what happened there with the minority religious groups. Plenty of international attention is being given to this issue but more needs to be done. Europe reacted quickly to the creation of a Jewish state after the Second World War. We are not looking for a new state to be created for Christians or other minority groups in the Middle East. We are simply asking that they be left to go back to where they came from and continue their traditions, which have created many of the values that we have today. I thank the Minister for his response and I hope that we get more back in the future.

It is sad that it is Holy Thursday evening during seachtain na Cásca when we are having this debate. That is our choosing. It is appropriate to have it this evening. I apologise for Deputy Grealish who had to leave for an engagement in Galway. I thank him. I know Deputy O'Keeffe and others are travelling to Frascati again this year in August to meet world leaders. I was glad that the leaders of the Coptic Church were brought before the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade to engage with us. There is a Coptic Christian community in Cahir in Tipperary. They are most welcome and valuable members of the community. I have sympathised with them totally and with their colleagues in Egypt after the horrific attacks that took place on Palm Sunday which caused deaths, slaughter and devastation. It beggars belief. I salute the NGOs and peacekeepers. We have a proud record. Deputy Grealish referred recently on Leaders' Questions to some of the peacekeepers of the past. He made the case that they have not been recognised properly for the gallantry they displayed. We are proud in Ireland. The United Nations has been lax in this case. It is ironic that under the dictatorships of certain countries – I will not name them but we know which ones – Christians were allowed to practise their faith with impunity, as were minority Muslim faiths. There was peace and harmony. They all worshipped whatever God they believed in or thought they were worshipping and there was no problem. However, things have changed since the bombing by the US, England and other countries. Since the removal of those dictators, there is no possibility for these people to worship or to hold their right to freedom of expression or anything else. The situation is far worse than it ever was. Aid to the Church in Need produced a report in 2016 on religious freedom in the world. The report analysed the situation of 196 countries from June 2014 to June 2016. It concluded that Islamic extremism is the main threat for Christians and other religions. That is an honest report. It states that more than 334 million Christians are persecuted and discriminated against because of their religion. Cardinal Mauro Piacenza, president of Aid to the Church in Need, made several observations at the launch of the report. He said that persecution has always threatened Christians and always will. However, he said that does not mean they need to have a pessimistic attitude or do nothing about it. We have to act. Out of the 196 countries under the microscope, 38 host Christian communities have suffered serious violations. This is savage. In 23 countries there is strong religious persecution and in 15 countries there is discrimination. The most dangerous countries for Christians are in the Middle East and Africa. These include Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, Nigeria and Somalia among others. According to the cardinal, this is the worst problem in the world community but we remain oblivious to the toil of these communities. The media have a role to play as well. We are not getting the attention. We get it when there is a horrific atrocity, and rightly so. However, we are not getting it otherwise. Since 2014, one in five counties has been the victim of an attack from Islamic State. Islamic extremism is felt more strongly every day and has caused a rise in the number of refugees. In 2015, a total of 5.8 million people had to flee their homes. They lost everything. According to the United Nations, the total number of refugees in the world is 65.3 million. It is unimaginable. This is the situation that the Bishop of Syria has to endure every day. These are the types of issues that arise. Christians who live under authoritarian regimes like those in China or Turkestan undergo difficult circumstances. In two years in the Chinese province of Zhejiang, 2,000 crucifixes have been removed from churches. We are at that in our country. We remove them from hospitals and places and we do not think of the consequences. I do not see the need or the rush to do it. We do not think of the awful consequences and the signal this sends to those people who are being savagely persecuted.

Deputy Collins did not take his time, so you might allow me a little grace. I am delighted that we got the opportunity to raise this matter. I am very pleased that the Minister is present to hear us. I know he is engaging and that he intends to engage. We have many Muslims in my constituency and in the constituencies of my colleagues as well. They are here and happy to be here. We are happy to have them. They play a vital role. That is the way it should be. We are not against any one faith or another. As I said, the minority sects of Muslims and others get even more horrific persecution. Something has to happen. Account has to be taken of where we are. The United States Congress and the United Kingdom Parliament have passed motions recently. We need to come to this Chamber without fear of any big powers. We need to stand up against the persecution of ordinary decent families. These people simply want to live out their lives under their own culture, in their own country and to be allowed to raise their families in safety.The whole world is being completely destabilised by what is happening in the Middle East. It will have earth-shattering consequences going forward if we do not deal with it. I thank the Cathaoirleach for his forbearance, as well as the Minister and my colleagues who helped to raise this discussion today.

Let me reiterate in the strongest possible terms that Ireland strongly condemns all forms of persecution on the basis of religion or belief, irrespective of where they occur or who the victims are or might be. We attach great importance to combatting all forms of discrimination based on religion or belief and all forms of incitement to religious hatred. We firmly believe in the matter of tolerance, non-discrimination, freedom of expression, freedom of thought, freedom of conscience, freedom of religion and freedom of belief. Ireland consistently raises the issue of intolerance and unequal treatment at the UN Human Rights Council during the council's universal periodic review of the United Nations' member states. I acknowledge what Deputy McGrath said on the matter of the United Nations. I note that Ireland also consistently raises this issue at meetings of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, and on a continuous basis in meetings and engagements of the Council of Europe. The promotion of inclusive societies in which the human rights of all individuals are respected is a core objective of our engagement. It is a core cornerstone of foreign policy to promote issues such as the freedom expression, the freedom of religion and the freedom of belief. During our recent Presidency of the Council of Ministers in 2013, Ireland played a key role in the development and adoption of EU guidelines on the freedom of religion and belief. These guidelines provide a framework for the promotion of freedom of religion or belief in the EU's external human rights policy. Later, in 2015, Ireland pressed for the inclusion of the promotion of freedom of religion or belief in the EU action plan for human rights and democracy, a four-year plan from 2015 to 2019. Let me assure the Deputy that I will continue to raise the voice of the Irish Government, Parliament and people on these important issues. I thank the Deputies for raising this issue, particularly today on Holy Thursday at the start of the most important Christian festival in our calendar.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-13 00:00:00	European Council: Statements	358	I thank the Minister for being here to take the issue and the Ceann Comhairle for allowing it. If Bashar al-Assad deliberately used chemical weapons on his own people, that is horrific. He should certainly be held to account. He has done bad things previously but the refusal to look for evidence and to have an independent inquiry is worrying. If the response to the assumption that there was a chemical weapon attack is a military strike, then we have a higher level of responsibility to ensure that it took place. The site should be visited, the evidence should be found and taken to the UN Security Council and, if necessary, to the Hague to initiate criminal proceedings. In Iraq back in 2003, there was no proof of any of the claims of the weapons of mass destruction. In Libya, there was no proof of the claims that Muammar Gaddafi was going to slaughter many people but this assumption was used as a pretext to bomb the living daylights out of the country. The same people who cheerled those disastrous wars are cheerleading this aggression now. Saudi Arabia approves of the airstrikes. This is because Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey, the US and the UK have been helping to fund these so-called moderate groups who end up being cousins to ISIS, al-Qaeda and al-Nusra. These groups are trying to take over the government of Syria which, like it or not, is a pluralistic society. The US, the UK, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey are promoting and funding this extremist jihadi movement. They want a regime change. This particular US attack was not the most deadly attack in Syria that the US staged last week. Many of the people calling for the US to intervene in Syria do not seem to realise that it is already at war there. In Syria and in Iraq, over recent weeks and months, US air attacks have hit mosques, schools and apartment complexes and have killed many hundreds of civilians to the extent that those who monitor this, such as the Airwars group, have estimated that the US has now surpassed Russia in its killing of civilians by bombing raids. As investigative journalist Mr. Allan Nairn claims, the murder of civilians is simply calculated out of existence as people forget that numbers are not valueless. Mr. Nairn said the following:Within the U.S. system, those killings of civilians are excused, because the U.S. was not targeting those civilians per se. They just happened to be next to the targets, so they died in the explosion. So the U.S. system says it’s OK .... They calculate how many civilians they predict will die by accident. So, in a certain sense, it’s an accident. But in another sense, if you were applying domestic criminal law standards, it wouldn’t be considered an accident. They could be charged with criminally negligent homicide. They could [even] be charged with various kinds of manslaughter. The death toll from a 17 March US airstrike in the Iraqi city of Mosul has risen to more than 300 civilians, including many children. While speaking to Mr. Jeremy Scahill on "Intercepted" this week, the former Ohio Democratic Congressman, Mr. Dennis Kucinich, laid out precisely why we should not fall into line with the hawks and warmongers and sleepwalk to the tune of the arms industry. In October 2013, then-President Obama sent Mr. John Kerry to meet Russia's Foreign Minister to come to an agreement to end the fighting in Syria. There were reports that the Pentagon and the CIA were opposed to any agreement with Russia. They did not want to share any intelligence with them. An agreement had been made between the Russians and Mr. Kerry but less than a week later, there was a US bombing attack on a Syrian army base. Approximately 100 Syrian military soldiers were killed and that ended the agreement. Effectively, the Pentagon and the CIA overruled the President of the United States and the Secretary of State and decided they were not going to tolerate any kind of agreement with Russia. They bombed a barracks in a country the Russians had been invited into to protect. This was a calculated effort to drive a wedge between the US and Russia so that the permanent war machine can just keep going on and on. There is no money in peace. I plead with the Irish Government to take a neutral position. I would not defend for a second what Assad does or what the Russians do, but I wish to God everybody would stop bombing any part of Syria.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-13 00:00:00	European Council: Statements	359	I welcome the opportunity to address this House on the situation in Syria once again. It is beyond doubt the greatest challenge facing the international community at present. The situation continues to be a matter of gravest concern and efforts to resolve it reflect not only the challenges internal to Syria, but wider regional and global dynamics. I was horrified by the news of last week’s chemical attack in which men, women and children were indiscriminately murdered. Just yesterday, a UN Security Council resolution on investigating this incident was vetoed by Russia. This is a further clear example of the challenges faced in trying to move towards a resolution of this terrible conflict. The attack at Khan Shaykhun underlines the need for full accountability for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Syria. Those responsible for crimes on all sides must be held accountable. We have consistently called for accountability and the referral of the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court. We will continue to work to ensure accountability is achieved. I welcome the establishment of the international, impartial and independent mechanism on Syria. Established by the UN General Assembly last December, it will assist in the investigation and prosecution of persons responsible for the most serious crimes under international law that have been committed in Syria. It is a small step but it is a step in the right direction. I am considering how best Ireland can support this mechanism. I had the opportunity to discuss the situation in Syria with EU Foreign Ministers at the Foreign Affairs Council in Luxembourg last week. My EU colleagues joined me in condemning the continued widespread abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law by all parties, especially the Syrian regime. We also agreed the new EU strategy for Syria. This sets out the EU’s clear position that there can be no EU support for reconstruction in Syria until a comprehensive, genuine and inclusive political transition owned by the Syrian people is firmly under way. The Council also agreed to support the resilience of the Syrian population and Syrian society through the provision of education and job creation, as well as support for local civilian governance structures in opposition-held areas, including by working with the Syrian interim government, and working to avoid the collapse of the state administration in Syria. Ireland will continue to make contributions to the humanitarian effort in Syria. Since 2012, Ireland has contributed €76.5 million to the crisis. Last week, the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, attended the conference on supporting the future of Syria and the region in Brussels and we announced an additional pledge of €25 million for this year of 2017.This is Irish Aid’s largest response to a single crisis in recent years, indicative of the level of priority we attach to this issue. In providing support to Syria, it is important not to forget the impact of the conflict on the wider region, in particular on neighbouring Jordan and Lebanon, and Irish Aid support is also disbursed in those countries. I want to underline Ireland’s support for the UN-led Geneva peace process and commend the efforts of UN Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura. The Geneva process is the only way of achieving an inclusive, sustainable and peaceful resolution to the crisis in Syria. I assure Members of this House that Ireland remains wholly committed to efforts to achieving this outcome. I have no doubt we will be back in this House discussing the crisis in Syria, both the war and its humanitarian impact, on other occasions in the future. This is the sad reality of the situation in Syria as we speak. However, we must also continue to have some hope that progress can be made, even if this progress is sometimes slow and intermittent. For my part, I assure the House that I will ensure that Ireland’s voice is heard where it is most effective - in Brussels, New York and Geneva - urging progress toward peace and political transition, followed by the rebuilding of lives and livelihoods and ultimately accountability for crimes that have been committed against the people of Syria.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-13 00:00:00	European Council: Statements	360	I am in favour of holding accountable all people who commit crimes, and I am talking about people on both sides. The Minister says the EU is working towards a genuine and inclusive political transition but I get the impression that "political transition" also refers to regime change. They went into Iraq to implement regime change and look at the mayhem they have left behind them. As bad as Saddam was, things were not as bad as they are now. As bad as Gaddafi, was, things were not as bad under him as they are now. The whole region has been destroyed in so many ways by military intervention. It is nonsense and it does not work. There is not going to be a military solution in Syria. It is possible to get everybody talking but those in Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar get arms from the British and the Americans, and they have been giving them to extreme groups that have totally escalated what has happened in Syria. It is illogical. I understand there is a very pro-US position in the EU and that there is also one here, and the evidence of that is that we are still allowing Shannon to be used as a US military air base. For the life of me, I do not understand how we can still do it. Surely the Minister will have to admit that, as bad as things were with Obama, it has become more dangerous. Watching Trump talking about eating chocolate cake when the news came through that the air strikes took place is frightening. Only recently, Trump made it plain to the military and the CIA that they could make their own decisions on the ground as to where and when to bomb and use drones. Under Obama, as bad as it was, the decisions were run through the White House bureaucracy and it involved lawyers. With Trump, the attitude is, "Don't worry about the limits or the lawyers. If you feel the need to bomb somewhere, go for it". We are talking about people who have a vested interest in promoting the arms industry. We have to disassociate ourselves from this military activity. We have to take a neutral position. I do not expect the Irish Government to support Assad or the Russians but I wish to God we were not supporting the US military effort either.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-13 00:00:00	European Council: Statements	361	Deputy Wallace and I disagree on a wide range of issues in regard to foreign policy and, indeed, domestic policy but there are two issues here with which I fully agree with him. The first is that there is not, in my view, any military solution to the situation in Syria and there must be a political and diplomatic solution. Second, I share Deputy Wallace's horror at the continuing conflict in Syria and its impact on the population of Syria and the wider population of the region. The last time I saw anything that looked like real progress involving broadly-based international support was in late 2015 and early 2016, at the time of the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 2254. I believe that resolution is still important in that it set out a roadmap for peace, and while it has not yet been possible to follow it, that resolution of the United Nations still remains the guide for our collective efforts. International political dynamics have changed considerably since the resolution was adopted over a year ago and we are seeing further shifts in recent weeks. The International Syria Support Group, which is co-chaired by the US and Russia, had earlier offered some cause for optimism. It remains to be seen if there is a real prospect of that track being renewed. However, the immediate goal of the international community must be the renewal of the Geneva process. On the ground we need to see a full cessation of hostilities and the lifting of the various sieges in the cities throughout Syria. In the meantime, Ireland will continue to play a very strong role in the sustainability of countrywide humanitarian access in order that humanitarian relief from the various countries, including Ireland, can be received and distributed to those people who are most in need. I do not see a military solution. I see a political solution and a diplomatic solution, and I see that coming through the Geneva process.
