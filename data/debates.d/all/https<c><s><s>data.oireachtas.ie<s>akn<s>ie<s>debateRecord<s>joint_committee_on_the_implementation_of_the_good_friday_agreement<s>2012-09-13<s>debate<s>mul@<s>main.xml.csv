Apologies have been received from Senator Martin McAleese, Deputies Joe O'Reilly and Michael Kitt, Mr. Mark Durkan, MP, and Ms Margaret Ritchie, MP.  Hopefully, this will be a fruitful meeting.  I ask everyone to turn off their mobile telephones because they interfere with the sound system.  Today, we will discuss the roads programme relating to the A5, N2, M1 and the N14 but I will allow members from Kerry, Cavan and so on to digress.  The purpose of the meeting is to examine how we can move access to the north west forward in a constructive way.  The more dialogue we have the better.  Notwithstanding the legal challenge lodged last Tuesday regarding the A5 project, it is important to continue with the dialogue and I look forward to a constructive meeting.  I am pleased to welcome political and administrative representatives of a number of councils, including the following: the Mayor of Monaghan County Council, Councillor Hugh McElvaney and the council's acting manager, Mr. David Fallon; the Mayor of Donegal County Council, Councillor Frank McBrearty, and the county manager, Mr. Seamus Neely; the chairman of Dungannon and South Tyrone Borough Council, Councillor Phelim Gildernew, and acting chief executive officer of the council, Mr. Iain Frazer; the Mayor of Derry City Council, Councillor Kevin Campbell, and the strategic director, Mr. John Kelpie, representing the chief executive of the council, Ms Sharon O'Connor; Councillor Frankie Donnelly from Omagh District Council, who is representing the chairman; and the vice chairman of Strabane District Council, Councillor Dan Kelly, representing the chairman, and Mr. Danny McSorley, the interim chief executive of Omagh and Strabane district councils.  People representing the various councils have been proactive to date and I hope this forum will help to bring the debate forward and to examine the challenges that lie ahead.  Before I call the witnesses to make their presentations, I would like to advise them that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their remarks.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I call Councillor McBrearty to make his introductory remarks.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-09-13 00:00:00	Cross-Border Transport Links: Discussion	1	I thank the joint committee for receiving our delegation, which comprises both elected members and senior executive staff of all the councils along the route between Derry, Letterkenny and Monaghan and includes Derry, Donegal, Strabane, Omagh, Dungannon, south Tyrone and Monaghan.  Our delegation has been working together for many years on the issue of access to the north west region and how it is connected to the rest of the island from Belfast to Dublin, Galway and Cork.  Today, we are focussing on the connection to Dublin and, in particular, on delivering on the opportunity provided in the Good Friday Agreement.  Our group is truly a cross-Border group which has been working together on a common goal.  We come here today as six councils with a consensus among ourselves for the region.  The peace process has given everybody a lift from the days of the Troubles when we suffered as a region.  There is a positive vibe about things nowadays and about the dividend to be had from peace.  Two examples in my own area are the Riverine project in Strabane and Lifford and the Pettigo-Tullyhommon project.  These two projects span the Border and bring a pleasant environment to a place that suffered in days gone by.  I have heard some say that the north west has been forgotten but I like to say, "Look at what the north west has to offer and what has been achieved over the past ten to 20 years".  I refer to significant investment in the quality and standard of housing, the local road network, water services, major hospital construction projects in Enniskillen, Altnagelvin in Derry and Letterkenny - although we need further investment in health care, in particular, to cut journey times in the first golden hour in serious cases - a top quality education programme to the highest PhD level between Magee University in Derry and Letterkenny Institute of Technology and immediate Project Kelvin broadband access to the US and beyond with the undersea cable coming ashore in County Derry and several connection points in the north west.  The region offers some of the best tourism spots in the world from scenic hills and trails to its unspoilt coastline and beaches.  There are vast fishing rivers, and lakes offering great potential.  We have historic towns and castles and, of course, Derry is the fourth largest city on the island.  Next year it celebrates being a City of Culture and it recently hosted the renowned Clipper Round the World Yacht Race.  We have a well-educated and energetic youth and our job is to help ensure they have a future.  The main road access to the region is vital to our development and economy and will ensure our youth have a future.  I am delighted Deputy McHugh is chairing this meeting as he is familiar with the issues and most supportive of our campaign.  We have broken up the presentation into three parts and I will not cover the ground of other speakers.  I will, therefore, conclude by again thanking the committee for the opportunity to present today and respectfully ask for its help and support in delivering this important road access to the north west.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-09-13 00:00:00	Cross-Border Transport Links: Discussion	3	I thank the Chairman for the invitation to address the committee.  I will set the context for the main policy platforms over the past number of years.  Forgive me if I repeat some things people are familiar with but it is important to put them on the record.  We have a national development plan which sees the Derry-Letterkenny gateway as critical to the north west and there is a commitment in the plan to develop this gateway and to prioritise improving road links to the region.  The North's regional development plan sets out the need for balanced regional development.  The strategy identifies both Omagh and Strabane as hubs or centres for employment and services and the need for connectivity into the strategic road network.  Those are the two policy documents.  We also have the north west gateway initiative to take full advantage of the potential of the region and to prioritise its development and ensure commitments by both governments are looked at closely when it comes to the north west.  The Good Friday Agreement contains commitments to strengthen the physical infrastructure of the region and to rejuvenate major urban centres in the North and in the Border counties.  The St. Andrews Agreement committed to ensuring capacity for long-term capital investment to underpin the economic transformation of the North and to bring long-term benefits to the island as a whole.  That is the context in which this project has been progressed.  Following the St. Andrews Agreement, we had a commitment to a jointly funded £800 million project for the A5.  Members will be aware of budgetary changes last year in which the southern contribution was revised down to an initial €25 million in 2015 and €25 million in 2016.Thankfully the Northern Ireland Executive held its nerve and announced in February it would be proceeding with two sections of the route with substantial northern investment and including the investment committed to by the Taoiseach. We appreciate that that commitment was reinforced at the NSMC meeting not only to progress the two sections that could start immediately where the funding was available but also to continue to have engagement between the transport officials North and South to ensure that the project could continue to be implemented with the remaining sections in time. That is the status of the project. This is a peace dividend project for the north west which experienced decades of underinvestment and was left behind in terms of infrastructure development. This was a key development for the north west and represented a shift away from the back-to-back development policies that had existed theretofore. This is effectively the Good Friday and St. Andrews agreements in working form with both Administrations operating and working together on major infrastructure projects that would be of benefit to the entire island of Ireland. We ask for the committee's support in the implementation of the project that was committed to. We also ask for its support and commitment to the wider infrastructure connectivity of the north west to the rest of the island, which is a major issue. Mr. Seamus Neely will provide some detail on that wider connectivity that is required to make the entire north west competitive when we emerge, as we undoubtedly will, from the current economic situation.

I ask Councillor Hugh McElvaney to make a final political presentation, followed by Mr. Neely, the county manager from Donegal, after which we will invite questions from members and have an open session during which people will be free to contribute.

As mayor of County Monaghan and in the presence of our county manager, Mr. Fallon, we express the support of Monaghan County Council for the committee's endeavours and wish it continued success.  I trust members do not mind if I read - is it in order?  I could talk off the cuff.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-09-13 00:00:00	Cross-Border Transport Links: Discussion	8	I thank the Senator.  Monaghan County Council is particularly conscious that the various participants to the peace process wish to include development opportunities as part of that peace process.  We wish to add our support to the promotion of strategic and local links across the whole island.  Monaghan County Council regards the development of links between the M1, N2, A5 and M14 as essential strategic infrastructure providing an effective interface between the economies, North and South.  We come here today in common purpose with all the other councils North and South, in making the case for improved road infrastructure linking Dublin with the north west and for those other infrastructure projects outlined by other speakers.  Planning policy for the Border region is formulated in a framework with European, national, regional and local dimensions.  The European Spatial Development Perspective, ESDP, has among its objectives economic and social cohesion across the Community.  Strong transport-access development is essential for the promotion of economic corridors within regions.  The continued development of the N14-A5-N2 route would fulfil this criterion.  The national spatial strategy provides a long-term planning framework designed to provide a better social, economic and physical development.  It identified a number of key objectives such as improved infrastructure links between Ireland and Northern Ireland.  It also emphasised that the Border region must complement the objectives in the regional development strategy for Northern Ireland regarding the major role for Derry and its Donegal hinterland.  Monaghan County Council wishes to play its role in providing such a central infrastructure as the A5-N2 route, part of which lies within our county.  The section from Clontibret in Monaghan to Aughnacloy in Tyrone is seriously deficient in terms of safety and future capacity.  This was initially identified in the NRA national road-needs study published in 1998.  The N2 Clontibret to Northern Ireland Border road scheme was also included in the national development plan, Transport 21, the national spatial strategy, and regional and county development plans.  It is fully compatible with the A5 western transport corridor scheme and would require improved linkage between Ireland and Northern Ireland and improved access between Donegal, Derry and Dublin.  Perhaps I should say linkage between the South and Northern Ireland rather than Ireland and Northern Ireland as if there were two different countries.  The scheme is currently at the route corridor selection stage with a route corridor 400 m wide.  In essence this means that a band of land is sterilised for development which is 28 km long and 400 m wide, potentially hampering development for private individuals, farming and business.  Monaghan County Council has lobbied the Government for a further allocation of €1.5 million to progress the design to a preferred route which would be approximately 100 m wide.  This would free up three quarters of the sterilised land along the route.  If this amount were allocated, route selection could be achieved within one year and it would be feasible to progress to construction within three years, depending on availability of further funding.  In any event the N2 project phasing could be agreed, based on the overall phasing of the N14-A5-N2.  Monaghan County Council also supports the acceleration of the A5-N2 link at Aughnacloy, as this is an integral part of the N2 improvements south of the Border.  As I mentioned previously, safety along the existing N2 is of major concern to Monaghan County Council.  We are very appreciative of improvements that have been carried out on the N2 north of Monaghan in recent years and also the proposed continuation of improvements, all of which is funded by the NRA.  Nevertheless, as safety continues to be an issue, it is imperative that the major scheme from Clontibret to the Border is progressed.  The collision rate on this section is far in excess of the national average.  The N14-A5-N2 transport link will complement Project Kelvin which Councillor McBrearty already mentioned.  That project will improve broadband communications, providing direct connectivity between North America, Northern Ireland and the South.  This provides efficient telecommunications to Belfast, Derry, Coleraine, Armagh, Strabane, Omagh, Monaghan, Castleblaney, Dundalk, Drogheda and Dublin.  The combination of road and telecoms projects will address peripherality and Border problems, thereby promoting business and economic development across the island which is of particular importance to County Monaghan.  I thank the members of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement for their interest.  I restate our support for the valuable work being done by the committee.  When I left Corcaghan, County Monaghan, this morning I thought I was only coming to Dublin to pay lip service to this project.  However, as I sit in this room I look at all the powerful people present from North and South, including MPs from Northern Ireland.  I cannot believe they are present.  They include my neighbour, Ms Gildernew, MP, from Fermanagh, and Mr. Alasdair McDonnell, MP, whom I only ever saw on television, Deputy Feighan, who is always in trouble, and Deputy Smith of Fianna Fáil from Cavan.  I am delighted to be here among all those present which shows we are really serious about this project.  I wish it well and hope to live to see it come to fruition in a very short period of time.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-09-13 00:00:00	Cross-Border Transport Links: Discussion	10	I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the opportunity to attend today.  I am glad to be part of the delegation of the six councils that have come together in collaboration to ensure we advocate for and help, as much as possible, to bring about the construction of the piece of infrastructure we are discussing today, which will effectively link the north west with the south east and vice versa.  In the interests of being brief, I intend to cover four broad headings, namely, a quick reminder of the needs, an acknowledgment of the potential that exists in the region and all parts along the way, some discussion around the practicalities we all have to face in trying to achieve this task and, finally, some requests in areas where we feel members can help us into the future.  They say a picture tells a thousand words.  Members have a hard copy of the presentation in front of them and I draw attention to the figure shown.  If members follow the colour codings, solid blue and solid green lines depict motorway or high-level dual carriageway.  At a glance, this tell us that above a line running approximately from Ballina through Longford and Cavan and then back up to Coleraine, an entire region is without a motorway or high-level dual carriageway.  Some 500,000 people live in a subset of that region, stretching from Sligo through Cavan and up to Coleraine, which means a huge portion of the population of the island does not have access to the same level of quick connectivity, with predictable travel times.  This is a huge difficulty.  There is great latent potential in that region in terms of people, skills, business and the economy, as well as in regard to topography, the tourism income that can come from that and the culture.  It is not just about latent potential because there is also a huge advantage to other parts of the island that sell products into our region.  Very often, people are put off considering our region as a destination to sell into by virtue of the difficult travel times and the greater expenses associated with that.  To reiterate, this entire region, with a population of over 500,000, does not have either a motorway or a high-level dual carriageway.  Councillor Donnelly talked about those portions of the A5 that are going to construction, namely, City of Derry to Strabane and Omagh to Ballygawley.  There are other matters of fact which are unfortunate for us, particularly the lack of a rail link into the north-west region other than the existing link between Derry and Belfast, and the lack of an air link between Dublin and City of Derry Airport, as the previously existing one was terminated.  It must be acknowledged that Derry is the second largest city in Northern Ireland and the fourth largest city on the island of Ireland, an important point.  We want to focus on the positives and how we can build on them.  However, while acknowledging the region has huge potential, there are matters of fact which are difficult for us.  It is a region with high levels of deprivation.  Derry or Londonderry has the highest level of unemployment in Northern Ireland at 8.8% and Strabane the third highest at 7.1%, which is above the average of 5.5%.  In our own county of Donegal, the census of 2011 showed that youths aged under 25 have an unemployment rate of 49%, and I acknowledge that many of our youth have emigrated.  It is a very significant issue for us as overall unemployment in the county is of the order of 20%.  There are other issues.  For example, communities in the north west must travel greater distances to access key services such as acute hospitals, medical centres of excellence, colleges and training facilities.  When we see the drive to move towards centres of excellence and towards putting facilities in places where efficiencies can be gained, the flip side of that coin is that we must then fill in the infrastructure that is necessary to connect people to and allow them to access those services.  We have a dispersed rural community which depends completely on roads and, by its nature, is extremely difficult to serve with a public transport system, and we have a historic deficit in strategic roads, as I noted.  Several issues arise around this, including the collision rate on rural, two-lane roads, which is 9.8 per 100 million km of travel time, whereas the average for motorways is one quarter of that figure and, for high-level dual carriageways, one third of that figure.  To take two areas in particular - the N14 from Strabane to Letterkenny and the N2 from the Border heading south towards Dublin - there are portions of both roads that have 3.5 to 5.5 times the average collision rate.  While we talk of 9.8 as an average for two-lane roads, portions of the N14 have as much as 50 times the average rate and that portion of the N2 has close to three or 3.5 times the average.  There are huge issues and costs associated with this in terms of managing the consequences of the collisions, which is not to ignore the importance of life and the fact that we need to improve the safety of our roads to the point where we do not lose lives on them.  With regard to opportunity costs, there has been a detailed appraisal of the A5 scheme which confirms its economic worth.  It involves 260 permanent new jobs and €180 million in business efficiencies.  There would be a huge boost to the construction sector, which is extremely important for us in the north west at present as it is an area that was traditionally very reliant on the construction industry and has a huge number of skills and competences available and ready to go.  To take some examples, the Omagh to Ballygawley section of the A5 will provide direct employment for 750 people, so 750 families will gain an income for the construction period.  It will generate between £53 million and £70 million in wages, provide jobs for 150 subcontractors, generating a further £100 million, and will generate £55 million in materials and £45 million in plant and equipment.  An immediate factor to take into account is that it will reduce costs on the social assistance side in other parts of the State that would have to be carried in any event.  In terms of funding and implementation, we are aware a working group was asked to develop a revised funding and implementation plan earlier this year.  Again, this is something we would like the committee to help with in terms of better understanding the outcomes to see how we can take it forward.  Looking at it from our own perspective, it is a unique cross-Border, cross-party scheme, and our delegation is doing something which perhaps would not traditionally have happened in the past in that we are looking at this from end to end.  We are looking at joining up the dots where various territories would normally end, which is a huge positive in bringing this forward.  We have put a figure of €2 billion on the present estimated cost of the whole route, although it is worth looking more closely at that figure.  Some £280 million has been committed for the A5 on the Northern side and £50 million on the southern side.  The €2 billion figure is perhaps an amalgamation of some of the more expensive options for subsections but if we take the more affordable options, the overall cost actually works out at €1.65 billion.  Given that €350 million of that is already committed, we are looking at a funding gap of approximately €1.3 billion.  We feel various options can be looked at to fund this.  Some of the cost of funding will derive naturally from the economic spin-off of the construction but some will also derive from avoiding costs on the unemployment contribution side that will necessarily be required if this project does not happen.  We are considering options such as Exchequer borrowing by both Governments.The benefit to cost ratio of the A5 is 1.99:1, which is very strong, and I estimate it is very reflective of the benefit to cost ratio for the entire piece. Options such as delayed payments or PPP arrangements could be used for some sections. INTERREG V will come on board shortly and while we acknowledge the overall amount of money available from this will not construct the road, it should certainly be targeted to help close out the design of certain sections. It is important that funding for the project be included in the further development of recovery programmes. We acknowledge the project could be phased in during an eight- to ten-year period. Looking at how this phasing might naturally develop, the construction of the City of Derry to Strabane and the Omagh to Ballygawley sections are under way or about to begin. Phase one could also include the preliminary road design on the section from Aughnacloy to Clontibret. The CPO for the N14 from Letterkenny to Strabane is ready to go and there is work to be done on the route selection and design for the section from Aughnacloy to the motorway. Phase two could include the completion of statutory processes and the final design and construction of the Strabane bypass, the Strabane to Omagh section, the Omagh bypass and the Ballygawley to Aughnacloy sections. The design of the section from Letterkenny to Strabane is ready to go to CPO. The phase could also include final design for the section from Aughnacloy to Clontibret and statutory processes for the section from Clontibret to the motorway. Phases three and four could involve the construction of the section from Aughnacloy to Clontibret, and the final design and construction of the section from Clontibret to the motorway. We call on the committee to advocate what we have put together as a collaborative proposal for the construction of this infrastructure, which would create a link to the north west and release the potential of the area to the southern Government, the Northern Ireland Executive and the London Government, along with the North-South Ministerial Council and the British Irish Council. We are delighted to have had this opportunity to come before the committee and we invite continued engagement on this matter. We very much want to bring to the table what resources we have in all councils in terms of development, design and advocacy. Coming before the committee today is a good opportunity to confirm this. We call on the committee to use its influence to ensure the construction of the dual carriageway connections to the north west is government policy in both jurisdictions and is a key strategic priority for the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. We ask the committee to use its good offices to secure immediate funding for the necessary design, which is extremely important so we are ready to go with the remaining parts when the opportunity arises. This also includes statutory processes. We also call on the committee to ensure funding mechanisms are put in place for completion of the scheme in its entirety. An opportunity arises for conversation and debate on other innovative ways of phasing the project along the lines of what we have presented. We call on the committee to use its good offices to ensure the scheme is included in the developing recovery programme.

It is very heartening to see that so much detailed work has been undertaken by local authorities on both sides of the Border.  Mr. Neely had the good fortune to work in Monaghan as well as in Cavan and he is now the county manager in Donegal.  The plan is ambitious.  It is a good plan and it is necessary if we are to develop the potential of the north west and the southern part of the Border area.  We all know good access is particularly important for economic development.  If a region is to be economically competitive it must have a proper road network with good and easy access to it.  I am very supportive of the programme.  It is necessary to make the region competitive. The Donegal county manager spoke about the population from Sligo across to Monaghan being a sizeable portion of the island's population so it is an area that needs development.  I welcome Councillor McElvaney's presentation and concur fully with its contents.  We do not always agree in full on every issue but I agree wholeheartedly with the proposals he outlined.  Councillor McElvaney raised the issue of safety and Mr. Neely spoke about the very high collision rates on other routes.  We need economic development but we also need safety for our citizens, North and South.  If we were living in an ideal world where funding was not an issue, and these projects were to get the go-ahead for the planning process and preparatory work, would a ten- or 12-year timeframe be necessary for the completion of what Mr. Neely described as the end-to-end project?
#SeanConlon	unknown-#SeanConlon-party	unknown-#SeanConlon-dob	unknown-#SeanConlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-09-13 00:00:00	Cross-Border Transport Links: Discussion	13	I welcome the witnesses from various local authorities and organisations, particularly my good friend the mayor of Monaghan, Councillor Hugh McElvaney, and the county manager, Mr. David Fallon.  I represent the part of County Monaghan through which the N2 passes and I live quite close to it.  I am very familiar with the concerns and the positive views people have with regard to the road being developed.  I applaud the sentiments and aspirations of the project.  It is a clear, unambiguous signal from the Irish Government that we wish to be involved in the upgrading of the road to the north west by providing €50 million in 2015 and 2016 for the A5 section of the project.  Mr. Neely mentioned the issue of funding.  My major concerns in the short term have always been how to provide funding for the road and determining the priorities in a time of recession when allocating funding for various projects in the State.  The local minor injuries unit in Monaghan town no longer provides a weekend service and is now a nine-to-five, five-day-a-week service because €200,000 was not available from HSE.  It is a massive local issue.  Funding is a key issue for the Government.    In the long term I would like to see the road upgraded to motorway status but in the short term my priority is to protect hospital and educational services.  We have a large infant population and we need to develop the local primary school structure in the Republic.  Our hospitals are under serious funding pressures because we are in a bailout programme.  We have been tasked by the IMF and the ECB to remove €3.5 billion from the budget this year.  Of this, €2.25 billion will be achieved through cuts and €1.25 billion will be achieved through tax increases.  This is the reality the Irish Government faces in the budget.  We have lost our sovereignty.  Previous governments over the past ten years have left us in a position whereby Ireland has lost its economic independence.  We have lost partial sovereignty and the task of the Government is to get it back.  To my mind the fundamental function of the Government is to get people back to work and regain our independence.  We will regain our independence only when the IMF and the ECB leave the country and when we balance our budget and are again in control of our finances.  In the short term my major concern is that we protect our hospital and educational facilities budgets as much as possible, and my longer-term concern is that we roll out this project.  I can see the need for strong regional balance in the long term.  The citizens of the north west are just as important as those in the south east and south west who already have motorway structures.  However, in the short term my major concern is funding.  If funding becomes available in the next five or ten years we should certainly progress this project as quickly as possible and it should be the first motorway project to proceed.  This is my position and it is one shared by many of my constituents who live along the route. I wish everyone involved in advancing the project over the next number of years well. I have set out the perspective of the Irish Government in terms of pressures on it in regard to what it must deliver in December, namely, €2.25 billion in cuts and €1.25 billion in tax increases, at the behest of our economic masters in the IMF and ECB.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-09-13 00:00:00	Cross-Border Transport Links: Discussion	14	I join with other speakers in welcoming all of our witnesses here today.  This is the first time witnesses from five councils have appeared together before the committee.  That they all are on the one page in terms of the issue before us is a powerful message.  We are in a difficult position.  We are all aware of how essential this project is.  On the issue of a strategic roads network map, the InterTradeIreland project undertaken some years ago which mapped the roads, investment and jobs in this country identified a linkage between good road infrastructure, investment and jobs.  It is evident from the map that the north west will be left behind if this project is not pursued vigorously.  Sinn Féin has supported the infrastructure project as an essential element of the economic renewal of the north west given the high level of job losses across the North, in particular within the Border region.  This road is essential in terms of the connection of the region with the island of Ireland.  The Executive has supported continued development of the road and has set aside €400 million to assist in that regard.  However, the decision of the Irish Government to delay the project has resulted in a disjointing of the project.  It is regrettable that the money set aside by it has been withdrawn from the equation.  The Executive has honoured its part of the bargain in terms of the promise given to the people of the region that this road would be provided.  It is time for the Irish Government to review its decision and to reinstate the funding for this road.  This issue feeds into a wider agenda in that people opposed to full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and St. Andrews Agreement will hide behind the actions of the Irish Government in pulling funding for this road.   I believe the committee should write to the Taoiseach calling for a reinstatement of funding for this road and the roll-out of the entire A5 project.  We should also seek a detailed breakdown of what the €50 million previously allocated by the Irish Government to this project has been spent on.  We must work on the presumption that this road will go ahead and, as stated by Mr. Neely, continue to lobby and ensure we are pushing the right buttons in terms of this project going ahead.  We have heard a compelling presentation this morning of the economic value of this project in the short term.  I believe its economic value, in conjunction with the safety issues highlighted, will in the long term be of vital importance to the people of the north-west region.  The counties affected are Donegal, Monaghan, Tyrone and Derry and the wider hinterland of Fermanagh, Cavan and Sligo.  We should be robust in our arguments to have funding for the A5 project reinstated and to have the project completed as quickly as possible to ensure we are not here again in ten years time talking about what remains to be done.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-09-13 00:00:00	Cross-Border Transport Links: Discussion	16	As regards what would be the natural build all things being equal, the Omagh-Strabane and Strabane-Omagh bypasses are shovel ready.  There is a CPO in respect of the Strabane-Letterkenny bypass, which includes the bridge from Lifford to Strabane.  The balance of that route from Lifford to Letterkenny is ready to go to CPO.  The Ballygawley to Aughnacloy section requires some design.  The remaining section is from Aughnacloy to the motorway.  In real terms, progressive phasing is possible with funding being spread over an eight year period, which would not be that far off what a natural build period would be in any event.  That is the case being made today.  Now is the time to move forward with the statutory process.  This is important because when the economy turns - and it will do so - we will need to be in a position to get in at the near end of prices before they rise again.  I acknowledge the points made by Deputy Conlon.  However, the point must also be made that the solution will become more expensive if we leave it too late.  I am thinking in this regard of the cost of projects in the South which would have been much cheaper had they been undertaken sooner.  The same point is relevant now.  The longer we leave it to get started the more expensive will be the solution, in part because prices will rise again and our deficit will be greater.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-09-13 00:00:00	Cross-Border Transport Links: Discussion	17	I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to contribute.  I am delighted there are so many influential people here today, including my party colleagues and others from Northern Ireland.  I concur with Ms Gildernew MP that the north-west region and Border counties have suffered owing to the Troubles in Northern Ireland.  However, we have moved forward through the peace process.  The north-west region has suffered as a result of policing on both sides of the Border and a lack of funding.  I agree with the points made by Deputy Smith and Ms Gildernew, MP.  However, I am somewhat disappointed with what Deputy Conlon had to say.  Donegal is also suffering as a result of HSE cuts.  We must look at the bigger picture.  We must be able to catch up with Dublin when we come out of the recession.  From a business perspective, one must speculate to accumulate.  Our appearance before this committee today is important to the region and Border counties.  We are united in terms of what we in the north-west and Border counties have to offer.  It is important we are listened to and that this project is completed so that in ten or 15 years we can provide our educated workforce with jobs.  There will always be an element of emigration from the region.  However, we must be able to offer our children a future.  We are united in terms of our pitch to the committee to have this infrastructure put in place.  The Chairman knows more than anybody the importance of these routes to the region.  I am disappointed that Deputy Conlon does not appear to have grasped the importance of moving forward.

Ms Gildernew, MP, is correct that the north west cannot afford not to have this infrastructure.  The country will, when recovery arrives, move on without us if it has not been put in place.  That is an important point in terms of the longer-term growth of the region.  Deputy Conlon spoke about the difficult funding choices that have to be made, which we very much appreciate, but there is also a realisation that right across Europe, one cannot only cut one's way out of recession. There is a need for a stimulus and growth package, and that voice is growing right across Europe. This piece of infrastructure needs to be prioritised in any recovery, investment or stimulus programme. That is where it should be positioned.

I indicated that of all the motorway projects, this is the first that should be advanced when economic circumstances improve.  I also made it clear that my priority at the moment is to protect the health care and education budgets.  I would like to know if Councillor McBrearty would prefer bed closures after this winter's budget in order to divert money to this project.  Should there be a diversion of the school building programme?  Is that the policy of Councillor McBrearty or the Labour Party?  I am following Government policy in the provision of funding.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-09-13 00:00:00	Cross-Border Transport Links: Discussion	24	Time is of the essence and I will be brief.  I welcome the group before us as it is very heartening for me to see such a formidable group here.  I would like to see them return to discuss health emergencies and other similarly important issues.  The A5 is being discussed today.  My comments are aired without implication but we need a united front on this.  It is no use if I say I am 100% behind this and somebody else is only 95% behind it.  We must all be on the one page, North and South.  We must recognise that if there was a choice, we would not start here.  The financial difficulties exist in both the North and South.  Despite the economic difficulties, steady progress will continue to be made on the Northern side of this project, although it may not be as fast as planned a number of years ago.  My sense is that sacrifices have been made on the Northern side and other projects have been squeezed.  This is top of the list on the Northern side.  The next comment is honest rather than a criticism.  Will the Aughnacloy to Clontibret section ever be done or will it be 20 years down the road?  There is a sense in the North that all this can go on around the A5 from the Border through to Strabane and Derry but there will be a bumpy or bendy bit in the middle.  I will not put it any more strongly than that.  I speak for anybody with a Northern interest in appealing to the parties in Government here on the issue.  I know that nobody can question the commitment of the Chairman and the work he has done in preserving this project, and I compliment him on that.  Nevertheless, we must work in a non-party political fashion.  This is a community effort and we must put up a united front.  Party politics should be set aside and the project must be taken as a priority in this case.  We must ensure that when the position improves on this side of the Border, money should be set aside to maintain confidence in the North.  If the Aughnacloy section is not completed, it will justify some sections in the North not being done.  The project will proceed in a piecemeal fashion.  There is a need for all of us to work on a united front and ensure we can stand shoulder to shoulder.  Any piece falling from the jigsaw will affect another piece.  More than anything else I want to see this project being completed, although I represent an area a bit further to the east.  Nevertheless, the poverty and marginalisation of many aspects of life in the west, right into Donegal, is important to me.  We must sing off the same hymn sheet.  The risk is always that either in the North or South, we may begin to sing from a different hymn sheet.  I urge the Chairman to keep up this work and I know the effort he has made with the Government to ensure it stays on the agenda.  I thank him for that.

I am especially impressed with the all-party and all-Ireland approach.  There are local government representatives from both jurisdictions present, and that is commendable.  Listening to the presentation, I am particularly conscious that in Donegal, 49% of people under 25 are unemployed.  Donegal and my own county of Kerry have the highest percentage of unemployment at approximately 25% or 26%.  There are 500,000 people in the area under discussion, which effectively has no proper infrastructure.  The consequences of not having any proper infrastructure mean that from an economic perspective, there is suffering.  That is very obvious when we consider the unemployment statistics in the area and the amount of investment that goes into it.  It is essential that we continue to work together and we should make this a priority for the Government in order to provide justice for people in disadvantaged areas arising from a lack of proper infrastructure.  The point has also been well made about safety aspects arising from an inferior infrastructure and an outdated road programme.  The consequences of this are more accidents, and Donegal has one of the highest rates in the country for loss of life or serious accidents on the road.  We would be failing in our elected capacity if we did not take that on board and make this issue a priority.  There was a debate on our priorities.  Unless we achieve growth and jobs in the economy, nothing will be made a priority as there is no money.  Effectively, when investing in a capital project like this, the outcome will be job creation, with more money circulating in the economy and coming to the Exchequer.  We should consider the matter in that light.  That is why we must make this a priority.  The Chairman should get every support and we must work together on this.  From the perspective of my party and everybody else, we must achieve this as an infrastructural priority that will bring about job creation and economic growth.

It is reassuring that many MLAs and MPs are appearing before the committee, making very valuable contributions on many issues.  I represent Roscommon and south Leitrim, part of the area mentioned by Deputy Conlan, and I come from Boyle.  The motorway network over the past few years has gone to Galway and Belfast but the north west was neglected.  Much money was spent and we have a great road network.However, they were not within budget. I believe there is the political will to complete this road. Perhaps the money is not available at present, but the political will is certainly there. This could be an opportunity to invest and stimulate, make savings and get value for money. It is a project this committee should pursue and promote. There are huge difficulties but the committee should advocate the building of these roads. The area certainly needs them. I shared an office with Deputy Joe McHugh for five years and that was quite obvious because he was late most of the time, whether it was due to Aughnacloy, Ballygawley or Omagh. I am familiar with the area and the committee has participated on many field trips to Omagh and Derry so we are aware of the situation. I thank Deputy McElvaney for his comments.

To make an observation, when I was a member of the Opposition for nine years I was never in trouble.  As the late Fianna Fáil Minister, former Deputy Seamus Brennan, said to the Green Party on the formation of the Government: "Lads, welcome to senior hurling."

I am a Dublin Deputy but this issue is a no-brainer.  It ticks all the boxes in respect of jobs and when people have jobs there are fewer people on welfare.  There is also the issue of safety.  Not everybody who is involved in a crash dies and there can be huge costs for the State as a consequence.  There are huge cost implications in addition to the effect it has on families.  We are all in favour of promoting trade.  As outlined in the document provided this morning, it increases the possibilities for trade and would make it cheaper to move goods from A to B.  It is also about building the all-Ireland economy, and the roll-out of that is Government policy.  We know there is a difficulty in part of that area with the provision of broadband and this could be linked to that.  Fibre-optic cable could be laid along the route as it is built.  There is also the issue of co-operation in this regard.  Much of it is not just due to the Troubles, but to partition.  Clearly, partition has affected the region.  Historically, the area has not been developed and that is directly due to partition.  There is a strong view that people feel let down by the two governments, but particularly the Irish Government.  A solemn commitment was made on this matter.  People can say the money is not available but there are private pension funds investing in other economies, banks and in other developments.  Surely this is one of the areas where money in the national pension fund should be considered.  The money is there.  It makes sense, it will grow the economy and it will stimulate jobs.  It just does not make sense that we are not going ahead with this.  I do not know if the permission of the troika is required, but clearly the two governments should be considering it.  If it reduces the number of people on social welfare, that is a positive result.  If it would develop an area and open it to tourism and trade, that should be a priority for the governments.  What has happened in this regard does not make sense.  It is important that we invite the Minister responsible for the roads project to meet the committee, but it is a matter for the Government in respect of its priorities.  My priorities are the same as those of other members in regard to the HSE and so forth.  However, there is funding that could be used and the frustrating issue for many of us is that this funding is not being used for positive projects such as this, which tick all the boxes with regard to development, trade, jobs and growth.  That is what I cannot understand.  The document makes sense and it should be sent to the Taoiseach and the Cabinet.  They need to look at this matter again.  The British Government also has a role and it must step up to the plate in respect of the roll-out of this project.  I cannot understand why it has not received approval to proceed.  I do not believe it is down to this nonsense of the money not being available.  The money is there within the economy so let us put our thinking caps on for pulling it together.  The document clearly outlines the savings that could be made and that in itself adds to the argument that this project can and should go ahead in the near future rather than continuously putting it off, which seems to be the current proposal.  Finally, I cannot understand how €50 million will be spent on pre-development of this project.  Could one of the witnesses outline what exactly will happen there?  Priority must be given to the Lifford-Letterkenny link and the Monaghan-Aughnacloy link.  Anybody who travels that route knows it is a disaster and people try to avoid the area if they can.  The money must be found immediately for this project.

I welcome the delegation and commend it on the detailed work it has carried out to date and on the excellent presentation this morning.  We are all in agreement on this.  It is vital that there is cross-party support and that we are all united and show a united front on this issue.  A good road network is vital to encourage business and tourism opportunities.  I live near the Border in Dundalk and I have first-hand experience of seeing the welcome opportunities that building a motorway between Dundalk and Dublin has provided for the area.  Even in the past year an amount of firms and factories have come to our area, so it is vital.  As Deputy Crowe said, it is a no-brainer.  We should all be on board and make the strongest possible case to the Cabinet and the Taoiseach for its implementation.  I worked in Monaghan for 17 years, after being interviewed for my teaching position by Councillor McElvaney.  He probably does not remember me.  Thanks to him I spent 17 years teaching in Monaghan and I frequently travelled the road between Monaghan, Aughnacloy and the surrounding area.  There have been many accidents and, unfortunately, some fatalities on that road.  I agree that we must provide for safety.  It is something the people in the area have been campaigning for over many years and we must consider it.  It is a no-brainer when one considers the economics, the positivity it will generate and the safety aspect.  It is vital that we proceed with it.  In addition, there is also the number of jobs and the job opportunities the delegation said would be available.  That is something we must also promote.
#MaryMWhite	unknown-#MaryMWhite-party	unknown-#MaryMWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryMWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-09-13 00:00:00	Cross-Border Transport Links: Discussion	31	I will try to be brief.  First, I believe this is the most exciting project this committee has seen since our meetings started.  We should make this project the number one priority of the committee under the leadership of Deputy McHugh.  We must approach the project in a businesslike manner, not like a committee.  We must drive it forward to get this road delivered.  There are many anomalies on this island.  There are different currencies in the North and the Twenty-six Counties. I find it farcical that different currencies are used on this small island. I recently came back from a journey through France, Italy, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Austria and Germany, most of which use the euro. I was able to use the same currency as I drove from one country to another, but I cannot do so on this small and remote island. Having travelled by car through Europe over the last month, I have decided that Ireland is as remote as Iceland. I never before realised how remote we are. This little island is cut off. We had civil strife for 30 years, but we now have a chance. I find it exciting that politicians and members of the Executive are coming together from across the parties and from North and South. We have to make this happen. If I were the Chairman, I would make it the main priority of the joint committee. It is the only way we will get jobs in the north west. We all know that the Border counties have suffered and that County Donegal is remote. The main priority on this part of the island is job creation. Giving people jobs has to become a national obsession. We all know it is now quicker to travel to Cork by road than by train. One can get to Cork in three hours. It used to be almost a full day's work. We have heard it takes an hour and 40 minutes to get to Belfast by road. We know how smooth it is. One can do a full day's work after one's journey. There was a time when if one went on the train to Belfast, one had to pull oneself together to do one's work. There is tremendous connectivity on this part of the island now. We have to ensure the road infrastructure is in place to enable people to get from Dublin to the north west quickly. That would allow the economy to grow and develop. When people get jobs, they pay tax. I am sorry to say I differ from my colleague who was too parochial in what he said. The road will provide connectivity between various towns and areas. As Councillor McBrearty said, jobs will be provided when the road is being built, which will take people off social welfare. I feel passionately that this should be our priority. I would love to be in Deputy McHugh's shoes as Chairman of this committee because this needs to be driven as a business project. As a Government Deputy, he has to convince his colleagues that money needs to be prioritised for this scheme. The development of this road would solve many problems and change the whole economic environment. After many years when nothing happened in the Border counties, as our guests know, this committee has to fight to make up for the opportunities that were lost over 30 years. As part of that approach, we should fight to ensure a common currency is introduced on both sides of the Border. I hope I have not spoken for too long. This is the best meeting of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement I have attended. I know we can get our teeth into this project. As Deputy Crowe said, the money is always there when the relevant Minister makes something his or her priority.

#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-09-13 00:00:00	Cross-Border Transport Links: Discussion	35	I would like to extend a sincere welcome to the delegation.  This is an important day for the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  This is the first meeting I have attended as a member of the committee.  Following changes in the membership of various committees, I have been allocated a position on this committee.  If all of our meetings are as important as this one, it will be a good committee to be on.  I have strong links with County Donegal.  I have visited the county on many occasions.  During the Troubles, I chose to travel through Sligo on many occasions.  I have travelled through Cavan and Monaghan on other occasions.  It is plain to see that this area needs investment so that its infrastructure matches the wonderful enthusiasm in those counties for meeting the challenges they face.  I represent a county that is inundated with motorways.  The M4, M6, M7, M9 and M10 pass through the county.  One might say we have many motorways.  Practically every village and town in County Kildare has been bypassed.  We have to reflect on the benefit of those roads for the towns and villages in question.  I suggest without fear of contradiction that each of the towns and villages in question has benefited significantly from the changes that have happened.  They are now able to look at the possibilities for economic, tourism and community development that are open to them.  When the main traffic is taken out of a town, that town is suddenly able to grow and benefit from it.  That is what will happen, with the help of God, when this road is completed.  All the towns bypassed will be able to develop accordingly.  The problem is that when multinationals come to look at a town, they will decide to go elsewhere if the necessary infrastructure is not available to suit the development.  I have seen this challenge in my home town.  It is a huge incentive for all the towns on the route in question, some of which are in the North and some of which are in the South.  The Government and the Oireachtas must provide for those towns and work with the Northern Executive to ensure this road is built.  It is obvious that it will have financial implications.  One can divide and separate the project in one's own interests, but in the context of overall development it is clear that everything will benefit if it goes ahead.  Having spoken to the Chairman about this matter on various occasions, I am aware it is one of his driving issues.  I hope this committee will continue to show an interest in it.  This meeting should not be a mere one-day wonder.  We should not invite these people to come to Dublin for a debate and promise all kinds of things without putting in place a calendar of events that will ensure the project is driven forward.  I suggest we should make plans to meet in Belfast, at some location along the proposed motorway or elsewhere at regular intervals to examine how progress can be made.  It is only then that we will meet these challenges and overcome the problems that exist.  We should put an inventory in place to ensure that we and our colleagues and friends in the Northern Executive and in the various councils try to meet these challenges as we make progress and get this job done.  There is no doubt that every town and village that will be bypassed by the proposed motorway will benefit from it.  I have seen that in my local area.  Anyone who has seen the other motorways that have been developed across this country will be aware that benefits have accrued from them.  I thank the delegation for attending this meeting.  It is important for us to have an exchange of views.  The next time we consider this matter, we should draw up an agenda that will indicate how progress can be made.

I would like to ask questions rather than setting out all my thoughts.  Everything that has been said is very important.  I appreciate what has been said about the establishment of a work programme to take us forward.  That would be quite useful.  Have any conversations taken place between the two Ministers who are responsible for road transport and representatives of the relevant council areas?  If so, what has the response been?  If such contact has not happened, we need to see if it can take place.  How can this committee make progress in this regard?  Would it be worth our while to have a conversation with the relevant Ministers?  Such efforts to take this matter forward should be part of our work programme.  I would like my questions to be answered.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-09-13 00:00:00	Cross-Border Transport Links: Discussion	38	I thank the Chairman and members for the invitation to address the joint committee and contribute to this excellent exchange.  I will make a brief contribution on a couple of points that have been raised by members.  The comments made on the discussion with Ministers may be a useful starting point.  At the time the funding for the A5 project was withdrawn, the various councils engaged in extensive discussion with Ministers.  There has, therefore, been a degree of engagement.  In terms of the action points coming out of this meeting, if there is potential for Ministers to address the joint committee, such a discussion would form part of the solution or at least encourage Ministers to recognise the vital importance of the A5-N2 project to the north west.  As has been noted, youth unemployment is a key issue.  It is important to reinforce to the joint committee the point that the issue is not only one of counting the number of unemployment claims but also the hidden issue of exporting our young people.  The impact of unemployment on young people is much more significant than what is showing up in the claimant count.    I acknowledged Deputy Seán Conlon's point about funding pressures.  Everyone present accepts that funding is an issue.  However, it is important that members view the A5 road project as part of the solution to the current problem.  We need jobs and, as Mr. Neely noted, the level of employment predicted as a result of the project is not based on speculation but reality.  The projects are about to proceed.  The consortium appointed for the Strabane to Omagh section of the A5 route is based in the South and includes Sisk, Roadbridge and PT McWilliams.  I do not know if it is possible for the joint committee to take evidence from some of the contractors who have done useful work as they are in a better position than we are to quantify some of the early economic impacts of the project.   A number of members raised the issue of the €50 million provided in funding.  Ms Gildernew, MP, raised this point in terms of obtaining clarification from the Government.  It is our understanding, however, that the €50 million in funding from the Irish Government is already in the budget for the first two sections of the project.  While it will be provided in 2015 and 2016, it will not necessarily give us new elements of projects in that period because it is already committed, as it were, to the two projects that are about to proceed.  The joint committee may wish to obtain more formal clarification on that point.

A great deal of lobbying was done at the time and I am aware that he was in close contact with the Donegal County Manager, Mr. Neely, on the role of Stormont and the need for a proactive approach in Dublin.  I invite the Mayor of Derry, Councillor Kevin Campbell, to comment.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-09-13 00:00:00	Cross-Border Transport Links: Discussion	40	I will be brief as I am conscious of the time.  Five council areas have come together to speak with one voice and collaborate on this issue.  This is an indication of how seriously we view this road project which is very important for our region.  We represent 500,000 Irish citizens.  Now is the time to plan and implement the remaining missing links, finish the A5 project and maximise the return from current investment.  Derry is the fourth largest city on the island.  Its economic future and contribution to the economy of the island depends on the completion of high quality road linkages to Belfast and Dublin.  In short, the A5-N2 dual carriageway is vital to the north west.  We ask for the joint committee's support for the completion of the last remaining radial route to and from Dublin.  We have listened to the economic arguments, all of which stack up and tick the boxes as far as the Governments are concerned.  Infrastructure is vital to any region seeking to create employment and attract inward investment.  The north west, which has been categorised as an economic wasteland for a long time, needs infrastructure.  Completion of the A5-N2 project would turn around the region's economy.  Without the project, we will be left behind again.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-09-13 00:00:00	Cross-Border Transport Links: Discussion	42	I thank the joint committee for being attentive and listening to our presentation.  It is great to be welcomed so warmly in Dublin.  If any part of the A5-N2 dual carriageway and motorway project is not completed, it will have serious consequences.  It is imperative that it is completed to link Dublin with Derry and Letterkenny.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-09-13 00:00:00	Cross-Border Transport Links: Discussion	43	We in County Monaghan believe that a benefit for any part of the region benefits the region as a whole.  Public infrastructure is required.  In classical economics, as practised, for example, in the United States in the 1930s, intervention is always advocated in times of depression.  The public infrastructure created at that time was most effective and dealt with unemployment and costs.  The benefits of this approach roll in when recessions end, as they always do.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-09-13 00:00:00	Cross-Border Transport Links: Discussion	45	Road safety is another concern of paramount importance along the route of the A5 and N2.  Drivers have few opportunities along the route to pass other vehicles which gives rise to driver frustration and adds to road safety problems on the route.  The existing carriageway is deficient in terms of safety and capacity along the entire route.  All going well, the N2 from Aughnacloy to Clontibret could be at construction stage within three years.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-09-13 00:00:00	Cross-Border Transport Links: Discussion	46	To provide a broader context, I will respond to the concerns raised by Deputy Seán Conlon about the budget rather than the specific issue of the A5 road.  We are not coming with a begging bowl.  The Deputy's concern may be that the money should go elsewhere.  I can empathise with the point he makes in that people in my area lost not only weekend services at the regional hospital in Omagh but we lost the entire hospital some years ago.  People in west Tyrone must now travel to Enniskillen or Derry to avail of services and in doing so must use a substandard road infrastructure.  We should bear in mind the golden hour for emergency responses.  On the issue of losing sovereignty, I always look to a case of an island economy which lost its sovereignty following a conflict, namely, Japan.  At that time, the International Monetary Fund took a much different approach from the one it is currently adopting.  It is worth examining what occurred in the case of Japan where the IMF drove forward an infrastructural programme.  One saw the benefits to the Japanese economy of infrastructural investment such as in roads and rail in the 1970s and subsequently.  
#SeanConlon	unknown-#SeanConlon-party	unknown-#SeanConlon-dob	unknown-#SeanConlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-09-13 00:00:00	Cross-Border Transport Links: Discussion	47	On a point of information, while I concur with Mr. Kelly on Japan, the problem is that the troika expects a report every three months on the amount of money we are spending.  The Republic still has the highest deficit of any of the programme countries, albeit one that is being reduced at a slow rate.  We are under serious pressure to further reduce the deficit.  Ireland is in a programme and depends on the troika for funding to make social welfare and old age pension payments and provide public services.  This will continue to be the position until the end of the bailout programme.  My major concern in the short term is the forthcoming budget.  The Government has been told clearly it must cut €3.5 billion in the budget in December.  This is to be achieved through €2.25 billion in expenditure cuts and tax increases of €1.25 billion.

I am outlining the short-term position the Government faces and the choices it must make.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-09-13 00:00:00	Cross-Border Transport Links: Discussion	50	If there are no further contributions, I propose that Mr. Neely conclude.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-09-13 00:00:00	Cross-Border Transport Links: Discussion	51	I will provide the committee with an example of the success of improved infrastructure.  Legislators in Northern Ireland in the 1960s decided to build a motorway to Dungannon.  There was a very compelling case to build it to Derry at the time as well, but they decided to build it to Dungannon, for whatever reason.  I do not think they had to go through the same procedures then as they would do now in terms of making a business case to legislators.  The result of that decision has allowed indigenous investment in the south Tyrone area which has created jobs which has further resulted in international investment.  One of the reasons investors were so keen to develop the south Tyrone area was the ease of access to the ports for exports.  If we are going to improve our economy we must create jobs.  Everything else will follow and Dungannon-south Tyrone is a fine example of that.  We currently have one of the lowest unemployment rates in the province.  We have the highest percentage of indigenous investment and the highest success rate for small and medium enterprises.  A major contributory factor in all of this is the road network.  I ask the committee to remember that when considering the development of major road infrastructure for the north west.

Does anyone else wish to contribute before I ask the Donegal county manager to sum up?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-09-13 00:00:00	Cross-Border Transport Links: Discussion	53	I thank members of the committee for their support for what we have presented here today and for their understanding of the issues we have tried to outline.  Having listened to all speakers, I urge the committee to make this its number one priority.  Once again, I thank the committee for its invitation to us and hopefully this is only the beginning of a constructive engagement on this project.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-09-13 00:00:00	Cross-Border Transport Links: Discussion	54	On behalf of the councils that have come here today, I thank the Deputies, Senators and MPs for giving us this opportunity.  This is a very important step forward for the region.  It is great that we have had this opportunity to come to the Dáil and to put our case to this committee.  I especially thank the Chairman, who as a native of my own county, has the best interests of Donegal at heart.  I know he is working on a daily basis to move this project forward.  I thank everyone for listening to our case, which was put forward very well today.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-09-13 00:00:00	Cross-Border Transport Links: Discussion	55	I join with previous speakers in giving a wholehearted thanks to all the people who are here today.  We feel that we had a very good opportunity to present our case regarding both the need for and the potential of this project.  We also acknowledge that there are practical difficulties that must be faced in seeing this through.  We welcome the suggestions that have been made regarding a critical path.  Some very good ideas have come from the floor today and we will certainly reflect on those.  We look forward to the opportunity to come back again and to re-engage with the committee.  There is one particular subject that arose in conversation today that would merit further exploration by the committee.  We spoke about the various parties and what they have to bring to the table.  However, one of the participants in the Good Friday Agreement was the Westminster Government and perhaps there is an opportunity for a conversation on how we need to advocate at Westminster.  Obviously, one of the enormous benefits of the Good Friday Agreement has been the costs avoided.  There is a strong argument for bringing that point to the fore in seeking further assistance from Westminster.    I thank all members for the opportunity to come here today and I look forward to engaging again.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-09-13 00:00:00	Cross-Border Transport Links: Discussion	56	I thank the delegation for coming here today.  There is a lot to digest from today's meeting because we did not just hear about people's perspectives but also about their experiences, including the effect of bypassing towns in County Kildare, the employment statistics in Dungannon-south Tyrone and so forth.  There is a lot to take in.  As a committee, our primary focus is on the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and an integral part of that is integrated transport strategies on a North-South basis.  That is a cornerstone for the committee, as is the integration of health, education and so forth.  Members will take on board all of the suggestions, including drawing up a calendar of events.  We must work on an outcome of this meeting.  Perhaps we should consider inviting in the contractors - Balfour Beatty, BAM and FP McCann - to hear their perspective, as was suggested.  We must continue with the dialogue, not for the sake of it but to keep the project moving.  There is no doubt this is a complex issue.  MLAs are not represented here today and many MLAs who live along that route are very proactive in their political deliberations.  The inaugural meeting of the new North-South Interparliamentary Association takes place in October and that is another forum we can work on.  We must look at all avenues, including Westminster, Dublin, Stormont and at European level, including the European Investment Bank.  One of the reasons given as to why European Investment Bank money could not be spent on the A5 project was that it was not a public-private partnership.  I do not know whether that is accurate.  We must be creative and open to the possibility of private partnerships becoming involved in this project.    We will follow up on this meeting.  I am not entirely sure how that will happen because we must first digest all of the information presented today.  The first ports of call, as Deputy Crowe said earlier, are the Taoiseach and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and his counterparts in Northern Ireland and Westminster.  We will also have to keep the British-Irish Council informed.  In my position as co-chair of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly I will endeavour to keep the issue alive in that forum.    I thank the delegation and members for their contributions, as well as for their honesty, candour and constructive suggestions.  We will be in touch again and perhaps a smaller meeting at some point in the future will enable to us to update each other on progress.  On behalf of the committee, I look forward to working with the delegation again.
