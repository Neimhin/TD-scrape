        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_1">
          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_1">Ní ceist don Taoiseach í seo. Ba mhaith liom a rá go bhfuil súil agam go mbeidh Nollaig shona ag gach uile duine sa Teach agus acu siúd atá ag obair i dTithe an Oireachtais.</p>
          <p eId="para_2">I wish Members of the House and the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas a happy Christmas and peaceful new year.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">In view of the fact that the Government is on record as saying that it wants another partnership agreement and in view of the differences between the employers and the unions, given that these talks are hosted by the Taoiseach's Department, that the Secretary General of the Taoiseach's Department attends to the talks and the importance of this process to the economy, does the Taoiseach intend to personally intervene or what proposals has he to bring both sides back to the table to see whether this matter can be resolved?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_2">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_4">I thank Deputy Kenny for his question, which is an important and serious one. Discussions on a new partnership agreement to succeed the PPF have been under way for many weeks. They have been taking place against the backdrop of the recently published NESC strategy report. We have been following the same procedure, process and system we have followed since 1987.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">I, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance have kept in touch in this regard, when necessary, for the past three or four weeks. Our assessment yesterday morning was that the talks were going relatively well. We had decided early yesterday morning to have an intensive and prolonged session yesterday. After ten hours of discussion in the early hours of this morning it became clear that progress was not being made and that a basis for agreement on a new pay deal had not been identified. Accordingly, the parties agreed to adjourn without specific arrangements to meet again. However, the chair – the Deputy referred to an official in my Department – arranged to contact both sides again this morning to assess whether there was a prospect of any change in positions which would make agreement possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_6">I recognise that both sides have engaged in good faith and with considerable effort in the process. I thank them because in fairness to both sides, they have given three full weekends – not to mind all the mid-week days – to this process. Like the Government, they recognise the value of social partnership agreements and have sought to put in place a new agreement in the period ahead. We knew that this would be difficult, but it is right that the parties should reflect on the implications of failure to agree. Local bargaining can proceed on an orderly, responsible basis. However, I have good reason to believe it can also produce significant disruption and conflict and, in time, competitiveness pressures of a different kind.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">The Government clearly wants agreement to be reached. I sent that message to both sides again this morning, but last night's conclusion was difficult. I will leave it at that. Frankly, I am not very hopeful, but I use this reply to Deputy Kenny to urge both sides to think about this. We were a very long way down the road yesterday morning. The talks went on for a long time yesterday and did not finish until 1 a.m. or 1.30 a.m. The people involved have been under a certain amount of stress and pressure, but I urge them to reflect on the process. We are available and ready to continue in every way we can.</p>
          <p eId="para_8">Direct intervention is not necessary in these matters. The process is in place and those involved are all aware of it. They are aware that the Government is in the background ready to continue the process. The Tánaiste and I will remain ready in that position. Anything else would be unhelpful.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">While the Government wants agreement, both sides need to want it as well. I urge both sides to listen to what we and our officials are saying. We are anxious to try to conclude an agreement and we would very much like to conclude these issues. We continue to press ourselves as far as we can to deal with these issues, but we must be conscious of what is right for the economy, competitiveness and the future of the country. It is not good for the future of the country for these talks to break down.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_10">Does the Taoiseach agree that the inflationary consequences of the Book of Estimates and the budget are making it more difficult to get agreement on these talks because of the increased pressure on consumers as a result of that? What is the Government's view on a pay pause? What is the Taoiseach's view in respect of the separation of public and private agreements? If his message to both sides this morning does not result in a willingness by them to return to the table, is the Taoiseach prepared to personally intervene again in view of the importance the Government attaches to getting an agreement and the signal that will send out in respect of competitiveness in Ireland and our ability to maintain jobs, increase trade and generate further prosperity?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_4">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_11">The Deputy has asked me if the higher inflation figures are an obstacle. I would like the figures to be lower, but that is not insurmountable. That aspect could be resolved.</p>
          <p eId="para_12">On the other issue of a central agreement proving impossible to achieve, we should not allow the social partnership process to collapse. There are substantial areas of agreement and these are reflected in the National Economic and Social Council. Many of these relate to local partnership and are outside the direct pay area. We have produced valuable outcomes in economic and social terms from these arrangements and this process should not be allowed to collapse. While we had a form of social partnership for many years before the first programme in 1987 in the form of well established tripartite structures which will continue, immense benefits have been derived from the type of process we have had for the past 15 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">The Government as an employer will reach an arrangement with its staff. There will have to be a public service agreement. That will not conclude for many months but it is our intention as an employer to have a public service agreement with our staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_14">Most of the agreements that expire on 31 December are in the private sector and involve large private sector companies. Should it come to it, I hope the issues can be solved by local bargaining. There are many difficulties for companies and trade unions in using this option, but they are quite capable of doing it if that is what they have to do. However, it is not in their best interests. I thought through all the weeks of talks that both sides would see greater merit in having an agreement than in not having one.</p>
          <p eId="para_15">I have no proposals to intervene directly. There is a process and these are grown men and women. My sitting on the other side of the table will make no difference. They know we are not far away and they know my position on these areas. Direct intervention will not help.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_5">
          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_16">I want to tease this important matter a little further. It is clear that the Taoiseach acknowledges that social contracts since 1987 have been a cornerstone of economic and industrial management by successive Governments. I am surprised then to hear him say that he has no intention of intervening. I am especially surprised that this Taoiseach says that. He has earned a reputation as one who intervenes and as a conciliator. The portents must be very bad if he has decided not to intervene. Is that what he is saying?</p>
          <p eId="para_17">On the proposed separation of the public and private sector, am I correct in assuming that the purpose of drawing a distinction is to defer a further phase of benchmarking beyond 2003? What is the Taoiseach's assessment of the quantum of difference between trade unions and IBEC on the pay front? Is it not the case, as was put to him by Deputy Kenny, that the Book of Estimates and the budget have made the prospect of a 5% phased increase over 18 months unrealistic for trade unions?</p>
          <p eId="para_18">Will the Taoiseach deal with the question of whether the Government is washing its hands of reconvening the parties and is leaving it to the social partners whether there will be a new contract?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_6">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_19">On the separation of the public service and private sector pay issues, Deputy Rabbitte is well aware how these discussions operate given that he has played a professional part in them over the years. He understands the process. On public service pay, it was always intended to deal with implementation of the benchmarking report as part of the discussions on the successor to the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. If there is no central agreement, these discussions will have to take place on a different basis. I am satisfied that substantial progress has been made on the significant change agenda which the benchmarking body recommended, and that should be the basis for the implementation of its pay awards. I am confident that we can do a deal on pay with public service workers. I hope we do that, and we will continue to endeavour to achieve it.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">On political intervention in the process, both the Tánaiste and I have been briefed regularly on the detail of the progress on a daily basis, as has the Minister for Finance when the issues have affected him. I met the social partners at the beginning of the process and during the budget period. We attended the Dublin Castle plenary meeting. Well used processes exist for dialogue with either the Tánaiste or myself on these matters and they will continue. It is not an issue of whether we are sitting at the table because we are never too far away.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">As far as I and the Government are concerned, the basis for settling the new contract existed yesterday morning but, after ten hours of discussions it no longer existed. That is perhaps not unusual, but it is disappointing. It was hoped to complete the process yesterday or today and, unfortunately, yesterday we regressed on almost every point. I am not too sure why that happened, but Deputy Rabbitte will appreciate that in negotiations, a point is sometimes reached which results in either a conclusion or the opposite. Yesterday was a hopeless day, to put it bluntly and frankly. We began the day with agreement almost reached on several points and ended the day with no agreement on almost every point. That is disappointing. It is no good the Government being ready. The parties will have to change their views and attitudes, even to the point they were at yesterday morning. If that were possible, it would be useful, but there is no point, and I am sure Deputy Rabbitte agrees, in concluding when people are getting on each other's nerves. I cannot put it more directly than that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_7">
          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_22">Does the Taoiseach not accept that, since he can no longer trade tax reductions for moderate pay increases, he must adopt a new approach?</p>
          <p eId="para_23">When he says he is confident of a public service deal, that implies the problems are in the private sector. Is it not the case that one of the major problems on that side is the issue of trade union recognition? Is it not true that the legislation the Government implemented on this issue is farcical and is claimed to be such by the trade unions concerned? Is it not the case that they seek to have something similar to the United Kingdom legislation enacted to give the right of trade union representation?</p>
          <p eId="para_24">Is it not the case that, for example, coming forward with decent proposals to amend the Redundancy Payments Acts would be a factor in easing discussions, especially in the light of cases such as the Peerless Rugs workers who still occupy their factory and who have not received compensation other than a half-week's pay per year of service, Miza in Roscrea where the workers were left without compensation, and Wexford Electronics? There have been a number of such casualties and there may, unfortunately, be more in the pipeline.</p>
          <p eId="para_25">Would improvements on the legislative front, such as trade union recognition and reform of the Redundancy Payments Acts, not enable the trade unions to get around the table for discussions? Is it not an irony that, as we approach the 90th anniversary of the 1913 lockout next year, a sovereign Government is bending the knee to IBEC on the issue of trade union recognition? Would it not be appropriate for someone of the Taoiseach's background and knowledge and claimed involvement in trade union affairs to move as the leader of a sovereign Government to give the right as enshrined in the Constitution to workers to be represented by a trade union?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_8">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_26">I can answer both those points positively. The Government is prepared to make changes in the arrangements to deal with problems that arise in companies which do not have a framework for collective bargaining, even though this has only been put in place recently. We believe it is an important way of enabling trade unions to be heard in representing the interests of their members. I agree with that point. I acknowledge that the trade union movement has the goal of statutory recognition of collective bargaining.</p>
          <p eId="para_27">As I said during Question Time recently, it is a sensitive area given the importance of the overseas non-union sector which, by and large, applies highly sophisticated human resource management policies and provides generally good conditions for its employees as the trade union side has always acknowledged. However, it is an area that is evolving at European level not only through the information and consultation directive, which is to be implemented here, but also in terms of the place for collective bargaining in human rights legislation. While it would be premature to reach a conclusion about how collective bargaining should be dealt with in the future, I believe sensible progress could be made and the Government will be prepared to facilitate that. I am restating that for the record because it is our position in the talks.</p>

          <p eId="para_29">I join Deputy Kenny in extending Christmas good wishes to all Members of the House, the staff and the members of the media who are present. While we can sincerely make these wishes, for some families this will be a Christmas that will be all too painful and one which they wish they would not have to face. How many more deaths will it take before the Taoiseach will personally intervene in what I can only describe as the scandalous, reckless and life-threatening downgrading of Monaghan General Hospital?</p>
          <p eId="para_30">The Taoiseach is aware of the justified anger and outrage throughout the country at the tragic loss of little Bronagh Livingstone's life. He is also very much aware of the great courage of her mother, father and family. Despite their immediate grief, hurt and loss, they have gone before the nation and given a full account of their tragedy and the tragedy that faces the community which I and others have represented for some years. Will the Taoiseach join me in paying tribute to the Livingstone family for their courage and public spiritedness in seeking to ensure this tragedy will not visit another family? Does the Taoiseach realise that what happened in Monaghan has already happened in this terrible year within the North-Eastern Health Board region, where another child was lost during delivery <i>en route</i> between Dundalk and Drogheda, having been turned away from the Louth hospital at Dundalk? Will the Taoiseach advise us—</p>

          <p eId="para_33">The Minister for Health and Children made our position clear last week. I take the opportunity to restate my personal sympathy to the mother and family concerned. It is a tragic period for the Livingstone family and the Government commiserates fully with them. The Minister for Health and Children will meet members of the family today. Although the Minister might not like me to say so, there is no Minister for Health and Children that would understand the tragic loss of a child more than he would and that is very much reflected in his reports to Government on this topic in recent days.</p>
          <p eId="para_34">In his professional capacity, the Minister for Health and Children immediately instructed the North-Eastern Health Board to carry out a full review of the incident and provide him with a detailed report of the circumstances surrounding the case. An external review group independent of the board has been established to evaluate the health board's report. The House probably already knows the membership of the group, which comprises Dr. Seán Daly, Master of the Coombe Women's Hospital, Maureen Lynott, Project Director of the National Treatment Purchase Fund and Bridget Boyd, Clinic and Midwifery Manager of the neo-natal unit at the Coombe Women's Hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_35">The board's report was completed on 16 December and the findings are being evaluated by the review group at present. The review group's report will be completed as a matter of urgency for presentation to the Minister and he intends to publish the findings by Friday. I hope we can establish the full circumstances of this so we can learn from it. There are protocols and regulations in place and we understand the difficulties in Monaghan. The full facts will be put in the public domain. That does not take away from the tragedy for the Livingstone family with which I completely empathise.</p>

There was also the tragic death of Christina Nutts earlier this year. In his response, I have not noted an indication on his part to make a direct intervention despite repeated appeals to him throughout the year. It is imperative for him to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_37">Who determines policy in relation to the delivery of health care and acute hospital services in particular?

          <p eId="para_44">The hospital was taken off call on 2 July 2002, in response to medical advice from the consultants based at Monaghan General Hospital and the medical adviser of the North-Eastern Health Board as the hospital was unable to provide a 24-hour anaesthetist service due to various difficulties as the Deputy is aware. If following a tragedy in any hospital, the Minister or Government had decided to ignore the professional advice of the consultants, the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland and the College of Anaesthetists, there would be uproar in this House. No Government can do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_45">The obstetricians, gynaecologists, anaesthetists and all the others have given their professional advice. Although it has created difficulties, the Minister for Health and Children along with his officials and members of the North-Eastern Health Board have given enormous time to this. Maybe Deputy Ó Caoláin thinks they are all bureaucrats and know nothing, but I would not ignore the advice of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland and the College of Anaesthetists. If I did so I would be held accountable in this House as being totally irresponsible or leading an irresponsible Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_46">The Minister will continue to work on this in every way he can. I could give a list of all the additional posts, consultants and facilities he has provided for Monaghan General Hospital. I have no doubt this will continue.

He will continue to deal with the difficulties there and I will remain in touch with him on those issues.</p>

      asked the 
      <b>Taoiseach</b>
      if he will report on the implementation of those aspects of the strategic management initiative applicable to his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_49">The modernisation programme in my Department supports the achievement of the Department's goals, as set out in the strategy statement. A draft strategy statement for the period 2003-05 has been prepared for my consideration. The new strategy statement will specify the objectives to be met in relation to each strategic priority, emphasising expected outcomes. The objectives for the Department are operationalised through the business plans developed at division-section level and the objectives set for each individual staff member, agreed as part of the performance management and development system.</p>
          <p eId="para_50">My Department has developed significant expertise and experience in all aspects of the public service modernisation programme through its involvement in the strategic management initiative since its inception. The Department has a dedicated internal change management unit and is also developing the capability of its internal support services through the recruitment and training of expert staff and the implementation of modern management processes and information systems.</p>
          <p eId="para_51">In accordance with the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, my Department submitted performance indicators for its modernisation programme to the independent Civil Service quality assurance group and reported on progress made to 1 April 2002. The staff of my Department were awarded the pay increase available under the programme by the quality assurance group in recognition of the changes that have taken place.</p>
          <p eId="para_52">My Department has set itself a new set of modernisation performance indicators which will guide the next phase of the change process in the Department. These will be updated, as required, in light of developments affecting the public service as a whole, such as the outcomes of social partnership discussions, the benchmarking process and the follow-up to the independent evaluation of the strategic management initiative.</p>
          <p eId="para_53">To help ensure an excellent service to our customers as part of the modernisation programme, a customer action plan for 2001-04 was published and made available on my Department's website, informed by the results of customer surveys. Customer surveys are carried out on a regular basis and the results have tended to be very positive.</p>
          <p eId="para_54">My Department has been involved in providing central co-ordination and impetus to the information society and e-public service agenda. Internally, it has prepared its e-strategy and is engaged in a number of e-Government projects, notably the e-Cabinet model which will be introduced during 2003. Work is ongoing on a number of human resource management initiatives, including the re-orientation of the human resource function, the upgrading of training facilities and the development of an integrated human resource strategy and staff development plan. A gender equality policy for the Department has been agreed as part of the partnership process and circulated to all staff and most of my Department's staff have received equality awareness training this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_55">My Department is among the leading Departments in implementing the new management information framework. A new financial management computer system was implemented in July last. The approach used by my Department has since been adopted as a model by a number of other Departments. To date, I am satisfied with my Department's contribution to achieving the Government's objectives through the implementation of its strategy, including the modernisation objectives.</p>

          <p eId="para_56">I am not sure what questions were asked in the customer surveys. Significant increases have been allocated to health and education in recent years without a corresponding increase being achieved in terms of value of service provided. Does the Taoiseach propose to introduce new value for money criteria for managers in key services, either in his Department or generally, to ensure the level of service provided matches the level of resources allocated?</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_57">I will answer only for my Department. Although all Departments are part of the strategic management initiative, each has its own strategy. The answer with regard to my Department is yes. The staff dealing with this issue have tried to put down performance, not just to units or sections but to individuals, to ensure everyone has objectives. The last pay increase was performance related and performance was analysed on an individual basis. I accept it is a little easier to do this in my Department because it is smaller and more focused on specific areas in comparison to many other Departments.</p>
          <p eId="para_58">Human resource management and training has proved very useful for staff. Given its strong orientation towards what they are trying to achieve, it has made staff more interested in their jobs. It works in a Department such as mine, while in others where there are different pressures, such as the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science, this is not easy to achieve.</p>

Is there a specific person or entity to whom the Department is responsible in terms of achieving its targets and objectives? Will the embargo on public service recruitment affect its implementation and outcome, in other words, as there may not be further recruitment, can the objective of the SMI still be achieved?</p>

          <p eId="para_60">The committee of the Secretaries General of the Departments drives the overall process, while each Department has an internal committee which drives it. The position with regard to numbers is that front line positions, as has already been stated, will not be affected. Within that, it is a matter for the Departments to manage overall numbers and the reduction required of them. In my case, the numbers are not significant. It may be more difficult in other Departments. The process is centrally driven by a co-ordination group.</p>

Is he aware that the implementation of the strategy in the Department of Health and Children appears to have produced a proliferation of boards and agencies?

          <p eId="para_67">The SMI process is not the cause of the difficulties outlined by the Deputy. While I note her point, I do not want to get involved in the affairs of the Department of Health and Children or the health boards. I do not have figures on the cost of the SMI in my Department, but I hope its work has produced a saving and believe that to be the case. Under the PPF, performance indicators were set for the modernisation programme in all sectors, including the Civil Service, health and education.</p>
          <p eId="para_68">The Deputy is, I understand, referring to the independent quality assurance group, which was represented centrally and drove the process. The SMI process and the various aspects of it outlined in my reply are beneficial. Other Departments will benefit from adopting the model in my Department. I do not wish to ignore the Deputy's question, but it is a broad one and several of the points she made will be examined in the health strategy in the context of reform of the health boards.

All correspondence in Irish is being dealt with as quickly as that in English, although we had some difficulties in that regard. Some 90% of members of the public who wish to deal with the Department through the Irish language are being dealt with within 15 seconds. We have genuinely tried to deal with this issue. I cannot speak for other Departments but I assure Deputy Sargent that all our new customer action plans and relevant issues will be bilingual. The issue is taken seriously in the Department.</p>

          <p eId="para_76">There is a question in regard to FOI about files being made available within a shorter period. There is some debate about that and the higher level group of civil servants has been looking at amendments to change the FOI legislation. There is a substantive difference between the FOI legislation and the National Archives legislation in that in the shorter term, it is not possible to release information for historical purposes. There is no compatibility between FOI legislation and the National Archives legislation. In most instances, there is little withholding of records under the National Archives legislation unless it is set out in section 8 and it is very tight. Even the security requirements have moved on and records are made available. It works well for historians.</p>
          <p eId="para_77">Perhaps under the FOI legislation and whenever the discussion is completed, a shorter period will, ultimately, be allowed. The intention was that it would be five years. I have said in the House on numerous occasions that is far too short and would create all kinds of difficulties. I have answered questions on this issue many times and I do not think it would be possible to release full records within five years, although perhaps it would be possible to release them within a shorter period than 30 years. Those who deal with the FOI and the National Archives legislation agree that there should be an examination of both Acts to make them more compatible so that if there is a shorter period under FOI legislation for Government files and other records, perhaps the criteria should be made more simple than it is at present and that one should not have to wait for 30 years for everything. Historians state that 30 years is a fair period.</p>

          <p eId="para_83">I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_84">I refer Deputies to my statement in the House yesterday evening when I reported extensively on the proceedings of the Copenhagen European Council, including bilateral meetings held during the Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_85">As I said, I took the opportunity on my arrival in Copenhagen on Thursday last to contact Prime Minister Aznar of Spain to raise our concerns in relation to fisheries. I informed the Prime Minister of the difficulties that the Irish fishing industry would face if access to the Irish Box was opened up, especially in the context of declining fish stocks. I indicated that a thorough review of the existing arrangements during 2003 would allow time for all the issues to be fully aired and for us to arrive at a mutually satisfactory solution. I also contacted Commission President Prodi and Prime Minister Rasmussen on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_86">It is expected that the President of the Convention on the Future of Europe, Valery Giscard d'Estaing, will visit Dublin in the new year. No date has yet been fixed for the visit.</p>

          <p eId="para_87">As Deputies are aware, a number of questions to the Taoiseach on the summit were ruled out of order because they anticipated yesterday's statements and questions to the Taoiseach. These two questions were allowed on the basis that they were outside those statements and the questions. Deputies should keep that in mind.</p>

          <p eId="para_88">Is the Taoiseach confident existing arrangements in respect of fishing will apply through next year which will give some breathing space and a lifeline to the 25,000 families in the coastal communities for whom fishing is their only livelihood? Did the Taoiseach have a meeting on the margins of the summit with Prime Minister Blair to discuss the peace process? When the president of the Convention on the Future of Europe comes to Ireland in the new year, will the Taoiseach extend an invitation to him to address this House since he took the opportunity to address the French National Assembly recently?</p>

          <p eId="para_90">In regard to the fisheries issue, difficult negotiations are taking place and it looks as if they have adjourned at the moment and that bilaterals are taking place. The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is endeavouring to reach an understanding with the Spanish. As I explained on Question Time last week, the legal service secretariat has made a judgment, which cannot be changed and which is not helpful from our point of view. If we could reach an understanding with the Spanish on how this will work out next year, it would be helpful. The negotiations, as Deputy Coveney stated yesterday, involve a number of distinct but linked proposals from the Commission to eliminate the Irish box restrictions, reduce quotas by 80%, limit fishermen's days at sea, reduce the size of fleets and address a number of other issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_91">We will be isolated on proposals in some areas while in others, hopefully, we will reach agreement to achieve a balanced package of quotas. The Presidency is endeavouring to address an enormous number of complex issues in one go in this set of negotiations. Whether that is achieved is very much up in the air. We must try to negotiate as best we can in the interests of the fishing industry. I agree with Deputy Kenny that we must achieve a viable package for fishing families, who are under pressure.</p>
          <p eId="para_92">The up-to-date position is that nothing has been agreed yet. The negotiations will probably go through tonight and tomorrow night into Friday and an agreement may not even be reached, although the Fisheries Council usually secures agreement following a protracted period.</p>

        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_47">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_94">Deputy Kenny also asked that question and I apologise for not taking it up. We did not have a formal meeting because we have had a great deal of contact over the past week or two. We have been trying to at least reach a negotiating position by this Friday that we can use in the new year with the parties to get into an intensive round of negotiations. Our officials have been meeting on a regular basis over recent weeks to get to that position. We will succeed in doing that by Friday, which is our plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_95">Early in the new year, we will commence an intensive round of discussions with the parties both in the ongoing round table process and bilaterally with the two Governments, perhaps, meeting them individually as well to see if we can move things forward. Our view is that we have until the end of February to reach a conclusion because if the Assembly had not collapsed and been suspended, it would have dissolved on 20 March to make way for the May elections. The Government and most of the parties are strongly of the view that arrangement must hold.</p>
          <p eId="para_96">There will be major difficulties if the elections are postponed. The Government will endeavour to reach agreement with the British Government. At this stage the British Government agrees with that position but I can see where pressure could come on it to change its position and I hope it does not. I have an understanding at this stage that, all things being equal, there will be no change and we will try to conclude the negotiations by the end of February and hold elections in May.</p>

          <from>Mr. Sargent</from>
          <p eId="para_97">Yesterday the Taoiseach described the Copenhagen summit as "truly historic". Did he have an opportunity openly at the summit to discuss what is historic for the nuclear industry or on the sidelines with the British Prime Minister, particularly in terms of Sellafield, or anybody else? The industry views the enlargement process as a boost to its activities given the large number of nuclear reactors in eastern European countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_98">The convention on the future of Europe is probably even more historic. In advance of his meeting with the president of the convention, will the Taoiseach facilitate a briefing of the other participants in the convention, including Deputy Gormley of my party, to give them a further opportunity to understand what is the Government position on the convention so that the different participants can try to co-operate more in pursuing Ireland's interests?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_49">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_99">On the latter question, the Minister for Foreign Affairs had an informal discussion with Deputy Gormley last week. The Minister had made his senior official available to give a briefing on meetings attended by himself or the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Roche. We are glad to do so. That arrangement may be informal currently and perhaps it will become more formal as more sessions are held.</p>
          <p eId="para_100">Deputy Kenny also asked about Valery Giscard d'Estaing. He probably addressed the French assembly because of his status and position, from which I would not like to take. It would probably be more appropriate if he addressed the forum rather than the House because there are long-standing precedents regarding who can address the House, which should not be broken. It would be useful to ask him to address the forum in public session and perhaps it could be televised as a matter of public interest so that everybody could hear what he has to say. The Ceann Comhairle might help us to organise that.</p>
          <p eId="para_101">I did not have detailed discussions last week because the European Council was engaged in intensive one-to-one negotiations with the applicant countries and the meeting was centred on enlargement. We, therefore, did not discuss the nuclear issue or other issues. However, I take a different interpretation of the position on nuclear issues than Deputy Sargent. The feeling of the European Council now compared to even five years ago on nuclear issues has changed.</p>
          <p eId="para_102">Gerhard Schröder, the German Chancellor, has taken a different view. He has announced the decommissioning of nuclear reactors and the European Union has contributed money towards that, while a number of other countries have come on board. Even statements about the nuclear industry are very different from those that were made five years ago. The Deputy will be pleased at the attitude that has been adopted. The Germans are pressing hard on this issue. Gerhard Schröder's political agenda is not only to help eastern Europe financially, as he is doing in a major way, but to use that as a <i>quid pro quo</i> for the de-escalation of the nuclear industry. All Members who have taken a line on the nuclear industry will be supportive of what is happening at the European Council.</p>

          <p eId="para_103">I mentioned yesterday that the Danish Foreign Minister indicated he had been contacted by the US Secretary of State, Colin Powell, about the US view that there was an urgency to admit Turkey to the EU. He also stated that President Bush had contacted Prime Minister Rasmussen on two occasions. Has the Government been contacted by the US in respect of the same matter?</p>
          <p eId="para_104">It is increasingly likely that the US will take action against Iraq. If that happens unilaterally outside the UN mandate during the Christmas recess, will the Taoiseach recall the House so that our views can be passed on to Ireland's representative on the UN Security Council? Were there any other discussions of this matter among the heads of State at Copenhagen? Former US President Jimmy Carter described it as having possibly catastrophic consequences.</p>

          <p eId="para_107">In relation to the second issue, there were no particular discussions. We will finish with the Security Council on 31 December and after that we will have to see what happens; we will not have the same day to day involvement.</p>
          <p eId="para_108">Regarding the Deputy's first question, I did not have any direct contact with the United States but the matter was raised in various forms with our Government and others. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has said that the matter of Turkish accession was raised with him by the US Secretary of State, Colin Powell, on 25 November. Mr. Powell encouraged Ireland and other member states to reach agreement at the Copenhagen summit on a starting date for negotiations on Turkey's accession to the EU. The Minister explained to Mr. Powell that the EU had established certain criteria, known as the Copenhagen criteria, which had to be met by any State seeking accession to the EU before accession negotiations could begin. The Minister also stated that Ireland would be as helpful as possible regarding Turkey's desire to begin accession negotiations subject to certain criteria being met. Mr. Powell also wrote to the Minister setting out his Government's position on the matter prior to the European Council so contacts were coming from all quarters.</p>
          <p eId="para_109">My view is that too much pressure was exerted from too many quarters on the day and it backfired. The discussion, as Deputy Kenny will know from meeting the party leaders in his grouping, dealt more with how many people were contacted rather than the issue at hand. That is the stage the process has reached but the lobbying was counterproductive.</p>

          <p eId="para_110">I thank the Taoiseach for his reply on Northern Ireland. Will he clarify what will happen on Friday? Will there be a joint statement from the two Governments on an agreed negotiating position? Also, when does he expect the intensive round of meetings with the key parties to begin?</p>

        <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" eId="spk_55">
          <from>Mr. Eamon Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_111">It is with deep concern we hear that the Government's position is that the European Commission's decision on the Irish Box is a judgment that cannot be changed. That was not the Minister's position at the joint committee. It is also worrying to hear furthermore that we are now looking to reach an understanding with the Spanish. Part of that understanding – and our negotiating position – is to join the Spanish and other Mediterranean nations in watering down the conservation measures proposed by the Commission. Given that we do not have a legal leg to stand on, would we not be better to change our negotiating position in favour of the conservation of stocks and try to steer conservation measures in such a way as to favour our smaller fleet? Would it not be better to follow that line?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_56">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_112">Regarding Deputy McManus's question on Northern Ireland, our position is that we want to finalise our work. That is our negotiating position with the parties; we would not be putting that into the public domain but it is really a matter of coming to an agreement ourselves on where we will go. Talks will start with the parties very soon after Christmas. We have done some preliminary work on our position papers so it is not that there is anything extraordinary in there but rather we are dealing with what has come up in our bilateral discussions. We have met all the parties individually and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State, Mr. Murphy, have chaired round table talks. We want to take that forward and agree all aspects ourselves. We have reached that point. We want to see how far we can go and once we get that done the way is open to get into intensive discussions early in the new year. Those discussions will be difficult. As the Deputy knows, the sides are quite far apart in the round table meetings and some recent public statements have not brought them any closer.</p>
          <p eId="para_113">Regarding Deputy Ryan's question, it is not a matter of us changing our position. We cannot change the advice of the Council's legal secretariat, even though we disagree fundamentally with that advice. Our position on the issue with the Spanish is that even if that is the legal position – that there is a change – rather than that coming into effect immediately the Irish and Spanish should be able to negotiate how it would operate next year and come to an understanding with them. That is only one issue. The Council is also seeking to conclude an agreement on the 20 year review of the Common Fisheries Policy and to agree total allowable catches and quotas which involve reductions of up to 80%. It also wants to agree a new system of limiting fishermen's days at sea, which would reduce the size of fishing fleets dramatically.</p>
          <p eId="para_114">We are in favour of the conservation methods but Deputy Ryan will agree that it is an extraordinary position for the Commission on one side to say it wants conservation mechanisms implemented while its own actions let hundreds of extra Spanish boats into the Irish Box. We do not accept that position and we will go along with the conservation methods. If we agree to a small reduction and let in the Spanish fleet we will create major difficulties. That is the point we will have to thrash out between now and Friday.</p>

The Appropriation Account is a cash based account.</p>
          <p eId="para_117">My Department recently implemented a new financial management system as part of the work being undertaken on the management information framework. My Department is among the first Departments to implement such a system. This system supports the accounting and reporting for transactions on both a cash and accruals basis. Work is ongoing in my Department on the preparation of annual accounts on an accruals basis and it is intended that accruals accounts will be prepared in my Department for the 2003 financial year which will be the first full year of operation of the accruals system.</p>

          <p eId="para_118">I have asked each Minister about this system and the Taoiseach's Department is the third to use any form of accrual accounting. The vast majority appear to have expressed no interest in their deliberations on this. The method of cash accounting in Departments relates to a statute going back to 1866, which is unbelievable. If any other organisation did their accounts on a cash basis they would be struck out by the accountancy bodies. Does the Taoiseach agree that this is a serious problem for the Government? One of the great failures of the Government in recent years has been in bringing Departments in under budget on current and capital spending.</p>
          <p eId="para_119">Does the Taoiseach agree with the cash accounting system which encourages the end of year gorging of Departments to make sure they use budgets, even though the actual expenditure may not in reality occur in that year? Is that the right system? When the Minister for Finance answered my question on this he did not seem particularly interested in his Department switching systems and said if it did it would be on a non-statutory basis. Is it not time that every Department, including the Taoiseach's, switches to a full accrual accounting system to try to get some form of proper financial management in each Department?</p>

          <p eId="para_121">This debate has been going on for a long time and Deputy Ryan will be aware that anyone using the accrual accounting system finds Government accounting systems a change. That is the way it has always been.</p>
          <p eId="para_122">Many logical reasons have been put forward both for and against it. It is a cash based system. It creates its own advantages in that everything is written off on a year one basis which is alien to systems other than that employed by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_123">There is a difficulty with the end of year issue. There would be better value for money and a better organised purchasing mechanism if the accrual system was used instead of the system of purchase and invoice having to be dealt with at the end of the year. On the other hand, there is the advantage of the finality of end of year records and it is extremely transparent. Within four or five days of the end of the year the Department of Finance publishes the accounts for the year and there are no hidden figures. The appropriations of aids is the only place where something can arise but they are easily queried. The concept of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the system of audit is a very good system.</p>
          <p eId="para_124">Many Departments come in under budget and their balances help to offset overspend in other Departments and that is a useful system from the point of view of the Exchequer. I accept that it is a totally different system to that which applies in business. My Department is moving to use this system and I believe other Departments will also do so. Our management information framework which was designed in the Department of the Taoiseach is now being used by other Departments. I am pressing for its use because I think it is useful.</p>

It is perfectly obvious that if this House was seen to be more effective and accountable and parliamentary answers were equivalent to what is available under freedom of information requests then there might not be as many tribunals running as there are now.</p>
          <p eId="para_152">The single biggest obstacle to democratic interest and to public interest is that this Chamber appears to be empty most of the time. While the House of Commons Question Time may be contrived to a certain extent, will the Minister of State make a proposal to radically change the structure of Question Time and give authority to the Ceann Comhairle to ask Ministers to answer any question on the order paper and that Ministers are required to answer fully and comprehensively in the interests of democracy and of the people?</p>

In respect of a minor matter, the Minister of State can gain access to her office at half past seven or eight o'clock in the morning.

          <p eId="para_167">On Deputy Kenny's question, a number of proposals were put forward by the previous Dáil and by my predecessor, Deputy Brennan, including Question Time being taken in the House and the Ceann Comhairle having the right only to call Members who are present in the House, and I know that the Fine Gael Whip is anxious that we proceed, particularly in that regard. It is one of those proposals with which we do intend to move forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_168">At our first meeting of the committee on Dáil reform, we went through the recommendations from the last package to see which of those are practical to implement, particularly bearing in mind where discussions and negotiations would have to take place with members of the staff, and we have now narrowed down the ones which are practical. Leaders in the House will be aware, of course, that we have already implemented the proposal on leaders' question, which was lifted out of the package and has been implemented very successfully.</p>
          <p eId="para_169">On Deputy Rabbitte's question, the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Bill is on Committee Stage. It has passed through Second Stage here. That of course will give us control of our own affairs and it will be up to us, as Members of the House, to determine how that money will be spent. I envisage that the committee will be dealing with that legislation early in the new year. It will then come back here and I hope the Commission can be established very quickly.</p>

The fact is that the original Bill, which included a 20% requirement for social and affordable housing, had a degree of certainty, if unworkability, about it. The position under the proposed Bill is that local authorities will be negotiating with developers, either for compensation or for land, and there will be different outcomes in different cases.</p>

This is nonsense. If these planning permissions were to wither, these houses may never have been built. Some 44,000 applications would wither at the end of 2002. More importantly, some of the Opposition seem to think that the social and affordable housing provided under Part V of the Planning and Development Act, 2000 comes free to local authorities, which is news to us on this side of the House. Under the original Part V, local authorities had to pay the full market value, including site costs, for these houses because the land was generally acquired before the 2000 Act was published. Under the new Bill, local authorities will receive a levy to help them provide housing, a stream of income they did not previously have.</p>

We will have less than an hour to examine a Bill containing 20 sections, to which 17 amendments have been tabled. There are 20 proposals for opposing sections or parts of them. We will have to complete Committee, Report and Final Stages in less than an hour. The Government would not refer this Bill to the normal local government and environment committee for a line by line examination. The Taoiseach and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government came in here and made assertions about the Bill which they are not prepared to put to the test of a proper parliamentary Committee Stage style debate. The only reason they are doing that is to rush this Bill through this House without its sordid details being examined. This is the worst example of this House being ignored—</p>

When the budget was traditionally held at the end of January, there was some justification for this but in a situation where the budget is taken at the end of the calendar year, there is no justification for it. We have just had Question Time about Dáil reform and if the Government was seriously concerned with Dáil reform, at a time when less than 60 minutes will be provided to deal with a matter of such profound importance for people depending on social housing, it would permit the Dáil to come back in some reasonable time in the middle of January.

To my shame I met many of those telephonists for the first time in my 25 years here.

If those people were not here some morning, there would be a fair amount of disarray in this House.</p>

This has been a long and eventful year. I could well survive next year without an election. I extend seasonal compliments to the Taoiseach, Deputy Kenny and to all our colleagues in the House. The House is especially well served by its staff. As the Taoiseach said, many of them labour unseen. To all of them, I extend our good wishes. I also include the colourful scribe from the <i>Sunday Independent</i> and all of his colleagues.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">It is remarkable that there is very little media coverage of this House any more. We cannot compete with what is going on elsewhere. Drama and sensation are the necessary criteria. The amount allocated even in the broadsheets to coverage of public affairs has been diminishing and there does not appear to be any sign of alleviation in that regard. If the House thought that benefit would redound to it from causing tribunals to be set up, it looks like the opposite is the effect inasmuch as all politics is damaged by what is going on elsewhere and there is little interest in what is going on here. That is a great pity. This is a matter for others to address rather than us. To the colleagues in the media who stayed with us throughout the year, I join with the other party leaders in wishing them a happy Christmas.</p>

          <p eId="para_329">There is a danger after such seasonal magnanimity that we will not be able to enter into the usual bonhomie of Private Members' motions.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">As with all Private Members' motions, allowing for the inevitable level of hyperbole they contain, there is always something important in them that needs to be noted and that strikes a chord. With regard to one of the aspects of the Sinn Féin addendum, I presume we can now look forward to Sinn Féin supporting the next constitutional treaty on the EU since it seems to support one of the aspects of the Charter on Fundamental Rights, which is about housing, with which I agree.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">It would not be fair to let the opportunity pass without complimenting Councillor Larry O'Toole, who is a member of my local authority in Dublin, on the work he does on the Traveller accommodation programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">The motion refers to waiting lists having increased from 26,000 to 48,000. This is similar to hospital waiting lists or any other statistics. Almost anything can be done with them. We are all aware that a revised assessment of need was conducted recently and several new categories were created. The housing situation is far from perfect, but everyone who has dealt with it has made an honest attempt to prioritise the increase in housing supply. Deputy McManus, as Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, did some innovative work, as did Deputy Howlin as Minister in the same Department and the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, when he was Minister. I have no doubt the current Minister, Deputy Cullen, will contribute to the considerable progress that has been achieved. There are gaps and none of us would be content with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">It is a question of matching supply and demand. I listened to a radio programme where an expert suggested that, in about 18 months to two years, we will be very close to matching supply and demand. I doubt that is accurate but we must be reasonably close to it. The fact that house completions this year will probably exceed 52,000 is another sign of the Government's commitment. Despite what I have heard people say, there has been an attempt in Dublin to grapple with the issue and this reflects the seriousness with which all of us who are members of local authorities – for the present – treat the issue. The 25% increase in output is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">I wish to focus on a few matters. One area that is making a significant contribution to housing supply is the voluntary housing sector. I am especially aware of this sector because of the input housing co-operatives make in the Ballymun area. Some of the best housing I have seen provided there has been built by a housing co-operative, Tógáil Developments. It is building affordable housing on a site in my neck of the woods in Finglas. Some 116 houses are under construction, all of them affordable homes for people who are getting on to the housing ladder. The same can be said for NABCO, Respond and Hale. This sector is undervalued. Building on small infill sites in city areas, some of which need to be built on to counter anti-social behaviour, and building only six or ten houses at a time is a valuable contribution to a local community.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">The problem with such housing is the long lead-in time. I was instrumental, along with colleagues in the Labour Party, in trying to progress the affordable housing issue in Dublin North-West. Some of the people from Sinn Féin who tabled an amendment to this motion were not behind the door in ensuring that the planning process was obstructed every step of the way. We need to be more upfront and encourage this kind of housing development because it addresses a need.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">We decided in our area of Dublin that all the houses we were going to build would be in the affordable housing category to achieve a balance between social, rented and purchased houses. I make no apologies for that. I have long held the view that many people are on housing lists only because they cannot afford to buy a house. If houses are available at a modest enough price, people will buy them. We have a long tradition of house purchase in this country and it is my belief that it will continue, especially in light of the example in Ballymun where we were able to sell good quality houses to purchasers for £100,000. It is achievable but with commitment. The Cherry Orchard project was mentioned and there are similar ones in Fingal.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">The previous and current Ministers must be complimented on the innovative ways they have tried to address youth homelessness. Much more is being done now in this area than we would ever have thought possible. Undoubtedly, there is a sector – single men up to the age of 40 – whose housing needs must be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">It is unfair to castigate all the housing initiatives the Government has pursued because considerable progress has been made in building houses for rental, purchase and social and affordable housing. I commend the Minister's amendment to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanPower" eId="spk_215">
          <from>Mr. S. Power</from>
          <p eId="para_339">Following the publication of the Estimates some weeks ago, one item that attracted all the publicity was the abolition of the first-time buyer's grant. I received reactions from constituents to it, but the response in the House was exaggerated. Deputy McCormack made great play about Fine Gael's petition which it was trying to get people to sign in support of its opposition to the abolition of the grant. It is not that long ago, when the Minister, Deputy Cowen, was rebalancing charges, that there was another such stunt where the leader of Fine Gael marched down Grafton Street followed by a lorry-load of photographers. These gimmicks serve no purpose and Fine Gael Members' time would be better served trying to devise policies rather than such stunts.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">We must acknowledge that the Minister, Deputy Cullen, has been very active since he came to office a few months ago. He has a large budget to deal with and it is vital, especially in current times, that the money is spent wisely. The Minister has obviously decided he can get better value for the money by some means other than giving it in the form of a grant that was first introduced in 1977. Regardless of what people say, it does not have the same importance today as it had when it was first introduced. I do not deny that it played an important part for many people when it came to doing their sums and paying for a house. However, to look on it in that fashion is simplistic. A much more detailed and multi-pronged approach must be taken by the Minister towards dealing with housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">The Planning and Development Act, 2000, especially Part V, has been closely scrutinised. It deals with housing supply provisions and is based on the principle that communities should benefit from a decision by a local authority to zone land for residential development. The intention was that local authorities would be allowed to use up 20% of the land or houses for voluntary, social or affordable housing. The idea was good but, in the form in which it was introduced, it was seen as too rigid and needing change. While the intention was to increase the supply of both social and affordable housing, in reality this did not happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">I reject claims that we are pandering to house builders.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">What we are doing represents a sensible approach. We are acknowledging that a problem exists and, as the Minister said yesterday and the Taoiseach said today, if we had not introduced legislation the planning permission for 44,000 houses would wither at the end of this month. He is rectifying that and at the same time imposing levies on developers that will provide much needed funds for local authorities to deal with social and affordable housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">It is the job of the Minister to provide more social housing. We should have learnt many lessons from the way we have built social housing. We cannot continue to build ghettos and put people in corners and classify them in a particular way, we must have total integration. However, we must also provide housing at a competitive price for people who want to buy their own homes. A number of initiatives were taken by the previous Government. We had the Bacon reports that examined the issue thoroughly. While we introduced measures that undoubtedly had some success, there is still a serious problem and the process of rezoning land leaves much to be desired.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">Landowners have too much control and it is wrong that land can increase in value overnight by anything from 20 to 50 times as a result of the decision of a local authority. In many cases farms are not being bought for agricultural purposes but because of their potential development value. The Minister should give more power to the local authority to acquire land and zone it so that we do not have to pay the huge prices we have been paying.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TonyKilleen" eId="spk_216">
          <from>Mr. Killeen</from>
          <p eId="para_346">We must acknowledge that the first step that must be taken towards addressing housing shortages and prices is to match supply to demand. Deputy Power mentioned the many initiatives taken by the previous Government on foot of the various Bacon reports. In some instances, they enjoyed a level of success but in general it was necessary to revisit and change the policies frequently. One difficulty with supply and demand is that it seems to be difficult to match the supply with the demand in various areas of the country. Even when record numbers of houses are being built nationally, as is now the case, there is a continuing difficulty in that insufficient housing is being provided in certain areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">The national spatial strategy outlines the numbers of households that will require housing over the next 18 years. It estimates that in 2000 there were 1.25 million households in the country and, depending on growth in the economy, that would be likely to be between 1.9 million and 2.1 million by 2020. Even the more modest projection represents a massive increase in the numbers seeking housing. We have approximately 340 houses per 1,000 people whereas the EU average is 450 housing units per 1,000 of population. The population structure is changing rapidly and becoming more similar to that of continental Europe where a very substantial proportion of households consist of a single individual. For many social and economic reasons that is the trend in Ireland too.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">As I have always said in these debates, the planning system is a major contributory factor to delays and cost, and it quite often gets its decisions wrong. In the context of the national spatial strategy, local authorities need to revisit their plans and zoning policies, particularly in areas designated as gateways and hubs, and perhaps more importantly in towns and villages immediately surrounding areas so designated. There will be pressure in these areas for development over the short to medium term.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">We must also remember that property owners, including developers, have civil and constitutional rights like all citizens and public policy, including legislation, must take account of these rights. We must also remember that builders can go bankrupt even in good times. They have choices to make and often those choices are dictated by the banks and financial institutions rather than by the developers. It is clear they were unwilling to take their chances with some of the provisions of Part V of the Planning and Development Act, 2000. They clearly believed in many instances they would not get buyers for houses in estates where 20% was being allocated to the local authority. There was a belief that people would be afraid to invest in case their property became devalued. They were particularly concerned they might have to sell the property and move on. Even though it is not politically correct to acknowledge its existence, there was also clearly a fear of anti-social behaviour. However, we need to face up to the facts in that regard and deal with them.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">Part V has been highly successful in the provision of housing and the rezoning of sufficient land for residential development. The withering of more than half of the 80,000 planning permissions had to be addressed in the next fortnight. This would undoubtedly have caused enormous difficulties which the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill, 2002, has addressed. I am no great lover of the levy but, in its favour, the proceeds go towards social and affordable housing. The changes in the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill, 2002 will result in many more houses being available in the short-term than would have been the case in what otherwise would have been a crisis hold-up.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanHaughey" eId="spk_217">
          <from>Mr. Haughey</from>
          <p eId="para_351">I acknowledge that I have received complaints from constituents concerning the abolition of the first-time buyer's grant and the 1% increase in VAT. However, the terms of this motion wildly exaggerate the current situation and it therefore lacks credibility. The traditional job of the Opposition is to oppose, but that opposition should be based on rational arguments rather than over the top sound bites. I have some knowledge of Irish history as have all Members of this House. Since the foundation of the State the housing situation was far more difficult in times past than it is today. We have come a long way since independence.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">Our active participation in the EU and the Government's economic policies including the sound management of public finances have resulted in low interest rates and, in particular, low mortgage interest rates. This has meant more people are now in a position to take out a mortgage and purchase a private house. That aspect of the Government's housing policy should not be overlooked in this debate. During this debate there has been little mention of the measures introduced in the recent budget to help first-time buyers. The first-time buyer's mortgage interest relief was increased by 25% to €4,000 per annum for a single person and €8,000 per annum for married or widowed people. The relief period was increased from five to seven years and, as a result, 45,000 first-time buyers will benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">I was a firm supporter of Part V of the Planning and Development Act, 2000. I spoke in favour of the provisions to increase the supply of social and affordable housing in this House. I also subscribed to the ideal of social integration, which was an integral part of the measure. I believed the common good was being served by the Bill and was delighted when the Supreme Court found this section to be constitutional. Therefore, I was disappointed to learn subsequently of the practical difficulties being experienced by local authorities and builders in implementing Part V. Nevertheless, I must accept the reality of the matter. The Minister had no option but to bring forward the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill, 2002, given that, for example, some 80,000 planning permissions would have been wiped out at the end of this month. Part V was also considered inflexible and bureaucratic by local authorities and builders and would not work on the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">I welcome the retention in the Bill of the principle of Part V. The new arrangements introduce flexibility and I am confident the Government's aims and objectives can now be achieved. I also welcome the Minister's commitment that the new regime will not mean that builders will be allowed to provide new estates with no social links or infrastructure at the edges of communities and that social integration remains one of his key objectives.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">The Government has pursued policies to increase the supply of housing. In particular, it continues to increase investment in the provision of serviced land for housing. It is also promoting more effective use of this land through improved planning guidelines on residential densities notably by pursuing the objectives outlined in Sustainable Development, A Strategy for Ireland, published in 1997, as well as the high density guidelines for local authorities published in 1999, and the strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area published in March 1999. The implementation of these strategies and guidelines has been controversial, certainly in the Dublin region where many traditional communities have felt threatened by them.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">Traditional neighbourhoods have witnessed the demolition of old traditional houses and their replacement by high density apartment blocks and while planning applications for such developments generate significant opposition, nevertheless, it is necessary to pursue these guidelines and strategies in the interests of providing suitable housing. We need to resolve these difficulties at local level. I support the provisions on the basis that they provide new housing units and demonstrate the Government's determination to address housing matters.</p>

          <p eId="para_359">They have looked after me very well during the past 195 days and I appreciate it. I am pleased to note the attendance of the Minister of the State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Noel Ahern, who visited Tallaght this week to commemorate those young and not so young people from our community who died as a result of drug abuse and related matters. The event gave us an opportunity to focus on the fact that, at Christmas, we need to remember that there are people suffering in our communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">Christmas is a time to focus on homelessness. although the problem should not only be raised at this time. Those of us familiar with our towns and streets will be aware that it is still a problem. While I do not wish to be too parochial, I have often noticed that in major population centres such as Tallaght, which has the third largest population in the country, we should not have to send people in crisis, homeless people, elsewhere to access services. In our case they are sent by bus into Dublin city centre. We need to continue to highlight this issue and ensure that local authorities and health boards act to provide services and facilities at the source of the problem. People should not have travel for miles to access services. In County Mayo, as Deputy Ring frequently points out, people must travel hundreds of miles, while in the case of Tallaght, people have to travel eight miles, which causes major problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">I bring to the House ten years' experience of this issue on my local authority. Many people in my constituency need houses. In the South Dublin County Council administrative area the figure is 4,500 families. As a Government backbencher, I am not afraid to point out the problem and will continue to highlight it in the House at every opportunity. However, the amendment also acknowledges the problem. While it is important we continue to tell the Government these matters need to be addressed, we must also continue to be innovative in our dealings with local authorities and ensure that the schemes in place help create an environment in which as many people as possible, particularly young people, are able to afford their own homes or are allowed to access local authority accommodation. The problem we have in South Dublin County Council applies equally to the rest of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">Opposition Members frequently express scepticism about the willingness of Government backbenchers to make such points. I am not afraid to do so. My role is to work with the Government of the day to highlight these matters and request they receive attention, whether by legislation or through other measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">During the past seven months I have found Private Members' business to be productive in this regard. This is not intended as a backhanded compliment to the Opposition. Private Members' time is a democratic process which gives us all an opportunity to engage in debate. Every week, notably this week, issues of concern in our constituencies are raised. It is important we continue to highlight and focus on the issue of housing and continue to remind the Government that there are problems, for example, with regard to the public perception of the Government's attitude to the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">Members raised the response of the public to the abolition of the first-time buyer's grant and other initiatives. The number of calls I receive on these issues has increased enormously since I entered the House. Even this morning I received several calls about housing issues. Some people were upset about affordable housing, others about the abolition of the first-time buyer's grant and one very articulate lady pointed out that she will be caught by the new VAT increase because she was held up by the builder. I support the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_366">I, too, wish all my colleagues and everybody who works in Leinster House a very happy Christmas and an interesting new year. Last Saturday and Sunday all the newspapers I read featured full page coloured advertisements on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs. The heading read: "We are working to build an inclusive society". Beside a photograph of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, the text stated: "This Government is most anxious to protect the weak and vulnerable in our society and to safeguard the gains made in building social inclusion".</p>
          <p eId="para_367">Having checked, the approximate cost of each of these advertisements is about €30,000. Perhaps €150,000 or €180,000 of taxpayers' money was spent in just one weekend to promote the political ambitions of the Government. Our money is being spent to tell us the Government is anxious to promote social inclusion. Contrast that assertion with the statements in this Private Members' motion. The number on local authority waiting lists has increased from 26,000 to 48,000 while the number of homeless people has increased to 6,000. There was a 5% cut in the Estimates for social housing in 2002 and the first time buyer's grant has been abolished. Is this building an inclusive society?</p>
          <p eId="para_368">It is an eye-opener to look at how this Government treats investors in the housing market compared to first time buyers. Investors in new housing have been able to offset full mortgage repayments against tax liability. That relief is capped for ordinary home owners, those who live in their houses, but investors, those with money to spare and to spend, have full tax relief. In reality, most investors are effectively paying no tax on the acquisition of houses or apartments because mortgage interest can be fully offset against their income from rental income. In designated urban renewal areas, investors are doubly favoured. The richer one is, the more one can write off. How does this compare to the treatment of first time buyers? Is this building an inclusive society?</p>
          <p eId="para_369">On the front page of one of the Sunday newspapers carrying the €30,000 political advertisement we were informed that one quarter of the highest earners paid no income tax in 2000. In fact, a study by the Revenue Commissioners for 1999-2000 showed that 63% of the Republic's top 117 earners had an effective tax rate of less than 10%. The main tax incentives include property based capital allowances. The front page told one story – the real story courtesy of the Revenue Commissioners – but inside we saw the fairy tale and, to add insult to injury, we paid for it at €30,000 per page. This is scandalous at any time but particularly so when we are all subject to cutbacks. If the taxpayers' money that was spent last weekend on political advertising was diverted to first time buyers, approximately 40 first time buyers would now have their grants and would be better able to compete with investors in the property market. That might be the start of building an inclusive society.</p>

          <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_370">First, I wish you, Acting Chairman, the Minister of State, Deputies and staff of the Houses a happy and peaceful Christmas. It is refreshing to see a member of the Technical Group in the Chair.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">I strongly support the motion on the housing crisis. Before I go into the details of the motion, it is important we remind ourselves of the reality of the housing crisis – the worst since the foundation of the State. I am particularly critical of Deputy Power who said he got no serious representations on the abolition of the first time buyer's grant and the housing crisis. Deputy O'Connor, however, told the real story about the telephone calls and the queries he got from constituents. There are 48,000 people on local authority housing waiting lists and 6,000 homeless people. House prices have increased by more than four times the rate of inflation, the first time buyer's grant has been abolished and the VAT increase will add another €6,000 to the cost of buying a new home. This is the real world of the wealthy Irish State in 2002. Instead of helping the people, the Government is going out of its way to punish and put down young couples and the poor and homeless.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">This motion deals with the reality of the housing crisis. The local authority housing waiting list has increased by 22,000 since 1997. The problem is that the Government parties, particularly the larger party, have an inside track which nobody wishes to discuss or mention. The people on the waiting lists are not regular voters and form part of the 40% which constantly stays away on polling day. Sadly, the large party knows this and thinks it can get away with it. I would say to people that there is no point whingeing or giving out about the Government or political parties if they stay away and do not vote on election day. It is not very democratic and if they keep doing that, nothing will change. I urge people to take their vote seriously in the interests of fair play and, above all, democracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">The abolition of the first time buyer's grant is a disgrace and the capping of the rent supplement is an act of human and social vandalism. There is also the scandal of low paid full-time workers who do not qualify for any support towards their housing costs. We need to be radical and creative to help the people. Why not fund social housing programmes through increased taxes? Why not introduce a levy on building land to capture the windfall profits of landowners and developers? These are tough decisions but they would make a serious dent in the 48,000 local authority housing waiting list. These are just a few small ways to resolve the problem but we must first accept that there is a crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">Many TDs seem to be living on Mars. If we sat down and brought in a five year plan or strategy to provide 10,000 social housing units per year over five years, it would make a serious dent in the crisis. We should set ourselves targets and get on with it. I urge Members to support the motion.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeHiggins" eId="spk_224">
          <from>Mr. J. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_375">I strongly support the motion in the name of Deputy Gilmore. When the history of the two terms of this Government is written, the housing crisis will go down as one of its most shameful legacies. A home is one of the key requirements for a dignified life. Shelter with reasonable comfort is a basic human right but one which is consistently violated by those who control the house building industry and those who speculate in building land. Land speculators and developers between them have violated the human right to a home for tens of thousands of people by profiteering in a most callous fashion and, in the short space of five or six years, doubling or trebling the price of a home thereby putting it out of the reach of ordinary working people.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">The Government composed of two right wing parties, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, has not only colluded in this outrageous profiteering but is actively responsible for it. The one or two excuses for an intervention under the Bacon reports were just that – excuses.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">Legislation has been brought before the House on many occasions in recent years to deal with those who visit anti-social activity on their neighbours and one could go to prison for acts of relatively petty vandalism but not a finger has been lifted against a much more serious class of vandal, those who profiteer in the housing market and who have had, as a result, the most anti-social effects on society and those who need a home.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">The media also actively colludes with this profiteering and speculation. When teachers or any group of workers have sought a reasonable increase in their living standards through wages, all hell has broken loose with denunciations heaped on their heads. Not a word is said to speculators and developers by Independent Newspapers and the rest of the media. There is no outing of those who are holding this country and its population to ransom for the sake of private profit.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">Unfortunately, there will not be time to discuss the rest of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill, 2002, which includes an extra cost that could have been covered by Deputy Gilmore's motion, that is, the 0.5% levy proposed on 80,000 houses, the planning permission for which expires at the end of this month. That would add €1,000 to the price of a home costing €200,000. The Minister stated, in a laughable part of his contribution, he intends that the levy will not be passed on to the purchaser of the house. He put forward a ludicrous provision that if the agreement of sale includes a requirement on a purchaser to pay the levy, it will be voided. However, everybody knows the price of a house will have increased because there is no control in that regard and the seller will add an extra €1,000 to the price of a house valued at €200,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">In the 19th century, it took Michael Davitt, the Land League and a mass movement to sort out the rapacious landlords who held our country and people to ransom. We need a similar movement to sort out their modern day counterparts and the quicker the better.</p>

        <speech by="#CiaranCuffeGP" eId="spk_225">
          <from>Mr. Cuffe</from>
          <p eId="para_381">The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government must be living in cloud cuckoo land. He stated in the House several weeks ago that houses were still affordable because people were buying them. He has no idea of the difficulties faced by people who aspire to home ownership as the average cost of a home in the greater Dublin area is €250,000 while elsewhere it is €170,000. That is beyond the reach of the average individual or couple because the average industrial wage is only €26,000 and the average cost of a home is almost ten times the average industrial wage.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">As regards applying for a mortgage on an average priced home in Dublin, if a Member whose partner was also a Member applied for a mortgage, under the normal lending criteria of the commercial banks which is two and a half times the salary of the principal earner plus one times the second income, he or she would not obtain mortgage approval. This demonstrates the cost of housing is beyond the means of individuals on average incomes.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">More must be done in this area. It is not good enough to give developers the biggest Christmas present of the past ten years following the outcome of deliberations on social housing, which will be provided for in the housing Bill later. The Minister has produced a cop-out of outrageous proportions and he is playing into the hands of the building industry and developers. Is the Minister's name Ciaran Ryan rather than Martin Cullen because he quotes the Irish Homebuilders' Association and the Construction Industry Federation chapter and verse instead of listening to the pleas of ordinary people who wish to own their own homes?</p>
          <p eId="para_384">The last time I checked there were 18,000 people on local authority housing lists in Dublin and the numbers have risen since. That does not take into account the tens of thousands who wish to buy a home but do not have an opportunity to do so in today's inflated housing market. The market is inflated because there is a select group of developers in Dublin and not because of a limitation in supply. The Minister of State knows their names as many of them are significant contributors to the funds of Fianna Fáil. This select group of people is holding on to vast chunks of property and paring off the land to keep the price of housing artificially high.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">The Minister of State should tackle this cartel and I am outraged that instead of doing so he is playing into its hands through the changes proposed in the housing Bill. A derisory 0.5% levy will be applied to 80,000 planning permissions that are due to expire at the end of the month. How many houses will be built using the levy? The price of an average home in Dublin is €250,000, therefore the levy will generate €1,250. If a house costs more than €270,000, a 1% levy will be applied. How many affordable homes will be built from levy receipts?</p>

          <p eId="para_388">I support the motion. As Deputy Higgins said, we must go back to the principles of fair rent, fixity of tenure and so on. We must provide affordable housing for the people and that will not happen through the legislation that will be brought before us later.</p>

          <p eId="para_389">We have tabled the following amendment:</p>
          <p eId="para_390">To add the following to the motion:</p>
          <p eId="para_391">"–the right to proper housing, to affordable accommodation is a basic inalienable right and should have constitutional status;</p>
          <p eId="para_392">–there should be an immediate target of supplying suitable accommodation within two years for 70% of housing waiting lists applicants and a target set for the complete elimination of local authority waiting lists as recommended in the National Economic and Social Forum report on social and affordable housing;</p>
          <p eId="para_393">–targets be set for the elimination of homelessness;</p>
          <p eId="para_394">–the failure to fulfil commitments on Traveller housing be urgently addressed and new targets for urgent delivery of accommodation set; and</p>
          <p eId="para_395">–the Department of Finance act on the recommendations of the National Economic and Social Council Report 110 that supports the implementation of a development land tax."</p>
          <p eId="para_396">I wish you, a Chathaoirligh, everybody on the island and Irish people everywhere a very happy Christmas. It will be a Fianna Fáil builders' new year and, while I do not suggest party members should engage in such activity, the fruits of their labour could be almost as lucrative and we could have considerably fewer problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">Sinn Féin supports the motion but believes that, while its intention is extremely noble, it is set on too small a canvas. The Government will ignore the motion and wrap itself in the comfort blanket to which it has frequently resorted since the Budget Statement by habitually restating that when Labour and Fine Gael were in Government their record on housing and other issues was abysmal. No Government in the history of the State has managed to house all its citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">Let us examine what successive Governments have done in recent years. Those who have been housed have been held to ransom and forced to spend tens of thousands of euro more buying a house than is economically necessary. They have, through Government inaction and, in many cases, protection of vested interests, been forced to line the pockets of property developers and speculators. Former Members and perhaps even current Members have been involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">Those who could not afford exorbitant house prices spent years on local authority waiting lists and the numbers are still increasing. When they were housed, the problems did not end, as quick fix mass building of housing schemes often meant thousands of families were relocated in isolated estates on the periphery of urban centres with no access to public transport, schools, health services or something as basic as a shop.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">Our amendment provides for a statutory housing policy that is fair to everybody to ensure our citizens are entitled to housing as of right and if this was implemented the nightmare would end. We know why homelessness has doubled in recent years and commitments to the Traveller community have not been met but our amendment sets out the minimum expectation. The rights of people to housing and affordable, adequate accommodation need to be enshrined in the Constitution. Only then can Governments be forced to live up to their commitments to house all our citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">The amendment also sets down a marker about previous failures by all parties. If the coalition parties oppose the amendment which seeks something as clear as a statement on when they propose to end homelessness and house all our citizens, what will they say to the public if they cannot be honest about this? What hope is there for the Government's accountability and credibility?</p>
          <p eId="para_402">The Government amendment does not deal with any of the issues involved and is a cop-out. This brief debate does not recognise the seriousness of the situation but the contributions have quantified the hardship involved for people on the streets. This is not a matter of figures on pages. Real people are involved. The homeless, Travellers and those in inferior accommodation are not getting any help from the Government; their efforts to provide housing for themselves are being hindered, which is unfortunate.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">The Government has not offered any solutions in this debate, though some Deputies have spoken about the representations they have received. Why are their representations so different from those we receive? It is certainly not the same story.</p>

          <p eId="para_406">I welcome Deputy Gilmore's initiative in highlighting the disgraceful record of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats on the housing crisis and their total failure to deal with the problems faced by thousands of people. It is a terrible legacy from the last Government and it now seems the situation will get worse rather than better under this Government. Rather than having a policy that makes sense and which has some strategic sense, we have policy being made and then unmade, as in the proposed changes to the Planning and Development Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">The message is now going out that when the builders bark, the Government comes to heel. We are now seeing a turning of the screw for young people in particular when they are trying to put a roof over their heads, while the tap is being turned on for developers and builders. It is "Groundhog Day" when it comes to the relationship Fianna Fáil has had in the past with builders, though many people had hoped there might be some change given the revelations appearing in other arenas and the new context in which we live.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">I received an e-mail from the mayor of Greystones in which he points out that a local developer, Zapi Properties, received planning permission from An Bord Pleanála for 1,040 houses in Greystones, overruling Wicklow County Council's refusal. The developers will benefit by approximately 15 million from this generous Bill. He says: "This is a great windfall for them at a time when we are being told there is no money for social facilities. I think that the Government seems to be running the country for the benefit of developers, not for the rest of the people".</p>
          <p eId="para_409">He goes on:</p>
          <p eId="para_410">The application was submitted shortly before Wicklow County Council adopted a policy of 20% social housing. Permissions granted without social housing have a two year life and lapse then. Developers would have to reapply and then the 20% would kick in. However, this new Bill removes this lapsing and the developer will pay a small contribution (between 0.5% and 1%) towards social housing. Zapi will be saving about 200 sites' worth, say €100,000 each, €20 million, and their housing contribution will probably be less than €2 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">That is devastating in terms of the imbalance now being created in favour of speculators, developers and builders and against those desperately trying to make homes for themselves. The latter look to this and the previous Government, in a time of plenty, to ensure they could be offered this opportunity, yet in this debate we have seen the clear extent to which the Government has denied these hopes. The cut in the social housing allocation is extraordinary when numbers on the waiting list have doubled, as is the withdrawal of the first time house buyer's grant at a time when people are struggling with enormous prices for houses. People can see their chances going.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">The Minister should also address the position of the Simon Community. We are very fortunate to have voluntary housing organisations which assist in meeting the needs of those who may be homeless or suffering from problems which make it difficult for them to house themselves. The Simon Community has issued a press release stating that its funding is unclear. I ask the Minister of State to make it clear today that Simon will get the money it needs and that that commitment at least will be made. At a time when serious cutbacks are being made we cannot allow the homeless, who are vulnerable, weak and voiceless, to be denied.</p>

Capping the rent subsidy will have major consequences for them. It is practically impossible to get rented accommodation in Athy and elsewhere in south Kildare, which is a rural area, and it is equally difficult in the cities.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">A major problem is that many of the landlords are faceless people who use letting agencies and auctioneers to let their property. Capping the rent subsidy endangers people in rented accommodation because landlords may raise the rent and put it beyond the reach of the tenant. That is a major problem in this area and the Minister of State should make clear how such problems can be solved. No legislation has been put in place to protect tenants and it has been impossible in my local authority area to identify landlords, despite the fact that there are practically entire housing estates being leased out. The local authority does not know who the landlords are.</p>

          <p eId="para_420">There is also the issue of the first time buyer's grant. In south Kildare a number of developers saw the potential for building houses under the shared ownership scheme and this had major consequences for first time buyers. The first-time buyer's grant gave people the chance to buy furniture. A number of developers identified this market. They saw that the market for the €170,000 house was gone and so they built lower priced houses which sold like hot cakes. The Minister for Finance then did away with the grant.</p>

          <from>Mr. Penrose</from>
          <p eId="para_421">I wish to compliment my colleague, Deputy Gilmore, on tabling this motion. I speak as someone who had to depend on the local authority to provide a house for my family. The cuts in the social housing provision by 5% for next year together with the cap on rent supplements for the private rented dwelling sector, the abolition of the first-time house buyer's grant and increasing VAT on homes, is a cocktail of negativity for people who are without hope in many cases. Some of those measures gave them hope.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">Capping of the rent supplement for private rented accommodation announced by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs is the equivalent of another cutback and it will affect thousands of low income families and tenants who will be exposed to the full extent of rent increases. This supplement is paid by the health boards to tenants who are on social welfare and cannot afford to pay the high rents now being charged by private landlords. The Government's decision to cap the amount which the health boards could pay is a charter for landlords to evict tenants. They will increase the rent charged so that it will be above the level of the cap and if the tenant cannot pay they will have to go.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">Instead of the Government taking the brave decision to introduce legislation to deal with the situation as outlined by Deputy Wall, to cap rents and give rights to tenants, it has used the supplementary welfare system to try to control rents in the private sector. It is a nonsense. The people in rented accommodation have been hit with rent increases over the past few years and rents are now so high that most families cannot afford to pay them without resort to the health board for supplementary assistance.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">It is the existing poor tenants who will sustain and suffer the full impact of this retrograde measure. I suggest that there should be a cap on rents and not on the rent allowances. The Government has failed to cap rents and also failed to introduce legislation to protect tenants in line with the recommendations which my colleague, Deputy Gilmore, advocates in the House every day. He recommends that the recommendations of the commission on the private rented sector be implemented. Nobody can be found to draft simple legislation that will protect those who are suffering. This is the third major housing cut in the space of a week. The Government has already abolished the first-time buyer's grant. Was any thought given to the effect that will have on the affordable housing provision? Most people used the first-time buyer's grant as a down payment to get into affordable housing. I know a number of prospective buyers in Mullingar who are in that position and will not now be unable to take up that offer. They will remain on the list and will be looking for a local authority house. The Minister is cutting off his nose to spite his face. The Government is very friendly with the builders who are annoyed over the increase in VAT. Why were transitory provision measures introduced on 4 December?</p>

          <p eId="para_426">Yes. I am disgusted at the lack of commitment by the Minister and his Department in efforts to find out what is happening in my local authority. The Minister made particular reference in his speech last night to the affordable scheme that is part and parcel of the Fingal County Council programme. A situation exists in the local authority area where people who have been on an affordable list for the past three or four years are now being taken off it because they earn over the income limit of €32,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">The Government and the local authorities are going outside the Act in implementing that rule. The Act provides that affordable houses may be sold or leased to eligible persons and the Act defines an eligible person as a person who is in need of accommodation and whose income would not be adequate to meet the payments of a mortgage for the purchase of a house to meet his or her accommodation needs because the payments calculated over the course of a year would exceed 35% of the person's annual income. There is no reference, good, bad or indifferent, to a limit of €32,000 in relation to the allocation of affordable houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">For this Department or any Minister or local authority to implement a scheme that takes people who have no opportunity of getting a mortgage of their own from financial institutions off the list and then discriminate against them is totally illegal. I will take it to Europe and to the Supreme Court if necessary. I want the Minister of State or the senior Minister and his officials to come clean for once and for all.</p>

        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_240">
          <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_429">I thank my colleagues in the Labour Party for affording me the opportunity to speak on this important motion. Deputy Ryan is quite correct in his interpretation of the housing Acts. The rules now being applied are totally without legal precedent. The problem was evident in the days of the Minister's predecessors. When Deputy Dempsey was Minister he was like Caesar asking where the smoke was coming from. The Minister of State at that time asked "What crisis?". The crisis did not exist. It is still here and it has become more serious. It appears that the Government parties do not understand the problem; it is outside their ambit of comprehension. They have failed to recognise how it affects ordinary people.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">Middle income groups are no longer able to acquire a home of their own. They are joining the housing lists and the lists are expanding. Interest rates are low and investors are investing in the housing market. They are now part of the lending market as they buy up scores of houses and apartments. The poorest and most unfortunate people with families are paying some landlord's mortgage, an investor's mortgage. We have a moral obligation in this House to ensure that those who are in need of a home have the means of getting it. It is not our obligation to ensure that the landlord has a good return on his investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">I thought that the new Ministers understood the situation. The Minister of State lives in the city and I thought he would understand fully what is happening and that there was a need for urgent action. There are now more homeless people in Dublin than in London. What are we doing?</p>
          <p eId="para_432">Other speakers have said that various Governments were not able to appease the housing market but that is not true. In the 1980s when we had no money it was possible to meet the housing needs of all our people. In the meantime the Government has copped out. In the late 1980s when the Government cut back in all directions, it forgot that it would have to rebuild.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">I am appalled that the Government has presided over what was a deplorable situation and has made it worse. I do not know when that has happened previously in the history of this State, but I appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, to recognise the problem and do something about it before it is too late.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">Acting Chairman: The Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, has three minutes.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern): It is a pity I do not have longer because I cannot adequately reply in three minutes. The motion is off the wall. There are some decent points in it, but there are also some nonsensical ones, some of which are factually incorrect and some with which nobody could agree.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">Mr. Gilmore: He is out of touch.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">Mr. N. Ahern: Nobody can deny that there are pressures in the housing market. There have been for some years. They are fuelled by economic growth, by population numbers. Deputy Durkan is correct, that the position has changed and it was different when we exported our young people.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">However, in the past five years 250,000 new houses have been built. That is an enormous number. I saw a statistic somewhere that 18% of the houses have been built in the past five years. There were 52,000 houses built last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">Mr. Gilmore: How many were holiday homes?</p>
          <p eId="para_440">Mr. N. Ahern: The Deputy should shut up. I had to listen to him.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">This year there will be 54,000 or 55,000 built. We need to continue that rate of building for ten years or so to really get on top of the problem. The number of houses we are building is extraordinary. To put it in context, Sweden has just under 10 million people and this year they are building 15,000 houses. We are building 54,000. The UK has 60 million and this year they are building just three times more than we are.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">Mr. Rabbitte: Sweden does not have a housing problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">Mr. N. Ahern: Exactly.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">Mr. Gilmore: Because it has had a Labour Government for 60 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">Mr. N. Ahern: I am just saying that we have an age profile of young people and we must continue providing an enormous supply of housing in the next ten years. Supply is the fundamental part of Government policy. That is the key and that is the common thread. The number of houses built, at 54,000, is enormous. Fifteen years ago or so, the number was about 20,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">I cannot understand their point about the rent supplements, which comes under the remit of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs. What are they saying? Are they concerned about the landlords? Do they want a greater State subsidy given to them? What is the point they are making?</p>
          <p eId="para_447">Mr. Stagg: It is being used as a tool for evicting people.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">Mr. N. Ahern: I agree that the waiting lists have increased by 23% but if one looks at the analysis of who is on the waiting list, 32% of them are now single people. Ten or 15 years ago they would not even have been eligible to apply. They are not comparing like with like.</p>
          <p eId="para_449"/>
          <p eId="para_450">Mr. S. Ryan: They cannot afford a house now.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">Mr. N. Ahern: Unfortunately, the abolition of the first time buyer's grant was a decision which had to be made but we are still giving enormous help to first time buyers. There is stamp duty exemption, the mortgage allowance, the rental and mortgage subsidies and under the affordable housing scheme there is a site subsidy of up to €38,000. There are enormous supports being given. They are much better targeted and much more focused towards the person who is buying. Deputies will have to make up their mind which side they are on.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">Mr. Gilmore: On which side is the Minister of State?</p>
          <p eId="para_453">Mr. N. Ahern: There are pressures in the market. Fundamentally, this is about supply. That is the key note.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">The expenditure next year may be down 4% or 4.5% on last year, but the base has been maintained. This year's figure is up €200 million on last year's figure. Last year's figure was up about €150,000 on the previous year's figure. There has been enormous extra investment in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">Mr. Durkan: I expected more from the Minister of State.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">Mr. N. Ahern: We may have to go through a year or two where investment is levelling off, but once we maintain that base and push forward again on social housing we can get there.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">Mr. Stagg: I wish to share my time with Deputy Rabbitte.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">The horrors of homelessness and the near hopelessness of the housing waiting lists have been dealt with in some detail by our spokesperson, Deputy Gilmore, and other colleagues. In the short time available I wish to deal with the plight of the large group of young families and couples who have been kicked in the teeth by the withdrawal of the first time buyer's grant and the other punitive measures recently introduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">Between VAT increases and grant withdrawal, the price of the standard starter house, the three bedroom house, has been increased by the Government by €6,000. It is unbelievable that any Government, even one as uncaring and right-wing as this one, could take such action.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">To show the real effect of these savage measures, let us look at an example. A couple with an income up to €45,000 per annum would qualify for a shared ownership scheme loan to purchase a house valued at €130,000. Mind you, it would be a very small house or flat, unless they moved about 50 miles from Dublin city.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">Mr. Durkan: About 70 miles.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">Mr. Stagg: Such a couple would normally have been in the private rented sector where the excessive rents charged exclude the possibility of saving. All their saving potential goes to the private landlord, who usually operates outside the tax system and without registration or standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">The €3,800 ready cash made available from the first-time buyer's grant literally made the difference between purchasing or remaining in the maw of the private landlord without a fair rent scheme or security of tenure. Thousands of young couples depended on the grant to pay legal costs and provide deposits or help with the cost of basic furniture. The Government, by its actions, has excluded these young families from the possibility of owning their own homes and has condemned them to continued exploitation by the speculators in the private rented sector. That is the effect of the Government's decisions. The Labour Party condemns that heartless action and now proposes that it be reversed.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">We call on the Joe Duffy and local radio brigade in Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats to have the courage of their strongly expressed convictions. Let Deputies Noel O'Flynn, John McGuinness, Máire Hoctor, Eoin Ryan, G. V. Wright and Billy Kelleher, all Fianna Fáil, and Deputy Noel Grealish of the Progressive Democrats now vote to restore the first time buyer's grant as they so loudly demanded. We are presenting them with the opportunity they sought. This is not local radio or a chat show, this is the Parliament where laws are enacted. They will either vote for the motion to restore the grants or they will be exposed as the gallery-playing hypocrites I suspect they are.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">The Constitution provides a right to shelter for all our citizens. Why then do we allow a situation to continue where there are thousands of families and individuals homeless; where we condemn members of the Travelling community to shocking unsanitary conditions on the side of the roads, in the Irish version of apartheid; where 200,000 men, women and children spend years and years waiting for social housing; and where our elected Government gives generous tax breaks to others who speculate ruthlessly in the so-called housing market? Why, when there is a scarcity of housing units, do we allow and encourage speculators to own and control as many houses as they can acquire?</p>
          <p eId="para_466">Should we not decide that all zoned land be assembled into a community land bank to ensure it is used in good time and for the purpose intended – to house our citizens and not to be hoarded for even bigger profits? Is it not time that zoned land should be available at "present use" value and that a windfall tax be employed to claw back excessive profits? Should we not, in this legislative assembly, now determine that as long as there is one family in our country without a home, it would be illegal for any other person to own more than one home and if we need a referendum for that, let us have one.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">These measures would take the provision of homes for our families out of the claws of the speculators and would ensure that, once again, young couples could aspire to own their own homes, at reasonable prices and in a location of their choice. There is no hope of this Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats right-wing regime taking any of these measures. If the young people who are directly and adversely affected wish to take action, they must prepare to vote them out of office at the next opportunity and elect a Government who will act in their interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">Mr. Rabbitte: I thank Deputy Durkan and the Fine Gael Party and colleagues in Sinn Féin and the Green Party and Independent Deputies who have spoken in favour of the motion put down by my colleague, Deputy Gilmore, on behalf of the Labour Party. It is particularly appropriate that we should have this discussion in the last days of the Christmas session. It is especially appropriate at this time of year that we should seek to address this issue of the provision of shelter for our people because that is really what it comes down to. As Deputy Stagg and Deputy Durkan outlined, there are 6,000 people homeless, 1,200 of whom are children. The Minister, Deputy Cullen, thinks there are half that number. If he is right, it is twice as easy deal with it. Why can we not deal with it? One cannot walk 50 meters from where this Dáil is meeting but there are children sleeping in doorways. In one of the most affluent countries in the world, we cannot deal with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">Mr. N. Ahern: They have a bed tonight.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">Mr. Rabbitte: Deputy Ned O'Keeffe said that this was the most right-wing Government since 1922. After more than 80 years of self-government, for a Minister of State to boast that people will have a bed tonight is scarcely an achievement for a sovereign State.</p>

          <p eId="para_500">That is remarkable. I would be amazed if the county manager of my local authority relayed anything like that to the Minister. It is not the view of the elected Members here, including those of the Minister's own party who came in paying lip service to the substance of the Labour Party motion but will vote against it later today. As Deputy Stagg said, those who gave interviews to local radio, who were horrified at the withdrawal of the first-time buyer's grant, who were upset about the capping of the rent allowance and who are now upset at the craven, subservient surrender of 16,000 sites back to the builders were all going to vote with us, but where will they be later today?</p>
          <p eId="para_501">The Minister contends that the Government is building of the order of 50,000 dwellings a year. The problem is that they are not where people need them. They are not affordable for tens of thousands of our citizens and they do not reflect the appropriate balance between public and private, affordable and top end or private and social.

He misunderstands the problem of 48,000 people on the public housing list. Does he want to go back to the situation that prevailed in his own constituency in the 1960s when the managing director of Waterford Glass had to appeal to the Government for a housing initiative because Waterford Glass, like other good employers, had to build housing for people as the Government of the day could not deal with it?

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Dea)</from>
          <p eId="para_622">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_623">The purpose of this Bill is to remedy a defect in the Domestic Violence Act, 1996, which resulted in the Supreme Court on 9 October declaring section 4(3) of the Act unconstitutional. In doing this, the Bill restores to our courts the power to make interim barring orders <i>ex parte.</i>Section 4(1) of the Domestic Violence Act, 1996, provides that the Circuit or District Court may, on the making of an application for a barring order, or between the making of such application and its determination, make an interim barring order if it is of the opinion that there are reasonable grounds for believing that there is an immediate risk of significant harm to the applicant or any dependent person if the order is not made immediately, and the granting of a protection order would not be sufficient to protect the applicant or any dependent person.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">Section 4(3) of the Act provides that where the court, in exceptional circumstances, considers it necessary or expedient in the interests of justice, an interim barring order may be made <i>ex parte</i> or notwithstanding the fact that the originating document or other notice of the application required to be duly served on the respondent to the application has not been so served. The words <i>“ex parte”</i>signify that the order has been made in the absence of, and without notice to, the other party. Section 4(4) provides that an interim barring order shall cease to have effect on the determination by the court of the application for the barring order.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">On 9 October last, the Supreme Court, in a case which arose out of the granting of an <i>ex parte</i> interim barring order which was in effect for almost three months, held that the provisions of section 4 as they relate to <i>ex parte</i> interim barring orders, in failing to prescribe a fixed period of relatively short duration during which such an order would continue in force, deprived the respondents to such applications of the protection of the principle of <i>audi alteram partem –</i>that the other side should be heard – in a manner and to an extent which is disproportionate, unreasonable and unnecessary. The court declared section 4(3) unconstitutional and said that it had not been demonstrated that the remedy of an interim order granted on an <i>ex parte</i> basis would be in some sense seriously weakened if the interim order thus obtained were to be of limited duration only, thus requiring the applicant, at the earliest practicable opportunity, to satisfy the court in the presence of the opposing party that the order was properly granted and should now be continued in force.</p>
          <p eId="para_626">It is important to note that the Supreme Court said that it was beyond dispute that the Legislature was entitled to abridge the rights of individual citizens, such as a person's right to be heard in proceedings taken against them, to deal with the social evil of domestic violence. However, the manner in which the abridgement of the right is effected has to be proportionate. As is clearly indicated by the Supreme Court, when such an order is made, there must be an early return date on which the applicant must show in proceedings, of which the respondent has notice, that the continuation of the interim order is justified in accordance with the statutory criteria.</p>
          <p eId="para_627">The Supreme Court's decision did not surprise me. When the Domestic Violence Bill was being debated in the House in July 1995, I expressed concerns about how it dealt with <i>ex parte</i> interim barring orders. I said at the time that we must look carefully at the restrictions on the general application of the power being given to the courts as it is a serious matter for someone to be removed from his or her family home without having the right to speak in his or her defence. This is exactly the point emphasised by the Supreme Court in its recent judgment.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">On the provisions of the Bill, section 1 is the substantive provision which substitutes a new subsection (3) for the existing section 4(3). Paragraph (<i>a</i>) of the proposed subsection has three features worthy of comment. These are: first, the provision that an interim order may be made <i>ex parte</i>; second, the replacement of the phrase “in exceptional cases” in section 4(3) with a reference to “the circumstances of the particular case”; and, third, the stipulation that an interim order may be made <i>ex parte</i>“where the court considers this necessary or expedient in the interests of justice”.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">Section 4(3), in its present form and prior to the Supreme Court decision, permitted the making of an interim barring order <i>ex parte</i> or notwithstanding the fact that the originating document or other notice of the application required to be served on the respondent to the barring order application had not been so served. This was a reference not to notice of the application for the interim order but to notice of the application for the full barring order. I have been informed that, in the vast majority of cases, interim barring orders were issued where notice of the barring order application had yet to be served on the respondent. Even where this notice had been served, it would be rare for the respondent to be aware that, in addition to a full barring order, an interim barring order was also being sought against him or her.</p>
          <p eId="para_630">The approach taken in the Bill is to dispense with reference to notice of the barring order application and provide simply that where, having regard to the circumstances of the particular case, the court considers it necessary or expedient in the interests of justice, an interim barring order can be granted <i>ex parte</i>; that is, in the absence of and without notice to the respondent. Where the court decides it is neither necessary nor expedient in the interests of justice to make the order <i>ex parte,</i> it can require notice to be served on the respondent of the application for the interim order. Paragraph (<i>b</i>) of section 1 makes a largely similar amendment to section 5(4) of the Act dealing with protection orders. I will refer to that matter later.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">The second point about the proposed new subsection (3)(<i>a</i>) relates to the phrase, “having regard to the circumstances of the particular case.”  The Supreme Court noted that section 4(3), as it stands, provides for the making of interim barring orders <i>ex parte</i> in “exceptional cases”, but contains no indication of the criteria by which the court is to decide whether a case is exceptional. The merit of the new wording is that it invites the court to assess the circumstances of the case before it. In that respect, it focuses on the individual case before the judge and does not require any determination that the case is exceptional, which would imply comparison with other cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">As regards the phrase "necessary or expedient to do so in the interests of justice", Deputies will note that this criterion is already in section 4(3). It also resembles section 17(3) of the Child Care Act, 1991, which was referred to with approval by the Supreme Court in the case to which I referred and which permits an interim care order in respect of a child to be made without notice to a parent where, having regard to the interests of justice or the welfare of the child, the judge so directs.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">On the proposed paragraphs (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) of the new subsection (3), applications for interim barring orders, prior to the finding of unconstitutionality, were generally made on sworn information. However, they were often supported by oral evidence given by the applicant to the judge. I understand that while the sworn information was frequently made available to the respondent, practice differed from one judge to another and sometimes the information was not made available. The oral evidence, however, was not recorded in a note or otherwise nor was it communicated to the respondent.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">This issue has been highlighted in a report of the Law Society law reform committee entitled, <i>Domestic Violence: The Case For Reform,</i> published in May 1999. This report proposed that court rules be amended to require that <i>ex parte</i> applications for a protection order or an interim barring order be made on affidavit and that the respondent automatically be provided with a note of all the evidence given at the hearing.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">The effect of paragraphs (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) is that the application for an interim barring order must be made either on an affidavit or on sworn information and, where an interim order is made <i>ex parte,</i> a note of any evidence given must be made and served, together with the order and affidavit or sworn information, on the respondent as soon as practicable. In this way, the respondent will have full information on what has been alleged against him or her and the basis of which he or she has been barred from the family home.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">Paragraph (<i>c</i>) provides that the note of the oral evidence shall be prepared by the judge, the applicant or the applicant's solicitor and approved by the judge or as otherwise directed by the judge. In the case of applicants for an <i>ex parte</i> interim barring order in the District Court, which represents the majority of cases, it would be unusual for such persons to be accompanied by a solicitor and they may not be fully in a position to make an adequate note of their evidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">To ensure such cases are catered for, the judge may make the note or he or she may direct that it be done in some other way, for example, by obtaining the services of a stenographer.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">Paragraph (<i>d</i>) of the proposed new subsection (3) addresses the main point in the Supreme Court's judgment. The court held that the provisions of section 4, as they relate to <i>ex parte</i> interim barring orders, in failing to prescribe a fixed period of relatively short duration during which such an order would continue in force, deprived the respondents to such applications of the protection of the principle of <i>audi alteram partem</i> in a manner and to an extent which is disproportionate, unreasonable and unnecessary. Paragraph (<i>d</i>) provides that the <i>ex parte</i> order shall have effect for not more than eight working days unless, on application by the applicant for the barring order and on notice to the respondent, the order is confirmed within that period by order of the court.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">The report of the Courts Service for 2001 indicates that, while the average length of time from the date of issue of the summons to the date of hearing of barring and safety order applications was 12 weeks, barring order applications where an interim barring order had been made were dealt with within two to three weeks. So the District Court had been giving priority already to cases in which an interim order had been made and judges were generally conscious of the need to set early return dates where they had made such orders.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">Proposed paragraph (<i>e</i>) provides that the <i>ex parte</i> interim barring order shall contain a statement of the effect of paragraph (<i>d</i>), i.e. the duration of the order and the possibility of its being confirmed as provided for in the paragraph. A working day, for the purpose of paragraph (<i>d</i>), is defined in paragraph (<i>f</i>) as a day other than a Saturday, Sunday, or a public holiday within the meaning of the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">If the interim order is confirmed, it will continue in effect until the application for the barring order itself is determined, as provided for in section 5(4) of the 1996 Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">Paragraph (<i>b</i>) of section 1 of the Bill provides that a new subsection (4) is to be substituted for section 5(4) of the 1996 Act. This provides that a protection order may be made <i>ex parte.</i> Section 5(4), as it stands, provides that a protection order may be made “notwithstanding the fact that the originating document or other notice of the application required to be duly served on the respondent to the application for a safety order or a barring order has not been so served”. As I have already explained in relation to section 4(3), this is a reference to the notice of the application for the final order – in this case a barring order or a safety order – not to any application for the interim relief. The proposed amendment to section 5(4) changes this by simply providing that a protection order may be made <i>ex parte,</i> that is in the absence of and without notice to the respondent.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">Section 2 contains a standard provision for the Short Title and collective citation.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">This Bill represents the first significant amendment to the Domestic Violence Act, 1996, an Act which itself radically amended our previous law on the subject. That Act came into operation in March 1996 and it provided expanded remedies to victims of domestic violence. Based on the experience of its operation, there have been a number of recommendations for change to what are perceived to be deficiencies in the Act. In particular, there have been reports from Women's Aid and the Law Society's law reform committee – I have already referred to the latter report. There is also a commentary on the Law Society's report by AMEN, an organisation that speaks in defence of men who have been respondents in domestic violence cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">I will now outline some of the proposals, which have come from various sources. Eligibility criteria for orders under the Domestic Violence Act, 1996 should be extended to include a person with a child in common. The residence requirement for eligibility for a barring order in the case of unmarried cohabitees should be reduced from its present level which is six months out of the previous nine. The residence requirement should be removed for cohabitees seeking a safety order and for cohabitees with sole ownership or tenancy rights in the home seeking a barring order. Provisions should be introduced permitting parents or elderly relations to apply for protective orders against abusive relations or persons other than an adult child. Such provisions should include safety or barring orders against such relations or persons residing in the home and safety orders against those residing elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">There should be a category of associated persons who would be entitled to apply for a safety order and a non-exhaustive list of such persons should be provided. Also, associated persons with sole ownership or tenancy rights in the home should be entitled to apply for a barring order. There should be either detailed statutory guidance or a list of criteria to be considered by the courts in determining whether to grant protection orders.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">The Minister, Deputy McDowell, intends to have these various recommendations further examined in consultation with interested parties and, to the extent that reform seems warranted, his intention would be to introduce the necessary amendments as part of a family law reform Bill which he would aim to bring forward in about a year's time.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">This Bill represents a proportionate response to the situation where an interim barring order has to be obtained urgently to save a vulnerable person who is faced with an immediate risk of significant harm to himself or herself, or a depenant. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnDeasyFG" eId="spk_372">
          <from>Mr. Deasy</from>
          <p eId="para_649">I will be brief. This Bill should be passed today so that it can be enacted before Christmas for obvious reasons. The Bill restores the power to the courts to make <i>ex parte</i> interim barring orders. The legislation allows for an interim barring order that is granted <i>ex parte</i> to lapse not more than eight days from the day it is made unless it is continued by a court, which has given the respondent an opportunity to be heard. Where such an order is made, a note of evidence must be given to the person barred.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">With others, my colleague, Senator Terry, made the point that there were many groups in the country involved in this debate in the past two or three weeks. Many of them felt there should have been a wider debate on domestic violence and the issues that surround barring orders. It is a sad indictment of the way society is going that it is necessary to pass this Bill before Christmas. There should be a wider debate and we should invite AMEN and Women's Aid to participate. We have talked about this for a long time, but the topic has not been debated adequately with women's and men's groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">One statistic stands out for me. Four out of every ten Irish women, who have had a sexual relationship, have experienced domestic violence. That is pretty startling and gives an indication of how widespread this issue is. Like the Minister, I am not surprised at the decision of the Supreme Court. I do not think many people were surprised. However, it has put the victims of domestic violence at renewed risk. At the moment, the courts can only provide a safety order or a protection order, which is not enough. At present a man or woman can wait for months before a violent partner can be barred, which necessitates this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">At one point it was said of domestic violence that it was a monologue, meaning that it was focused on violence against women. Now it has become a dialogue and is a debate that centres on not just women, but also men. John Waters should be given credit for that. Almost single-handedly he has raised the debate nationally over violence that is perpetrated against men in this country. I am sure not many people know that one third of sexual assaults in this country are perpetrated against men.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">There are some issues not covered in this legislation that need to be addressed quickly. One of those is the lack of help for victims of violent partners. A study in the UK discovered that only one in 20 victims actually report the crime committed against them. I imagine it is similar in this country. In many cases people do not understand or believe they cannot afford to deal with the legal system. They feel intimidated by the system and that has to change. In many cases that is why these crimes are not reported.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">On a general theme, one of the biggest issues facing the country is the break up of the traditional family unit. This is having a deep effect on our society in terms of crime and in many other respects. The Minister and I are both from urban areas, although Waterford is the smaller of the two. When one visits a secondary school in Limerick or Waterford, it becomes very noticeable that many of the children are from one parent families. While many lone parents are doing a tremendous job bringing up their children, unfortunately, a large number of one parent families lack a role model. I have been told by social workers that some such families are terribly dysfunctional for this reason.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">It is incumbent on us to begin to allocate resources to domestic violence issues, which we have, to date, failed to do. We need to evaluate the break up of the family unit here. Although some pilot programmes on domestic violence have been done very successfully, they are badly under funded. In many cases the schemes have helped participants and prevented the break up of families. The Government needs to address the problem of family breakdown and its serious consequences.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">I lived in Washington DC for seven years. I remember taking a trip with one of the local homicide captains in the middle of the summer. It was at the height of the 1990-93 period when the city was known as "Murder, USA" because it had the highest number of murders <i>per capita </i>in the country. The captain told me we had a very good chance of coming upon a homicide. At about 3 a.m., we did. Afterwards, I asked him what was going on in the city, to which he pointedly replied that most of the kids in question, mainly juveniles aged between 14 years and 25 years, had never known their fathers and, similarly, the generation of men before them had never known their fathers. The family unit had broken down. Although we have not reached that stage yet, domestic violence here is not given sufficient priority and funds are not being allocated to existing pilot programmes, which should be expanded.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">We need to try to keep families together at all costs. Domestic violence programmes and schemes have been successful, but have lacked funding. We cannot accept domestic violence as an inevitable, but unfortunate facet of life. Our tendency to do this is allowing tremendous damage to be done to society. Intervention and prevention programmes would ameliorate the problem. We should also provide more money for refuges, many of which are so short of funds they must turn away significant numbers of people, which one estimate I have seen put at 66% of those seeking assistance. This issue needs to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">I support the Bill. It is an indictment of society that we are taking it just days before Christmas, a period which we acknowledge gives rise to widespread domestic violence as people get together.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_373">
          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_659">I welcome the Minister and the legislation, which my party will support. It was inevitable, as the Minister indicated, that a case would be taken before the courts because of the manner in which <i>ex parte</i> applications were being made and the delays in hearing cases in full. It comes back to the question of resources. If there had been full hearings of <i>ex parte</i> applications, it is very unlikely a constitutional case would have been taken as the matter would have been dealt with expeditiously and there would have been a full hearing. As such, it is improbable the respondent would have been so dissatisfied as to take a case to court.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">We should also remember that the Supreme Court did not find against <i>ex parte</i> orders <i>per se,</i> but against the mechanisms used. The Bill is in tune with the constitutional findings in that it makes provision for <i>ex parte</i> findings where a sufficiently important and serious emergency arises. The problem, therefore, was with the manner in which applications were being handled, the lack of resources available to the courts and the rather lackadaisical approach by which information or notes were not made available to the respondent, who was not informed in all cases. One also had the problem of full cases dragging on.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">I hope we will get a commitment to provide resources in support of the legislation. I am appalled by the last sentence in the explanatory memorandum which states that no necessary financial implications are envisaged, despite the acknowledgement that the legislation will give rise to additional court hearings. One cannot introduce legislation on such a basis. The resources available are insufficient to expedite the cases which come before the courts, either on an <i>ex parte</i> or permanent basis. To introduce further legislation and claim it will have no financial implications is ludicrous. I am concerned we will again find ourselves without the necessary resources and the legislation will, as a result, fall into disrepute.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">I am also unhappy that we are debating the legislation at this late date. I understand it could have been taken on 9 October, which would have allowed us to consider the context in which it has been framed. There is no sense in rushing legislation through the House. I am concerned we do not have a repeat of the passage of the previous legislation which passed without First Stage, Second Stage, Committee Stage or Final Stage debates. This was, I understand, the first time this happened in the House. This debate is not much better in that we have little more than an hour to debate all Stages and there will not be an opportunity to put the proposals in their proper, broad societal context or consider amendments, either by subtraction or addition. It is wrong to use the imminent end of the session as a pretext for taking a guillotine approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">As the title of the Bill states, the background to the legislation is very serious and has grave implications for society. Domestic violence is widespread. We, as public representatives, are probably more aware than most because we are in constant contact with people who have been abused, physically and emotionally, in the home and elsewhere. Domestic violence is often a hidden crime. The Garda Commissioner, who appeared before a committee yesterday, said he was a great believer in CCTV on the streets and that he has examined some of the footage from city centre locations and was appalled at the degree of violence one citizen can perpetrate on another in a public place. What may be done in the family home or in an intimate situation may be very sour indeed. During celebrations or festive seasons such as Christmas there seems to be a substantial increase in domestic violence. That leads us to the degree of alcohol consumed in this country and the limited steps we have taken to deal with it even though we speak about it regularly.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">There is no doubt that we need to deal with this substantial problem which often spills over into the courts as emergency action is required. Before I look at the legislation I wish to refer to statistics on the nature and extent of violence against women which I am sure have been supplied to all Members by Women's Aid. I would have thought the Minister of State would have put such statistics on the record as a background to the legislation. In 2000, Women's Aid – one organisation – supported 10,000 women in need of support. In 1999, three refuges accommodated 609 women and 1,451 children but we must remember there are 32 refuges in the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">In 1999, gardaí were called out more than 10,000 times to incidents of domestic violence of which 92% were against women. In 2001, 4,470 barring orders were applied for, while 2,067 were granted. In the same year, 2,903 safety orders were applied for, while 1,232 were granted. Some 8,243 calls were made to the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre between July 1999 and June 2000. Four out of ten women involved in a sexual relationship with a man have experienced violence. The Rotunda Maternity Hospital found that in a sample of 400 pregnant women, 12.5% had experienced abuse while pregnant. That is a fairly horrific picture of violence in the home presented by one organisation. There are other organisations, including those representing men who have been subjected to violence, which could give us statistics that would add considerably to what I have stated.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">This amending legislation is appropriate in that it remedies a defect in the Domestic Violence Act, 1996, whereby it was deemed unconstitutional to grant barring orders as they operated under that legislation. What is the Minister of State's interpretation of the eight working days? Is it eight working days as set out in section 1(<i>f</i>) which states “days other than Saturdays, Sundays or public holidays”? How does it operate if the courts are in recess? Does it mean the working days of the courts or of the ordinary citizen? </p>
          <p eId="para_667">Section 1(<i>c</i>) states “If an interim barring order is made <i>ex parte </i>– (i) a note of evidence given by the applicant shall be prepared forthwith-”. Does that also apply to an application for a barring order? The taking of a note of evidence should be automatic once the applicant is brought before the court. It would be proper to have the facilities in place and to have best practice. A proper note of evidence should be taken in all cases, irrespective of the success or otherwise of the barring order.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">The victims of violence must be paramount and this legislation at least ensures temporary relief for them. However, what will be done in the long-term? What support and relief will be provided by the State? The State has been lackadaisical in providing support mechanisms and relief to victims of violence, whether generally or, more particularly, in the home. It has been left almost exclusively to voluntary organisations to fund raise and make applications to the State for grants, funds and premises. The State has not taken the initiative in this matter. Although the situation in respect of domestic violence has been deteriorating, as the statistics show, the State's responsibility has not increased in a meaningful fashion, resources have not been provided and structures and mechanisms have not been put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_669">The Minister of State said the Minister, Deputy McDowell, intends to look at some of the broader issues and to introduce an amendment as part of a family law Bill. I fear future commitments. It is like the Minister closing down Shanganagh Castle, the only open prison for juveniles, and promising to build a replacement some time in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">Commitments are not adhered to always. The commitment is not included in the programme and I wonder whether the Minister of State could provide a more substantial commitment than the statement at the end of his contribution that there would be a wider level of consultation whereby all the organisations involved in this area could be brought together. They could be brought before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, for example, or the Minister to make a presentation.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">Many recommendations are being implemented in this area in a broader context. We support this necessary legislation, which is welcome. We would like to see the day when adequate resources will be provided to implement this legislation, the original Bill and the other proposals so that more comprehensive legislation can be introduced.</p>

          <from>Dr. Cowley</from>
          <p eId="para_674">I welcome the Bill because it is short and sweet and is clear in what it seeks to do, which is to remedy a defect that rendered section 4(3) of the original Act unconstitutional and to restore power to grant interim barring orders <i>ex parte</i>. It is a good day for democracy when we do something that makes a real difference to people. The people affected by this legislation are in need of our help.</p>
          <p eId="para_675">As a general practitioner, I have seen the effects of domestic violence and, as someone who has studied law, I am aware of the deficiencies in the legal system. Like the "Late Late Show", the Bill contains something for everyone in the audience. In cases of domestic violence if the court considers that only a barring order will suffice to compel the alleged perpetrator to leave the family home, it can provide for such on an interim <i>ex parte</i> basis where there is thought to be an immediate threat to the person seeking protection or to dependent children.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">The new wording gives more discretion to the courts to grant such orders than the more narrow phrase "in exceptional circumstances."  With regard to the implementation of the order when the full hearing is many months away, if the excluded member of the family is out of the picture for that time, that could have a detrimental effect on his or her chances in decisions relating to custody of children and so on given that courts favour stable relationships.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">Everyone involved in the caring professions knows that alcohol and Christmas are synonymous with domestic violence and I can vouch for that having worked as a GP for 23 years and in the accident and emergency departments of hospitals. Some people hate Christmas, and children, in particular, dread the foreboding that comes with hearing a key in the door because they are reminded of unpleasant experiences. The answer to alcohol-related violence lies in the banning of alcohol advertising as well as in the provisions of this legislation. Shakespeare said alcohol increases desire but decreases performance. However, it affects mental as well as physical performance. The higher centres of the brain are dampened resulting in violence.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">Legislation is only part of the equation. The increase in the number of refuge centres for women brings home the increase in domestic violence cases and women nowadays are not prepared to put up with what their peers did in the past. They will walk out but it takes on average seven attempts before a victim of domestic violence eventually leaves the home. That illustrates the hell on earth these women and men experience.</p>
          <p eId="para_679">Domestic violence is not confined to Ireland and it is all-pervasive as it does not heed the urban-rural divide or social classes. That does not matter a hoot. Children are scarred mentally and physically. Domestic violence is no less shocking than other types of violence. It is often worse because it occurs in relationships based on trust and the victims expect to have sanctuary in their own homes but instead they are not protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_680">On average six women are murdered in Ireland annually and in a high proportion of cases where a spouse or partner is killed, there is a history of violence against the woman in the relationship. That is chilling and it is also chilling that the common thread in these cases is the pattern of coercive control among those who abuse. This can involve destruction of property, isolation from friends, family and other supports, stalking, control over access to money, food, transport and telephones, sexual coercion, assault, rape and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_681">In an important US study a total of 57% of male partners who had been married were found to be violent to another partner. This raises the question of whether there should be a register of such abusers but I do not know where it would fit because it would be so big. An analysis of Garda criminal record files found that domestic violence offenders who were found guilty were previously heavily criminalised. This population of offenders should be noted.</p>
          <p eId="para_682">The most recent study of domestic violence in Ireland, as reported in <i>The Irish Times </i>on 1 February, indicated that almost four in every ten women attending their GP had experienced domestic violence. Men are also affected and we need to highlight the controlling behaviour involved and take steps to attenuate it so that it does not lead to violence. If it was highlighted, perhaps it would not be socially acceptable. We live in a violent society and aggressive behaviour is wrong. However, it must be seen to be such. It begins with bullying in the classroom and continues up the line, and children need to be told that such behaviour is not right. With various super powers fighting each other in movies, how can our children learn?</p>

          <from>Mr. Cuffe</from>
          <p eId="para_683">I welcome the Bill. Although it is a quick-fix solution, it is necessary given the season that is in it. Measures are needed to help the victims and their families who will, sadly, be exploited and abused over the festive period. This is a good Bill but there will be a number of teething problems, but amendments could be made. Overall it is a positive step in dealing with the court action taken last month.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">It is important to recognise and applaud the fantastic work of voluntary organisations in this area, ranging from national bodies to women's refuges on the ground. I visited a refuge recently and the steel doors on the front of the building bore witness to the horrific circumstances in which women, in particular, often find themselves. They must regularly find a way out of such circumstances at a moment's notice. While barring orders are an imperfect tool, they are necessary to protect people from domestic violence and to that end they are welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">I concur with Deputy Cowley's reference to the link between alcohol and violence. Given that alcohol advertising levels increase significantly at this time of year, a ban on such advertising must be considered because they perpetuate the myth that alcohol does nothing but good. When the chairman of the National Safety Council saw an alcohol advertisement with the word "Believe" in it, he stated that many people would die as a result of drink driving over the festive period. Many more will be victims of violence in the home as a side effect of alcohol consumption and that must be addressed separately.</p>
          <p eId="para_686">Regarding the eight day period in the Bill, concerns have been expressed by Women's Aid, among others, that people may find themselves in limbo after one eight day period ends while waiting for another to commence. The Minister of State should clarify this. However, there is also a concern that we may see an infinite number of eight day periods with the order continuing for a long period before a full hearing is held. I would welcome clarification on this point also. A specific date for a hearing on the full barring order should be clear as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_687">I compliment the Minister and welcome the haste with which he has acted on this matter. The legislation could do with amending and the Labour Party has put down some simple amendments. Subject to some clarification on the eight day period my party supports the Bill.</p>

        <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_378">
          <from>Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_688">The day the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that interim barring orders were unconstitutional my constituency office received numerous calls. They were all from women, though that is not always the case in this area. The women felt very vulnerable because of the collapse of their interim barring orders and in many cases their ex-partners took advantage of the confusion to terrorise them further. When one considers the statistics they were right to be fearful, as 76% of women who are separated from abusive partners suffer post-separation violence. Women's Aid also states that in the resolved cases of women murdered in their homes, 82% of the women were killed by men they knew. Women are at the greatest risk of homicide at the point of separation or when leaving a violent partner.</p>
          <p eId="para_689">Constitutionally valid interim barring orders could save lives and I am glad we are debating this Bill. I have been pushing for this since the Supreme Court judgment and I am eager we get the legislation right and that it is fully constitutional. I acknowledge that domestic violence is not perpetrated exclusively by male partners against female partners, nor is it exclusive to heterosexual partnerships. The reality of domestic violence in our society is that partners abuse partners, parents and other relatives abuse children and grown children sometimes abuse their elderly parents. Children on the receiving end of such violence often become abusers themselves in the future, perpetuating the cycle of abuse. These tragic circumstances are all around us and anyone holding an advice clinic or the like can recite the details of numerous cases. The fact that there are so many refuges around the country reveals the existence of these tragic situations. The Bill is not enough to tackle the entire problem but it is another step forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_690">We must acknowledge there is domestic violence against women and that it is reaching epidemic proportions. The statistics are harrowing: one quarter of all violent crimes reported involve a man assaulting a wife or partner and on average a woman will be assaulted by a partner 35 times before reporting it to the police. We want the Government to ensure that the resources are made available in order that the legislation can work as intended. I therefore raise my concerns about recent budget cuts when it comes to implementing the Bill. The delays the Supreme Court found unreasonable are not in the interests of either the applicant or respondent in such cases and we know a contributory factor in creating the unreasonable delay in the first case was the under resourcing of our district courts. This applies to barring orders, child custody and access applications but the problem does not stop there. Low income applicants and respondents currently face great difficulties in accessing legal representation and the waiting lists are far too long, yet the Government cut the legal aid grant for next year in the budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">There is an urgent need for new legislation to make interim barring orders constitutionally compliant and I welcome this debate. I have put down a Committee Stage amendment which I will address at that point but I welcome the Bill. I hope those who usually suffer at Christmas do not suffer this year.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryHanafin" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Taoiseach" eId="spk_379">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Ms Hanafin)</from>
          <p eId="para_692">This is a crucially important issue for many women. In many ways it is ironic that at Christmas, when we are thinking of celebrating, many people will be the victims of violence as a result of the tension, alcohol and pressure that goes with this time of year. Our responsibility is to ensure the provisions are there to protect these people and to make sure that wherever they need the protection of the law, over Christmas and beyond, they will have it.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">It would have been nice to spend longer debating the finer points of the Bill but we do not have that luxury if we want to ensure that those protections are in place. The void that was created since the Supreme Court decision of 9 October has been highlighted already. If the current law on interim barring orders is unconstitutional it is our responsibility and duty to fill that void and to return to the courts the right to grant barring orders <i>ex parte</i>. It is a sad topic but we recognise that interim barring orders are vital to protect the safety, and often the lives, of people when it comes to domestic violence. It is sad when one realises it takes a long time for someone to seek an interim barring order and to have to say they have been a victim for a long time, suffering repeated acts of violence, physical injuries and psychological taunting. Unfortunately, that is compounded by court delays and a lack of refuge places. We must ensure these people do not have to wait for a full court hearing in order to get the extra legal protection they need.</p>
          <p eId="para_694">It is a very brave decision for a woman to seek a barring order against a partner which is only reached after long consideration. Calling the gardaí to remove a partner from the home is a brave and difficult decision. We are all aware of instances in which the gardaí have broken into a house where they have heard sounds of domestic violence. One garda told me he entered a house to find a man with a knife at his wife's throat only for her to say it was not a domestic violence incident and to deny it. Denial is part of the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_695">If one gets to the stage where a woman will take the step of going to court to seek a barring order, then we must put a process in place to protect her. Such women have suffered fear, intimidation and violence and unfortunately will do so after the barring order has been issued. They know as much and the statistics bear this out. The court must make a decision quickly and decide whether a protection order is enough; if it is not an interim barring order has to be put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">Domestic violence means the stronger person can intimidate the weaker into remaining in a destructive relationship. Deputy Ó Snodaigh has already quoted figures from the Women's Aid report which said that people had been beaten up 35 times before they reported it. From previous work with children I know they are suffering not just by being the victims of a physical assault but by being present when domestic violence is taking place. It is equally important that the process is fair and is seen to be fair. We all accept that an accused has the right to hear the case being made against him and should have the opportunity to defend themselves. Any restriction of that principle would have to be justified and would have to be proportionate.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">I accept and understand the judgment of the Supreme Court that the lack of a time limit on interim barring orders when they were granted <i>ex parte</i> was disproportionate, unreasonable and unnecessary. Both parties in a case must be given consideration because there were cases of men who came home in the evening and found they had no home to get in to and did not know if they were ever going to get back in. Justice must apply to everybody. If the barring order was not being dealt with for several months by the court then that was equally wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_698">The increase in barring orders over the last number of years is a terrible indictment of society. Dr. Cowley mentioned the link with alcohol. Like most issues of a social nature which we examine in this House there is a wider social impact and there is no one reason as the cause. In 1996 there were 170 barring orders granted and 1,159 were granted in 1999. That is a huge increase but it is also a huge increase in the number of brave women who have taken the step. When I read these figures I wonder if there is more domestic violence or is it just that people are admitting that it exists. Much of it is probably the latter, with people willing to talk about what is happening behind closed doors. I acknowledge that there will be questions about the time of eight days but it is a fair and a balanced way of trying to deal with the issue and of giving the respondent the right to present their case in court.</p>
          <p eId="para_699">I have attended events organised by Women's Aid and I attended the launch of the report earlier this year. We should never cease to be shocked by the statistics. People do not usually give information of a personal nature in surveys and they are doing society a great service by imparting this information. We must constantly focus on this area because of the effect it has on families and on women and their children. The perpetrators are usually partners or ex-partners, people who are known to the women concerned. We must work to help women build up self confidence so that they can recognise what is acceptable behaviour.</p>
          <p eId="para_700">I have met children who have been the victims of domestic violence. Their lives are ruined by fear and their emotions are torn. They fear for their own safety and for the life of their mother in many cases. They are torn between which side to take. The Barnardos campaign shows a child terrified by what is happening in the home and between their own parents. The children are learning to suppress their own fears and feelings and it is only in later years that a lot of this can come out. They believe that living in fear is a normal feeling. We know then that as they go through life, having experienced violence and conflict as a normal part of life, many – perhaps 50% – risk becoming a victim or a perpetrator of domestic violence. Too often we forget about the child in the case; we think of the child when the child is the direct victim of a physical assault but we do not think of the emotional consequences for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">I launched the national children's strategy two years ago. One of its key aims was that children should be safeguarded to enjoy their childhood free from all forms of abuse and exploitation. That takes a lot of work with families. We saw evidence during the week of how counselling and mediation work in the context of marriage and families. I commend and praise from a height those organisations and voluntary groups who work daily with women and families to ensure that they are safe in their homes. We should all strive to protect children and to protect them from their families. That is our job as legislators. Today is just one step on that road. We can put supports in place and this Bill will put a legal support in place at a very opportune time for victims.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">I have met men's groups who tell me that they too are increasingly becoming the victims of domestic violence and we should not ignore that fact. The vast majority of people who look for barring orders are women. It is a wider social problem which should be examined. Christmas can be a difficult time for a lot of people. My message to women who are the victims of domestic violence is to seek support and to tell somebody. The help is there, the Garda and the organisations and refuges will support them, and they do not have to remain a victim in their own home.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DanNeville" eId="spk_380">
          <from>Mr. Neville</from>
          <p eId="para_703">There is no doubt that it was necessary to deal with the situation which arose in October. It was necessary to ensure the safety of women in the home. The Minister of State may be correct in saying that it may be an increase in the level of reporting rather than an increase in incidents but I suspect that there is an increase in the level of violence in the home. The Minister of State drew attention to the plight of children. The discussion of domestic issues often concentrates on parents and the children are often only referred to in passing. We should examine how society deals with children.</p>
          <p eId="para_704">I wish to speak about the role of parents in a changing society where possibly one in four children are born to single mothers. We must legislate for the role of the father in a changing society. The State does not facilitate single or separated fathers to fulfil their role, obligations and responsibilities as a parent. Single parents as of right – when I say single parents I mean mothers and fathers, single and separated – have an entitlement to a relationship with their children. The presumption in law is that single fathers do not have a right and must seek agreement to obtain that right.</p>
          <p eId="para_705">As it stands the law facilitates the rights of the mother to the access and rearing of children. It hinders the role of the single father in carrying out his rights and obligations. Custody or guardianship cannot be arranged without first being agreed with the mother. The State does not encourage or facilitate a single father to establish guardianship or joint guardianship without the mother's agreement. As it stands, the law discriminates against single parents in the children's relationship with their father, and single fathers have an inferior status in the eyes of the law and in society in general.</p>
          <p eId="para_706">We should conduct an examination of the role of the father in a changing society. It is important that children have the knowledge and the influence of both parents and an acquaintance and friendship with both parents' families. A child has a right to the knowledge and friendship of both parents and the State should uphold that right.</p>
          <p eId="para_707">While we agree that progress has been made in recognising children who are born outside marriage, even going back to the abolition of the concept of illegitimacy, nonetheless we must continue to recognise that families are now very different than they were in the past. We continue to promote this principle that parentage is, in effect, solely tied up with marriage, particularly in the case of the father. We are not recognising the needs of the child or children who are born to a single mother and we are not relating to the realities of life today.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">Traditionally the father had enormous control in families and the mother, in effect, was dependent on the father. This is long changed to very good effect, and it was a very necessary change, but we have now almost turned the principle on its head whereby in certain circumstances fathers are now dependent on mothers for access to a relationship with their children. It is not acceptable that it is solely within the gift of the mother to grant guardianship to the father of her child. A single mother can agree or disagree that the unmarried father be a guardian of the child, however the role of the father is not significantly or properly developed in the context of what is happening today. I am not happy that so many women are rearing children on their own where the fathers of those children are missing because they do not want to know their children or they have been prevented from knowing them. It is an issue which we must address.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">It takes two people to have a baby and I believe it takes two people to rear a child. The responsibility and rights of fatherhood have not been addressed where the parents are single. We must include fathers in a way in which they are established as having rights and they are challenged to take responsibility for having a child. If we fail to do so, we are simply reinforcing a pattern which will not be good for society as a whole or for individuals who have the rights and responsibilities as parents, regardless of whether they are married.</p>
          <p eId="para_710">Unless there are compelling reasons like domestic violence, with which the Minister is dealing today, it is in a child's best interests to know and have a relationship with both father and mother and the father should recognise the relationship and be involved in parenting of the child. The overriding consideration in any marriage breakdown seems to be the convenience of the parents rather than the best interests of the child.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">We cannot overestimate the importance of the father figure in a child's life. There is a void where a father is not involved in the rearing of a child. Some 80% of primary school teachers are female and many children taught by female teachers do not have a father present in the family, therefore those children brought up by their mothers have no male influence or significant male figure in their lives. I cannot outline the consequences of this, but I believe it has serious consequences for the upbringing of children and for the future role of the male in society.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">We must face the reality that while there are in excess of 2,500 children born to unmarried parents each year, less than 1,000 applications are made by unmarried fathers for guardianship of the children. We must examine seriously what is in our culture which determines that the majority of fathers of children born outside marriage do not have a relationship with their children. We must consider how we should cope with the position to ensure that children of unmarried parents have as stable a relationship as possible with both parents.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">Society and the State must fully recognise that a family is automatically created when a child is born, regardless of whether the parents are in a relationship. Of course there will be exceptional circumstances such as those the Minister is dealing with here. Both parents have an obligation to take an active part in the upbringing of the children and the law should facilitate this rather than oppose it as it does at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">Children have an automatic right to access to the extended family of both parents and they have the right to have both parents' names on their birth certificate. They should have access to the family tree of both parents. How often, when you go to a doctor for an examination, will he or she ask about your family history or, for example, whether any member of either side of the family has, for example, a history of coronary disease? Every child should have a right to know the answer to that question and the State should facilitate that.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">This is a two-sided issue. It has to do with the State granting the right to single fathers to be involved but also with placing responsibility on those fathers who walk away from their duties and responsibilities and ignore the rights of their child.</p>

          <from>Mr. Andrews</from>
          <p eId="para_716">A Cheann Comhairle, you were good enough to allow me to raise this matter on the Adjournment a couple of months ago after the Supreme Court judgment. I am not claiming responsibility for the drafting of the legislation, but I find it very gratifying that we have managed to close the gap created by that judgment. It is a little sad that we are concluding our work in the Oireachtas at Christmas time with legislation which is a sign of the times, a mark of society generally and of marital breakdown in particular. It is sad that we should be concluding our work on this issue, but nevertheless it is very important and I am pleased to see such widespread support for the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">One of the duties which will come with passing the legislation will be its implementation. Specifically the Government, and perhaps the media to a certain extent, have a duty to clarify the position for the public. As the House will be aware, there was some confusion arising out of the Supreme Court judgment where some people were of the view that all baring orders were deemed unconstitutional rather than just interim barring orders, and violent spouses were coming back to the family home in some cases. That confusion created a great deal of grief for groups like Women's Aid. I hope the Government, on passing this legislation, will do its best to publicise what we are doing here.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">The Supreme Court judgment was designed to bring an end to the position where there were delays in dealing with barring orders, whereby the respondent would have an opportunity to give his view. In the case which led to the judgment there had been about three months of a delay between the interim barring order and the decision in the Supreme Court. It is amazing nobody ever brought a case in the time between 1996 and October 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">One of the issues raised by the Opposition is that this Bill is being brought through so quickly, but I think people can see that it must be passed before Christmas. On the one hand, the Government is criticised for not introducing some legislation quickly enough and on the other, as in situations like this, it is criticised for expediting matters too quickly. The Opposition is trying to have it both ways, which is not politically acceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">On the legislation itself, there has been criticism of the dropping of the phrase "in exceptional circumstances". There is a fair amount of protection in the Bill to ensure no fraudulent applications are made. I am particularly pleased about paragraphs (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) of the new subsection (3), which deals with sworn evidence. This is something which could be extended to other areas of the law because the obligation to swear an affidavit, the information upon which one makes one's application, can have a sobering effect on people who might abuse the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">The statistics were outlined by other Deputies and Senators yesterday. I think there were 1,000 interim barring orders issued in 2001, so this is a large area of the law that had been open to abuse. The dropping of those words allows the District Court, which is usually the forum for these applications, to deal with a case on its merits rather than carrying out some spurious comparative analysis exercise in different sets of cases. Finally, regarding the eight days stipulation, the Courts Service reports an average delay of 12 weeks between the issuance of interim barring orders and a full hearing. This is an appropriate answer to the problem, and I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Dea)</from>
          <p eId="para_722">I appreciate the wider philosophical debate but will stick to a few specific points made in relation to the Bill. I thank Deputies on all sides for their support. Deputy Deasy called for a wider debate, and I can assure him that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is serious about bringing forward the proposals I mentioned in my Second Stage speech to amend family law in a number of respects. I can further assure him that any proposals for legislation in this area will be developed in consultation with bodies such as Women's Aid, AMEN and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_723">Deputy Deasy is also correct when he speaks of the need for support for victims of domestic violence. The Government is committed to the provision of such support, as evidenced by the fact that it has significantly increased the funding for service providers. The funding for refuges and rape crisis centres, for example, has increased from €3.8 million in 1997 to over €11.5 million in 2002. Of course that does not tell the full story of provision of local authority houses and flats and various other measures across different Departments. I agree, nevertheless, that more needs to be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_724">Deputy Deasy also said that there should be a wider debate on this and that there should be a facility to bring in groups such as AMEN and Women's Aid. That facility is already there through the Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights. My understanding is that it is quite possible to make arrangements to bring the appropriate groups before the committee and let them make submissions.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">I take Deputy Costello's point about the explanatory memorandum. It is perhaps being overly-cautious when it says that there will not necessarily be financial implications. My personal view is that there will be financial implications because there will be more hearings and more pressure on the Courts Service. Regarding the Deputy's point about working days, a working day is defined as a day other than Saturday, Sunday or a public holiday within the meaning of the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997. Public holidays under that Act are Christmas Day, St. Stephen's Day, St. Patrick's Day, Easter Monday, the first Mondays of May, June and August, the last Monday of October, the first day of January and, where relevant, the following weekday when the public holiday falls on a Saturday or Sunday.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">The provision for eight working days gives greater flexibility to the courts than would be the case with eight days. For example, with eight working days, an <i>ex parte</i> order granted on Monday, 23 December next will expire on Monday, 6 January 2003. If the period were eight days, it would expire on 30 December and the court would have to sit on that day or earlier. While eight working days amounts to a longer period than eight days, our view, based upon the fact that it has been cleared by the Attorney General's office, is that it is not an excessive period or disproportionate abridgement of the respondent's rights having regard to the Constitution. In short, the Bill refers to working days in the lay person's sense, not in the technical legal sense.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">Deputy Cuffe made an interesting point about the eight day period. The <i>ex parte</i> order will have effect for eight working days at most unless confirmed by the court on notice to the respondent. The court will summon the respondent to a hearing, which obviously has to take place within the eight working days, and decide whether the order is to continue. If it is confirmed, the order will last until the full barring order application is determined in accordance with section 4(4) of the 1996 Act. In reply to Deputy Cuffe, there will not be any definite series of eight day interim periods. That will not be a consequence of the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_728">These were the main points raised in relation to the Bill itself. I reiterate my thanks to Deputies for their co-operation. As has been acknowledged, it is necessary to get this legislation on the Statute Book because, as a result of the Supreme Court decision, it is currently not possible to secure an interim barring order <i>ex parte</i>. Judging by the volume of applications for such orders, the legislation is necessary. These orders were found by the courts to be necessary in up to 1,000 cases in 2001, so it is a matter in regard to which we need to press on. I appreciate what Deputies are saying about not giving sufficient time to debate the wider issues and about the legislation being somewhat rushed. It is rushed out of necessity. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_732">This is a very simple amendment designed to streamline the proceedings of the courts. Section 1(<i>c</i>) states that if an interim barring order is made <i>ex parte</i> then a particular note has to be taken and so on. The wording I introduce is to ensure that if an application for an interim barring order is made, the same procedure would take place. I am seeking to ensure that there would be a procedure in place in the courts that would kick in automatically once an application was received and that, irrespective of whether the application was successful, a note would be taken of the evidence presented. This would be in accordance with the wishes of the Supreme Court and the manner in which it made its judgment and would ensure a fairness in procedures from the very beginning. Amendment No. 2 is consequential on amendment No. 1.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Dea)</from>
          <p eId="para_733">The effect of these amendments would be that a note of the evidence given in any application for an <i>ex parte</i> interim barring order would have to be made and served on the respondent even though the application was refused. The Bill, as it stands, deliberately provides that this be done only if an <i>ex parte </i>order is actually made. My Department is being lobbied for a change along the lines of these amendments by two organisations that are concerned about men's interests in domestic violence proceedings, namely AMEN and Parental Equality.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">However, I believe the amendments are fundamentally misconceived. Firstly, the purpose of requiring that a note of evidence be made is to make a record of the evidence on which the court acted in making the <i>ex parte </i>order so that this can be served on the respondent as soon as practicable. In this way, the respondent will know some time in advance of the hearing, which will be held to decide whether to confirm the order, what is alleged against him or her and he or she is thereby better prepared to present their side of the case. In the absence of the note of evidence, the respondent would see the sworn information perhaps but, as I indicated on Second Stage, this might not give the full picture as told to the judge by the applicant at the <i>ex parte</i> hearing.</p>
          <p eId="para_735">Providing for a note of the evidence to be made and served on the respondent is eminently fair to him or her. However, if no <i>ex parte</i> order is made this reason for preparing and serving the note of evidence seems to disappear. No order is in existence, the <i>status quo</i> is maintained and the respondent is still residing in the family home. Why serve the evidence given at the <i>ex parte</i> hearing on him or her? I can see no reason to do so. In fact, it could be harmful as it could serve to seriously inflame whatever friction exists between the parties and could even lead to incidents of violence. It is not difficult to imagine the atmosphere that would be engendered when service is made to the respondent of evidence given about him or her to a judge by the applicant when both parties are still residing under the one roof. The purpose of this legislation is to combat domestic violence, not cause it. That is a further reason for rejecting the amendments.</p>

          <p eId="para_738">This provides that within the period of eight days an application can be made by the respondent as well as the applicant to confirm the order or otherwise. The legislation makes specific provision for the applicant to seek to have the order confirmed. The amendment provides that the same entitlement is given to the respondent so the order can be dealt with within the period of eight days.</p>

          <from>Mr. O'Dea</from>
          <p eId="para_739">I understand the Deputy's intention. The Deputy wishes to provide for the possibility that the respondent could move to have the <i>ex parte</i> order discharged prior to the hearing which will decide whether to confirm the order. However, this possibility already exists in section 13 of the 1996 Act which provides that a respondent may apply for the discharge of an interim barring order or, indeed, any other order under the Act. There is, therefore, no need for the amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">Another point is worth making. If such a procedure is undertaken by the respondent, the onus of proof will be on the respondent whereas if the situation is left to run to its natural conclusion when the hearing is held to confirm the interim barring order, the onus of proof will still be on the applicant for the barring order.</p>

          <p eId="para_744">The amendment would guarantee a return date within the eight days. This arises out of the degree of confusion surrounding the eight day provision. In the court the judge would determine when the next hearing would take place. If an <i>ex parte</i> application is made on 23 of December, it does not have to be heard until 6 January, which is the latest date. However, the courts will not be sitting, if I am not mistaken, because they are on holidays at that time and domestic violence is likely to be greater during the festive season.</p>
          <p eId="para_745">The courts are not in operation for long periods of the year. We could end up with the situation suggested by Deputy Cuffe, where there would be continuous postponements with the eight day period being repeated on a number of occasions. It is important that during the hearing a specific date is agreed and set down at that time.</p>

          <from>Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_746">My amendment seeks to close a loophole. It requires the court to fix a return date for a hearing within the proposed eight day period and to serve notice of such on the respondent. There is no onus at present on the court to do so. This amendment would be helpful to the intent of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_747">If the amendment is not accepted, situations will arise where the return date for a hearing on notice of either an application for an interim barring order or a full hearing is fixed outside the eight day period. Hence, the order will lapse before the applicant can get an opportunity to have his or her application dealt with. It will also leave the application at the mercy of the varying sitting days of the courts, which differ greatly throughout the country. Dublin might have more sitting days than areas outside the greater Dublin area in various courts. If one is depending on the Circuit Court, it means waiting until it is sitting in the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_748">The amendment will relieve the respondent of the onus of bringing the matter before the court and will give the applicant the benefit of not being subject to the difficulties of the listing system or the discretion of the court as to when the hearing can be accommodated within the lists. The applicant for an interim barring order is not in a position to require the court to list the hearing on notice within the eight day period. The onus should be on the court to list the matter. I hope the Minister will accept the amendment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_392" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. O'Dea</from>
          <p eId="para_749">I have given this issue some thought. People's fears about courts not sitting at certain times and so forth are misconceived. We are talking here mainly about the District Court and family law matters are heard throughout the year. The District Court will be forced to sit, even in vacation periods, to deal with situations such as this. That is clear.</p>
          <p eId="para_750">Amendment No. 4 would require the court which has made an interim barring order <i>ex parte</i> to specify a date on or before the date on which the order is due to expire on which it will hear any application for confirmation of the order. Amendment No. 5 is similar in that the court would have to fix a return date within the eight day period so the application for an interim order could be heard on notice to the respondent. This is not necessary. The amendments seem to be based on the premise that the court will wilfully allow the order to lapse for want of a confirmation hearing or that the court will lose sight of the matter, perhaps under pressure of its other business. Neither of these scenarios is likely and the rules of court committees can be relied on to make any necessary provision in respect of procedure in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_751">In making the interim barring order <i>ex parte</i> the court will have accepted that the applicant is at immediate risk of significant harm and that in the circumstances of the case it is necessary or expedient, in the interests of justice, that the order be made <i>ex parte</i>. In this serious situation I am satisfied the court will be mindful of its responsibility to arrange its business in such a way that the order does not lapse because a hearing within its period of validity is not fixed. Regrettably, I cannot accept the amendments.</p>

          <from>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
          <p eId="para_761">The Conference of Heads of Irish Universities and the Council of Directors of the Institutes of Technology met separately with officials of my Department recently regarding the Estimates provision for 2003 and have since written to me regarding their concerns about the level of funding for the third level sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_762">The recurrent allocation for the university sector in 2003 is 1.7% above the 2002 projected outturn when account of the additional income to the institutions from the increase in the third level charge is considered. The recurrent allocation for the institutes of technology in 2003 is €372.9 million, which is approximately 1% less than the 2002 Estimates provision. However, when compared with the 2002 projected outturn which also takes account of the additional income to the institutes from the increase in the third level charge, the 2003 Estimates provision represents a 1% increase.</p>
          <p eId="para_763">The provision of funding for 2003 was decided having regard to the current economic constraints and the Government's commitments and priorities. In this regard it should be noted that in the past five years there has been an increase of 84% in the provision for the university sector as the recurrent grant increased from €333.831 million in 1997 to €615.443 million in 2002. In the past five years there has been a 95% increase in the provision for the technological sector as the recurrent grant increased from €192.7 million in 1997 to €376.1 million in 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_764">In the circumstances it will be a matter for the universities to manage their resources in 2003 and, where necessary, to effect economies to keep expenditure within the approved budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_765">My Department and the Higher Education Authority are working to examine ways in which we might minimise problems arising out of the Estimates. I am confident that the regular monthly meetings between the authority and my Department will provide the necessary forum within which issues arising can be discussed and mutually agreeable solutions formulated.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#OlwynEnrightFG" eId="spk_396">
          <from>Ms Enright</from>
          <p eId="para_766">Is the Minister not concerned that third level institutions believe they have to run their institutions like a business rather than an educational facility and that they have to look at the provision of education from a business point of view? Even prior to the Estimates, the president of one third level institution said we should try to increase our intake of foreign students, who pay higher fees, for financial and cultural reasons. Has the Minister concerns about that view? I have no difficulty in taking in those people for cultural reasons but I am not sure if we should use our universities to raise money by taking in foreign students.</p>
          <p eId="para_767">The Minister is aware that the presidents and directors of the institutes of technology have admitted that they are facing a financial crisis and that they will have to borrow substantial sums to meet a shortfall which they expect to be in the region of €39 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_768">Will the Minister confirm whether he had regard in the Estimate for decisions approved by his Department and the Department of Finance, including PPF, new structures and approved staff recruitment for 2003? Those staff have been recruited but the money to pay them does not seem to be available. How will he address this?</p>

          <p eId="para_769">I believe universities and third level institutes should have academic freedom, but that does not mean they should not try to be as effective and efficient as they can. The third level sector cannot be more immune to the current financial realities than any other sector. The sector has received its allocation and will have to live within it; there is no further money available. Furthermore, I do not agree with the institutes borrowing money because to do so would be to take from next year's allocation.</p>
          <p eId="para_770">Third level institutions should accept foreign students and not only for financial reasons. We should encourage them to accept foreign students as it will help build cultural relations between this and other countries. The institutes of technology will have to face the new financial realities. They have received their budgets and the Department made it clear that that was all the money they were to receive.</p>

Is it a coincidence that the report was released at the same time as the Government announced cuts of 5,000 places in the public service and a cap on recruitment? Is the Minister aware of the concern in many schools which expected that special needs support and resource teachers would be provided for children identified as having special needs? The expectation was there but things now appear uncertain. Will the Minister clarify this before schools resume in the new year so that they can be certain of what will happen?</p>

There is no equivocation about this but I know it will not stop people from stoking up fears. The NEPS is reassessing the submissions that have been made for the 788 resource teachers.

      <b>Mr. Gregory</b>
      asked the

      his views on the many requests to his Department from ICON, the Inner City Organisations Network, that a task force on education be established in view of the extreme education disadvantage in Dublin north inner city.
      [26866/02]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_405">
          <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
          <p eId="para_781">The Inner City Organisations Network is one of four networks operating within the Dublin Inner City Partnership. At present, the work of the Dublin Inner City Partnership is supported by a representative of my Department's inspectorate assigned to its education and training sub-committee. This group supports the planning and development of measures to tackle educational disadvantage in the partnership area.</p>
          <p eId="para_782">My Department also funds the services of an education co-ordinator. The role of this co-ordinator includes assisting with the identification of gaps in current education provision at local level, facilitating the development of new and innovative responses to address these gaps and supporting the networking and cohesion of education and training provision within the partnership area.</p>
          <p eId="para_783">In addition, my Department directly supports the educational needs of the community served by ICON through targeted funding for schools under the Giving Children an Even Break programme, the home-school-community-liaison service, the school completion programme and a number of other school-based programmes and schemes. Funding is also channelled through the City of Dublin VEC for a range of programmes in the further education and informal sectors, including Youthreach, the vocational training opportunities scheme, the back to education initiative, adult literacy programmes, adult and community education, the young persons facilities and services fund and other youth programmes and services. Under the millennium fund, financial resources are provided to promote third level access among young persons from the partnership area.</p>
          <p eId="para_784">As regards the Deputy's specific question on the establishment of an education task force in Dublin north inner city, I understand that such a proposal has been the subject of ongoing discussions for some time with Department officials in relation to the terms of reference, resources and representation by my Department on such a task force. As the Deputy will be aware, the centralised structure of the Department of Education and Science has meant that, to date, it has not been possible for the Department to be represented to any great extent on local development groups.The exception to this has been the 14 local drug task forces, one of which is located in the Dublin north east inner city area. These task forces were prioritised for representation because of the urgency attached to drug misuse prevention and education. However, the establishment of a framework of regional offices, on foot of the Government decision regarding the reform of the operations of the Department, will greatly improve my Department's capacity to engage in various regional and, where required, more local groups such as that proposed by ICON.</p>
          <p eId="para_785"><i>Additional information</i>Arrangements are currently in train for the roll-out of the regional offices from spring 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_786">I have said publicly, on many occasions, that my priority is to assist the most disadvantaged people in the education system. The Deputy will be aware that, notwithstanding the challenging budgetary situation for 2003, I have ensured that funding for tackling educational disadvantage has been protected and that it will be possible to make further progress in a number of specific areas. I intend to ensure going forward that resources will be targeted, in the most effective way, to support those most in need of our support, including the Dublin north inner city community.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TonyGregory" eId="spk_406">
          <from>Mr. Gregory</from>
          <p eId="para_787">Despite the myriad schemes to which the Minister referred, educational disadvantage in the Dublin 1 area is appalling. Only 4% of children in that area go on to third level education compared to 54% or more of children in Dublin 4. That is a stark example of the level of inequality in our society. It is also evidence that despite all these schemes, they have failed in this regard. The Minister has also been critical of the range of these schemes, which all supposedly tackle disadvantage. The numbers dropping out at second level in this area continues to be disastrously high.</p>
          <p eId="para_788">I note from the Minister's reply to a parliamentary question I tabled today that the Department does not appear to be geared to dealing with this problem. It does not even have literacy statistics for the Dublin 1 area, as apparently it does not compile statistics on that basis. It is in that context that the Inner City Organisation Network identified the link between the drugs scourge in this area and educational disadvantage and called on the Department to act in this regard. This is an area in which the Minister's office in the headquarters of the Department of Education and Science is located. For decades the area has had the worst record of educational disadvantage in the State, and is one which the Taoiseach has represented for many years.</p>
          <p eId="para_789">The Inner City Organisation Network believes that the response to the problem of educational disadvantage must be built on the success of the response of the drugs task forces to tackling the drugs crisis. The only way to co-ordinate all these resources is to examine the issue fully and to come up with an effective response to establish a local task force to specifically examine why, despite many different responses to disadvantage, education in this area remains abysmal, notwithstanding the best efforts of the teaching staff in the many schools in this area.</p>

          <p eId="para_791">Does the Minister consider he has a special responsibility to try to tackle disadvantage? He highlighted tackling disadvantage as one of his priorities. In this area in which his office is located there has been an appalling record of neglect for decades. There is still no effective response to this problem.</p>

          <p eId="para_793">I accept what the Deputy said, that there is a great deal of inequality and disadvantage in certain areas of Dublin city. Tackling disadvantage is a priority of mine. I read the various schemes that are in operation, which I will not repeat as that would be instructional. I am not sure that a local task force would not add to all of that. However, I have said to representatives of local partnerships that if they put forward innovative approaches, which would bring everybody concerned on board and not only one or two groups, I will examine any possible solutions to tackling this problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_794">I agree with the Deputy that one of the biggest problems is that we have all these schemes but little measurement of outcomes. Once such schemes are in place, it seems they must stay in place forever because little empires are built up. I spent a few hours with representatives of the inner city primary schools partnership to ascertain what is happening in that area. I challenged them to devise a scheme which I could follow up.</p>

      <b>Mr. Stanton</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Education and Science</b>
      the reviews which are currently under way or are planned into the provision of resource teachers, special needs and classroom assistants; if he will clarify his remarks regarding such provision here when compared with other countries in the European Union; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
      [26868/02]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_419">
          <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
          <p eId="para_804">Children with special needs in the primary school system have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs. The nature and level of the response is based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual child. Where such children are attending school on an integrated basis, the response would normally take the form of a resource teacher and or special needs assistant support.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">Since October 1998 the number of resource teachers in the system has grown from approximately 100 to 2,300. The number of special needs assistants has grown from approximately 300 to 3,800 full-time and a further 1,000 part-time posts over the same period.</p>
          <p eId="para_806">As part of its evaluative role, my Department's inspectorate recently conducted a review of 25 primary schools, which had recently been allocated such support. The objective of the review was to provide a detailed account of the additional allocation of resources for pupils with special educational needs with particular reference to the terms of the relevant departmental circulars.</p>
          <p eId="para_807">The survey established that of the 6,908 pupils enrolled in the schools surveyed, 3% were enrolled in special classes, 6% were in receipt of resource teacher support and 12% were in receipt of learning support provision. Thus, a total of 9% of pupils in the sample had been identified as having significant physical, sensory, intellectual or emotional disabilities. The survey report contrasted this 9% figure with the findings of the Special Education Review in 1993, which estimated that pupils with significant physical, sensory, intellectual and emotional disabilities amounted to an estimated 2% of the population, of which half were being educated in mainstream schools. It also noted that in England and Wales approximately 275,000 pupils have statements of special educational need and that this equates with approximately 3% of all pupils.</p>
          <p eId="para_808">While expressing concern at the higher than expected incidence of significant disability identified in the survey, the report emphasised the need for caution in drawing firm conclusions because of the small sample involved. It also noted that increased access to psychological assessment services in recent years had led to increased numbers of pupils in mainstream schools being identified as having special needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_809"><i>Additional information</i>Nonetheless, the report expressed concern that the greater availability of resources in recent years may also have led to significant over-identification of special needs in schools and that such over-identification had serious long-term implications for the future funding and development of special education services.</p>
          <p eId="para_810">In view of the survey's findings, arrangements were made for an immediate review of the 788 applications for resource teacher and special needs assistant support recently received in my Department and due for response in the week commencing 9 December 2002. The purpose of this review is to verify that the special needs resources sought in these applications conform with the terms of my Department's circulars governing such allocations. In the meantime, while my Department issued sanctions, in principle, to schools in respect of the resources sought, the schools were advised not to take action on foot of these sanctions pending verification of the application process.</p>
          <p eId="para_811">The schools were also advised that a psychologist from the national educational psychological service would be calling to carry out the verification process. The verification process commenced on Friday, 13 December 2002 and it is expected to be completed by the end of this week. Once this process is completed, my Department will advise the schools in question of their approved allocations.</p>
          <p eId="para_812">I assure the House that the purpose of the reviews to which I referred is solely to ensure that the support services in question are properly targeted at the children who require them and that the substantially increased resources which are now being made available in the special education area have the desired effect of ensuring all children assessed as having special needs receive the support they require.</p>

          <p eId="para_814">The Minister said at a committee that there may be an underlying health reason or other reasons as to why there seems to be an increased need for special educational support. In response to an earlier question, the Minister said that psychological assessments will now be carried out by NEPS. Does that mean that other psychological assessments of special needs students who need assistance in the classroom carried out by professional psychologists will not be admitted? Does that also mean that the waiting list for such assessment will increase? Does the Minister have any idea how many primary school children need psychological assessment? Is it not true that the list is long and, in some cases, the children concerned have waited for years for assessment?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_421">
          <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
          <p eId="para_815">No, it is not true that other psychological assessments will not be accepted. There is no change in the scheme in relation to psychological assessment. People can be assessed by NEPS. As that service is rolled out to the extent that 200 psychologists will be available, they will be able to cover more of the country. As the Deputy is aware, there is a scheme in place where private psychological assessments can be obtained.</p>
          <p eId="para_816">The purpose of the review of the 788 applications is to ensure and verify that the special needs resources sought in those applications conform with the terms of the Department's circular governing such allocations. In the meantime, the Department has issued sanction in principle to schools in respect of the resources. They have been told that they have the resources, in principle, but that we are verifying that the applications are correct.</p>
          <p eId="para_817">It is not the function of the Department of Education and Science to conduct psychological assessments or to determine whether they are necessary. The question of the number of children awaiting psychological assessment is one for the Department of Health and Children.</p>

There is no question of young people certified as having special needs not receiving the necessary resources.</p>

Our commitment is reflected in the fact that the number of resource teachers in the primary system will have grown from approximately 100 at the end of 1998 to a projected 2,300 by the end of this year; that the number of special needs assistants in the system will have grown from approximately 300 at the end of 1998 to a projected 3,800 full-time and 1,000 part-time posts; that in excess of 500 teachers have been deployed to support special dedicated classes attached to ordinary primary schools; that in excess of 1,000 teachers are in place in 108 special schools dedicated to children with special needs; that approximately €30 million is being spent annually on the special school transport service and a further €4.4 million on the special escort service for children with disabilities; that the allocation for part-time tuition services for children with special needs is being increased from €12 million in 2002 to €19 million in 2003; that the funding allocation for special equipment is being increased from €1.6 million in 2002 to €2.26 million in 2003; and that funding for the salaries of special needs assistants is being increased from €68 million in 2002 to €100 million in 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_823">These figures represent real and substantial improvements in special education services and provide concrete evidence of the Government's commitment to the ongoing development of these services.</p>
          <p eId="para_824">In addition, I am taking steps to ensure that the necessary arrangements are put in place for an efficient and effective system for service delivery. A key development in this regard has been the decision to establish the National Council for Special Education.</p>
          <p eId="para_825"><i>Additional information</i>The council, which will have a local area presence, will play a key role in the development and delivery of services for persons with special needs. It will also have a research and advisory role and will establish expert groups to address specific areas of special needs provision. Such areas would include the question of the future role of the special school sector and how the reservoir of experience, expertise and commitment which the special school sector represents can be better utilised to support the special education system.</p>
          <p eId="para_826">Arrangements for the establishment of the council are well advanced. A chief executive has recently been appointed to the council and it is intended that it will be vested by the end of March 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_827">I also intend to bring forward legislation, based on the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill, to clarify the rights and entitlements of persons with disabilities to an education service and to put in place the necessary framework to deliver the required services. My Department is consulting interested parties on the proposed legislation. My objective would be to secure the passage of this legislation through the Oireachtas before the summer recess.</p>
          <p eId="para_828">I am confident that the measures I have outlined will ensure that all children with special needs receive the support they require to enable them to gain maximum benefit from the education system.</p>

          <p eId="para_833">I am aware of the case of a young girl who, because of her visual impairment, must travel to Jordanstown for education services. While a lack in this area is being addressed, it is not acceptable that people with a visual impairment must travel outside the country to receive an education.</p>
          <p eId="para_834">Some people are very vocal about and critical of what the church did in the past, and in the process, all members of the church are tarred with the same brush. Unfortunately, one of the side-effects of the church moving out of education is that the State provision is increasing. The area in question is one that is most visible. We are committed to providing the services.</p>
          <p eId="para_835">If the case to which the Deputy refers is the same as the one of which I am aware, this was assessed as the best opportunity for the girl in that she would be able to avail of this education here. It is not satisfactory that she has to travel that distance, but the important point was that her needs were met and that the Department was prepared to do that. In the past, such children would have been ignored. We have far to go in this regard, but there is no doubt about our commitment.</p>

      <b>Mr. Durkan</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Education and Science</b>
      his proposals for meeting the requirements of children with special needs in mainstream education; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
      [26785/02]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_427">
          <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
          <p eId="para_837">Children with special needs attending mainstream primary schools on a fully integrated basis have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs. The nature and level of the response is based on the professionally assessed needs of each child. The response will normally take the form of resource teacher or special needs assistant support or both, depending on the level of need involved. The automatic entitlement to support was introduced on foot of a Government decision of October 1998 – I have given the statistics in this regard in previous questions.</p>
          <p eId="para_838">In some cases the level of special needs may be such as to require placement in a special class attached to a mainstream school. The number of special classes has grown from 350 to more than 500 since 1998. Each such class is dedicated to a specific disability category and operates at a significantly reduced pupil-teacher ratio. Children attending these special classes also attract special increased rates of capitation funding and are entitled to avail of the special school transport service. Children with special needs attending mainstream schools may also require access to special equipment. The funding for that has increased from €671,000 in 1998 to €3.8 million in the coming year.</p>
          <p eId="para_839">In addition to maintaining the ongoing development of these services, we are also establishing the National Council for Special Education. The council, which will have a local area presence, will play a key role in the development and delivery of services for persons with special needs. It will also have a research and advisory role and will establish expert groups to address specific areas of special needs provision. It will also establish a consultative forum to facilitate inputs from the educational partners and other interested parties. Arrangements for the establishment are now well advanced. A chief executive has recently been appointed to the council and it is intended that the council will be vested by the end of March 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_840">I also intend to bring forward the legislation based on the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill to clarify the rights and entitlements of persons with disabilities to an education service and put the necessary framework in place. My Department is currently consulting with interested parties on the proposed legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_841"><i>Additional information</i>My objective would be to secure the passage of this legislation through the Oireachtas before the summer recess.</p>

          <p eId="para_843">I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply. Can the Minister update me on the mainstreaming of the CE schemes as far as special needs students are concerned? Is he satisfied that training for resource teachers and special needs assistants is adequate? What assessment is being carried out to ensure students with special needs are succeeding in mainstream education and that they are not just left there? Has he had any communication with the Principals' Association with regard to the extra stresses placed on principals and what assistance they may require when they are putting this scheme in place? When will the special education commission he mentioned be operational?</p>

I am anxious that the council be set up and have its staff, including local staff and the special needs organisers. I have had formal and informal meetings with principals at which we have discussed special education. There are mixed views on this.

          <p eId="para_850">Yes, I support choice in education, within limits financial and otherwise. We cannot allow everybody to establish schools all over the place. However, the question related to special needs and whether parents should have the right to choose whether a child goes to a mainstream school, a special class or a special school. Based on assessments I agree with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_851">For some people with disabilities there is a huge educational value in having them in mainstream schools, rather than segregated in special schools. As the Deputy said, I accept people should be facilitated as close to home as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_855">As the Deputy is aware, the Universities Act, 1997 confers autonomous statutory responsibilities on universities in relation to the day-to-day management of their affairs. The conduct of staff relations is a matter for each university in accordance with section 25 of the Act. In this context it would not be appropriate for me to comment on operational management or individual disciplinary issues within a particular university such as the issue raised by the Deputy.</p>

          <p eId="para_856">No doubt the Minister is aware through letters from, for example, SIPTU that DCU is allegedly in breach of the Universities Act, contrary to his response to a previous question. He may not be able to comment specifically in individual cases, but there seems to be a concerted effort by the management of DCU to deny a lecturer his rights to make a case. Crucial files were not given before a meeting with the Rights Commissioner where the person in question was to give a refutation of specific allegations by DCU management. In recent months I have met a number of students from DCU and they allege they were bribed to drop the science and society course in return for something being done for them, which is totally unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_857">Under his powers, will the Minister establish conclusively whether DCU has been in breach of the Universities Act as SIPTU has alleged in its refutation letter to him? If so what action can be taken to ensure that the management will work within the remit of that from now on? Otherwise there will be summary dismissals—</p>

Section 14(1)(<i>b</i>) of the Universities Act lays out what the university must do in performing its functions. It is independent and autonomous and if issues arise, such as unfair dismissals, other laws can be invoked by the union or the individual to protect their rights.</p>

          <p eId="para_862">The main purpose of the school transport scheme is to ensure that pupils, who might otherwise have difficulty in attending school, can do so on a regular basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_863">The scheme conveys over 130,000 pupils, at both primary and post-primary levels, to school at present. In providing this service in the region of 2,850 vehicles are required daily covering approximately 5,600 routes to school.</p>
          <p eId="para_864">The vast majority of school transport users are satisfied with the service provided. However, a number of users appeal to my Department each year for changes to be made in the delivery of the service to meet their particular needs. In order to increase transparency in the delivery of the system and to demonstrate to our customers that such appeals are treated in an efficient and objective manner, an independent appeals board will be established. It is proposed that the appeals board will commence its operation in January. Arrangements relating to its composition and operation are at an advanced stage, as is the preparation of suitable material to promote public awareness. I propose to make an announcement on these matters in early January and will forward details to the Deputy.</p>

Will the board have responsibilities in the area of safety on school buses, for instance, the issues of overcrowding and the non-wearing of seat belts?

          <p eId="para_869">The reason for the establishment of the appeals board will be to introduce and increase transparency in the delivery of the system. The Department currently deals with a number of cases. It is important that people feel their cases are being considered in an independent manner. The types of appeal that may be expected range from dissatisfaction with the safety of a pick up or drop off point to distances from pick up points, safety issues and disputes concerning the distance for eligibility.

          <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
          <p eId="para_880">I propose to take Questions Nos. 32, 46, 87 and 88 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_881">An Agreed Programme for Government sets out a commitment to implement changes to retention and support policies which will assist schools in areas of significant disadvantage to recruit and retain teachers. My Department is committed to providing support for teachers in all primary schools. Following negotiations with teacher representatives, there have been many improvements in the conditions of service of teachers in recent times. These include the introduction of release time for teaching principals, improvements in conditions for the appointment of administrative principals, the introduction of payments in respect of supervision duties and the provision of increased substitute cover for absences.</p>
          <p eId="para_882">My Department is in ongoing discussion with teachers' representatives concerning the conditions of service of primary teachers. The recruitment and retention of teaching staff is a difficulty for many boards of management at present due to the current shortage. The difficulty is not confined to disadvantaged schools alone. The action being taken to increase the teacher supply generally will ensure the current difficulties with regard to teacher supply will be eliminated. The difficulties currently experienced are aggravated by the number of teachers currently availing of the career break and job sharing schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_883">In the context of the commitment concerning retention and support policies referred to in the programme for Government, I have asked officials of my Department to examine how best this commitment can be implemented over the next five years and to consult with the partners in education in that regard. I understand a subgroup of the statutory committee on disadvantage is currently examining the recruitment and retention of teachers within schools in disadvantaged areas. I will examine any recommendations which this sub-committee may make on the issues.</p>

          <from>Ms O'Sullivan</from>
          <p eId="para_884">Is the Minister alarmed by the recent report which reveals that more than 1,000 untrained teachers are working in primary schools and that the majority of the schools affected are in disadvantaged areas? I ask him to treat this as a matter of urgency because children who are already disadvantaged by virtue of where they live and their family backgrounds are being doubly disadvantaged by being taught by untrained teachers. Will he introduce measures to reduce class size and class contact time for teachers in disadvantaged schools? These would support and assist teachers who are, in many cases, under considerable pressure and stress. Does he have plans to involve community programmes in schools and provide support for communities in order to address the issue in a holistic way?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_456">
          <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
          <p eId="para_885">As the Deputy will appreciate, it is not possible for me to produce teachers from my back pocket. The problem of teacher shortages arose because the number of graduates allowed to enter primary teaching colleges fell to 150 in the 1995-96 period. This was addressed in a very substantial way in the past four to five years. Although it takes time to train teachers, fortunately, some 1,400 new teachers came through the system this year and the current level will be maintained.</p>
          <p eId="para_886">It is a little contradictory to call for fewer children to be taught by untrained teachers while, at the same time, seeking a reduction in class contact times and pupil-teacher ratios as well as improved conditions for teachers. Every time one improves the lot of teachers by removing them from class contact, one exacerbates the problem on the other side. As I said recently, if all the qualified teachers on career breaks, on <i>force majeure</i> leave and on the other schemes in operation, which were designed not only for teachers but for everybody and to which they are entitled, were back in the system, there would not be a shortage.</p>
          <p eId="para_887">My priority is to provide teachers and ensure children, particularly those in disadvantaged areas, have trained teachers. That may mean making decisions on other matters which will not reduce class contact hours for teachers or, effectively, reduce PT hours except in disadvantaged areas. They are the types of choices I will have to make. I am sure I will have the full support of the INTO which has said its members will not teach in schools with untrained teachers after 2005. If the INTO is serious, it will support me in trying to ensure we train the teachers we need and that they are in place by 2005, so that situation will not arise. It is incompatible to be shouting about reducing class sizes and PT hours while looking for more time off for teachers or more breaks. There must be a balance and I intend to balance it in favour of the pupils.</p>

          <from>Ms Enright</from>
          <p eId="para_888">Further to his comments a fortnight ago, does the Minister intend to pay bonuses to try to retain teachers in these schools? Where does he intend to get the funding to do that? There is a difference between disadvantaged areas and disadvantaged children. Does the Minister accept that many of the special programmes are targeted at relatively few urban schools in what would technically be called disadvantaged areas and that over 60% of disadvantaged pupils come from rural communities and towns? Does he have any proposals to spread those programmes out to those types of schools or will he target other programmes to try to deal with these children who may be scattered over a large number of schools in different areas?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_458">
          <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
          <p eId="para_889">There has been a move from disadvantaged areas and schools to disadvantaged pupils. That is something which is being considered. There is a certain validity in the argument that each child should be targeted. If one reduces the pupil teacher ratio in a school, it may not benefit the most disadvantaged pupils. It will, however, benefit them if the teacher uses the extra time he or she has to work with weaker students. There is a tendency with these blanket schemes that those who are already advantaged are even more advantaged and those who are disadvantaged are further disadvantaged. That is a problem we must address.</p>
          <p eId="para_890">The Breaking the Cycle programme applies to urban and rural schools and the school completion programme will apply to both as well. We need to take a thorough look at all these schemes and at how we target disadvantage. The Deputies spoke about all the schemes and I think they were a bit unfair when they said they were not making a difference because they are. The question is whether they make enough of a difference. I agree with Deputies that they do not.</p>

          <from>Mr. Gogarty</from>
          <p eId="para_891">The Minister said job sharing and career breaks are affecting teacher numbers but said previously that he was looking at a plan to encourage people to work in disadvantaged areas for some form of non-financial incentive. Resource teachers sometimes take two or three children from each class in the morning and afternoon. Does he agree there is plenty of scope for job sharing as an incentive for resource teachers in particular? This could be targeted in a cost effective way.</p>

          <from>Mr. Stanton</from>
          <p eId="para_892">The Minister spoke primarily about primary schools. What suggestions has he in regard to second level schools? What are his views on weighted payments for teachers teaching in stressful conditions and on the home school liaison programme? Does he have plans to expand that programme?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_461">
          <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
          <p eId="para_893">I would have no difficulty with any scheme which got teachers into schools, whether resource, part-time or otherwise. The home school community liaison scheme appears to be working well and has had positive effects. It is a scheme at which we should look, particularly in light of the welfare board being put in place. There is room for more synergy there.</p>

          <p eId="para_899">The Census 2002 preliminary report, based on summary information assembled during the fieldwork, was published on 24 July 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_900">The main finding of the preliminary report was that the population increased by more than 290,000 persons between 1996 and 2002 to reach its highest level since 1871.</p>
          <p eId="para_901">The preliminary total for the population enumerated on census night 28 April 2002 was 3.917.336 persons, compared with 3.626.087 in April 1996, representing an increase of 8% in six years.</p>
          <p eId="para_902">The populations of Kildare, +29,003 and Meath +24,204 both increased by more than a fifth between 1996 and 2002. Other Leinster counties which showed large increases were Westmeath +13.8%, Wexford +11.7%, Laoighis +10.9%, Louth +10.5% and Carlow +10.2%. Overall, the increase in the population of Dublin was 6.1%; somewhat lower than for the State as a whole.</p>
          <p eId="para_903">Cork City was the only administrative county in the State to register a population decline while for the first time on record the population of Leitrim has shown an increase, up 3% since 1996.</p>
          <p eId="para_904">The CSO is committed to finalising the data capture phase of the census processing by the end of April 2003 and this work is proceeding on schedule. Following this it is planned to release the definitive demographic results from the census by the middle of 2003 and to follow this up with the remaining socio-economic results towards the latter part of the year.</p>

          <p eId="para_913">The reduction in the 2003 allocation referred to by the Deputies is primarily due to the cyclical nature of expenditure on the census of population.</p>

          <p eId="para_915">Since the 2003 Book of Estimates shows a reduction of about €21.3 million in the allocation for the CSO, it can be observed that more than €1 million extra is available to the office for non-census activities.</p>

          <from>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
          <p eId="para_924">There is a provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling €120 million over the period 2000 to 2006 to tackle disadvantage at third level. In line with a commitment under the programme for prosperity and fairness, my predecessor, Deputy Woods, established the action group on access to third level education to advise on the development of a co-ordinated strategy to increase participation of students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with a disability at third level. The action group's report was published in July 2001. Responsibility for implementation of many of its recommendations lies with my Department while others require action on the part of different Departments. On a wider level, the recommendations call for action on the part of third level institutions, schools and community and voluntary groups.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_99">To date a number of measures have been taken by my Department in response to some of the main recommendations in the report. The most significant spending recommendation of the group concerned the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, commonly referred to as top-up grants. These recommendations were introduced, with retrospective effect, from the 2000-01 academic year. Following a recent review, I increased the annual income threshold for the special rates by 32%, which is significant. For 2002 to 2003, I increased the special rate of grant to €4,000 for students residing more than 15 miles from college and €1,600 for students resident within 15 miles of college. This is equivalent to a top-up of €1,490 and €596 respectively, for eligible students, on the ordinary maintenance grant. As a result of the review, it is expected that the number of students qualifying for the top-up grant in 2002 and 2003 will double to 7,000 students.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_100">A new millennium partnership fund for disadvantage was introduced with effect from 2001. The fund provides assistance to partnership companies and community groups to develop support schemes for students from disadvantaged families. Area Development Management limited, under whose aegis the partnerships operate, accepted my Department's request that it would administer the fund for the 2001 to 2002 academic year. The total allocation for the academic year was €1.2 million, with 37 partnerships and community groups receiving allocations from the fund. For 2002 to 2003, I have increased the provision for the fund to €2 million. ADM Limited, which is continuing to administer the fund, has notified 50 area partnerships and community groups of their allocations in respect of the academic year.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_101">The report of the action group on access to third level education sets out a co-ordinated framework of actions required to improve equity of access to third level. The group considered a single co-ordinating body to be essential to realise the framework. Accordingly, a key recommendation of the group was that a national office for equity of access to higher education be established to ensure the effective implementation of many of the recommendations in the report. I have given approval for the establishment of the national office for equity of access to higher education, within the Higher Education Authority. I anticipate that the office will facilitate increased third level access by the three target groups in partnership with my Department, the third level institutions and other stakeholders and agencies.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_102">Some of the action group's recommendations relate to the achieving of targets for access to third level education, over the period of the national development plan, on the part of students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with a disability. I am committed to progressing these, and other, recommendations in the report of the action group on access to third level education and to ensuring that the issue of equity of access to third level education remains a priority during my tenure as Minister for Education and Science.</summary>

          <from>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
          <p eId="para_926">The Breaking the Cycle pilot project was launched in 1996 and seeks to discriminate positively in favour of primary schools in selected urban and rural areas which have high concentrations of children who are at risk of not reaching their potential in the education system because of their socio-economic backgrounds. When the project was launched there were 33 schools in the urban dimension and 123 schools in the rural dimension. However, due to amalgamations and withdrawals there are now 32 designated disadvantaged schools included in the urban dimension and 120 small rural schools in the rural dimension. The 32 schools in the urban dimension are benefiting from a targeted programme of teacher and funding supports being made available. For the 120 small rural schools shared teacher and co-ordinator supports and funding supports are also made available.</p>
          <p eId="para_927">It has been found, however, that Breaking the Cycle, in common with the disadvantaged areas scheme, does not take account of different levels of need. On this basis, a comprehensive survey of all primary schools was carried out by the Educational Research Centre in 2000, at the request of my Department. The purpose of the survey was to identify the level of concentration in each primary school of pupils with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage and early school leaving. The survey is the most comprehensive ever of the incidence of educational disadvantage in primary schools in Ireland and it provides a valuable basis for directing resources to the areas of greatest need. The survey outcome forms the basis of the new disadvantage programme, Giving Children an Even Break, a major initiative which was launched in January 2001 to tackle educational disadvantage at primary level over a three year period. Under Giving Children an Even Break, my Department's approach is refined to ensure that the individual at-risk pupils are targeted. Giving Children an Even Break subsumes the previous process of designation of schools that serve areas of educational disadvantage. In total, over 2,300 schools are now participating in the programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_928">Giving Children an Even Break is a key component of my Department's strategy to discriminate positively in favour of children who are at risk of school failure or who are experiencing educational disadvantage. Schools in Giving Children an Even Break are in receipt of a range of additional supports including teacher posts and other non-teaching supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils.

        <summary eId="sum_103">All schools included in the Breaking the Cycle pilot project and those that were previously designated as disadvantaged will retain the resources allocated to them under those programmes. They may also qualify for additional resources under Giving Children An Even Break, based on the level of concentration of pupils at risk. Both Breaking the Cycle and Giving Children An Even Break are being monitored to ensure that they are addressing the needs of the educationally disadvantaged pupils targeted. Where modifications are required, the necessary changes will be made to incorporate these. In addition Giving Children an Even Break will be subject to independent evaluation to ensure that the programme is meeting its objectives. The evaluation will assist in its future development and the introduction of further interventions in this area.</summary>

Schools are obliged to identify possible hazards, assess the risks to health and safety and put appropriate safeguards in place. It is open to school management authorities or individuals to make direct contact with the Health and Safety Authority in relation to matters of concern to them and my Department would not necessarily be aware of such communications. Where they are issued, notifications from the Health and Safety Authority are sent to the management authorities of schools in the first instance.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_104">In practical terms, individual school authorities are best placed to assess the detail of their own health and safety requirements. I am satisfied that the majority of schools are aware of their responsibilities in this area. However, I have some concern that in a minority of cases, the devolved funds which I have made available are not being used in an effective manner to address health and safety issues as a priority. I have, accordingly, asked my Department to undertake a detailed review of expenditure under the scheme and work has recently started on this.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_105">To assist school authorities in fulfilling their responsibilities in relation to health and safety, my Department provides funding on an annual basis to each primary school at the current rate of €3,809 per school and an additional €12.70 per pupil. Furthermore, schools which require funding to address specific issues relating to health and safety above the value of the devolved grant, may apply to the building unit of my Department for supplementary minor grants. Approximately €61 million was expended by my Department on minor grants to primary schools in 2002, including those relating to health and safety. This funding was in addition to the payments under the devolved grant.</summary>

The recurrent allocation for the institutes of technology in 2003 is €372.9 million, which is approximately 1% less than the 2002 Estimates provision. The funding provision for 2003 was decided having regard to the current economic constraints and to the Government's commitments and priorities. It should be noted that in the last five years there has been a 95% increase in the provision for the technological sector as the recurrent grant increased from €192.7 million in 1997 to €376.1 million in 2002. In the circumstances it will be a matter for the institutes to manage their resources carefully in 2003 and where necessary to effect economies in order to keep expenditure within the approved budget.</p>

          <p eId="para_956">Education concerning alcohol and drug misuse and abuse is addressed in both primary and post primary schools in the context of the social, personal and health education, SPHE, curriculum. Specific measures have been put in place to ensure that all schools within the local drugs task force areas, at both primary and post primary levels, implement substance misuse education and prevention. Support officers have been recruited to assist LDTF schools with this work. At national level, it is intended that every primary school will implement the SPHE curriculum which includes substance misuse education and prevention, by September 2003. Walk Tall is detailed educational resource material which is provided to schools to support teachers in addressing substance misuse education and prevention. Comprehensive in-career development has been provided to teachers for Walk Tall. The primary curriculum support programme is organising, on a phased basis, in-career development programmes for all teachers in SPHE and has allocated approximately €1.6 million from its budget in 2002 to this work.</p>
          <p eId="para_957">In addition to this, a budget of €645,000 was allocated in the financial year 2002 to support this service in primary schools in the local drug task force areas. From this budget a once off Walk Tall grant of €500 was allocated to all primary schools in the local drugs task force areas in 2002. An independent evaluation of Walk Tall was published in December 1998. The findings of this evaluation were very positive and encouraging and a further evaluation based on the experiences and responses from schools in the LDTFAs is currently being undertaken.</p>
          <p eId="para_958">In post-primary schools, the implementation of SPHE, which incorporates substance misuse education and prevention, at junior cycle has been supported by the post-primary SPHE support service since September 2000. This service works in partnership with health promotion personnel in regional health boards. A budget of €1.2 million was jointly allocated to the SPHE support service in 2002 by the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Health and Children and health boards. It is expected that all post-primary schools will have implemented SPHE as part of their junior cycle programmes with effect from September 2003. On My Own Two Feet is key educational resource material which supports teachers in addressing substance misuse education and prevention in the context of SPHE. An independent evaluation of the implementation of the junior cycle social personal and health education curriculum at post primary level is being undertaken at present.</p>

This view has been endorsed by the Cromien report of October 2000 on the review of my Department's operations, systems and staffing needs and by the report of the action group on access to third level education which was published in July 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_964">The Deputy will be aware that the time frame for delivering on the commitments in the agreed programme for Government of June 2002, is the term of office of the Government. When I have had an opportunity of considering the range of issues involved in implementing the commitment I would expect to be in a position to arrive at a more definitive time frame. The Deputy will also appreciate that there are major implications, for example, for the local authorities and vocational education committees, in any proposals to change the administration of the maintenance grants schemes. It is my intention, therefore, that there will be full consultation with all interested parties and that no irrevocable decisions will be taken in relation to any future arrangements prior to such consultation taking place.</p>

          <p eId="para_966">I am aware that the introduction of new legislation and changing circumstances in society has created additional impositions on boards of management and principal teachers in primary schools. However, in recent years many improvements have been made to assist principal teachers in the performance of their duties and to relieve their administrative burden. Up until the 1999 to 2000 school year, principals were released from teaching duties to become an administrative principal where the school had a staffing of eight or more mainstream class teachers. From the commencement of the 2000-2001 school year, administrative principals were appointed to ordinary schools with seven mainstream class teachers and in schools with a principal plus eleven or more teachers including ex-quota posts. Further improvements were granted in the 2001 to 2002 school year when schools were allowed to appoint an administrative principal where there were six mainstream class teachers. The provisions were further enhanced for the 2002-2003 school year whereby administrative principles can be appointed to schools with a large number of ex-quota posts where there is a principal plus nine or more teachers in the school.</p>
          <p eId="para_967">The scheme of release time was also introduced for the 2000-2001 school year. This scheme enables teaching principals of primary schools to be released from their teaching duties for a specified number of days annually to undertake administrative leadership and management functions. The number of days release time granted is determined by the number of mainstream class teachers in the school. Substitution paid by my Department is provided for the days that principals are on administrative leave. The number of release days granted was further increased for the current school year and boards of management were advised of the increase in a recent circular issued by my Department. Arising from the implementation of the PCW agreement significant improvements were introduced to the management structure of primary schools by the allocation of additional posts of responsibility. It is a matter for the boards of management of schools to delegate functions to post of responsibility holders. The number of posts of responsibility range from two posts of responsibility in a two teacher school to, for example, 20 posts of responsibility in a 40 teacher school. In addition to the above, funding to primary schools for secretarial and caretaking services has increased from the €50.79 per pupil that applied in the 2000-2001 school year, to the €102 per pupil that issued in March 2002 to all eligible schools. This rate will increase further next year to €127.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_106">I am aware that a claim regarding the category of allowances payable to primary teachers is being processed under the teachers conciliation and arbitration scheme. The Deputy will appreciate that it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the business of the conciliation council. My Department is currently engaged in the development of a computerised on line system for the submission of claims for the payment of certain categories of teachers. It is expected that a pilot project will commence in the 2003-2004 school year on the implementation of this project. The implementation of this project and its extension in primary schools in the next few years should help to further reduce the administrative burden on boards of management and principal teachers.</summary>

          <p eId="para_969">Statutory rights to choice of school derive from the Education Act 1998, section 6 of which provides for a number of objects to which those concerned with the implementation of the Act must have regard. These include promoting the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents' choice having regard to the rights of patrons and the effective and efficient use of resources. In addition, section 15 (2)(<i>d</i>) of the 1998 Act provides that a board of management of a primary school shall publish, in such manner as the board with the agreement of the patron considers appropriate, the policy of the school concerning admission to and participation in the school and ensure that as regards that policy principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents' choice are respected and such directions as may be made from time to time by the Minister, having regard to the characteristic spirit of the school and the constitutional rights of all persons concerned, are complied with.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_108">At present, officials in my Department are working with officials in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government with a view to drawing up regulations under the Act governing the preparation of admissions policies. The purpose of the proposed regulations is to promote greater consistency, transparency and accountability in decision-making at school level and to further the objective, under the Education Act, of equal status to, and participation in, education. It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act. In this regard, a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. In formulating an admissions policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful. In particular, it must act in accordance with section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000 which, subject to very limited exceptions, prohibits schools from discriminating against people in relation to a number of matters including the admission or the terms or conditions of admission of a person as a student to the school.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_109">Where a board of management refuses to enrol a student in a school the parent of the student or, where the student has reached 18 years of age, the student themselves, following the conclusion of any appeal procedures at school level, has a statutory entitlement under section 29 of the Education Act to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department. A committee is established to hear the appeal with hearings conducted with a minimum of formality. In most cases, appeals must be dealt with in 30 days. Where appropriate, the Secretary General may give whatever directions to the board of management are considered necessary in order to remedy the matter complained of. In addition, in cases where parents experience difficulties in having their child admitted to the school system, my Department gives assistance in securing a suitable school placement through the involvement of its inspectorate in a consultative process with the school authorities.</summary>

          <p eId="para_976">I propose to take Questions Nos. 53, 73 and 75 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_977">The total annual amount paid in respect of fee-charging secondary schools is some €77.5 million. Of this sum, approximately €68.5 million relates to salaries and allowances of teachers. The balance includes the Protestant block grant, funding towards support services such as secretarial and caretaking services and grants in 2002 towards supervision arrangements. The payment of teachers' salaries is part of a complex scheme of funding for fee-charging schools, which has traditionally sought to balance considerations of equity, pragmatism and State support for minority religions. Teachers in fee-charging schools, irrespective of the denominational ethos of the school, are paid by the State. This may well reflect a long standing pragmatism that the State would be required to provide teachers for the pupils in question were they located within the free education scheme. There are 58 fee-charging second level schools in the country, of which 21 are Protestant. The latter schools receive funding by way of the Protestant block grant, which has its origins in the desire of the State to enable students of the Protestant persuasion to attend schools which reflect their denominational ethos. The block grant includes payments in respect of capitation and these schools also qualify for payment of such grants as the transition year support grant and secretarial and caretaking grants. Fee-charging schools not embraced by the Protestant block grant do not qualify for payment of capitation or related supports.</p>
          <p eId="para_978">I have no plans, at this stage, to withdraw State support for the payment of teachers in fee-charging schools. This support has been a long standing feature of our education system and one continued by successive Governments.</p>

      <b>Mr. O'Dowd</b>

      the progress which has been made to counteract early school leaving in areas with high levels of drug misuse; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

        </question>
        <speech by="#NoelDempsey" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_485">
          <from>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
          <p eId="para_980">Early school leaving is the most significant cause of keeping people caught in cycles of disadvantage and is a key indicator for subsequent difficulties including long-term unemployment, homelessness, substance abuse and criminal activity. Tackling the problem of school leaving is a key priority of this Government and requires movement on a number of fronts, including legislative and curricular reforms and preventative interventions. The Education Welfare Act and the establishment of the National Educational Welfare Board are important planks in the campaign to keep students at school. The Educational Welfare Service, although seen as a new service, is in many respects the modernisation and development of the long existing school attendance service, operated up to now by a small number of local authorities and by the Garda. The focus is on a welfare approach, with a clearly set out recording and reporting system, rather than the old style prosecutorial system.</p>
          <p eId="para_981">My Department's strategies to tackle the problem of early school leaving have included widening the educational experience available to students. The aim is to achieve a greater level of inclusiveness in curricular provision and meet the needs of the diversity of pupils in our second level schools, by expanding funding for programmes such as the junior certificate schools program, JCSP, the leaving certificate vocational programme, LCVP, vocational preparation training, LPT and the leaving certificate applied, LCA. My Department has also implemented schemes directly targeting those in danger of dropping out of the education system, namely the school completion programme, which builds on two earlier schemes, the early school leaver initiative and the stay in school retention initiative. The school completion programme recognises that a wide variety of home, community and school-based factors can contribute to low school attainment and early school leaving. Consequently, strategies designed to address the needs of young people at risk of early school leaving must include a range of actions that impinge on these aspects of young people's lives. These strategies must therefore be holistic and child-centred. The programme is based on the development of local strategies to ensure maximum participation levels in the education process. It entails targeting individual young people of school going age, both in and out of school, and arranging supports to address inequalities in education access, participation and outcomes.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_110">Evidence generated from the pilot phases of the school completion programme shows that the most effective way of addressing educational disadvantage is through an integrated services approach and necessitates the establishment of a local committee consisting of representatives from statutory and voluntary agencies, the local drugs task force and city or county development boards. The local drugs task forces were set up in 1997 to facilitate a more effective response to the drug problem in the areas experiencing the highest levels of drug misuse. The task forces comprise a partnership between statutory, voluntary and community sectors. They were mandated to prepare and oversee the implementation of action plans which co-ordinate all-relevant drug programmes in their areas and address gaps in service provision. Initiatives were funded to complement and add value to existing programmes and services under the themes of education, prevention, treatment, aftercare, rehabilitation and reducing supply. Forty-three of the 82 school completion programme projects are established in areas identified by the local drug task force to be experiencing the highest levels of drug misuse and representatives of the local drugs task forces have been invited onto the local school completion programme management group. In 2000 there were 264 primary schools and 113 post primary schools with disadvantaged status within the 14 local drug task force zones and 36 measures under the education and prevention themes of the national drugs strategy receive funding directly from the social inclusion unit of my Department. These measures aim to educate and alert children to the dangers of drug use.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_111">Such concentrated and focused deployment of funds should lead to more and more young people staying on and completing second level education. That is the most effective way to assist in redressing early school leaving, together with the integrated services approach which will help to support young people at risk in their school, home and community.</summary>

The Residential Institutions Redress Act, 2002 provides for the establishment of the Residential Institutions Redress Board. The purpose of the board is to provide a mechanism for persons who as children were abused while resident in industrial schools, reformatories and other institutions subject to regulation or inspection by the State. The Act allows for victims of residential abuse to claim financial redress for injuries suffered as a result of that abuse. The provisions of the Act allow the board to make awards based on a lower threshold of proof than is required in taking a case through the courts. An applicant is expected to provide proof of their identity, that he or she was resident in an institution, that he or she was injured while so resident and that the injury is consistent with any abuse that is alleged to have occurred while so resident.</p>
          <p eId="para_984">The redress board is accommodated in Belfield Office Park, Clonskeagh, Dublin 4. Judge Kieran O'Connor, retired judge of the Circuit Court presided over the planning stages for the redress board, together with Professor Desmond Greer, Dr. Helen Cummiskey and Dr. Ruth Pilkington. It was with regret that I accepted Judge O'Connor's resignation from the board for personal reasons on 4 December 2002.

The board has now commenced an advertising campaign in Ireland informing possible applicants that application forms and a guide to the application process are available from its offices in Clonskeagh since 2 December 2002. An advertising campaign will commence in the United Kingdom and internationally shortly. Following receipt of completed applications and supporting documentation the board will move as soon as possible to the provision of awards.</p>

Science is now a part of the curriculum for all primary school students. The vast majority of students – 89% – take science as part of their junior cycle course. There are only five small schools that do not offer science as part of the junior certificate programme. The NCCA, in its interim report on the review of junior cycle published in 1998, advised that all students should study science in the future. To this end, the NCCA has just completed its review of junior cycle science. I understand that a new, more attractive science syllabus will be presented to my Department shortly for its approval.</p>

          <p eId="para_995">A range of measures to improve teacher supply have been introduced in recent years. The intake to the bachelor of education programmes in the colleges of education has been increased dramatically. Since 1999 over 1,000 students have been admitted annually to the undergraduate programme. This represents a doubling of the number admitted to the programme in 1996. Since 1996, post-graduate diploma courses have been run by the colleges to increase further the number of graduates. In February 2002, 461 students commenced the post-graduate course and these students will graduate in June 2003. A further post-graduate course will commence in February 2003. A maximum of 460 places will be available on the course which will conclude in June, 2004. A total of 1,633 students completed the post-graduate course between 1996 and 2002. As outlined, the total intake to the colleges of education in the 2001-2002 academic year was increased to a record 1,461. This compares with an intake of 500 in 1996-97.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_113">There are currently some 3,460 students enrolled and pursuing various stages of primary teacher training programmes in the colleges of education. Between 2002 and 2003, it is projected that some 2,700 qualified primary teachers will graduate. This represents a huge increase in the number of trained graduates compared with 1995 when 291 graduated. My Department is examining the feasibility of providing a modular type course for second level trained teachers currently teaching in primary schools, who hold the higher diploma in education and the necessary academic requirement in Irish. This proposal will be discussed with the colleges of education in the near future and, if implemented, would enable these teachers to become fully qualified primary teachers. As well as increasing the number of student places my Department has introduced a range of initiatives to address the current shortage of qualified teachers. Graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast, who study Irish to Honours level as an academic subject are now recognised as fully qualified. In addition, primary degree holders with the higher diploma in education are now paid on the trained salary scale in respect of temporary teaching service. Teachers trained in EU countries are also paid at the trained rate for up to five years pending attainment of the necessary competence in Irish, while teachers trained outside the EU whose qualifications are accepted by my Department are granted the same provisional recognition as EU trained teachers.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_114">Those who successfully complete the three year Montessori course in St. Nicholas, Dún Laoghaire, which is recognised by the NCEA, and those who attain the Montessori qualification on completion of the three year full time course in the AMI college are recognised as fully qualified for substitute teaching. Such teachers are also fully recognised for teaching service in certain categories of special schools and classes where Irish is not a requirement on the curriculum. Fully qualified teachers trained outside the State are also fully recognised to teach in these categories of schools and classes. I am confident that the measures outlined above are contributing significantly to an improvement in the supply of trained primary teachers.</summary>

          <p eId="para_997">Following the general election I decided that, rather than proceed with the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill, 2002, I would allow more time for further consultation among all those interested in this important legislation. To this end my Department contacted organisations which had made submissions on the Bill as originally published, inviting them to meet to discuss it further. In addition, my Department placed advertisements in the national press inviting submissions from all interested parties. Thirteen submissions have been received from organisations and individuals interested in the Bill and officials of my Department have to-date met with 19 organisations who requested a meeting. The consultation process has been very useful and constructive and from it I hope to bring forward legislation which will be rights based and child centred and which will recognise the unique place which parents have in their children's education.</p>

          <from>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
          <p eId="para_1012">Children with special needs in the primary school system have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs. The nature and level of the response is based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual child. Where such children are attending school on an integrated basis, the response would normally take the form of resource teacher and, or, special needs assistant support. Since October 1998 the number of resource teachers in the system has grown from approximately 100 to 2,300. The number of special needs assistants has grown from about 300 to 3,800 full-time and a further 1,000 part-time posts over the same period. As part of its evaluative role, my Department's inspectorate recently conducted a review of 25 primary schools which had recently been allocated such support. The objective of the review was to provide a detailed account of the additional allocation of resources for pupils with special educational needs with particular reference to the terms of the relevant circulars of the Department of Education and Science.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_116">The survey established that of the 6,908 pupils enrolled in the schools surveyed, 3% were enrolled in special classes, 6% were in receipt of resource teacher support and 12% were in receipt of learning support provision. Thus, a total of 9% of pupils in the sample had been identified as having significant physical, sensory, intellectual or emotional disabilities. The survey report contrasted this 9% figure with the findings of the special education review committee which estimated that pupils with significant physical, sensory, intellectual and emotional disabilities amounted to an estimated 2% of the school population, of which half (1%) were being educated in mainstream schools. While expressing concern at the higher than expected incidence of significant disability identified in the survey, the survey report emphasised the need for caution in drawing firm conclusions because of the small sample involved. It also noted that increased access to psychological assessment services in recent years had led to increased numbers of pupils in mainstream schools being identified as having special needs. Nevertheless, the report expressed concern that the greater availability of resources in recent years may also have led to significant over-identification of special needs in schools and that such over-identification had serious long-term implications for the future funding and development of special education services.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_117">In view of the survey's findings, arrangements were made for an immediate review of the 788 applications for resource teacher and special needs assistant support recently received in my Department and due for response in the week commencing 9 December 2002. The purpose of this review is to verify that the special needs resources sought in these applications conform with the terms of my Department's circulars governing such allocations. In the meantime my Department issued sanctions in principle to schools for the allocation of resources. Schools were advised not to take action on foot of these sanctions pending the verification of the application process. The schools were also advised that a psychologist from the National Educational Psychological Service would be calling to carry out the verification process. The verification process commenced on Friday last and it is intended that it will be completed within a week or so. Once this process is completed, my Department will advise the schools in relation to their approved allocation.</summary>

        <summary eId="sum_119">With regard to the current 2000-2006 round, an issue has arisen in relation to the methodology used since 1997 to apportion the above overheads. This has delayed the processing of expenditure returns for some EU-aided programmes and the subsequent drawdown from the ESF. This issue is the subject of ongoing discussions between the Department of Education and Science, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Department of Finance and the European Commission. It is estimated that the net shortfall in this year's receipts arising from the above is €23 million. Any shortfall in ESF receipts to the Exchequer, in the present financial year represents a deferral of receipts, as opposed to a loss. It is not possible to anticipate when these receipts will be realised. That matter is dependent on a satisfactory resolution of the issue.</summary>

In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. In formulating an admissions policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful. In particular, it must act in accordance with section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000 which, subject to very limited exceptions, prohibits schools from discriminating against people in relation to a number of matters including the admission or the terms or conditions of admission of a person as a student to the school.</summary>

A committee is established to hear the appeal with hearings conducted with a minimum of formality. In most cases appeals must be dealt with in 30 days.

          <p eId="para_1035">I am very conscious of concerns expressed about the uptake of the sciences at second level. Before outlining the measures being taken by my Department to address the issue, I should point out that there are a number of science subjects in the second level curriculum and that the uptake pattern varies considerably across these subjects.</p>
          <p eId="para_1036">At junior certificate level there is one science subject and the uptake of this subject has been consistently high, with approximately 89% of the cohort studying it. At leaving certificate level there are three main science subjects – biology, chemistry and physics. The uptake of biology, though falling somewhat in recent years, is still quite high, with almost 40% of the cohort sitting the examination last June.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_130">The uptake of physics and chemistry has been a cause of concern for some time. I should mention that this is so, not just in Ireland, but also in most developed economies. The decline in uptake of these subjects started in the 1980s and continued until recently. There has been a reversal of the trend in recent years. In the leaving certificate examination in June 2002, 15.6% of the cohort took physics, up from 14.1% in 2000, and 12.0% took chemistry, up from 11.1% in 1999. I believe the current uptake rates are still too low, given the importance of these subjects to our economy and the all-pervasive nature of science and technology in modern life. Nevertheless, the modest reversal in the downward trend is a positive indicator that, with appropriate support and interventions, we can attract more students to the study of the physical sciences.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_131">The task force on the physical sciences presented its final report in March. A consultative period followed, with a deadline for submissions of 1 September 2002. Last month I brought a memorandum to Government on the matter. I can tell the Deputy that the Government is fully committed, in principle, to the proposals that I have put forward and to the implementation of the recommendations of the task force. I am at present exploring possible ways forward having regard to current budgetary allocations. I intend to press ahead with priority areas for action and to approach the implementations of the recommendations on a phased basis.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_132">I am confident that the measures already in place, together with those being planned by my Department in response to the task force report, will have a significant impact on the uptake of the sciences at second level.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1096">Former workers in IFI will get their full statutory redundancy entitlements, in accordance with the usual terms and conditions of the schemes. I understand that most of the workers made redundant from IFI have now received payments in respect of these entitlements.</p>
          <p eId="para_1097">In addition, the shareholders, while there is no legal obligation to do so, have established a special <i>ex gratia</i> severance fund with almost €24.5 million for the workers. When combined with statutory entitlements such as redundancy and minimum notice, which based on the statement of affairs produced by the board of IFI are estimated to be worth about €11 million, there will be a total of more than €35 million available. This is sufficient to provide average payments of about €57,000 per worker. At this stage, most of the workers who lost their jobs as a result of the liquidation have received an interim payment of €5,000 from the fund to help them in the short-term pending the determination by the trustee on the shape of the final scheme for the distribution of the available funds.</p>
          <p eId="para_1098">Both the Irish Government and ICI believe that in setting up the <i>ex gratia</i> fund they are providing severance arrangements which are fair and reasonable in the circumstances. It will be for the <i>ex gratia</i> fund's trustee to decide, after consultations with employee representatives, how payments from the <i>ex gratia</i> fund will be made. It is hoped that this issue can be resolved in the near future and that the final payments from the <i>ex gratia</i> fund can be processed.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_138">I understand also that the liquidator has now accepted, based on legal advice received, that the workers in Belfast have certain contractual rights in respect of severance payments and that these rights will now be recognised as a claim on the liquidation. However, I should point out that, in accordance with the terms of payments from theex gratia fund, any sum payable by the liquidator in due course in respect of such rights will be reduced by any sums received from the ex gratia fund.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_139">It is, of course, open to the workers at the other locations to seek to establish that they have similar contractual rights and I understand that the workers' representatives are exploring this possibility at present with the liquidator who is responsible for determining whether such rights exist.</summary>

        <summary eId="sum_142">The person in question submitted an application to the tribunal and it was examined on 8 October 2002. Unfortunately, the tribunal was unable to recommend an allocation in this case. While every application is treated in a fair and sympathetic manner, the amount of quota available for allocation is limited in the context of the large numbers of applications that are submitted and therefore the tribunal is not always in a position to recommend the allocation of quota to an applicant.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_143">The tribunal gives priority to the following categories of producers: small scale producers whose entitlement to purchase quota under recent milk quota restructuring schemes was limited because of animal disease or personal illness or where insufficient quota was available in the applicant's co-operative/dairy; younger dairy farmers with small milk quotas; producers whose butterfat representative levels are very low; and producers who are in financial difficulty.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_144">In assessing these applications, the tribunal takes account of the following factors: current quota size; off-farm income and-or other farm enterprises; size of holding; family circumstances, including succession; commitment to dairying; and previous allocations from the national reserve.</summary>

      <b>Mr. B. Smith</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Agriculture and Food</b>
      if, in view of the need to increase the size of the average milk quota in the Cavan-Monaghan area, in a milk restructuring scheme no quota will be lost from this general area; if, in a redistribution of quota, priority will be given to areas such as Cavan and Monaghan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <from>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</from>
          <p eId="para_1145">Under Agenda 2000, apart from the increase in quota levels for Ireland, I negotiated also changes to the EU milk quota regulations which allowed for greater flexibility in how member states apply the system. Based on this, I introduced major changes to the regime in Ireland in the European Communities (Milk Quota) Regulations, 2000. I am satisfied that these have had very positive effects and are achieving the objective of placing quota in the hands of active committed dairy producers. One result of these changes is that the milk quota restructuring scheme is now the main means by which milk quota is acquired by producers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1146">Notwithstanding the acknowledged success of the restructuring scheme to date, we now need to consider mechanisms aimed at making even more quota available to those who need it to expand their operation in order to remain competitive in the coming years and to earn a decent living. The fact is that there is not enough quota coming into the restructuring pool to meet such needs. With the help of the milk quota review group, I have been considering mechanisms which would achieve this. I have asked the organisations represented on the group to further consider how more quota can be brought into the pool, particularly in parts of the country where there is a serious deficit of quota relative to the demand from active producers.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_146">I will consider those submissions as soon as they become available as well as the recommendations already made to me by the review group. While I have not made any decision as yet in this matter, I have made clear the importance I attach to the existing ring fencing rules and the importance of these to certain areas of the country, including those to which the Deputy referred.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1189">I am aware of this case, which has been brought to my attention by a number of recent representations. Officials from my Department are currently examining the case and recently met to discuss it with members of the Irish Falun Dafa Association. They have also met representatives of the Chinese Embassy in relation to the Falun Dafa, or Falun Gong, movement.</p>
          <p eId="para_1190">The two individuals in question are members of Falun Gong, which was banned by the Chinese authorities in July 1999. Falun Gong are regarded by the Chinese Government as "an evil cult". The persons concerned are Chinese citizens and are, therefore, subject to the laws of China while in that country, including those in respect of Falun Gong. As they are not Irish citizens, Ireland has no consular function in this matter and the matter currently rests with the Chinese authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1191">However, the Government takes seriously concerns about human rights in China, including those of Falun Gong members. During his meeting with Premier Zhu Rhongji in September 2001, the Taoiseach discussed human rights both in a private meeting and in the plenary meeting of the delegations. During my visit to China in January, I held discussions with Premier Zhu and Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan on a range of human rights issues and concerns. We will continue to raise human rights issues in our bilateral contacts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1192">The EU discusses key human rights concerns with China in the framework of the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue which provides a forum for an in-depth discussion of the human rights situation in China. The dialogue has included an exchange of views on a wide range of human rights issues. During the meeting in Beijing from 5 to 6 March last, there were frank and open discussions with the Chinese authorities on the Falun Gong during which the EU reiterated its human rights concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_1193">The formal human rights dialogues are complemented by bi-annual human rights seminars in which representatives from academia, the judiciary and other experts from the EU and China participate. The most recent seminar tool place on 17 to 18 October, in Copenhagen during which the European Commission outlined the priorities for the dialogue.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_152">Recently at the fifty-eighth session of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, Ireland was fully associated with the EU statement under Item 9 on the Question of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms in any Part of the World, which outlined our concerns in relation to human rights in China. These included the persecution and harsh treatment of Falun Gong followers and restrictions on the freedom of expression, assembly, association and religion.</summary>

It will also have a research and advisory role and will establish expert groups to address particular areas of special needs provision. Such areas would include the question of the future role of the special school sector and how the reservoir of experience, expertise and commitment which the special school sector represents can be better utilised to support the special education system. Arrangements for the establishment of the council are now well advanced.

          <from>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
          <p eId="para_1256">In An Agreed Programme for Government the Government determined that the overriding priority would be to secure lasting peace in Ireland through, <i>inter alia</i>, the development of a spirit of friendship between the North and South and in this context to work to consolidate the North-South Ministerial Council and the implementation bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1257">One of my major objectives is to contribute to the achievement of this priority through the development of North-South co-operation and common action, in our common interest, in the area of education, particularly in the context of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_1258">As the Deputy will be aware, the Good Friday Agreement provides for co-operation through implementation bodies, common policies and separate implementation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1259">Aspects of education were identified among the areas for North-South co-operation and implementation. In a joint statement of 18 December 1998 the Northern First Minister and the Deputy First Minister agreed that the following areas should be prioritised for co-operation in education: educational under achievement; special educational needs; teacher qualifications; and school, youth and teacher exchange.</p>
          <p eId="para_1260">These have been the subject of ongoing discussions and conclusions within the North-South Ministerial Council education sector format, which despite the political difficulties that have emerged since the commencement of the process, has had four meetings and approved an ongoing programme of work on issues of common concern to both administrations. In addition, support for Irish medium education and the teaching of Irish is one of the specified functions of the language implementation body, An Foras Teanga.</p>
          <p eId="para_1261">Co-operation in education at primary, postprimary and third level is maintained across a very wide area of activity including school exchange, joint school projects, Irish language, youth exchange and information technology. There has been very wide ranging co-operation at Departmental, education professional, institutional, local education and organisational level prior to the Good Friday Agreement and on a more structured basis since under the umbrella of the NSMC. The number of projects linking teachers, schools and youth in co-operative projects in education continues to increase. In addition, initiatives to promote and enhance consultation and co-operation in education on a North-South basis within the broader context of relationships with Britain and the USA have been supported.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_160">Specific provision has been made in measure 5.5 of PEACE II to provide funding for approved projects in support of education, cross-Border school and youth co-operation. The Departments of education North and South are jointly implementing this measure. The objective of the measure is to develop innovative projects and programmes for children, young people, teachers and youth workers, which aim to address a range of issues of common concern in local communities. Actions aimed at promoting the social inclusion of, and reconciliation and mutual understanding between, children and young people in disadvantaged communities and groups will be particularly targeted.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_161">Departments of education North and South have also been mandated to explore the potential for further areas of co-operation in education, which might be proposed in future programmes of work. There are differences between the systems of education North and South. This diversity will have to be recognised but it equally provides an opportunity for both of our administrations to learn from our respective experiences in order to ensure the highest quality of education for all our citizens. This objective is shared within the EU context.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_162">Co-operation in relation to the development of policy on education and training has gained considerable momentum at EU level with the approval of the EU Education Ministers, in February 2001, of a report on the future objectives of education and training systems. This was followed with approval in February of a work programme to give effect to these objectives. This co-operation between EU member states reflects the determination of the Council of Ministers and the EU Commission to provide a comprehensive response and make a contribution to the Lisbon Agenda whilst recognising the broader mission and responsibility of education and training systems to society. These co-operation developments at EU level provide a backdrop against which the North-South co-operation provided for in the Good Friday Agreement can be taken forward.</summary>

          <from>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
          <p eId="para_1279">Since my appointment as Minister for Education and Science, I have made it clear, at every opportunity, that addressing educational disadvantage is my top priority. It is my intention to ensure that available educational resources are targeted at the most disadvantaged people in the education system at all levels. This includes targeting resources towards those children most at risk of early school leaving in order to encourage long-term participation in education and better educational outcomes for all children. In framing the education spending Estimates for 2003 I decided, as I have already stated, that priority would be afforded to specific targeted programmes for tackling educational disadvantage and for primary and post-primary education.</p>
          <p eId="para_1280">My overall approach to tackling educational disadvantage is set in the context of An Agreed Programme for Government and the Government's national anti-poverty strategy. Education is a central element of the NAPS. This includes three headline targets for education focusing on reducing early school leaving and improving literacy levels in schools and in the adult population.</p>
          <p eId="para_1281">The NAPS approach for education is based on a continuum of provision, from early childhood through adulthood, with the focus on preventive strategies, targeting and integrated community responses. The strategies and programmes which we are implementing to achieve the NAPS targets build on the very comprehensive range of measures that have already been put in place to counter educational disadvantage. At school level these are giving children an even break programme at primary level which applies to over 2,300 schools. For the most disadvantaged of these schools the scheme provides for the appointment of over 200 additional teachers to ensure that the maximum class sizes in junior classes will be 20 and 27 in senior classes. The expenditure for this programme combined with the targeted resources dedicated to the breaking the cycle project, the support teacher project and the disadvantaged areas scheme will be over €37 million in 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_1282">The school completion programme incorporates the elements of best practice established by the eight to 15 year old early school leaver initiative and the stay-in-school retention initiative at second level. It focuses on young people between the ages of four and 18 years who are educationally disadvantaged and at risk of leaving school early. The SCP involves in excess of 370 primary and post-primary schools in 82 clusters with a budget in 2003 of some €23 million – up from €15 million in 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_1283">The home-school-community liaison service serves primary and second level schools with designated disadvantaged status. The scheme promotes active co-operation between home, school and community agencies and raises awareness among parents of their own capacities to enhance their children's educational progress and to assist them in developing relevant skills. Over 350 co-ordinator teachers are employed in this service.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_165">In addition to these three schemes a wide range of other supports are in place including those for Traveller children, children of non-nationals and other vulnerable groups. Also, the establishment of the national education welfare board on a statutory basis from March to promote school attendance and combat problems of absenteeism puts in place a key structural mechanism for identifying and tackling problems of disadvantage at an early stage.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_166">In all this work I am advised by the statutory educational disadvantage committee set up under the Education Act, 1998, to advise on the policies and strategies to be adopted to identify and correct educational disadvantage. This committee, chaired by Dr. Áine Hyland, brings together experts from across the community of education interests and is a very important resource to me in planning to ensure that real progress is made in this area.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2285">Section 28 of the Broadcasting Act, 2001, requires that the national television and sound broadcasting service, maintained by RTE, shall have the character of a public service, be a free-to-air service and be available as far as is reasonably practicable, to the whole community. It is quite clear that RTE's mandate extends to catering for the whole community, including those who are deaf or hard of hearing. It is difficult to make a value judgment in relation to how RTE is meeting its mandate for groups that make up Irish society as its mandate is quite general in nature.</p>
          <p eId="para_2286">The 2001 Act provides a mechanism through which RTE's obligations to those who are deaf or hard of hearing may be better measured in the future. Section 19(11) of the Broadcasting Act, 2001, provides that the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland shall make rules requiring each broadcaster, including RTE, to take specified steps to promote the understanding and enjoyment of television by persons who are deaf or hard of hearing. The 2001 Act leaves it open to the commission to determine the specific steps to be employed by broadcasters and gives it power to specify the actual percentage of programming to which such steps must be applied. The preparation of rules by the commission will bring clarity to the obligation of broadcasters. As part of its recent application for an increase in the level of the television licence fee RTE gave a specific commitment to increase the incidence of programmes that would be subtitled.</p>

          <p eId="para_2337">As I explained in a response to Parliamentary Question No. 233, reference No. 21845/02, on 13 November, under the local authority swimming pool programme, 2000-02, which is administered by my Department, there are four stages in a swimming pool project following the submission of a feasibility study. These, in order of progress, are: preliminary report; contract document; tender and construction. My Department's technical advisors, the Office of Public Works, evaluate each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project unless prior approval issues from my Department. Grant aid is allocated only when tenders have been approved for the project and will be capped at the time of allocation.</p>
          <p eId="para_2338">Under the local authority swimming pool programme grants of up to a maximum of €3,809,214 are available towards both the refurbishment of existing pools and the provision of new pools, subject in both cases to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in designated disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost. Support is available towards the cost of a swimming pool, toddler pool, sauna and steam room.</p>
          <p eId="para_2339">My Department has received a feasibility study for a proposed swimming pool in Monaghan. Unfortunately, this proposal was received after the closing date set for the current local authority swimming pool programme which was 31 July 2000. Recently I met a delegation in relation to this matter and I am considering the issues raised at the meeting. I will be in contact again with those associated with the Monaghan project as soon as my consideration of the issues involved has been completed.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley)</from>
          <p eId="para_2451">Additional funding has been made available annually in recent years to the health boards in respect of the provision of health related support services for persons with autism and those with an intellectual disability. In particular €14.6 million has been invested in health related support services for children with autism or intellectual disability nationally between 1998 and 2002. A further €3.3 million has been allocated to these services in 2003. This includes diagnostic and assessment services, early intervention, home support and out reach support to children of school-going age.</p>
          <p eId="para_2452">However many health boards and specialist service providers have been experiencing difficulties in recruiting allied health professionals and specifically speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and psychologists. This is due primarily to the general shortage of available staff in these grades nationally. Health boards and agencies have been and are continuing to undertake intensive recruitment drives at home and abroad. My Department has asked the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority to explore other approaches which might result in the maintenance of an existing level of service provision or enhancement in line with agreed services developments for children using the resources allocated to the services. It is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards to decide on the specific approaches which they may consider appropriate in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_2453">In response to my concern regarding the high level of vacancies my Department commissioned a report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists. The study was published in July 2001. The report recommends a major expansion in the number of training places available for those professions.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_188">An inter-agency working group was established comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority (HEA). The HEA, following a formal bidding process between third level educational institutions, has allocated an additional 175 training places to respond to the training needs identified in the study. In addition, the Northern Area Health Board undertook a concerted overseas recruitment drive on behalf of all health boards. Procedures are being streamlined to minimise the length of time taken to validate foreign qualifications consistent with the overreaching need to ensure that all therapists working in the health sector are appropriately trained and qualified. As the Deputy can see from the measures outlined, the Government has been and is continuing to work to expand the level of support available nationally to children with autism or intellectual disability.</summary>

My Department is already involved in a wide range of partnerships with other Departments and bodies in an effort to tackle the issue of alcohol use by young people.</p>
          <p eId="para_2459">Education programmes have been developed so that young people may be more informed and better equipped to make informed decisions when faced with the issue of alcohol. Children are targeted through the substance misuse prevention programme called ‘Walk Tall'. Adolescents are targeted through the ‘On My Own Two Feet' programme which forms part of the social, personal and health education curriculum; the national youth health promotion programme with support from the health promotion unit, initiated a national project which provided opportunities for young people, 14-16 years to explore their relationship with alcohol. The health promotion unit of my Department is currently engaged in a three year alcohol awareness campaign entitled Less is More – It's your choice. Some phases of the campaign have focused on: those who buy or supply alcohol to those under age with a poster and radio messages with the theme of keeping children safe from drink; third level students in the restaurants of colleges with some facts on alcohol and a reminder that alcohol can affect one's finances, studies and health; youth leaders and health professionals in each of the health board areas to identify best practice initiatives within communities that promote awareness of alcohol to young people.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_189">A national working group on alcohol consumption in higher education was established by the heads of universities and third level institutions to formulate a response to a growing concern about alcohol promotion practices on campus, high risk drinking among students and its impact on student academic achievement and student attrition. A framework for the development of a college alcohol policy was developed by the national alcohol policy adviser who is a member of the working group and each third level institution can adopt the guidelines to reflect the needs and aspirations of its own campus environment.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_190">My Department is represented on a number of alcohol-related European Union and World Health Organisation committees and contributes to a wide range of policy positions including that on the legal age to consume alcohol. International research has repeatedly highlighted the issue of alcohol related injuries. A pilot study carried out by Dr. John Sheehan, consultant in liaison psychiatry at the Mater Hospital showed that alcohol was a contributory factor for one in four patients attending the accident and emergency department. I recently announced funding to allow this study to be expanded. It will now be conducted in five major hospitals; the Mater Misericordiae, St. Vincent's University Hospital Dublin, Cork University Hospital, University College Hospital, Galway and Waterford Regional Hospital. It will be conducted on the basis of a WHO protocol in line with eight other countries.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_191">In addition to measuring the proportion of alcohol related attendances in accident and emergency, the study will provide information on the patterns of alcohol related injuries and the context in which consumption had taken place. Materials will be developed and piloted to assist accident and emergency room staff in assessing and coding the degree of alcohol intoxication. It is expected that the study will take approximately one year to complete.</summary>

      in relation to the proposed enterprise liability for medical indemnity, if his Department proposes to assume responsibility for historic liabilities where there may be a shortfall of insurance funds to meet those liabilities in view of the fact that changes may result in Irish doctors being faced with the liability for historic claims arising from both public and private practice and also Irish patients' claims not being met.

          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</from>
          <p eId="para_2467">The issue of historic liabilities of the mutual defence bodies is one that remains to be resolved. The MDU and the MPS have historically offered cover to their members on an occurrence basis. This means that they are liable for the costs of a claim whenever it arises provided the doctor concerned was a member when the event giving rise to the claim occurred. This open-ended cover means that each year the defence bodies receive claims relating to events which occurred many years before. Their long experience of the business of providing professional indemnity cover for doctors should enable them to anticipate the pattern and cost of claims against their members. It is then their responsibility to price the level of their subscriptions accordingly. If the defence bodies are unable to fully fund their historic liabilities it is because they have either failed to properly reserve for them or have not charged the appropriate subscription or a combination of both.</p>
          <p eId="para_2468">These liabilities remain the responsibility of the defence bodies. It is a matter for them to determine how they will finance them following the introduction of enterprise liability. I am not aware of any suggestion that the burden of financing them will fall on consultants in private practice. The unique feature of the defence bodies is that they exist as mutual organisations formed for the defence of all of their members' interests. The suggestion that one relatively small group of members should shoulder a disproportionate share of the liabilities of a large mutual organisation would be entirely at odds with the history and tradition of these bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_2469">I do not see that the introduction of enterprise liability will have any adverse effect on the practice of private medicine in Ireland. In fact it should lead to a reduction in the indemnity costs of many specialties. I acknowledge that complex changes of the nature represented by enterprise liability can have unanticipated indirect consequences. I have repeatedly stated that I will be monitoring the situation closely and that I will liaise with organisations representing the medical profession and the independent hospital sector to ensure that the introduction of enterprise liability does not adversely affect the interdependence between the public and private hospital systems.</p>

          <p eId="para_2478">I have expressed my concerns about the issue of drug and alcohol misuse by young people on a number of occasions. In response to this very complex issue the Government developed the National Drug Strategy 2001-2008 Building on Experience which was published last year. This followed a national consultative process which identified local, regional and national issues and concerns. The eight-year strategy is being co-ordinated by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs across all sectors and Departments. The actions in the strategy are taken under the four headings of prevention, supply reduction, treatment and research. The role of the voluntary and community sector in both the prevention and treatment of drug misuse is central to this strategy, particularly in relation to young people and local community action.</p>
          <p eId="para_2479">Significant progress is also being made nationally in the prevention actions set down in the strategy. In addition to the implementation of the social, personal and health education – SPHE – curriculum, all schools have received guidelines for the development of a school substance use policy. The national youth health programme offers similar support for the non-formal education sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_2480">The health promotion unit of my Department is currently engaged in a three year alcohol awareness campaign entitled ‘Less is More – It's your choice'. Some phases of the campaign have focused on: those who buy or supply alcohol to those under age with a poster and radio messages with the theme of keeping children safe from drink; third level students in the restaurants of colleges with some facts on alcohol and a reminder that alcohol can affect one's finances, studies and health; youth leaders and health professionals in each of the health board areas to identify best practice initiatives within communities that promote awareness of alcohol to young people.</p>
          <p eId="para_2481">The recommendations of the strategic task force on alcohol, which I established earlier this year, are framed using the ten strategy areas for alcohol action outlined in the WHO European charter on alcohol. These strategies which include the provision of effective treatment services and the provision of information and education are based on sound scientific evidence.</p>

          <p eId="para_2483">As part of the national children's strategy, launched in November 2000, the Government included a commitment to develop national play and recreation policies to address the play needs of children and young people around the country. As the Deputy is aware, An Agreed Programme for Government states that we will develop a national play and recreation policy which will aim to ensure that all children have access to at least a minimum standard of play and recreation facilities. The national policies will respond to the play and recreation needs of all children and will be developed in a strategic way which supports the attainment of positive developmental outcomes for children and young people.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_193">The National Children's Office is currently drafting a national play policy, to concentrate initially on the under 12s. A consultation forum to inform the new play policy was held in November 2002 bringing together representatives from key groups with a role in developing play for children. It was attended by 57 people representing a range of agencies including local authorities, staff of city and county development boards, members of sports agencies, child care bodies, teaching and health professionals, voluntary organisations and play specialists. Issues identified at the forum as needing to be addressed to support better play provision included training, insurance, funding and the provision of a child-friendly environment.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_194">To establish the existing level of public playground provision, a survey of local authorities was carried out by the National Children's Office in September and October 2002. This survey found there are less than 170 public playgrounds owned and managed by local authorities around the country. However, some local authorities are making significant advances in progressing the issue of play for children. County Laois, which had no public playgrounds up to 2001, now has a playground, a play policy and a play development officer. Dublin City Council has assigned responsibility for progressing play opportunities for children to a designated play development officer and a play worker. In Kerry a play advisory committee has been set up to draw up a play policy for the county and includes representatives from child care, tourism, disability and sports organisations. Many city and county development boards have identified the need to develop play and recreation facilities for all in their strategies for economic, social and cultural development. A number of local authorities have play on the agenda of their strategic policy committees.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_195">The national play policy will encompass all the issues listed above and will specifically address the issue of provision of public playgrounds. It is intended to submit the play policy to Government in early 2003.</summary>

This will include the overall application of standards for drivers, licence holders and for vehicles. It is also envisaged that the functions of the office of the regulator will include the design and administration of a scheme to implement the recommendations of the taxi hardship panel in accordance with Government decisions on the matter; the setting of national taxi licence and related fees; the setting of standards for drivers, driver training, requirements for entry; the licensing of small public service vehicle drivers following consultation with the Garda Síochána; the setting of standards, guidelines and parameters for the designation and alteration of taximeter areas, the setting of maximum taxi fares, and the provision and designation of taxi ranks and associated bye-laws; the setting of standards for taxi, hackney and limousine vehicles and the implementation of the proposed wheelchair accessible taxi policy and the setting of standards for customer service and for meeting the needs of people with disabilities.</p>

The adoption of metric values for speed limits will of itself create the need for alterations to the imperial values applying at present. The last comprehensive review of speed limits was carried out between 1990 and 1992 which resulted in the adoption of the current structure. I intend to take the opportunity afforded by the process of metrication to review that structure in consultation with the Garda Síochána, the National Roads Authority and the local authorities, in view of the particular role given to the latter in the Road Traffic Acts in the application of speed limits at specific locations.</p>

          <p eId="para_2520">I propose to introduce a plastic card licence that will comply with the EU model specified in Council Directive 96/47/EC amending Directive 91/439/EEC on driving licences. I am anxious that the card licence be in place as early as possible. My Department is considering the detail of the proposed card, including the security features, together with the scope of the changes to be made to the system of issuing driving licences, with a view to preparing the necessary tender documents. I will be making regulations in due course for the introduction of the card licence following consultation with the EU Commission. It is my intention to issue a credit card sized plastic card as an interim measure pending full implementation of a smart card system.</p>

          <p eId="para_2522">I am informed by Iarnród Éireann that, pursuant to the terms of its agreement with the Spencer Dock Development Company entered into in 1998, it is required to vacate, by 3 Jan 2003, an area in the North Wall currently used to operate its container business. This development has been expected and was originally due to happen earlier this year. I understand that failure to vacate the site in accordance with the terms of the 1998 agreement could expose Iarnród Éireann to significant compensation claims from the developer. CIE has advised me that the revenue generated from the development of the Spencer Dock site will allow significant capital investment for the upgrade of rail services throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_2523">The agreement entered into with the Spencer Dock Development Company pre-dates my request to the board of CIE to refrain from reducing its services.</p>
          <p eId="para_2524">I have been advised that, recognising the inevitability of this development, in December 2001 an investment of €1 million was approved by the company to relocate and facilitate continued container handling operations in the North Wall area. The facilities on this new site allow 85% of current container volumes to be handled there. I am informed that to retain the balance of the 15% would have required an additional investment of €10 million. The question of the appropriateness of this further significant investment will be considered in the light of the strategic rail review.</p>
          <p eId="para_2525">The board of CIE, following a request from me, agreed to make no final decisions regarding the future development of rail freight until the outcome of the strategic rail review. The review will provide a national strategic framework for investment priorities and decisions on the development of rail services, including rail freight. I expect the strategic rail review to be available in the New Year.</p>

          <p eId="para_2527">The Prison Service provides work training schemes within a number of prisons in a workshop environment. These workshops provide inmates with the opportunity to acquire skills that will assist them in gaining employment when they are released. Examples of these activities are printing, metal work, woodwork, clothing, craft, etc. Income is generated from the sale of items manufactured in the prison workshops and from the sale of produce from the farm in Shelton Abbey. Total manufacturing income for year ended 31 December 2001 amounted to €949,348. This was generated from the following prisons:</p>

          <p eId="para_2549">While I share the concerns expressed by the Deputy about this atrocious crime, he will appreciate that it would be inappropriate of me to comment other than to confirm that it is being actively investigated by An Garda Síochána. In relation to measures to protect nightclub employees, I am assured by the Garda authorities that a long-established and excellent relationship has been maintained in Limerick city with members of the licensed trade, including the management and owners of nightclubs. I am informed that closer liaison has been established in recent months, involving the Limerick City Council authorities, to address such issues as security, safety, public order and drugs. I am further informed that additional measures are being taken, as appropriate, following an assessment by the local Garda authorities of the specific concerns of nightclub security personnel in the city centre.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_202">As I previously explained to the Deputy, a visiting committee is appointed to each prison under the Prisons (Visiting Committees) Act, 1925, and Prisons (Visiting Committees) Order, 1925. I am satisfied that the visiting committees perform a very valuable service and I would like to take this opportunity to thank them for their efforts and hard work.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_203">The function of visiting committees is to visit at frequent intervals the prison to which they are appointed and hear any complaints which may be made to them by any prisoner. They report to me any abuses observed or found by them in the prison and any repairs which they think may be urgently needed. The visiting committees has free access either collectively or individually to every part of their prison. In inspecting prisons, the visiting committees focus on issues such as the quality of accommodation and the catering, medical, educational and welfare services and recreational facilities. The committees also submit annual reports to me which are subsequently published. Members of visiting committees receive no remuneration. Vouched expenses for travel and subsistence are paid, on the authorisation of the prison governor, in line with Civil Service rates. Following is a table of the payments to individual members of prisons visiting committees for the period requested by the Deputy. The table reflects changes in the composition of the committees as a result of the term of appointment of some members ending and new members being appointed.</summary>

          <p eId="para_3578">In the course of his correspondence with my Department in recent years, the person in question has made allegations about a number of firms of solicitors and a bank in relation to their dealings with their dealings with him in a property transaction. Where the allegations made could be considered to relate to a criminal matter, my Department has advised the person that he should inform the Garda Síochána or the RUC – now the Police Service of Northern Ireland – so that they could take appropriate action.</p>
          <p eId="para_3579">Where the allegations made relate to civil matters, I am sure you will appreciate that as the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform I have no function and it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in any way. I also understand that the person in question has been advised of the various measures provided by way of legislation for dealing with complaints against solicitors.</p>

          <p eId="para_3582">In April of this year the Government agreed to increase the approved strength of the Garda Síochána by 200 to 12,200. As the current actual strength of the force has not yet reached this figure – it now stands at approximately 11,900 – my priority is to bridge that gap by making maximum use next year of the existing capacity of the Garda Training College, bringing the strength of the force to its highest ever level. A cap on public service numbers has been put in place and, until it is removed, it will not be possible to recruit sufficient additional trainees to progress further beyond the figure of 12,200.</p>
          <p eId="para_3583">It is not possible to give an accurate estimation of the number of trainees that will pass through Templemore for the years 2003 to 2005 at this stage. The Deputy may be assured that I will be pressing for the maximum number of trainees to be recruited for 2003. The number of trainees in 2004 and 2005 will depend on the number of retirements in the intervening period, which cannot be predicted at this stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_3740">Details concerning firearms seized by the Garda are published in the Garda Síochána annual reports. However, I am informed by the Garda authorities that a break down of these statistics per Garda division is not readily available and could only be obtained by the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of Garda time and resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_3741">As regards the issue of the availability of firearms, the Deputy will be aware that the holding of a firearm is strictly governed by the provisions of the Firearms Acts, 1925 to 2000. The Garda Síochána take all appropriate action to ensure that illegally held firearms are seized and that the holders of such firearms are proceeded against.</p>

          <p eId="para_3747">The Disability Bill, 2001, was published on 21 December 2001. Following concerns expressed by interest groups, the Government agreed to further consultations on future proposals for disability legislation, in particular the Disability Bill. An expert consultation team was appointed in April 2002 comprising Ms Sylda Langford, Assistant Secretary in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr. John O'Donnell, Senior Counsel, Professor Brian Nolan, Economic and Social Institute, Mr. Bernard Feeney, senior consultant, Goodbody's Economic Consultants, and Mr. Brian Crowley, Member of the European Parliament.</p>
          <p eId="para_3748">The consultation team is examining proposals from disability groups and is meeting with other relevant stakeholders, including the disability legislation consultation group, ICTU, IBEC, the community and voluntary sector and relevant Departments. The disability legislation consultation group is a representative group of disability organisations brought together by the National Disability Authority, NDA, earlier this year to facilitate dialogue within the sector and with the consultation team.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_223">In June 2002, a commitment was given in An Agreed Programme for Government to complete consultations on the Disability Bill and bring the amended Bill through the Oireachtas with provisions for rights of assessment, appeals, provision and enforcement. It is not possible to say in advance of the conclusion of the consultation process what might otherwise be contained in the legislation or whether it would be appropriate or necessary for the Bill to include provisions formerly contained in the Disability Bill, 2001, which fell on the dissolution of the 29th Dáil. Accordingly, the information given in the following table is one of historical record relating to the contents of the Disability Bill, 2001.</summary>

          <p eId="para_3889">The allocation of specific resources is a matter for the Garda Commissioner having regard to various policing demands which include those arising from the problem of drug misuse. I understand that, since the publication of the national drugs strategy, there has been a moderate increase in Garda resources in a number of Garda stations, including those in local drugs task force areas. The overall position is that all members of the Garda Síochána are charged with enforcing the law in relation to drugs misuse. Since the publication of the strategy, Garda resources generally in the fight against illicit drugs have increased, particularly with the creation of divisional drug units. These drugs units operate in divisions throughout the country with a primary focus on local drugs activities. In addition, the Garda national drugs unit co-ordinates large scale operations against drug dealing-trafficking and unit personnel either investigate such cases themselves or assist local investigation teams. Additional assistance is also available from other specialised Garda support units, such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation and the Criminal Assets Bureau.</p>

In determining the eligibility of a person, the local authority must take into account the annual net income – i.e. gross annual income net of income tax and PRSI – of the applicant and half the annual net income of any other person who might reasonably be expected to reside with the eligible person and contribute to the mortgage payments.</p>

In seeking to secure the future of larger urban areas the strategy endorses the need to continue with targeted area-based measures to tackle areas of disadvantage, particularly in inner city areas and in major concentrations of social housing development on the periphery of cities and towns.

It is a basic principle within this process that land owners must get fair compensation and that it should be paid as quickly as possible. The relevant compulsory purchase order, CPO, legislation provides for the payment of compensation by local authorities for lands acquired by them on the authorisation of a duly confirmed CPO.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_234">Compensation is composed of a number of elements: the market value of the land, disturbance, severance and injurious affection. Where a dispute arises about compensation the matter can be referred to an independent arbitrator for decision. A decision taken by the arbitrator is binding on both parties.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_235">The Planning and Development Act, 2000, provided for the transfer of the Minister's functions to An Bord Pleanála and introduced other changes designed to streamline the CPO process. These include provision for less formal oral hearings in place of the more formal public local inquiries, the confirmation of CPOs by local authorities themselves where there are no objections, time limits on submitting CPOs to the board for confirmation, an 18 week objective for making decisions on CPOs and shortening the period within which local authorities must serve notice to treat to purchase the land from three years to 18 months.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_236">A voluntary agreement in respect of the acquisition of land for national roads under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 between the Irish Farmers Association, the National Roads Authority and the Department of the Environment and Local Government, which was then the appropriate central government Department in relation to national roads, came into operation on 10 December 2001 regarding the acquisition of farmland for national roads. The agreement provides for the establishment of a liaison group including representatives from the NRA and IFA to facilitate its efficient and effective implementation. The agreement also provides for an independent assessment mechanism in cases where the local authority and the individual land owner fail to reach agreement on the compensation package to be paid. A copy of the agreement has been placed in the Oireachtas Library. The NRA has issued circulars to local authorities in relation to implementation arrangements.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_237">My Department has no proposals to alter existing arrangements with regard to the processing and payment of compensation under CPOs.</summary>

Those who are on the back to work allowance scheme will not be affected by these changes.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_243">The need to re-focus the BTWA was determined by the substantial fall in long-term unemployment since the scheme was established and the need to target resources on more disadvantaged groups. In this context, framework IV of the PPF includes a commitment to carry out an overall appraisal of active labour market programmes, ALMPs, to ensure their continued relevance in the context of labour market requirements and effectiveness, particularly in terms of training where appropriate, and to monitor the rate of progression from ALMPs to open employment.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_244">This work is currently under way under the aegis of the standing committee on the labour market, SCLM, which is chaired by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and which includes a representative from my Department. To aid the committee in its deliberations, consultants were commissioned to assess and report on the overall effectiveness of existing ALMPs, including the back to work allowance scheme. I understand that this report has been presented to the committee for consideration.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_245">In December 2000 and prior to the PPF related review, the same consultants also completed a report specifically on BTWA for my Department which recommended,inter alia: the numbers of participants in both the employee and self-employment strands to be significantly reduced; a new set of selection criteria for scheme participation to be introduced with flexibility to be allowed in the duration of support offered; the selection criteria for self-employed participants to exclude particular occupations where the skill content is low and where the probability of dead-weight is high; the selection criteria to afford priority to the very long-term unemployed.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_246">The need to re-focus the back to work scheme was also identified as part of the Independent Estimates Review Committee, which highlighted the need to re-examine the scheme in the light of the fall in long-term unemployment. While that committee recommended allowing no new entrants to the scheme in 2003, I am maintaining the scheme for those with particular difficulty in the labour market.</summary>
