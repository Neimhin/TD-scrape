          <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_1">
            <from>Deputy Willie O'Dea<recordedTime time="2014-06-10T14:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_2">The Minister will be aware that various suggestions were made to alleviate the effects of the cut in the respite care grant. I am trying to ascertain whether any of those recommendations has been implemented or is intended to be implemented.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social Protection<recordedTime time="2014-06-10T14:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_3">The Government published a national carer strategy in 2012 to signal its commitment to recognising and respecting carers as key care partners and to respond to their needs across a number of policy areas. The contribution that carers make is critical to our society. The Department, in meeting its commitments under this strategy, provides a range of income supports to assist with the financial burden of caring. These include carer's allowance, carer's benefit, domiciliary care allowance and respite care grant.</p>
            <p eId="para_4">A total of €806 million is provided for these payments in 2014.</p>
            <p eId="para_5"> Carer's allowance is the main income support. Over the past decade the number of people in receipt of carer's allowance has increased from just over 23,000 in 2004 to close to 57,200 at the end of last May. Nearly 25,000 of these recipients are in receipt of a carer's payment at half rate as they are also in receipt of another social welfare payment. For example, a lone parent who is caring on a full-time basis for an elderly relative can receive €219.80 in one-parent family payment and €102 per week in half-rate carer's allowance. Recipients of carer's allowance also qualify for free travel and, if they are living with the person they are caring for, the household benefits package.</p>
            <p eId="para_6"> In addition, the respite care grant is an annual non-means-tested payment made to carers by the Department. Full-time carers who are not in receipt of a carer's payment from the Department are also entitled to the grant. In fact, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the annual payment of the respite care grant commenced last Thursday to more than 70,000 carers at an estimated cost of €122 million for the full year in 2014. Carers can use the grant in whatever way they wish.</p>
            <p eId="para_7"> The Government is committed to ensuring that, in addition to the necessary income supports, carers receive a comprehensive range of services to assist in the caring role. The responsibility for providing respite care services and supports rests with the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_3">
            <from>Deputy Willie O'Dea<recordedTime time="2014-06-10T14:05:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_8">The question was to ask the Minister for Social Protection the plans she has to improve services for those who depend on the respite care grant in view of the fact that that grant was cut last year. The Minister has spent several minutes answering a question that could be answered in four words: We have no plans.</p>
            <p eId="para_9"> The Minister mentioned that the expenditure on carers in the current year is at €806 million. She will be aware that for every euro the State spends on carers it gets back about €5. The value of the total caring done in this country is estimated to be between €4.5 billion and €5 billion. The Minister will also be aware of the survey published yesterday by the Neurological Alliance of Ireland. It is among a number of surveys which point out that this particular cutback, among other cutbacks, has had a significant impact on carers of people with neurological conditions.</p>

            <p eId="para_11">At the time of the Social Welfare Bill and the controversy that arose regarding the cut in the respite care grant, various members of the Minister's party said that this was not the be all and end all because, as she said, the respite care grant did not have to be paid at the time of the budget. However, various suggestions were put forward in a Seanad debate, largely by members of the Labour Party, outlining clever ways in which the effect of this cut could be alleviated. The Minister is aware of that debate; she participated in it. Has she considered those suggestions and does she have any plans to implement any of them?</p>

            <p eId="para_39">Excuse me. I am asking the Minister about her role in government. The Labour Party came into government based on votes from people to whom they promised they would not cut core social welfare rates. The Minister is well aware that everybody who is in receipt of a carer's allowance is automatically entitled to the respite care grant. Thus, when the respite care grant is cut, that represents a cut in the core rate of social welfare. Regardless of how the Minister juggles it up, that is the reality.</p>
            <p eId="para_40"> At the time the former chairperson of the Labour Party, Deputy Keaveney, voted against the cut in the respite care grant, other members of the Labour Party who were also wrestling with their consciences publicly thought they would be able to persuade the Minister to take on board their suggestions to alleviate the effects of that cut. There was a Seanad debate on the issue, at which various suggestions were put forward. I know the Minister is aware of those suggestions. Is it her intention to turn them all down? Is it her intention to set her face against those suggestions, which were by implication promised to members of the Labour Party in return for their support in getting the Social Welfare Bill through?</p>

            <p eId="para_62">When the youth guarantee was conceived at EU level, the idea was to guarantee all young people a meaningful education, training or a job opportunity.

            <p eId="para_63">The Government recognises the importance of increasing participation in employment for people with disabilities, including young people. I am committed to removing any barriers that remain preventing people with disabilities from participating in activation programmes and employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_64">In terms of mainstream provision, young people with a disability can access all activation programmes, for example, SOLAS training courses, community employment schemes and JobBridge. Those previously receiving a social welfare payment will either retain that payment or move to a training allowance or temporary employment payment, depending on their individual circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_65"> In addition to facilitating access to its mainstream provision, SOLAS funds customised training for people with disabilities provided by a range of specialist training providers. The Department of Social Protection also provides a wide range of income and work-related supports specifically for people with disabilities. These include the EmployAbility service, formerly the supported employment programme. This facilitates the integration of people with disabilities into paid employment in the open labour market. Also included are a number of other supports specifically for employers, including the wage subsidy scheme, which pays an employer a subsidy for employing a person with a disability, the work equipment adaptation grant, the employee retention grant and the disability awareness scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_66"> In addition, the Department launched the disability activation project, DACT, at the end of 2012. This is based in the Border, midland and western region and covers four specific strands associated with the employment of people with disabilities, including progression programmes for young people with a disability. DACT will provide invaluable guidance as to how best to develop further effective activation measures generally for people with disabilities into the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_67"> My Department funds the Willing Able Mentoring, WAM, programme, which helps to bring graduates and employers together to promote access to the labour market for graduates with disabilities. As we roll out the youth guarantee, I very much hope that those with disabilities, particularly the young, will be involved.</p>

            <p eId="para_68">Everybody would hope for that but the problem is that young people with disabilities are specifically excluded from the youth guarantee. The Minister has an opportunity to correct that before the youth guarantee is developed any further. My question seeks to have disabled youth specifically included and to have a specific amount of funding set aside just for them. Most of the allowances and measures the Minister mentioned are not specific to young people.</p>
            <p eId="para_69"> My question was on the youth guarantee. Does the Minister intend at this stage to amend the youth guarantee and its documentation rather than wait for a promised review to ensure there will be no discrimination against young people with a disability? Will she try to assure organisations such as WALK, which made a presentation to the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection last month and which was concerned, that there will be no discrimination and that measures will be implemented to enhance, rather than take away from, the opportunities, small as they are, for young people who are disabled?</p>

            <p eId="para_70">From visiting and meeting many of the groups and organisations that work with young people with a disability, sometimes intellectual and sometimes physical, I realise there is significant pent-up demand to allow young people with a disability to participate in the labour force as well as in all the educational opportunities that the State has to offer. I am sure the Deputy supports this objective. As the Deputy knows, I, as Minister, have opened up areas of opportunity in social protection that were not focused on previously, including in respect of young or older people with a disability.</p>
            <p eId="para_71"> With regard to the youth guarantee and its initial layout in terms of how Europe has indicated it wants to proceed, the relevant authorities have been speaking about young people who are unemployed. Obviously, somebody in receipt of an allowance in regard to a disability is not technically on the live register but may very well wish to participate properly in work and educational opportunities. I would encourage him or her to do so as much as possible-----</p>

I want, if at all possible, for her to list the new measures under the youth guarantee, rather than existing measures, and what portion of additional youth guarantee funding, not existing funding, will go to ensure there is work available for young people with disabilities. As I said, the EU has provided the money and it has requested that it be told only when matters have progressed to the point of spending it. However, it did not put limits as to whether somebody has a disability or not. It would be wrong if Ireland was one of the states that limits access to the opportunities the youth guarantee will hopefully present to young people into the future. That would be a bad day for Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_77">The issue is that we get the fullest use of the existing schemes. I want to say to employers who may be listening or reading this, if it is reported in the media, that we offer, through the Department of Social Protection, very significant wage subsidy schemes for employers who take on people with a disability of any age although, of course, this includes young people. Many people in organisations dealing with young people with a disability are very keen to see that scheme expanded, as I am. Measures include the wage subsidy, the adaptations scheme which, for example, provides for small-level grants for physical adaptation of premises, if necessary, and the mentoring scheme provided both to the employer and to the young person.</p>

We are trying to manage a situation where people are coming in to us, saying their rents have been increased and they cannot get anywhere else because landlords are not accepting rent allowance, and have now gone so far as to put "No rent allowance" or "Work reference only allowed" on e-mails when looking to accept tenants. I want to know what procedure the Department has in place to deal with those issues.</p>

            <from>Deputy Joan Burton<recordedTime time="2014-06-10T14:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_86">I propose to take Questions Nos. 83 and 84 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_87"> The Government has provided over €344 million for the rent supplement scheme in 2014, the purpose of which is to provide short-term income support to assist with reasonable accommodation costs of eligible people living in private rented accommodation who are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their own resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_88">There are approximately 76,000 rent supplement recipients, of whom over 50,000 have been in receipt of a payment for more than 18 months. Maximum rent limits are generally reviewed every 18 months. The most recent review was completed in June 2013, with revised rent limits introduced on 17 June 2013. Despite pressures on the social protection budget, the last review saw rent limits increase in line with market rents in some areas, including Dublin and Galway. with Dublin limits increasing by a weighted average of 9%.</p>
            <p eId="para_89"> A new rent limit review has commenced within the Department and will feed into the budgetary process. This review will involve a comprehensive analysis of information from a range of sources, including rental tenancies registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board, the Central Statistics Office rental indices and websites advertising rental properties. In this regard, the current difficulties in the rental market and with rent supplement relate to a shortage of supply of suitable properties. I am concerned that raising rent limits as such is not the solution to the problem. It is likely to add to further rental inflation and impact not only on rent supplement recipients but also on many lower income workers and students who are paying their rents out of their private resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_90"> The Government has recently launched its construction strategy with the aim of increasing supply generally. In addition, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, has set out a very clear objective for local authorities to release vacant local authority housing and NAMA units are also coming on stream. I am fully aware that in some areas, particularly urban areas, prospective tenants, including those seeking access to rent supplement, are finding it increasingly difficult to secure accommodation owing to reduced availability. We have made arrangements to allow customers of the scheme who are facing difficulties to bring their situation to the attention of staff in the Department's community welfare service, CWS, who have considerable experience in dealing with customers and will continue to make every effort to ensure their accommodation needs are met. Staff have discretionary powers to award a supplement for rental purposes in exceptional cases where it appears the circumstances of the case merit it.</p>
            <p eId="para_91"> The CWS, including through its work in the homeless persons unit and the asylum seekers and new communities unit, works closely with local authorities and other stakeholders to facilitate homeless persons in accessing private rented accommodation. Where possible, this ensures people are diverted away from homeless services and towards community-based supports. In addition and in view of the current supply difficulties, the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, in conjunction with the Dublin local authorities and voluntary organisations, has agreed a protocol with the Department in order that families at risk of losing existing private rented accommodation can have more timely and appropriate interventions made on their behalf. These operational arrangements are being put in place and it is expected that the initiative will be launched towards the middle of this month.</p>
            <p eId="para_92">
              <i> Additional information not given on the floor of the House. </i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_93"> The Department's strategic policy direction is to transfer responsibility for recipients of rent supplement with a long-term housing need to local authorities under the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme. Officials are working closely with those in the lead Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in piloting the HAP scheme in Limerick with further roll-out to selected local authorities during the year.</p>

            <p eId="para_94">I put it to the Minister that it is not a question of supply but of landlords increasing rents to a level that people receiving rent allowance cannot pay. It is also due to many landlords specifying "no rent allowance" or "work references only". That is a form of apartheid towards unemployed people who need rent allowance to secure private rented accommodation. I am glad to hear the Minister defining clearly the intervention of community welfare officers because I have found the approach to be <i>ad hoc</i> in terms of who to approach to deal with the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_95">For example, the bank has taken over the house of a girl from Tallaght who contacted me. She has five children and the local authority cannot provide her with housing. She has been told to move out of the house by 28 July, but she has nowhere to go. She is trying everywhere for accommodation. If the Minister could e-mail the information she provided for the House earlier to every Deputy and community welfare officers, it would help.</p>

            <p eId="para_96">If the Deputy makes the details of the case to which she referred in Tallaght available to me, I will pass them to the community welfare service in Tallaght with the permission of the family she is dealing with because the objective has to be to keep families in homes. The practice of landlords of indicating through websites that rent allowance is not acceptable is not helpful. On the other hand, when one website took down the statement, a number of agencies dealing with people in accessing rented accommodation did not believe it was helpful. There is, therefore, a slight difference of opinion. I do not like to see such a blanket exclusion, but agencies want to know if a landlord is interested in somebody who may be in receipt of rent supplement.</p>

            <p eId="para_97">The Minister has established a protocol with community welfare officers in the Dublin region. While I fully appreciate this, I remind the House that there is a country outside Dublin and that we have similar problems in Limerick and every other urban area. Will the Minister give us a commitment that she will consider establishing a similar protocol in other areas such as Limerick where there are pressing problems? Perhaps she is correct that the solution is not simply to increase the flow of State money to landlords. The figures I have suggest the top 20 earning landlords last year received €5 million from the State in sums ranging from €180,000 to €578,000 to an individual at the top of the scale. That is one side of the story, but, on the other hand, the difficulty is that 76,000 people are in receipt of rent allowance and that 90,000 are waiting for social housing. My experience in Limerick of rent supplement is that the caps are no longer realistic relative to the rents being charged. Up to now, there was a nod and a wink scenario whereby a tenant would pay the landlord under the counter, but even that arrangement which is illegal can no longer apply because rent supplement recipients cannot afford the increased rents. The Minister has said she has no evidence of this practice, but I have plenty of it. We are facing an imminent problem. I am dealing with people who will become homeless in the next few weeks. What can they do?</p>

            <p eId="para_98">With regard to the position in Dublin, the community welfare service, the homeless persons unit, the HSE's asylum seekers and new communities unit, Departments and agencies dealing with housing, the local authorities and other stakeholders are coming together to facilitate homeless people in accessing private rented accommodation. The community welfare service in Limerick provided a fantastic service during the recent flooding in the city for people who had, unfortunately, been flooded by setting up special clinics, including on the estates particularly affected by flooding.</p>
            <p eId="para_99">If the Deputy has an interest in seeing a similar extension of services in Limerick, I will refer back to him with a specific response on the situation in Limerick.</p>

            <p eId="para_100">That service should be set up where it is needed throughout the country. Even if it is not necessary now, it will be needed very soon. This is not just a phenomenon in Dublin; it has happened in Cork and other urban areas. The Minister should immediately instruct community welfare officers and inform local representatives and the local authorities that if a problem arises where somebody could find himself or herself homeless within a period of time, they should step in. We are advising people who approach us to hold on to the houses they are in because if they have nowhere else to go, they must stay there until they receive some assistance or find somewhere else to live. If we do not build social houses, this will be a tsunami, as Fr. Peter McVerry said. If there was a tsunami tomorrow, we would be building houses immediately to try to replace the ones lost. These are people who are losing the roof over their heads; therefore, there must be a more urgent response throughout the country.</p>

            <p eId="para_101">Community welfare officers in Limerick did a tremendous job during the flooding. I would appreciate it if the Minister referred back to me as quickly as possible as I have an interest in this issue. The difficulty is that I do not know what advice to give. I will take a leaf from Deputy Joan Collins's book and advise them to simply stay in the house, even if they cannot afford to pay the increased rent. We are facing imminent problems of homelessness.</p>
            <p eId="para_102"> I have a question about the move to the housing assistance payment, HAP. The Government has been promising this move for some time, whereby responsibility will be transferred from the Department of Social Protection to the local authorities. The scheme is part of the programme for Government and was supposed to be piloted in Limerick. I checked with the local authority in Limerick yesterday. The Minister has said there are 76,000 people in receipt of rent allowance. Limerick is the only place in which the HAP scheme has been initiated and only 40 of the 76,000 have transferred to it. That is approximately one half of 1% and we are 75% into the lifetime of the Government. When will the HAP scheme take off in a realistic way? Forty people out of 76,000 at this stage is pathetic.</p>

            <p eId="para_103">The Deputy has extensive experience of membership of the Government and during the long period in which Fianna Fáil was in government there was much talk but never any action on this important issue. If people are renting and likely to be renting in the long term, our aim and objective are to ensure a family has secure long-term accommodation. That is the best and most stable solution for them. It has taken a significant amount of work and I am very grateful to the local authorities in Limerick which have undertaken pioneering work in this regard, as they have in respect of Gateway, to install systems which are new to local authorities. To refer back to the comments made by Deputy Joan Collins, local authorities have housing departments and specific expertise in assessing the suitability of accommodation and so forth. The Department of Social Protection which is more of a payments agency would not have the level of resources or skills local authorities have related to housing.</p>
            <p eId="para_104"> Staff in the community welfare service have discretionary powers to award a supplement for rental purposes in exceptional cases where it appears that the circumstances of the case so warrant it. These discretionary powers are available when dealing with, for example, people who are homeless or at risk of losing their home.</p>
            <p eId="para_105">That is what is happening in terms of what has been established in Dublin, where there is co-ordination among officials in different agencies dealing with those who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. In Limerick, those officials have the same discretionary powers. However, I will speak to the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, about co-operation with Limerick City and County Council and whether arrangements there could mirror those in Dublin.</p>

Not only does each JobBridge position cost the Exchequer a weekly social welfare payment plus €50, it also incurs a cost to the Exchequer in terms of taxes and PRSI foregone because of displacement where jobs are not advertised and filled as they ought to be.

            <p eId="para_108">The Department will spend close to €1.1 billion this year in a range of employment, education and internship schemes. The major scheme is the community employment scheme, with expenditure of close to €358 million. The back to work allowance accounts for close to €113 million, while JobBridge spending stands at €82 million. All modern economies invest in education, training and work experience with a view to developing people's careers over their working lifetimes. In addition, various European studies have shown that young people who are not in employment, education or training are seriously at risk of becoming long-term unemployed, with associated poor life outcomes.</p>
            <p eId="para_109"> JobBridge internships are designed to break the vicious circle whereby unemployed job seekers need experience to secure job offers but cannot gain such experience without a job. In the past, one of the barriers faced by job seekers in building up that experience was that they lost their social welfare payments if they took up work experience opportunities, as they were deemed to be unavailable for work. This problem was compounded by additional costs incurred, such as travelling to and from the location of their work experience. As Minister, I introduced JobBridge to remove these barriers and open up a new pathway to employment via internships.</p>
            <p eId="para_110"> I am pleased to say that since its launch in 2011, JobBridge has provided a valuable work experience and development opportunity to just under 30,000 unemployed job seekers, of whom approximately 23,000 have completed the programme. There are just under 7,000 persons currently engaged on internships. More importantly, independent research indicates that the rate of progression to employment via JobBridge is higher than under any other domestic scheme and significantly higher than comparable schemes elsewhere in Europe. The research found that 61% of interns entered paid employment within five months of completing their internships.</p>

            <p eId="para_112"> The research, published in April last year, also examined the displacement and deadweight impacts of JobBridge to estimate the value for money to the Exchequer of the scheme. In summary, the data indicated a displacement impact of just over 6%. The research indicated that JobBridge, based on 2011 and 2012 performance, and contrary to the suggestion in the question that it would give rise to opportunity costs, generated positive value to the Exchequer of approximately €15 million over a full year.</p>

            <p eId="para_113">The Minister is probably aware of the economist and researcher Michael Taft. He has outlined an example of a large company taking on 14 young JobBridge interns for six months instead of recruiting at the minimum wage, which the company should be encouraged to do. It might even be encouraged to take on staff under a JobsPlus mechanism. In the example, the loss to the Exchequer over the six months includes the €144 per week social welfare payment plus the €50 top-up and lost employer PRSI of €765, which is not included in the Minister's figure of €82 million. There is also the fact that the income tax that would have been paid had someone been employed directly is lost. In this example of 14 young interns, JobBridge costs the Exchequer €81,000 while the company receives the equivalent of a subsidy worth €136,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_114">Can the Minister confirm the full cost of the displacement in the workplace in terms of pay and conditions is included in the €82 million she mentioned rather than just the subsidy paid on top of the social welfare payment?</p>

            <p eId="para_115">Economists like the one mentioned talk about displacement effects and the people who would have got work anyway. Based on research from 2011 and 2012, contrary to the suggestion of Deputy Ó Snodaigh about opportunity cost, JobBridge generated positive value to the Exchequer of €15 million over a full year. Perhaps what the Deputy's economist is failing to take into account is where people get a start and work experience. As a society, we put great emphasis on education but people come out of education at various levels having done the leaving certificate, a degree, a masters and, in the case of some people I have come across, a doctorate, but they have no work experience. In a labour market where it is difficult to get a job, not having that magic thing of some work experience means good people cannot be seriously considered by employers for vacancies. If they get a start with JobBridge, they get the experience. The research shows that, subsequently, over 60% of them go on to be in paid employment five months later. We must look at the totality of the return to the individual, to the company and to the organisations that use their services. This includes community organisations that go out of their way to give interns high quality work experience. Then, people get a start in the labour market.</p>

            <p eId="para_116">Michael Taft is not my economist and hopefully he is nobody's economist. I think he is an independent economist and was probably closer to the Minister's party in the past than mine. The Minister mentioned independent research but she has never quoted the following fact from her Indecon report. One of the questions to the employers was whether they would employ someone if JobBridge was not available, which is the displacement level. The level is 29%, as 29% of host companies said that, in the absence of JobBridge, they would have offered paid employment to the interns. Some 29% were willing to admit publicly that they were glad they could scam the Government, get the subsidy and gain a competitive advantage over companies close by. The question is what the full cost to the Exchequer is and, as pointed out in the Indecon report that the Minister is forever quoting at me when I raise JobBridge, some 30% of the companies would have employed someone. That would have led to more money for the Exchequer and more money in the pockets of at least 30% of people. JobBridge is now being made compulsory, forcing people into the scam. It should be changed.</p>

The average number of weeks to decide on a new carer's allowance application has decreased from approximately 26 weeks at that time to a current average of 12 weeks. I compliment the staff in the Department of Social Protection who have worked with all their might and main to overhaul the system I found in place when I became Minister and to produce these improvements. On the question of whether there is room for more improvement, we are working on that constantly.</p>
            <p eId="para_151"> There are currently approximately 3,500 carer's allowance applications awaiting decision. The equivalent number in 2012 was 11,600.

            <p eId="para_152">The Minister may be satisfied that she has cut the processing times down from what they were two years ago, but there are still people coming to my office who have been waiting longer than that. This happens in particular when the Department comes back to the person seeking another letter from the doctor or more medical evidence in regard to the claim and application. Recently, we found we had to ring from the Oireachtas line in regard to a case from November 2013, but the office was unable to tell us when that claim would be processed.</p>
            <p eId="para_153">Several things would facilitate a quicker turnaround of claims, one of which would be simpler application forms. Another would be if someone were to sit down with people and tell them exactly what was required from their doctor in terms of medical evidence. When a doctor writes to the panel and verifies that a person is disabled, very ill and that his or her condition will not improve, the panel should accept this, rather than refusing the application.</p>

            <p eId="para_154">If departmental staff were to do that, they would end up before the Committee of Public Accounts facing complaints. When people are given allowances, there are procedures which must be followed, otherwise the Deputy's colleagues on the Committee of Public Accounts would be complaining. There is a procedure in place, but one of the good things about the Irish system, unlike that in other countries, is that we allow people to constantly submit new information. If, when they apply initially, they do not submit all of the necessary information or if their doctor writes a less than clear letter, we allow them to provide further evidence or an explanation.</p>
            <p eId="para_155"> On the issue of the design of the forms used, I must agree with the Deputy. In fact, when it came to the revision of the domiciliary care allowance forms, we brought in the National Adult Literacy Agency, NALA, to help us to redesign them, taking into account the fact that some people might not be as strong in reading forms as others. We are in the process of redesigning the forms, but if the Deputy has specific suggestions to make, I would be delighted to hear them because I am anxious to facilitate people in obtaining their entitlements. That is what the schemes are for.</p>

            <p eId="para_156">I acknowledge that the changes made in recent years have been beneficial, in the main, in that people are not waiting as long as in the past. However, it is still very frustrating for those who make an application for carer's allowance or another allowance and who, on inquiring about their application, are told that processing has not even begun and or that it will take a number of months. Flowing from this, one of the problems identified last year was that wrong decisions were being made and many applications ended up in the social welfare appeals office. Following the changes in the assessment of applications, has the accuracy of decisions improved? In the past, up to 50% of the original decisions by social welfare deciding officers were overturned on appeal.</p>

            <p eId="para_157">The area of disability payments, for example, is still undergoing reform. At the end of April 2013 over 4,000 people were awaiting a decision, whereas in April 2014, the number was down to 2,750. The average processing time of disability allowance applications going through the social welfare appeals system has dropped from 10.2 weeks in 2013 to 9.6. Departmental delays have been reduced considerably, too. I can supply tables to the Deputy outlining the progress made.</p>
            <p eId="para_158"> Deputies Aengus Ó Snodaigh and Joan Collins have a particular insight into this area and it is critically important that they share with us their ideas on how the schemes could be improved. It is important to provide income support for those who are entitled to it. That means, among other things, that medical advisers have to be very clear. The quality of information provided by them can vary wildly from case to case, but we will continue to work to improve processing times. In that context, I compliment the staff involved. Sometimes people can be very critical of public servants, but staff in my Department are working very hard to improve the system and have done so.</p>

            <p eId="para_160">In April 2012 the pensions policy officer of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, met representatives of the Department of Social Protection and was informed that it accepted congress's assertion that those with an average number of 29 annual contributions stood to lose €1,500 a year for life from next September. This is a grossly inequitable cut which targets a section of the workforce and will adversely affect vulnerable workers, particularly women. We believe that when these workers realise what has been done, they will simply not accept the cut.</p>

          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_106" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">

            <p eId="para_161">Some 33%, or €6.5 billion, of all expenditure incurred by the Department relates to pensions. The number on pensions is increasing by approximately 17,000 annually. In other words and as a result of demographic changes in society, an additional 17,000 individuals seek payment of retirement pensions each year. In 2013, for example, the Department was obliged to make provision for an additional €190 million as a result of the increase to which I refer.</p>
            <p eId="para_162"> In the context of women and social insurance payments, it is worth noting that the actuarial review of the Social Insurance Fund carried out in 2012 confirmed that the fund - owing to its distributive nature - provided better value for female rather than male contributors. The review also examined the changes to the contribution rules and the associated rates of payment which were to be introduced in September 2012. It found that those with lower earnings and shorter contribution histories would still continue to obtain the best value from their contributions.</p>
            <p eId="para_163"> The contributory State pension is a very valuable benefit. Therefore, it is important to ensure those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund during their working lives. The reform measures introduced to date are consistent with this goal. The contributory State pension is based on contributions paid and credited during the course of the pensioner's working life and, accordingly, those who had less attachment to the workforce qualify for lower pensions under the scheme. As the Deputy noted, new rate bands were introduced from September 2012. These additional payment rate bands more accurately reflect the social insurance history of a person and ensure those who contribute more during a working life benefit more from the scheme in retirement than those with fewer contributions. The social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners who have been less attached to the workforce.</p>

            <p eId="para_164">In April I tabled a question in which I asked the Minister to provide a rate band analysis of all State pension contributory awards since 1 September 2012, broken down by number of awards, gender and percentage of overall awards. Her reply contained a tabular statement which was detailed and showed that 27% of those in the 20-29 rate band were female and that 8% were male and that 9% of those in the 15-19 rate band were female, while 3% were male. I forwarded this information to ICTU and received a reply which thanked me for my interest in revealing it. ICTU pointed out at the time that these changes would impact unfairly and disproportionately on women, particularly low-paid female workers. It also protested, in the strongest terms, at the grossly unfair way the rise in pension and age entitlement had been handled. Congress intends to continue to fight on these issues. Those who represent workers are of the view that the Minister has, in terms of the change in the pension rate banding, discriminated against women, particularly those in receipt of low pay. She is going to be challenged on this matter in the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_165">It is important to reiterate that €6.5 billion of all social welfare payments made by Department relates to pensions. The cost in this regard is increasing by €190 million each year as a result of the 17,000 additional people who claim pensions each year. As the Deputy is aware, the social protection system provides alternative methods in supporting pensioners who have been less attached to the workforce. These include the homemaker scheme, increases for qualified adults, widow's, widower's and surviving civil partner’s pensions which can be based on the PRSI record of the worker or the spouse and the means-tested non-contributory State pension.</p>
            <p eId="para_166">The supports provided for pensioners have resulted in similar outcomes for male and female pensioners in Ireland, with poverty rates for women over 65 years being statistically the same or slightly lower than those for men.</p>
            <p eId="para_167"> My priority has been to fully maintain the maximum weekly rates of payments for pensioners. We have successfully done this in all the budgets I have been involved in, despite the fact that each year we have had to spend, happily, an extra €190 to €200 million on the significant numbers who arrived at retirement age in that year.</p>

            <p eId="para_169">I am saying to Deputy Collins that the independent actuarial review shows comprehensively that women actually benefit significantly from the social welfare system - in fact, more than men do. We do not have the time now to go into a detailed discussion of why this is so. I refer Deputy Collins to the actuarial review, which is on the Department's website. I am pleased to say that, as a society, we prioritise pensioners and payments to our pensioners. I have been able to sustain these despite the economic crash that the country has unfortunately experienced, and I will continue to do so.</p>

            <p eId="para_180">The Government will give detailed consideration to how the target will be reached over the coming months. The Exchequer returns to the end of May were published last week. They showed that taxes were €446 million or 2.9% ahead of profile while overall net voted expenditure was €156 million or 0.9% below profile. The Department of Social Protection returns showed that net voted expenditure was €138 million or 2.7% below profile, as Deputy Ó Snodaigh noted. This includes the impact of higher PRSI receipts of €108 million in the year to date, due obviously to the additional number of people who are at work, paying PRSI and, as we have seen from the tax returns, paying income tax as well. Overall expenditure on all schemes, services and administration in the Department is under profile by €27 million, or 0.3%.</p>
            <p eId="para_181">The better than expected performance of PRSI income mirrors that of taxes and is evidence of a slowly emerging recovery in the economy that everyone hopes will continue. In particular, the reduction of nearly 33,000 in the number on the live register year on year to the end of May is encouraging. The Department and I are committed to an unrelenting focus on job creation. This is the best way of reducing welfare expenditure, while freeing resources to assist the vulnerable and deal with the demographic pressures of an ageing population.</p>
            <p eId="para_182"> The budget for next year will not be announced until October. As the Deputy rightly stated, I will not discuss its details, nor will I speculate on the overall adjustment to be made. However, it is important that we continue to push the development and roll-out of Intreo in order that people can be brought into employment and avail of education, training and work experience. This year the Department will spend approximately €1.1 million on schemes ranging from the community employment scheme to Tús and the back to education scheme. This is an important investment in the country's future. Obviously, we will watch the data closely between now and October.</p>
            <p eId="para_183"> I regularly meet organisations that have an interest in social protection matters. I will meet 39 community and voluntary organisations on 4 July. I will listen carefully, as I do every year, to their opinions on the priorities for 2015. I will ensure the issues they will raise at the meeting are brought to the attention of the Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_184">I was not expecting a discussion on budget 2015 which we will have in October, but many changes can be made by ministerial order. Some of what we are discussing is Voted expenditure, but in many instances savings have been made, for example, through increases in employment or because so many unemployed persons have emigrated. I asked the Minister a question when we discussed the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill last week. Given the many pronouncements made by her and her Labour Party colleagues concerning a change in attitude, perhaps she might consider prior to the announcement of the budget using some of these savings to reverse a number of ministerial orders instead of sending the money back into the black hole of the Exchequer. She mentioned the respite care grant. Although it was granted last Thursday to many people, it has been €325 short for the past two years. We are facing into another winter, yet the Government cut six weeks from the fuel allowance period for 60,000 or more recipients. Perhaps these cuts might be reversed by using the saving of €24 million, although it would not meet the entire figure of €136 million or €138 million.</p>

            <p eId="para_185">I notice that Sinn Féin's proposals to generate extra income are to increase taxes significantly, particularly for those in work or who have family homes. It has also promised on the doorsteps to abolish water charges, the property tax and the universal social charge, USC. It is important that the stabilisation and growth in the economy, particularly in employment, that we have achieved, as a result of which we are able to borrow internationally at cheap rates compared to Germany, should continue. The more people who leave the social welfare system, return to work and pay initially a small amount of PRSI before paying more in taxation, the more there will be an easing in the social welfare budget. I hope this would allow us to invest more in returning people to work through education, training and work experience. This will enable us to secure and improve the position for those who are in receipt of social welfare payments. Importantly, we have been able to maintain core social welfare payments at a difficult time historically. We are moving away from that period, but we still do not know for certain what the economic outlook will be by October. The trends so far have been positive.</p>

          <p eId="para_188">I welcome the statement by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Charles Flanagan, that the Government will establish a statutory commission of inquiry into the operation of mother and baby homes. Such an inquiry will have to deal clearly with how women were treated and mistreated in such homes, the high infant mortality rates in such homes, the burial practices, the carrying out of vaccine trials, all of the circumstances surrounding adoption practices, for example, illegal and forced adoptions, and much more. Above all, I suggest such an inquiry will have to deal with the societal backdrop and society's attitude at the time to women who became pregnant outside marriage. Shame, guilt, stigmatisation, hardship and a culture of concealment were all part of society's response to such women. They endured all of this because they were deemed to have broken society's rules. Much of this is incomprehensible to present day generations, but it was nonetheless the reality. Children born in such homes were treated as lesser beings with fewer rights. Many were barbarically taken from their mothers without real respect for their mothers or their own inalienable rights as children. The importance of this issue for present day society and future generations concerns the need to learn lessons and, I hope, influence society for the better in how it deals with the many social issues that come its way.</p>

          <p eId="para_191">Will the Government agree or has it agreed to establish a dedicated counselling service for all those who have been affected by experiences in mother and baby homes? A dedicated counselling service should be established. It would take time to do this, but such a service should be established to be of assistance. A confidential telephone line should be established by the Government immediately, manned by appropriate personnel to deal with the queries that will undoubtedly arise from the highlighting of the issue in recent times.</p>

          <p eId="para_192">I thank the Deputy for his constructive comments. Everybody is aware that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has today announced that the Government will set up a commission of inquiry into mother and baby homes as run in Ireland in the past decades. We do so with a sense of sadness but, equally, with a sense of duty and resolve. The interdepartmental group has commenced its work which it will continue on all of the issues being mentioned to be reported on to the Government shortly. This is about examining a period in which women, particularly young women, were silent and silenced. It was an extraordinary time when the women of Ireland, mna na hÉireann, poor women especially, were callously held to account. It is not an exaggeration to say that in many cases their treatment and that of their babies was an abomination. In that regard, the inquiry will consider a time when there was a disturbing symbiosis between the Church and the State when a sin became, if not a civil wrong, certainly a societal offence. These were not the good old days about which we were told. They were not times of happiness or comfort for a great number of people. The walls of respectability that surrounded many God-fearing sectors of society have now been dismantled and the consequent freedom and shame are ours to act on and we will do so. </p>
          <p eId="para_193"> I thank the Deputy for his comments which were made in a constructive fashion. The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is open to full consultations with members of the Opposition. This is an issue for Ireland because if it is not handled properly, in many ways, Ireland's soul will lie, like the babies of so many mothers, in an unmarked grave. It is important that we try to get this right. </p>
          <p eId="para_194"> I take the Deputy's points on counselling and the structure, scale and scope of the inquiry. These are matters the Minister will certainly take into account. It is for the mothers involved and their babies and the sake of the lost and stolen generations within families that we deal with the issue. I hope we will hold the inquiry in as compassionate, humane and understanding a way as possible. The Minister will see to it that Opposition parties and Independent Members are consulted fully in terms of discussions on the structure of the inquiry, the terms of reference and how the issue should be handled. </p>
          <p eId="para_195"> This issue has affected the lives of so many in the country and abroad as a consequence of what happened. While in some cases we seem to consider that this just happened in the past few years, it is a reflection of a period since the foundation of the State in terms of what happened to women and mothers in Irish society. Where they were poor and uneducated, it made matters even worse. It is not about comely maidens dancing at the crossroads. This is an issue for the Ireland of today to deal with as another element of our not so glorious past.</p>

          <p eId="para_196">I welcome the Taoiseach's comments on engaging with the Opposition, but I ask that the various representative groups and parties involved be consulted also. I presume the Minister will do this on both the structure of such an inquiry and also its terms of reference.</p>
          <p eId="para_197"> With regard to a dedicated counselling service, by way of information, when we established the commission of inquiry into the abuse which had taken place in institutions, it took two years to establish a dedicated counselling service with properly qualified personnel who were particularly adept and expert in that area. I suspect something similar will occur in this instance. I appeal to the Taoiseach to do everything he can to set up a dedicated counselling service as speedily as possible because many people may have buried much of what happened or may not have been dealing with it until recently because of the debate. Undoubtedly, it will create issues for people and families and as the inquiry begins, there will be a need for an ongoing and specific counselling service to be established. What is required is something that will be separate from normal counselling services that may be available to people on an ongoing basis in the realm of adoption. A separate and specific service needs to be established for those who have experience of these homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_198"> I also believe we owe a great debt to social historians and, more recently, Catherine Corless who made the discovery in Tuam but who did so in a measured and balanced way, as we can gather from reading some of the material that was carried in the media over the weekend. She came up with information on 800 babies who had died in the home in Tuam alone and had been buried there between 1925 and 1961. We are looking at a period that dates back to the early part of the last century, up to the late 1970s, if not later, an enormous expanse of time. The inquiry will have to have a number of strands to it. Will the Taoiseach give a commitment to establish a counselling service and a confidential telephone helpline which should be established without undue delay?</p>

          <p eId="para_199">The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs will take note of all the comments and suggestions coming to him, including from the Deputy in respect of counselling services and a confidential telephone line. Obviously, the terms of reference for the investigation will need to be considered very carefully. I understand most of the information is available, but it needs to be collated and gone through. I honestly believe this is a much broader question about the kind of society in which our people lived from the foundation of the State until the early 1960s. I know from the part of the country I come from that there are implications in terms of what happened to children who were fostered, the vaccination issue, those who were forcibly signed into mental institutions by families, the banishing of young women from various locations around the country to have their babies in Liverpool or wherever else, if not in mother and baby homes, the mortality rates which were so high and the old buildings, the walls of which were infested with TB and whatever else. These are all issues that need to be considered in the context of the kind of society we had at the time. Essentially, this is about the kind of country Ireland was in which women, in particular, were the focus of shame and suppression. I think today of the late Nuala Fennell who served in this House and was the principal driver of the banishment of illegitimacy when babies born out of wedlock were deemed to be an inferior sub-species. That is one of the issues that will be dealt with. In so far as the Government and the House are concerned, this is about the country and its people. It is not about apportioning blame at any one location.</p>
          <p eId="para_200">We can apologise to everybody, but where does it end? This was Ireland of the 1920s to the 1960s, an Ireland that might have been portrayed as having a glorious and brilliant past but which within its shadows contained all of these cases, and in which people felt ashamed and different and were suppressed and dominated. Obviously, the question of their treatment in the mother and baby homes is a central part of that, as were the issues identified in the Ryan report with regard to mother and baby homes, the fostering out of babies by institutions, and so on. It is another issue that we must deal with in 2014 to the best of our ability. In an attempt to get this as right as possible we will, through the programme being put together by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, meet with everybody, including the historians and groups mentioned by Deputy Martin.</p>

          <p eId="para_202"> I, too, welcome that the Government is to establish a commission of inquiry into mother and baby homes across this State. In the past week or so there have been horrific revelations in this regard, including that up to 800 children may have been buried in an unmarked communal plot at the site of a former mother and baby home in Tuam. It is alleged that a regime of neglect and malnutrition caused the deaths of these most vulnerable of our citizens. As we know, this was not an isolated case. Dozens of these homes were operated across Ireland from the late 1800s up to partition and then in this State up until the 1970s. It is clear that the women and babies had no rights. It is also clear from the harrowing accounts of survivors who in recent days found the strength to speak out that their lives were destroyed. It is well past time that the institutions and agencies of this State faced up to this shameful period. I commend the survivors and other activists, particularly the historians, who have kept faith on this issue. </p>
          <p eId="para_203"> I would like, if I may, to tease out the terms of reference of the proposed inquiry. As stated by the Taoiseach, it must be comprehensive. There are a number of key issues on which it must focus, including that of the imprisonment of pregnant women in mother and baby homes, the taking of babies from their mothers against their will, the cause of the shocking infant mortality rates at mother and baby homes, the circumstances surrounding the burial of children and babies who died at these homes, the routine illegal adoption and trafficking to the USA of an unknown number of children, and the subjection of children, without the consent of their mothers, to medical trials. There are other institutions that need to be included in this inquiry, including the Westbank Home in Greystones, County Wicklow, and similar institutions. Can the Taoiseach confirm that all these issues will be covered by the Government's commission of inquiry and, also, whether the commission will have full powers of compellability in relation to those whom it wishes to interview and full access to all records and documents, whether held by public authorities or private institutions?</p>

          <p eId="para_204">Aontaím leis an Teachta Adams gurb é seo an rud is fearr le déanamh.</p>
          <p eId="para_205"> I welcome the Deputy's constructive suggestions. Many people come here from America to trace their roots, having been adopted by Americans. The vast majority of those adopted by people in the United States were perfectly healthy babies. What we need to know is what happened to those who were not so healthy and had problems, intellectual and physical, or other difficulties. The Church can play a role here in terms of identification of burial grounds, whether consecrated or to be consecrated, and the proper marking of same, and in relation to the privacy issues surrounding adopted children and so on. I understand that several thousand children were adopted by people in the United States. The commission will also examine the issue of imprisonment of women, as mentioned by Deputy Adams. On the question regarding the structure and nature of the investigation, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs will discuss that issue at 4 p.m. with members of the Opposition and Independent Deputies.</p>
          <p eId="para_206"> It is a case of trying to define a set of terms of reference that are based on the key facts that need to be determined. Everybody has his or her own view on how we deal with that. Information is now beginning to flood in from many quarters. Rather than have a rushed reaction in terms of the quick establishment of an inquiry that might not be as comprehensive, suitable or appropriate as needs be, it is important that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, on behalf of Government, takes a little time to get this right, although not too long, as this issue has drifted for many decades now. It is one that filters out into a wider societal background of the type referred to by Deputy Martin and also referred to by me. From that point of view, the Deputy can take it that the inquiry will be as comprehensive, thorough and appropriate as possible. </p>
          <p eId="para_207"> In my view, what we do not want is a litigious response that results in an expensive assessment of facts and files already available in the public domain. There is a whole series of issues involved that need to be dealt with. I would assume that the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, will engage constructively with everybody who wishes to contribute, including historians, local groups, members of the public and public representatives, and will try to ascertain the totality of the range of facts that need to be determined and on that basis define the structure and terms of reference for the commission. Members of the House will be directly involved in that.</p>

          <p eId="para_208">Go raibh maith agat. In trying to come to terms with this, one of the questions I asked of myself was how did this State allow the establishment of these institutions for women who had babies out of wedlock. In trying to tease through the sad history of all of this, the more profound question is what are we going to do about it. The Government, by announcing the establishment of a commission of inquiry, has made a good start. The Taoiseach's commitment to work with parties in Opposition and others is also to be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_209"> Sinn Féin has been consistently raising the issue of Bethany Home with the Government. The Government still has not fulfilled its responsibilities to the victims of the Bethany Home, which I have never understood, given the small number of people involved. What we now have on the back of that is greater revelations involving even more citizens. While I welcome the Taoiseach's commitment and that of the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, Sinn Féin's responsibility is to hold the Government to account in all of these matters. Counselling is crucial. In many cases, it is an add-on. It is crucial for all of the survivors and others traumatised by these revelations.</p>
          <p eId="para_210"> Why is An Garda Síochána not investigating this? That strikes me as a pertinent point.</p>

          <p eId="para_213"> Will the Government support Sinn Féin's Private Members' motion on this latest shameful episode of our history? I am pleased that our motion has been overtaken by the Government's announcement, but I would like the Government to make clear its position on the motion.</p>

          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2014-06-10T15:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_214">The Government wants to make it clear that it has decided to hold an inquiry by way of a commission of investigation into these matters. As I stated, the range of issues and facts that need to be determined is very extensive. Encompassed is a very broad range of societal issues. Therefore, it is only right and proper that we attempt to deal with this as thoroughly, fully and appropriately as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_215"> Deputy Adams has mentioned Bethany Home in the House on quite a number of occasions. Archbishop Jackson has written to me today about this matter. The question being examined was whether Bethany Home should be considered as part of the investigation and analysis of the Magdalen laundries. Bethany Home was clearly not a laundry. It is now one of a significant number of mother and baby homes that must be investigated.</p>
          <p eId="para_216"> I have heard varying estimates as to the number of graveyards and cemeteries around the country. In every county, there are unmarked graves where children were buried. Some were from the Famine times and some may include children who came from mother and baby homes. The analysis of the records, burial procedures and burial grounds, whether consecrated or not, must be focused on also. In my part of the country, up until just a few years ago, unconsecrated ground was where children born out of wedlock were buried. They were treated as a different species entirely. It was not until the 1980s that the concept of illegitimacy was abolished.</p>
          <p eId="para_217"> These are valuable contributions that Members make. The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs will lead on this matter on behalf of the Government and, as I stated, will consult broadly the public, all the relevant groups and, of course, elected Members in order to get this as right as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_218"> It is very hard to put a fix on the conclusion of the process. The big message is that the Government is obviously concerned with the implications and has decided to have a formal inquiry or commission of investigation. My hope is that Members of the House, the various parties and Independent groups can all work together to try to deal with this matter, which is another episode from our not-so-glorious past.</p>

        <speech by="#CatherineMurphy" eId="spk_134">
          <from>Deputy Catherine Murphy<recordedTime time="2014-06-10T15:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_219">I too welcome the announcement of a commission of inquiry. That inquiry will be far reaching. Fundamentally, it will go back to the origins of a state that was controlled by fear and where responsibility for services was often outsourced. This led to a real tragedy for those who lived in and, in some cases, died in mother and baby homes. I will obviously attend the briefing and comment on it later.</p>
          <p eId="para_220"> I wish to raise another issue, a contemporary example of the outsourcing of responsibility. Tomorrow we will pass the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. This is a seminal moment in that we will officially abandon people on housing waiting lists to the markets. In the absence of dealing with anything on the supply side, housing authorities will now become housing support agencies. This represents a fundamental shift in how we deal with housing. The private sector will now become the sole supplier, or almost the sole supplier, of social housing. It is a figleaf that attempts to cover up the emergency that is evident. Recent announcements by the Minister responsible for housing are intended to give the impression that many things are being done. Those announcements, however, are superficial and inadequate, given the scale of what is needed. Much of this is being brushed under the carpet.</p>
          <p eId="para_221"> In many cases, there are children involved. We are back talking about children. The children can be sheltered only for so long from the fear they will pick up from their parents. Uncertainty as to where they will go to school next week and the question of whether they will have a home in a month's time will inevitably have an impact on their lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_222"> There appears to be no standard response to the treatment of families facing homelessness; it very much depends on the location of the family. Some local authorities provide short-term temporary accommodation, and others send the individuals away. Some of those presenting are very vulnerable. How, for example, can a young woman who delivered twins ten weeks prematurely just three weeks ago go house-hunting when she is caring for those babies in intensive care? How can a deaf woman caring for a child with special needs convince a landlord to take less than the market rent? The entire process is very much a hands-off one. People are left to their own devices with unrealistic rent supplement limits. It is an impossible task.</p>
          <p eId="para_223"> Does the Taoiseach agree that housing authorities are being turned into housing support agencies? If not, what is the Government's plan to deal with the supply-side shortage in the short and medium terms? Will he acknowledge the role of rent supplement limits in the current crisis and take immediate steps to relax the rent caps to allow families to secure housing?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_135">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2014-06-10T15:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_224">I thank Deputy Catherine Murphy for her comments and I know she will contribute constructively to the hearings being held by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.</p>
          <p eId="para_225"> The Government considered this morning the latest report from the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, on the question of the provision of adequate social housing for people who need housing. Obviously, this is related to the general problems of homelessness and demand for houses. The report concluded that there is a requirement for a new funding model for the provision of social housing and that it will not be possible to continue funding through the model that applied before - direct provision through local authorities. A new funding model will have to be created to deal with the scale and cost of what is involved. The report from NESC is timely. It feeds into the strategy being followed now by the Minister of State responsible for housing, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, in the provision of direct housing, the provision of money strictly for homeless people and the allocation of moneys to have almost 2,000 units that have been boarded up for some time occupied by families so they can be taken out of hotels and bed and breakfasts and given proper, warm and appropriate accommodation. I refer also to the question of the delivery, through NAMA and other agencies, of both ground and the opportunity to provide adequate housing for people. The House will be aware that €50 million was provided through the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government towards the provision of homelessness services in 2013. A similar investment is expected again this year. In addition, the health service spends €30 million providing care and supports for the homeless. Obviously, having emerged from a very difficult recession, very many people now regard this as a real issue. The Government recognises this. A central feature of the Government's focus this year is dealing with the construction sector. There is, of course, the opportunity for the private construction sector to step up to the mark in a way it has not been able to do in recent years and provide affordable, high-quality houses for people who need them at appropriate locations around the country. This is to prevent a repeat of the granting of planning permission in areas where it might not have been appropriate in many cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_226"> The Deputy's point is valid; it is recognised by the Government. Obviously, the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, is working very hard to make a real impact in this area.</p>

          <p eId="para_227">The Taoiseach has just given me what is more or less a rundown of what was announced about a month ago. I cannot believe he thinks this is adequate to deal with the current crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">I wonder whether the Taoiseach has a real appreciation of the scale of the crisis. As he has just said, the €50 million announced for the provision of accommodation for homeless persons in the next two years will deliver something like 253 housing units nationwide. Obviously, this is to be welcomed, but it will not even scratch the surface in terms of what is needed. These announcements strike me as being on a par with the delusional budget that led to the medical card fiasco. The Government keeps on adopting piecemeal approaches when it is a supply side issue. As I have said on numerous occasions, we have been told at the environment committee that there is a very large amount of money to be leveraged from the European Investment Bank for this purpose, in the region of €500 million, but we are not getting to grips with this problem.</p>

          <p eId="para_230">I recall the Taoiseach telling us a number of weeks ago that he had gone up to a homeless man on the street and talked to him. I urge him to go to any house for rent in Dublin, its suburbs or surrounding counties. What typically happens is that people plead with and beg the letting agents to accept rent supplement and they try to convince them to accept additional money under the table in order that they will not find themselves homeless.</p>

          <p eId="para_232">I am just about to ask it. What the Taoiseach would notice is the sense of fear and panic people are confronted with when they find themselves in a situation they never thought would happen. My questions are as follows. Will the Government implement preventive programmes to prevent families from becoming homeless in the first place and work with some of the housing charities in that regard? Will it look in a serious way at the funding available through the European Investment Bank for the provision of a rental sector that would ultimately provide homes for people, rather than a temporary property solution for them?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_141">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2014-06-10T15:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_233">The Government engages with the European Investment Bank and much more money is being invested now in a range of projects than was the case. In fact, one of the difficulties in Ireland in the past was that we did not bring forward projects of sufficient scale to warrant investment from the European Investment Bank. That is no longer the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_234"> I take the Deputy's point on the scale of what is available for particular housing, but we have to start somewhere. Why is it that we have all of these residential units boarded up? This leads to activities that are not in keeping with good estate management. The Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, received money from the Government recently in order that every council in the country could bring 2,000 of these units back into a condition where people could live in them comfortably. When Dublin City Council repairs unit X which is boarded up, it tears everything out and starts as if it is an empty shell, when it is not necessary to do this in many cases. A good, competent builder could restore a unit to provide very comfortable accommodation for a hell of a lot less and in a lot less time. There is no reason for this, other than wanting to comply with spurious conditions. We have to start somewhere. I hope the bringing of these 2,000 units back on stream will send a signal in its own way from every local authority. The Minister of State now reports to the Government each week on the progress being made in order these units can be brought back into use.</p>
          <p eId="para_235"> On another point, I find that in this city, when a unit is brought back to a liveable standard, it is often nine or ten months before it is allocated to a family, which seems unorthodox. One would think that when units were identified, families would also be identified to move into them and not have them repaired and left vacant for 12 months or more.</p>

Obviously, Deputies are entitled to request the Ceann Comhairle to take matters of topical interest when they arise. It is genuinely a focus of the Minister of State with responsibility for housing with the full backing of the Government. I hope that within six months we can make real progress on it.</p>

          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_151">
            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2014-06-10T15:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_267">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 21, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_268"> I travelled to the United States this year for the St. Patrick's Day period. Each year the St. Patrick's Day celebrations provide the Government with a unique opportunity to engage with Heads of State and Government, senior politicians, business leaders, civic organisations and the media right across the globe. Our overriding objectives are to strengthen Ireland's international relations and enhance our profile and reputation as a location for trade, tourism and investment. It also gives us a unique opportunity to connect with and advocate on behalf of Irish people living abroad.</p>
            <p eId="para_269"> This year, my visit to the United States ran from 13 to 18 March and included a comprehensive programme of engagements in Washington D.C., Boston, and New York. My main focus was on advocating the case for immigration reform and promoting Ireland as a location for investment and jobs. I took every opportunity to highlight these issues at over 30 meetings and speaking engagements, including bilateral political meetings, business and economic focused events and civic engagements.</p>
            <p eId="para_270"> In Washington I met President Obama, Vice President Biden and Speaker Boehner. During my meeting with President Obama we discussed a number of issues of interest to the United States and Ireland. I outlined the progress made towards Ireland's economic recovery and we also discussed developments with the US economy and the prospects for negotiating a transatlantic trade and investment partnership between the European Union and the United States.</p>
            <p eId="para_271"> We discussed the Northern Ireland peace process, including the current state of play in resolving the issues of flags, parades and the past, after the good work of Richard Haass and Meghan O'Sullivan. We agreed that continued effective and strong leadership from within Northern Ireland was essential in building on progress made. I thanked the President for his Administration's continued attention to Northern Ireland, both in terms of engaging with the political leadership and in terms of addressing the social and economic development needs of the communities in the North.</p>
            <p eId="para_272"> I also raised the question of the appointment of an ambassador to Ireland. I note the President has proposed Mr. Kevin O'Malley to be considered for appointment as the ambassador, which I welcome.</p>
            <p eId="para_273"> I did not discuss specifically the Pat Finucane case with the President or his Administration which are very well aware of Ireland's position on it.</p>
            <p eId="para_274"> On international issues, we discussed the situation in Ukraine. For my part, I briefed the President on the emergency European Council meeting the previous week, at which the European Union was united in its strong condemnation of the actions taken by the Russian Federation in Ukraine. We also discussed the referendum in Crimea. We agreed that the Russian actions were unacceptable, that there was a need to take appropriate action to support Ukraine and that the focus had to be on a diplomatic solution.</p>
            <p eId="para_275"> In recent months, most notably during his 2014 State of the Union address, President Obama has clearly set out his intention and determination to achieve comprehensive immigration reform as quickly as possible. During my discussions with him and Vice President Biden they both acknowledged the particular significance of this issue for Ireland and the Irish living in the United States. In all of my political meetings, as well as during relevant public engagements, I highlighted the urgent need for immigration reform to resolve the issue for the estimated 50,000-plus undocumented Irish living in the United States and to provide adequately for legal migration flows in the future through reciprocal arrangements between Ireland and the United States.</p>
            <p eId="para_276">In addition to substantive discussion of the immigration reform issue with President Obama and Vice President Biden, I also discussed the prospects for progress with a range of other members of Congress including Speaker John Boehner, Congressman Bob Goodlatte who is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee which has responsibility for immigration legislation in the House, Congressman Paul Ryan, the Congressional Friends of Ireland and Senator Patrick Leahy who is chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee which oversaw the passage of the Senate's comprehensive immigration reform bill last June. </p>
            <p eId="para_277"> While in Washington, I also called into a St. Patrick's Day gathering for members of the Republican Party, which provided me with a very valuable opportunity to talk to a number of key Republican Congressmen about the issue and encourage progress. I emphasised the need for progress on immigration reform in my speeches to influential audiences at the US Chamber of Commerce, the American-Ireland Fund gala, the White House St. Patrick's Day reception, the Ambassador's St. Patrick's Day reception and, most importantly, at the Speaker's Lunch on Capitol Hill where a large number of members of Congress were present in addition to the President, Vice President and Speaker Boehner and where I called in the strongest possible terms for Congress to show leadership and deal with the immigration issue now.</p>
            <p eId="para_278"> One of the principal reasons for going to the US for St. Patrick's Day is to share the celebration of our national day with the Irish-American community which has done so much to keep its Irish heritage and culture alive and strong. During my visit, I met with members of the community in Washington D.C., Boston and New York where I heard first-hand accounts of the difficulties faced by our undocumented citizens and, of course, saw some of the tremendous efforts that are being made to support our citizens living in the United States.</p>
            <p eId="para_279"> I did not have any detailed discussions on double taxation agreements with the President or at other meetings. I would mention, however, that in December 2012, Ireland became one of the first countries in the world to sign an agreement with the US to improve international tax compliance and implement the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, FATCA. During my meeting with Vice President Biden, we discussed a number of issues of mutual interest including Ireland's economic progress and the need for immigration reform. The Vice President confirmed his desire and intention to visit Ireland. </p>
            <p eId="para_280"> At the US Chamber of Commerce in Washington, I highlighted Ireland's economic progress as well as the current state of play with regard to negotiations on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, and the benefits of an ambitious agreement for both the US and Europe. I also had a meeting with Mike Froman, US Trade Representative, where we discussed progress on the negotiations to date and our joint commitment to the conclusion of a comprehensive and ambitious partnership.</p>
            <p eId="para_281"> I also participated in a number of other events in Washington, including addressing a major business event organised by the embassy and the economic promotion agencies. I presented the inaugural Science Foundation Ireland St. Patrick's Day Medal to Professor Garrett Fitzgerald. I attended the American Ireland Fund's 22nd national gala where Vice President Biden was recognised for his distinguished public service and presented with the American Ireland Fund Peace Award. Also, in Washington, I took the opportunity to meet Northern Ireland First Minister, Peter Robinson, and Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness. We discussed the current situation in the North, including prospects for political talks on dealing with contentious issues, including the past. I emphasised the need for courage and leadership from the Northern Ireland Executive and the political parties. A few days later, I had an opportunity to meet with Dr. Richard Haass during my visit to New York, and heard at first hand his assessment of the talks process and prospects for further progress between the parties.</p>
            <p eId="para_282"> In Boston, I attended the South Boston St. Patrick's Day breakfast, which was attended by federal, state and city council representatives including its host, state Senator Linda Dorcena-Forry; the Governor of Massachusetts, Deval Patrick; and Senator Elizabeth Warren. Afterwards, I met the new mayor of Boston, Marty Walsh. We spoke about the strong economic ties between Boston and Ireland, which the mayor's Irish links will only help to make stronger. I visited the Irish Cultural Centre based in Canton outside Boston. This centre is at the core of the Irish community in the Boston region and is doing tremendous work on its behalf. I also attended a reception at the consulate general in Boston attended by representatives from the business, economic and philanthropic Irish organisations in the region. Finally in Boston, I visited the USS Constitution Museum, a ship once captained by the grandfather of Charles Stewart Parnell and which is claimed to be the oldest functioning naval ship in the world.</p>
            <p eId="para_283"> In New York, I had a range of meetings focused on political, economic and cultural issues. I attended the traditional St. Patrick's Day mayor's breakfast with the city's political leaders, including Mayor de Blasio. Later that day, I had a bilateral meeting with Mayor de Blasio at City Hall where we discussed the mayor's election success and I updated him on economic progress in Ireland. I proposed that the mayor meet regularly with leading Irish figures in New York, including the consul general, in order to discuss matters of importance to the Irish community in the area. I attended the annual Ireland Chamber of Commerce reception before joining the St. Patrick's Day parade where I marched with New York GAA members marking the centenary of the GAA in New York. I attended the traditional lunch event with the Knights of St. Patrick following which I visited the American Irish Historical Society. This society receives funding from the emigrant support programme and has served as a centre for Irish scholarship and the study of Irish history in the United States for more than a century. I did not have any meetings with representatives from the Ancient Order of Hibernians. Before returning home on 18 March, I attended a number of business events in New York, including addressing a gathering of business leaders at the Partnership for New York City, which is an influential group. Following this, I attended a meeting of business leaders to discuss ongoing negotiations on a transatlantic trade agreement and the potential benefits for Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_284"> As in previous years, it was evident to me that the strength of our relationship with the US is something that Ireland must continue to nurture. Everywhere I travelled, I found tremendous goodwill towards the country and an enthusiastic acknowledgement of the economic progress it is making. This sentiment was in evidence again last week during my visit to San Francisco and Silicon Valley. St. Patrick's Day offers us a unique opportunity to promote our country on the global stage. The dedicated efforts of our Government Ministers and the staff of our diplomatic missions and overseas agencies who represent this country so professionally are essential to Ireland's social and economic interests and have a tremendously positive impact on Ireland's profile and reputation and, ultimately, on our ability to compete for tourism, investment and job creation opportunities.</p>

            <p eId="para_285">Deputies Martin, Adams, Higgins and Boyd Barrett have questions in this group and I will take questions from them in that order.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_153">
            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2014-06-10T16:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_286">I have quite a number of questions under a number of different headings. Clearly, the Taoiseach had a very busy schedule in his journey to the US during the week of St. Patrick's Day but I put it to him that it has taken us about four months to get the opportunity to ask questions about it. This cannot be satisfactory. I do not think it is just about the Taoiseach's own idea around the party proposals. At the minimum, we should return to the system of two periods per week for questions, which was the position up until this Dáil. Second, when the Taoiseach has to cancel questions, he should at least agree to reschedule them. I think he is the only member of Government who can cancel questions without rescheduling them and there have been a number of them. All of this leads to a situation that is very frustrating where it can take four months before we can get answers to questions.</p>
            <p eId="para_287"> It is very clear that the overall issue of the undocumented Irish is ultimately a function of domestic politics in the US. I was formerly involved as Minister for Foreign Affairs. We must maintain our contacts with particular people in the House of Representatives where a significant degree of the opposition still exists. There was some hope after the last presidential election that there would be momentum behind comprehensive immigration reform legislation. That appears to have stalled. I would appreciate the Taoiseach's assessment of that. In respect of the bilateral strand, I negotiated a working holiday agreement with Japan and others some time ago that involved a 12 month visa. Has there been any evaluation of that? Is there any potential for developing more flexibility around that and getting greater numbers on that working holiday agreement? The idea is that we can get more people travelling legally to the US as opposed to being incentivised to do something illegal, which we do not want.</p>
            <p eId="para_288">I would appreciate his views on that and on the bilateral agreement we had pushed at one stage, to which there was resistance in the US and which the Australians had developed.</p>

            <p eId="para_289">Is it the e-visas?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_155">
            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2014-06-10T16:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_290">Yes. Has the Taoiseach an update on that?</p>
            <p eId="para_291"> With regard to taxation, did he have discussions with President Obama about Ireland's corporate tax regime? Last week, the Governor of California, Jerry Brown, used humour when he raised questions about our tax rates, but his comments were played back here and they were serious none the less. He said that California would be an independent state if it had Irish tax rates. He is ill-informed and I was surprised that there was not a stronger push-back from the Taoiseach and others, because we must be much more robust regarding our taxation structures. A one-sided debate has opened up on our corporate tax regimes and tax structures. Even people in this House are suggesting the country should apologise or should rush to amend its corporate tax regime. There are jobs in this country based on the regime. There are jobs in my constituency and in many other constituencies in the pharmaceutical, electronics and technology industries. We must be robust in this regard. Countries have different regimes and tax structures. We have higher taxes than California, for example. It has flexibility on tax that we could never have. Its VAT rate, for example, is 8.5%, while its top income tax rate is 10.5% for those earning in excess of $1 million a year. I would put it to Governor Brown that if the people of California had to pay our tax rates, they would be far from happy. We structure our tax code to encourage business and to attract inward investment. I cannot change the global order. I will not change what is happening in Singapore.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#SeanBarrett" eId="spk_156">
            <from> An Ceann Comhairle<recordedTime time="2014-06-10T16:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_292">Could we get back to Question Time?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_157">
            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2014-06-10T16:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_293">This is about an important tax issue. There has been a great deal of comment on this by American politicians, and when we visit America and meet the President, we must be robust and say that we are entitled to have a corporate tax rate of 12.5% and to structure our tax regime to attract inward investment. Many of these companies are no longer US companies; they are global companies that trade internationally. One only has to look at the incentives offered by Singapore and Israel. They outstrip any that an EU member state can offer in state aid and tax structures.</p>
            <p eId="para_294"> Companies such as Intel and Apple have had deeply embedded functions and an embedded presence in Ireland for a long time and they have employed thousands over the years. Apple, for example, at one time manufactured more products in Ireland than in the US. These are the realities we have to push back with. During his meetings with business interests, chambers of commerce and so on, was the tax issue raised with the Taoiseach? We have to push back more assertively and effectively on these issues because damage is being done to Ireland's international reputation. A proactive narrative needs to come out of Ireland, robustly arguing for our position. Did the Taoiseach raise this in the US?</p>
            <p eId="para_295"> Recently, the European Commission asserted that it intended to examine Ireland's corporate tax regime. What about the Dutch and the French? If the Commission wants to start looking at one country it had better look at every member state, because every country does not play by the same rules or have the same structures.</p>
            <p eId="para_296"> With regard to Northern Ireland and his discussions with Dr. Haass and the US, has the Taoiseach reflected on what some perceive to be the hands-off approach he has adopted up to now regarding Northern Ireland? Is there a need for him and for both governments to become more hands-on in the negotiations about the past and the issues that were part and parcel of the Haass process? The situation within the Executive and the Assembly is not what it should be, and many people in the middle ground have been disappointed by the lack of progress on a broad range of issues. The politics of the Assembly still appear to be very partisan, with the parties primarily engaged in electoral gain as opposed to breaking the mould on social and economic policies. There has been a drift, and people are commenting on that. Will the Taoiseach indicate what is the American perspective on creating new momentum in the process to get talks going?</p>
            <p eId="para_297"> Question No. 18 asks whether the Taoiseach attended any fund-raising meetings in the US. I presume he did not.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_161">
            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2014-06-10T16:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_301">Was it a fund-raiser for him?</p>

          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_162">
            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2014-06-10T16:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_302">I was there for about 15 minutes. I am not sure that it was an official fund-raiser for him or his party. My conversation with him was in regard to the undocumented Irish. He extended an invitation to drop by to an event he had arranged. Obviously, he is quite a close friend of Ireland. He is influential in the Tea Party wing of the Republican Party and he is supportive of Ireland's immigration reform agenda. He was one of the honourees at the event organised by the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform on Capitol Hill on 12 March. It was not an occasion for me to make a public comment other than to speak directly to Congressman Mulvaney and ask him to continue to support the issue of dealing with the undocumented Irish and to provide long overdue relief for people suffering in that regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_303"> I apologise for having to cancel some of the questions. These things are sometimes outside my control.</p>
            <p eId="para_304"> I spoke directly in his office to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, John Boehner, and Congressmen Ryan, Goodlatte, and Mulvaney about the question of immigration reform. The Republican Party recognises the importance of dealing with the immigration issue. Clearly there is a range of views within the party, no more than in the Democratic Party. The Irish ambassador, Ms Anderson, is exceptionally active on the Hill in keeping members up to date and in trying to put together a group that will continue to focus clearly on what is needed in this regard. My impression, directly from Speaker Boehner, was that he is very anxious to get this done before November. There will be an opportunity before the autumn elections take place to deal with this, and it seems as if the congressmen are focused on attempting to sort it out. For us, it is 50,000 undocumented out of between 15 million and 20 million. These people will not be deported and there is a growing realisation in both parties that a path to legitimisation or to legal access to the US would allow them to contribute more fully to US society and the economy and to be able to travel back and forth to their home countries, no more than our own here.</p>
            <p eId="para_305"> The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade is going to the USA in the next week or so to continue these discussions. I spoke to Ms Anderson in California last Thursday and Friday. She is focused on this at a high level of activity.</p>
            <p eId="para_306">Now is a time for the American Administration to deal with this, as the Deputy correctly says, and I hope it does.</p>
            <p eId="para_307"> There was strong representation of American politicians at the Speaker's lunch on Capitol Hill and they got a clear message about the importance for us of dealing with this. Deputy Adams was also in attendance. On the basis of what they were saying, it was not a case of just focusing on the question of e-visas. There was a strong reaction from the Republican Party members who said they wanted to deal with it comprehensively and that they had identified ways of doing that. I hope they can have the resolve and co-operation to make it happen. As the Deputy is aware, if it goes beyond the autumn elections the priorities in American politics will change and the opportunity will be lost. They and the Democrats are conscious of that. Senator Leahy and all of those to whom I spoke, as well as the Irish group there, are all focused on this. It is a case of the American political administration dealing with it. We will continue a high level of intense activity and the Tánaiste is visiting America next week.</p>
            <p eId="para_308"> I spoke to Dr. Richard Haass about his reflections on the outcome of the talks. He told me that he is to come over to Ireland to accept the Tipperary International Peace Award and that he might make other comments on his reflections on the talks there. We can see the difficulty here. I said to Deputy Adams last week or the week before that I wished to have an early meeting with his party and to meet with the Executive in Northern Ireland. The Tánaiste was there on Sunday and Monday with the Secretary of State, Theresa Villiers. There is an opportunity for some progress before the intensity of the marching season. I spoke to the Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, on the telephone last Saturday or Sunday week about the importance of moving this forward and not letting it drift into unfocused areas. The parties in Northern Ireland are meeting, but these are three issues about which there are clear sensitivities.</p>
            <p eId="para_309"> Dr. Richard Haass pointed out where progress could be made on a number of areas and, with the goodwill of the political process, it is a case of trying to make progress on that. If the Governments get involved, they would go beyond the Executive and the parties, who invited Dr. Richard Haass to Ireland to see if he and Professor Meghan O'Sullivan could make progress on the past, parades and the legacy issues. It is a case of having a fix on what can be achieved. I have not spoken in detail to the Tánaiste about the outcome of his meeting with the Secretary of State, Theresa Villiers. I will meet with Deputy Adams and his people at an early date and talk to the Executive to see if, in the short time ahead, there is an opportunity for both Governments to get involved and make progress on a number of these areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_310"> I will be interested to hear Deputy Adams's views on where he considers we might be able to make progress on some of these matters. Clearly, nobody wishes to see a return to what happened previously. Along with the co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, this was a genuine attempt by the parties in Northern Ireland to involve themselves in a forum, chaired by Dr. Haass, and to see if progress could be made. There was a basis for progress in a number of areas, and we thank him for that. The parties have continued to meet. As to whether it is worth delving in on top of that if progress can be made, I will speak to the Tánaiste shortly about his discussions over the weekend with the Secretary of State.</p>

            <p eId="para_311">I wish to raise the manner in which questions to the Taoiseach are organised and taken. The first tranche of questions today relate to March, which was three months ago. The second tranche are about the meeting of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, in Paris at the beginning of February. We probably will not reach them today, so they will be postponed to another day. It is not an efficient, representative or inclusive way to deal with these matters. Clearly, some of the issues are ones we consistently raise, but the context changes. I will now ask some of the same questions that were asked earlier regarding the undocumented Irish in the US and our tax laws. I also wish to concentrate some of my time on the ongoing situation in the North. Will I deal with the tax first and then refer to the North?</p>

            <p eId="para_313">It allows for a focus on them. First, I appreciate and, indeed, enjoyed the way the Taoiseach raised the issue of the undocumented Irish at the Speaker's lunch. It was a very direct way of doing it and it certainly caught people's attention. I commend him on that. As the Taoiseach said, there is an opportunity before the election in November to push for reform that would favour the undocumented Irish, but this requires significant work by the Government and our diplomatic representatives in the US. I know the Taoiseach understands how important this is both for the families here in Ireland and the people who have no legal status in the USA. The Taoiseach told me yesterday he is working on this issue, which I welcome, but the Government must increase its engagement with the Obama Administration and the people on Capitol Hill. Perhaps he would take the opportunity to outline what his strategy is for the forthcoming period. This issue fluctuates but it never goes away. Depending on whom one talks to, it is likely to be resolved or is not likely to be resolved. In the meantime, there are ongoing difficulties for the people involved. Will the Taoiseach outline the Government's strategy for the next few months?</p>
            <p eId="para_314"> I noted the Governor of California, Jerry Brown, whom I know, venting on an issue that arises very regularly among those in politics in the United States. He was giving out, in a humorous way, about our tax laws and how US corporations such as Apple are treated in this country. Aside from his humour, his criticism was quite scathing and, one could say, undiplomatic. He talked about the Government's creative accounting, which allows US multinationals to avoid paying a substantial portion of their taxes in the USA. There is a roll-on effect of the USA being denied its tax take, the big multinationals getting off scot free and the consequent effect even in the developing world. Does the Taoiseach accept that these are genuine concerns expressed by Governor Brown, especially as the European Commission is to launch a formal investigation into assertions that the Revenue Commissioners have offered special deals to multinational companies here? The Government usually glosses over this, says it has signed an agreement and so forth. Would the hostility and anger about this issue result in senior US political figures making the job of the IDA more difficult? Does this arise, or was it raised with the Taoiseach in March?</p>
            <p eId="para_315"> I will come back to the issue of the North later.</p>

            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2014-06-10T16:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_316">I drifted from the question Deputy Martin asked about tax.</p>
            <p eId="para_317">Governor Brown was speaking at an event in San Francisco attended by representatives of 20 small companies from Ireland who had been through a boot camp here on how to present their cases for investment by venture capitalists. I was very taken by the scale and nature of the presentations, ideas and propositions the companies put forward, sponsored and assisted by Enterprise Ireland. A number of them will certainly make serious headway in the time ahead.</p>
            <p eId="para_318"> On the point raised by the Deputy, this is a question of being very robust and strong in defence of our corporate tax system. He is correct to say these issues vary from country to country and sector to sector, depending on location. Our tax system is perfectly legitimate, statutorily based, ethically implemented and will be defended strongly by the Government if the concerns expressed by the European Commission are moved. Our corporation tax rate is not in question. We have had it since the 1950s and it is a cornerstone of what we offer to have a competitive rate of corporation tax. Unfair competition in taxation is an issue that must be addressed and the appropriate fora for this are the EU code of conduct on business taxation and the OECD's forum on harmful tax practices.</p>
            <p eId="para_319"> We published Ireland's international tax charter on budget day as part of the country's international tax strategy and reaffirmed Ireland's commitment to actively contribute to OECD and EU efforts to tackle harmful tax competition. We have made the point that the digital world has moved far ahead of the legislative world. For that reason, 15 sectors were identified and Ireland contributes enthusiastically with all other countries to these sectors to obtain an international response to an international phenomenon. On foot of a perception of reputational damage, the Minister for Finance abolished the stateless concept in the last budget. As a result of its own research, the OECD has indicated that it is in favour of tax competition. Pascal Saint-Amans, the director of the OECD Centre for Tax Policy and Administration in Paris, stated recently that what OECD member states were concerned about was not low tax but zero tax or situations in which all profits and intangibles, including intellectual property, ended up in jurisdictions in which not only was there no tax but no business activity. Obviously, the situation in Ireland is that multinationals employ considerable numbers of people. It is not a matter of having a brass plate on a door indicating an issue. The OECD's base erosion and profit shifting, or BEPS, project will address the opportunities for locating profits in jurisdictions without co-locating actual business in the first instance.</p>
            <p eId="para_320"> Ireland will adopt a very strong defence of its tax position, including our rate of corporation tax, its legitimacy and the efficacy of its implementation. The matter was raised in a general sense by a number of companies. They like to have clarity in America and horizons against which they can plan. They like to know that Ireland's system is statutorily based and that the rate of corporation tax is not under observation or being considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_321"> Governor Brown has made a dramatic impact in his three years as Governor of California. He has shifted it from having a €27 billion deficit to a point where there has been significant economic progress. It was not without some very decisions being implemented in California. There are places in San Francisco where one can see houses which are highly priced with homeless people lying outside in significant numbers. I was speaking to a young person who worked for one of the major IT companies in Palo Alto and who lived in a very small bedsit, the rent for which was approximately €4,000 per month. That places serious pressure on housing in the city. Governor Brown and I had a good discussion. He was here last year and called to see me. He wants to come back again. He has strong connections with Ireland on foot of his ancestors' origins in Tipperary.</p>
            <p eId="para_322"> The impact of the companies projecting for business is very strong. Members can be very proud of how they are presenting their cases. Many of them will make significant progress.</p>

            <p eId="para_325">He is not coming back with ideas to end austerity any time soon or for the public investment which is so desperately needed here. In any case, my question to him involves the substance of his discussions with President Obama on the proposed trade agreement between the United States of America and the European Union. Specifically, what did they discuss and into how much detail did they go? Did they merely reinforce the propaganda the Taoiseach and the President have been propagating, which is just a regurgitation of the claims made by the major multinationals which see the agreement they are trying to drive as the source of massively increased profits? They have been lobbying furiously for that type of agreement. Has the Taoiseach subjected to reality the claims being made for the agreement to the effect that there will be huge job increases? The same was said about the North American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, involving Canada, the USA and Mexico and jobs have been lost. Working people have been seriously discommoded by the effects of that agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_326"> Is the Taoiseach aware of the details that have been leaked from the negotiations between the European Commission and the USA of what the big corporates on both sides of the Atlantic want? They want full scale liberalisation and further privatisation of public services, with concomitant downward pressure on wages and conditions for working people. Have we not learned from the savage proposals of Bausch &amp; Lomb to drive workers in Waterford into penury and poverty to maintain profits? That, written large, is what is involved in these proposals. Is the Taoiseach aware that consumers - meaning ordinary people in Europe, including Ireland - do not want the standards being pushed by big US agri-businesses on genetically modified food, hormone-fed beef and chlorine-washed chicken to be imposed in Europe? These are all anathema to ordinary people in Europe.</p>
            <p eId="para_327"> Did the Taoiseach discuss with the President of the United States of America the implications of the investor-state dispute mechanism whereby business interests could override by way of the proposed agreement the ability of states to make sovereign laws? As a result of the NAFTA, Canada is being challenged by a major corporate in seeking huge damages because it placed a moratorium on fracking, which is considered to be an intrusion on the right of companies to do business as they wish.</p>
            <p eId="para_328">I do not think the Taoiseach is up to speed on this. Nevertheless, I ask him if he has gone into such details with the President of the United States. Otherwise, they are reinforcing the type of propaganda that has obviously been fed to them by big business lobbyists.</p>

            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2014-06-10T16:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_329">I thank Deputy Higgins and I congratulate Deputy Ruth Coppinger on her election to the House. I am sure she does not need to learn anything but she has a good stiúrthóir beside her as Contae Chiarraí.</p>
            <p eId="para_330"> It is important to remember that things are not how they used to be. People from this country no longer go to America with one hand as long as the other. Some 80,000 to 100,000 American people are employed in Irish-owned and Irish-run firms across 50 states. This is set to continue and to expand, which is an important recognition of the progress we have made with our people over many years. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, has the potential to create 500,000 jobs in Europe and a similar number in the United States. Europe and the United States have a closely integrated economic relationship, but it is not one that has been fulfilled in terms of job potential.</p>
            <p eId="para_331"> The Deputy refers to the difficult situation in so far as the purchase of Bausch &amp; Lomb is concerned, and I hope discussions taking place there can sort it out in a way that means Waterford and the south east do not lose out heavily. Recently, I was at Intel in Leixlip, which has spent €5 billion in the past three years. It is the single biggest investment in the history of the State, with 5,000 construction workers from this country employed for the past number of years building a plant that no one is working in yet but which will guarantee the future for highly skilled Irish workers and others over the coming 25 years. It is the first time in 40 years that Irish engineers were challenged and came up with a positive outcome in designing, instead of just manufacturing, a chip in the Intel plant in Leixlip. It is a case of intellectual property being vested here and it is an extraordinary achievement when we consider what is coming at us in terms of the Internet.</p>
            <p eId="para_332"> The Allergan plant in Westport is the subject of a €300 million investment, with considerable employment being created in its construction. I was in Sligo last week with the Minister of State, Deputy John Perry, at the opening of the AbbVie plant, which is another significant investment. There is a very highly skilled workforce and they will produce the serum and the vaccine for hepatitis C. It has a cure rate of 95% in respect of the people it is intended for and it brings comfort and quality of life to millions of people around the world. Around 23,000 people will benefit in Ireland. It is an expensive drug but it is being produced by AbbVie in Sligo.</p>
            <p eId="para_333"> I did not discuss the intricacies of fracking with President Obama. Clearly, it has transformed United States, but I am not sure everyone would be happy with the outcome in terms of the way it is performed in some states. It has reduced energy prices by considerable amounts in the US, while Europe has gone the other way in terms of increasing energy prices. It makes it so much more competitive for serious investment and with regard to companies' long-term decisions to locate in the United States as opposed to Europe. That is not to say that we must have fracking everywhere. There are arguments for and against these issues, and the Keystone pipeline is a major issue of discussion in the United States between Canada and the area southwards. It is an issue for the American Government to deal with.</p>
            <p eId="para_334"> With regard to the relationship between the EU and the US, I do not see why we should be afraid of this. These are the two most economically developed entities on the planet and we can set down the conditions for world trade for the coming 25 years or 30 years, assuming we can get a conclusion on the TTIP arrangements. When the matter was raised at the G8 meeting at Loch Erne in Fermanagh, which I attended because Ireland held the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, the response was swift. The discussions have been progressive, as I understand it, and there are very good people representing Europe and the United States. There are difficulties in the United States that always come to light when we get down to the nitty-gritty. People will say they are in favour of free trade until it begins to hit a particular sector. That is where the discussions must get the parties together. The proposal for the TTIP agreement has the potential to boost the GDP of Europe by 0.5% and create between 400,000 and 500,000 jobs. Another advantage is that the agreement will enable Europe, and Ireland as a consequence, to develop the regulatory standards that are of benefit not only to the EU and the US but to other countries as well, and to strengthen the multilateral trading system, which is of particular importance in the area of intellectual property rights, and the environment and labour standards of which the Deputy speaks. These are important issues and there will be a global knock-on effect.</p>
            <p eId="para_335"> The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has commissioned a study that is expected to be completed in the coming eight to ten weeks to identify more precisely the sectors in Ireland from where the greatest opportunity and economic impact can come. Our flexibility and the many creative firms here mean this is an opportunity for us. If jobs are our priority, as they are, we must use every opportunity to ensure that more people can be employed as a consequence of providing services that we know we can deal with.</p>
            <p eId="para_336"> Europeans are serious about the TTIP, as are the Americans. Many of the issues are complicated, technical and difficult and we may not get agreement on them all, but there is no harm in trying to move on from stage to stage. This is about jobs in Europe, jobs in Ireland and jobs in the US, and I am all for that, subject to the conditions that apply in normal good regulatory situations.</p>

            <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2014-06-10T16:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_337">Following on from the TTIP, we are all in favour of trade, but the issue is whether trade is properly regulated and accountable to citizens and whether the interests of citizens and the environment are protected. The critics of the TTIP point to the settlement mechanism proposed for disputes between investors and states, which means that multinational corporations can sue Governments for breaching the terms of the treaty and these matters will be arbitrated in offshore panels of lawyers bypassing domestic courts. This is a manifesto for multinationals to ram their interests down the throats of unsuspecting citizens across Europe, and the citizens of Europe will have no recourse. These supranational arbitration bodies will be dominated by the usual suspects of legal and accountancy firms that are accountable to nobody. That is why it is a serious matter of concern in terms of letting the multinationals off the leash.</p>
            <p eId="para_338">George Monbiot, one of the leading critics of this measure, has brought forward proposals regarding negotiations. A question I will ask regarding the Taoiseach's discussions with the Americans is whether he is in favour of the details of the negotiations being published in order that we know his negotiating position and that of European Union on the matter of how environmental and other concerns, including about workers' rights, will be dealt with and not overridden by this supranational disputes body which will allow multinationals to sue governments and strike down legislation protecting workers. What is the Taoiseach's position on this issue?</p>
            <p eId="para_339"> Should there be a vote in this Parliament on every chapter, not just the full package, of any final agreement? I do not know if we will even see the agreement in this Parliament. The European Parliament has indicated that we will just see the whole package, rather than individual chapters. This will deny public representatives the opportunity to engage in proper scrutiny and the right to vote on each detail of this enormously significant deal. There should be a sunset clause in any agreement and a provision for regular review in order that if the economic benefits the Taoiseach claims will derive from the agreement do not materialise, the sunset clause will cover the issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_340"> There is no evidence for the claims the agreement will lead to the creation of 500,000 jobs. Rather, there is good reason to believe letting multinationals off the hook and giving them power to strike down environmental and workers' rights regulations will lead to the loss of jobs. Let us see the hard evidence on how the agreement will produce extra jobs. I do not believe for one minute that it will. Once again, it is a charter for the multinationals.</p>
            <p eId="para_341"> That brings me to the issue of corporation tax, the discussions the Taoiseach may have had on it and the barrage of criticism in the United States about our corporation tax rate. I do not doubt that some of the US critics of Ireland's corporation tax rate are motivated by politics, cynicism, self-interest, opportunism and so on. However, behind all of this is a substantive issue, namely, that everybody should know that Ireland is spearheading a race to the bottom in terms of corporate taxation. We have been at the vanguard in reducing the tax obligations of the most profitable entities in the world, thus encouraging a race to the bottom. As a tax system should be moral, I ask the Taoiseach for an honest answer to this question. Is it moral that the lady who cleans the toilets and the floors in multinationals such as Google or Facebook pays a higher portion of her income in tax than the shareholders of these companies? Is that moral and are we acting morally in spearheading, on an international level, a race to the bottom, where these companies will pay less and less in corporation tax, while ordinary workers are screwed to the wall? Is that not the basis of the criticism the Taoiseach is receiving in the United States because people know that is what we are doing?</p>
            <p eId="para_342"> I have asked the Taoiseach about this issue before, but I do so again today. While he was in the United States, speaking at a Grant Thornton conference, he said that if one had 30,000 three-bedroomed detached houses in Dublin, one would sell them in one week, thereby encouraging, as is happening, large profit driven American investors to speculate in Irish property. Is that a responsible way for the Taoiseach to talk about a crisis, a property bubble and a homelessness and housing crisis that is devastating significant sections of Irish society? Is it responsible of the Taoiseach to talk in these terms to profit driven international investors? Is he seriously suggesting the people concerned who have no interest in dealing with the homeless and housing crises in Dublin or the dire situations in which ordinary people who have been forced into accommodation for homeless persons or who, with nowhere to go, must sleep on the streets find themselves should come and solve the housing crisis? That is crazy, but is it his policy?</p>

            <p eId="para_343">That is absolute nonsense. What I was doing was pointing out to people in the United States the scale of the economic catastrophe the Government had inherited and the consequences for so many people, including a housing shortage and the demand for housing. It was not a case of inviting American investors to come here to build houses. That is absolute nonsense and well the Deputy knows it.</p>

            <p eId="para_345">The Deputy never mentioned the scale of Irish investment in property in so many countries during the so-called boom years. I do not hear him talking about this. In many cases, that investment pulled down good business in this country. Banks had to cut deals when property dropped in value in other countries, pulling down business that were thriving here as a consequence. That is an issue. Therefore, it is not true to say an invitation was issued to American investors to come here to build houses. The construction sector is only contributing from 6% to 7% to GDP, a drop from the figure of 25% that it used to contribute. We need it to be at approximately 10% to 12% and to be building 30,000 to 35,000 houses annually. The Deputy knows well that if we were in a position to magically transform, as some here seem to think we can, to a position where we had 30,000 three-bedroomed houses available in this city, they would go very quickly.</p>

            <p eId="para_347">I was in Blanchardstown during the recent by-election when I spoke to two estate agents, both of whom told me that people were walking into their offices with mortgage approval from one or other of the two main banks or some other arrangement, but there was no property available to sell to them. That is part of the construction challenge. The construction industry needs to be able to step up to the mark with a funding stream to provide private housing where appropriate and at the scale required.</p>
            <p eId="para_348"> The Deputy suggested the TTIP was a charter for multinationals. What is his focus? Does he not understand that I was just talking about small Irish firms that employed 100,000 people across America? Does he not understand that when quotas go next year, we will have the most productive agri-sector on the planet and that one element of the TTIP arrangements, if they are concluded successfully, will allow for many Irish firms to be able to send fresh Irish agricultural produce to the United States, with benefits for the economy and jobs in production on and off farms? These are not multinationals. It is not a charter for multinationals, rather it is a charter for economic expansion on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>

            <p eId="para_350">The Deputy says there is no evidence that 400,000 jobs will be created, but there may well be double that figure because we have the greatest number of developed western countries in the European Union, offering enormous opportunities if we conclude an agreement. I do not accept the Deputy's view.</p>
            <p eId="para_351"> Let me make another point. I remember co-chairing, back in the 1990s, the WTO talks in Singapore. In the case of world trade, there is a solution to the issue of a row breaking out between countries. It is determined by panels within the WTO and works successfully. If we have an agreement and sign up to it, there must be a dispute resolution mechanism. It is not about overriding the legislation of countries, rather it is about dealing with the conditions signed up to in the agreement for the benefit of both countries. Sometimes we need a dispute resolution mechanism, as the Deputy knows well.</p>

          <p eId="para_359">We disagree with the proposal because 45 minutes is a derisory amount of time to give to such an issue. That is a minute for every year of abuse that took place. This issue is causing huge anger around the country. Major issues are at stake and major questions must be asked, including why this happened. Why did a weak, poverty-ridden capitalist State lean on the Catholic Church for legitimacy and support and tie the morality of the Church into the foundations of this State with the result that women and children born outside wedlock were given such appalling treatment? The State is made up of the political parties that are represented in this Chamber today. The State is largely culpable in this. We need a major debate, with all Deputies given the right to participate. Only ten minutes have been allocated to the Technical Group. Notwithstanding the Private Members' debate later, we believe that more Government time must be given to this debate. The time allowed is derisory for such an issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_452">I wish to inquire about three reports that are outstanding and also about the issue of discretionary medical cards. The Cooke report, with which the Taoiseach has dealt previously, relates to allegations of bugging at the offices of GSOC. I do not think it is good enough for a discussion on this report to be put off until next week. In recent days the Taoiseach returned from what, I presume, was a very gruelling trip to the United States at which point he read the Cooke report and digested its contents. There are those in this House who possess the same intellectual and technical capacity as the Taoiseach.</p>

          <p eId="para_454">I am seeking that the Taoiseach set time aside at the earliest possible opportunity for a debate on this very serious issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_455"> The other reports to which I wish to refer are those compiled by Professor Oonagh Walsh and Judge Yvonne Murphy, respectively, in respect of symphysiotomy. Last July the Taoiseach informed the Dáil that the Walsh report was to be published soon after. In November Judge Murphy was appointed to carry out an examination into the horrific practice of symphysiotomy and her report was to be completed within eight weeks. Neither report has as yet been published. In a letter to me on 15 May the Taoiseach stated that the Minister of Health would submit proposals to the Government in the coming weeks. Has the Minister now done so and when will the Government make the contents of those proposals known to the Dáil?</p>
          <p eId="para_456"> For months the Government claimed that there was no such thing as discretionary medical cards or that if they did exist, they were not being taken away. It then suspended the review of medical cards and we are now informed that the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, and his Minister of State, Deputy White, were tasked with preparing a plan in respect of this matter. The Government's cuts have given rise to a great deal of distress and there is huge confusion with regard to this matter on the part of the sick, the elderly and the parents of children with difficult medical conditions. There is still no coherent plan. When will the Government produce its proposals in respect of medical cards?</p>

          <p eId="para_457">The proposals relating to medical cards will be produced by means of a memo the Minister will present to the Cabinet next week. Earlier today he provided the Cabinet with an update on the progress being made in respect of this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_458"> I cannot answer Deputy Adams' question regarding the reports on symphysiotomy. However, I will communicate further with him in respect of the Minister's intentions for bringing them before Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_459"> There are people in this Chamber with intellects that are vastly superior to mine. I am sure they could quite easily speed read the Cooke report and absorb its contents. The report relates to a serious matter. It was received on Friday last and is being published today. It is appropriate that we should give all Deputies the opportunity to absorb its contents before, as is my intention, making Government time available for statements on it next week.</p>

            <p eId="para_649">I thank the Minister for taking this issue. The local elections are over and the political landscape has changed. However, the need for a directly elected mayor for Dublin city has not gone away. I know the Minister is strongly committed to this idea. The people of Dublin should be allowed have their say in a plebiscite next year at the same time as the marriage equality referendum. The four local authorities in Dublin cover a population of nearly 1,300,000 people. Dublin is not competing with Cork, Limerick or Galway. It is competing against cities of the world such as London, Singapore, Cape Town and Geneva. Dublin needs a strong, single voice with a mandate. That is why I believe this city needs a directly elected mayor.</p>
            <p eId="para_650"> We recently completed a process for considering a directly elected mayor as laid out in the Local Government Reform Act 2014. Many said it was doomed to failure from the beginning but the forum of 22 elected councillors tabled a proposal that was overwhelmingly endorsed by councillors of three of four Dublin councils. There were legitimate reasons for Fingal councillors to vote against the proposal for a plebiscite but I do not believe it should be dropped completely. I would have concerns also about splitting the functions of the IDA and Enterprise Ireland under a Dublin mayor but a mayor must have an economic role.</p>
            <p eId="para_651"> I ask the Minister to call on the mayors and chairs of each of the councils to restart the process. I ask him to meet with them in the next few weeks to see how that process could be started. My reading of the legislation is that it would have to be amended to allow a further vote at council level. I ask the Minister to consider bringing these minor amendments to the House quickly. Failing that, the Government should convene a convention for Dublin modelled on the Constitutional Convention. We need more public debate on what a mayor should do, the powers he or she should have and the elements of transport, housing and environment issues that are so important to this city. We need to bring ordinary citizens together with their councillors, business and community organisations to build support and tease out the problems in a democratic way. All stakeholders should have a say in crafting a proposal to put Dublin, and the people of Dublin, first. Such a convention could address the problems in the original proposal and allow Dubliners to have their say. People want a vote. They were prevented from getting one this year due to a small minority of councillors, but we have the time and space now to rethink and reinvigorate the proposal that can shape the future of our capital city. </p>
            <p eId="para_652"> I ask the Minister to act in the coming weeks by bringing together the new chairs and mayors of this city who can bring forward a proposal that would allow us directly elect a mayor of our capital city. That would be a progressive move. I believe the Minister is committed to it, and it would be a fine legacy if a plebiscite could take place next year.</p>

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Phil Hogan)<recordedTime time="2014-06-10T17:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_653">I thank Deputy Humphreys for raising this important matter. As he knows, the establishment of a directly elected mayor across the area of the four local authorities in Dublin has been attempted a number of times by Governments over the years, and there have been a number of changes of heart by those Governments, with a lack of structured consultation with local representatives or the people of the Dublin metropolitan area.</p>
            <p eId="para_654"> Within the framework of the Local Government Reform Act 2014, I provided for the first time a more consultative and bottom-up approach to the creation of an office of directly elected mayor for the metropolitan area of Dublin. The option of a plebiscite remained as had always been envisaged - that is, a local plebiscite allowing the elected councils in the first instance, and the electorate in Dublin secondly, to decide whether Dublin should have a directly elected mayor, and the range of functions for the office.</p>
            <p eId="para_655"> In recognition of their democratic mandate as local public representatives, and in the best traditions of representative democracy, the elected councillors in Dublin were given a proposal in respect of their vision for an office of directly elected mayor developed by a forum of the elected members from across the Dublin authorities, which was representative of a wide range of political perspectives. Each of the local authorities took its own decision on whether there should be a plebiscite in light of what they felt was best for the area they represent.</p>
            <p eId="para_656"> There was a clear divergence in the views of Fingal County Council and the other three local authorities in Dublin on the role of a directly elected mayor, leaving us with no consensus on a model for the office that could be put in a plebiscite in tandem with the recent local and European elections on 23 May. In our system of representative democracy, it would have been wrong to ignore the views of Fingal and to put a proposal to the electorate that did not enjoy the support of all four authorities in the region.</p>
            <p eId="para_657"> My immediate focus has now switched to bedding down the very significant reforms to the local government system generally that have been introduced from 1 June this year. The meetings of 30 of the new councils last Friday were a further welcome step in the reform programme, and I look forward to the completion of meetings of the new municipal district members over the rest of this week and early next week. </p>
            <p eId="para_658"> The changes we have brought about in local government are the most important changes across the country in more than a century, and their successful implementation will greatly improve local government and the role it plays in representing local communities and in economic, community and social development. However, that is not to say that, following a period of reflection, proposals for a directly elected mayor for Dublin could not be revisited.</p>
            <p eId="para_659"> I assure Deputy Humphreys and the House that I am committed to the concept of a directly elected mayor for Dublin. The Government remains committed to the notion of a plebiscite for a directly elected mayor for Dublin, and it appears that it is down to me to come up with a fresh initiative in view of the failure of the forum to achieve that consensus. This must take account of the differing views, significant in some respects, among the different local authorities on the role of such an office. Engagement will be required with the four authorities and all relevant Government Departments at a time most likely to maximise the prospects for agreement on a meaningful proposal to put to the electorate, and to maximise the prospects for success in the ballot box.</p>
            <p eId="para_660">In that context, consideration would have to be given to not only how an office of a directly elected mayor would impact on functions currently discharged at central government level but also how the existing four Dublin local authorities' remit would be affected by such an office. It is my intention to write to the newly appointed mayors and chairpersons of those local authorities to invite them to a meeting in the Custom House in early July to discuss how working together we can take the directly elected mayor issue forward.</p>

            <from>Deputy Kevin Humphreys<recordedTime time="2014-06-10T17:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_661">I welcome the Minister's statement that he proposes to invite the mayors and chairpersons to a meeting in the Custom House in July to discuss how this issue can be taken forward. I believe it is fundamentally important to Dublin city that a directly elected mayor role be developed. That was the view of the citizens' forum, which included elected councillors, held in the Mansion House by former Lord Mayor Oisín Quinn. As I said earlier, three of the local authorities voted overwhelmingly in favour of a plebiscite. The only local authority not in favour was Fingal County Council, whose legitimate right in that regard I acknowledge. However, one of the fundamental groups not consulted was the citizens of Dublin. Citizens were not given the opportunity to vote for or against a plebiscite. A referendum on another matter is to be held next year. Knowing the work rate of the Minister, Deputy Hogan, I believe he is well capable of achieving consensus on the holding of the plebiscite on a directly elected Lord Mayor. This would require only minor amendment of the relevant legislation or the holding of a convention in Dublin through which we can engage with citizens, small and medium sized businesses and local groups on the drafting of a proposal.</p>
            <p eId="para_662"> A directly elected mayor of Dublin would have a democratic mandate. From that democratic mandate power could be built. As I said, Dublin is competing on an international basis for inward investment. A directly elected mayor for Dublin, representing 1.3 million people, will allow Dublin to compete on an international scale in attracting foreign direct investment into the city. We face enormous challenges in terms of sustainable development, employment, arts, culture, housing and flood protection in Dublin city. These issues can be best addressed by a directly elected mayor for the city.</p>
            <p eId="para_663"> I welcome that the Minister proposes to issue an invitation to the chairpersons of the four councils. I look forward to that process being built upon quickly so that a plebiscite on the election of a mayor for Dublin city can take place in the middle of next year. I believe this will add to the economic recovery not only of Dublin city but the country. It should not be forgotten that more than 50% of all taxation raised is raised from within in the greater Dublin city area. Anything that allows us to attract more foreign direct investment must be welcomed. </p>
            <p eId="para_664"> I again welcome the Minister's commitment and look forward to an engagement with the citizens of Dublin on the issue of the holding of a plebiscite on a directly elected mayor.</p>

            <p eId="para_665">I again assure Deputy Humphreys that I am committed to the concept of a directly elected mayor for Dublin. It is regrettable that in the discussions between the four local authorities it was not possible for them to reach consensus on what should constitute the powers and functions of a directly elected mayor. It certainly was not possible for me to ignore the fact that one of the local authorities had some difficulties in that regard. In establishing the forum to allow local public representatives of the four local authority areas, as they then existed, to come together I thought it would be possible for them, as those closest to the citizen, to come to a conclusion on the matter. Deputy Humphreys mentioned some of the issues that are of concern, particularly to the councillors in Fingal, which perhaps should have been reflected upon a little earlier in the process and not taken for granted.</p>
            <p eId="para_666"> As the saying goes, we are where we are. I will kick-start the process by way of early engagement with the mayors and chairpersons of the four Dublin authorities in early July. I look forward to a constructive process in the future which will meet the objective which Deputy Humphreys and I want.</p>

            <p eId="para_667">I thank the Minister of State, Deputy White, for coming to the House to respond to this matter. I first became aware of this problem on Facebook, when a constituent tagged me on a post uploaded by a young Galway woman in relation to the circumstances facing her family, particularly her mother who suffers from MS. Rather than try to describe the situation I propose to read into the record the post uploaded onto Facebook by the young woman, which I believe will illustrate the situation far better than I can. It states:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_668">I don't normally make statuses like this on FB but our government needs to see and hear what effect the decisions they make have on families, from the families themselves! My name is Caitriona I'm a 24 year old student nurse, from Galway originally but I'm studying in Sligo. As you know, nursing is a profession that involves providing high quality care and treatment for the sick and promoting health for all. And as a nurse the situation my family is facing at the moment has greatly affected me because our country won't provide my mother with the treatment she needs. We recently received the news that my mum, who has Multiple Sclerosis, will no longer receive her medication (Fampyra) on the Long Term illness Scheme. Meaning that she will now be forced to pay 500 euro a month if she wants to have the only tablets that have treated the symptoms of her MS in particular her walking ability and fatigue. My mum retired early because of the illness, and her loss of mobility and loss of power in her arms and hands, she uses a collator to walk, and has a hand controlled adapted car as her legs have severely reduced power, she has foot drop and has had two falls, one of which took me and my brother ages to get her off the ground and resulted in a fractured shoulder. Watching the effects that her condition has on her has been awful, hell actually and without her medication things will progress sooner. It will be impossible for her to afford these on the pension that has already been cut and making ends meet at the moment is already difficult. She currently has a six weeks supply left and if I have to write to every TD in this country for the next 6 weeks I will, because she needs this medication as much as anyone with a terminal illness needs theirs! This issue is not only affecting her but others around the country and it needs to be brought to your attention, and I cant emphasise this enough! It took me hours to write this because I couldn't get the words out, but because of the fear of what the future has for her, I did!! Please like and share this status in the hope that someone hears my voice and yours in support of my mums treatment.</p>
            <p eId="para_669">As I said, that post was uploaded by a young lady in Galway. </p>
            <p eId="para_670"> In a recent article in the <i>Irish Independent </i>a man said that the drugs allow him to continue to do a job he loves, pay taxes and not need any home care. He has been on the medication for three years and in one instance when he could not get the drug for two weeks he went from using one stick to needing two sticks to walk. The article states:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_671">If I forget to take one of the tablets I am very unsteady and can barely walk. It gives me the strength to lift my feet up steps and basically get around the house and get in and out of work. In the evening when I have a double dose in my system I can even climb a flight of stairs. </p>
            <p eId="para_672">The man also said that the drug has improved his balance and reduces his risk of falling. The article continues:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_673"> I have gone on to secondary progressive multiple sclerosis and there is no cure. All I can do is hope that it will not get bad quickly.</p>
            <p eId="para_674">That is what the drug has been doing for the lives of real people. I appeal to the Minister of State to do anything that he can to help these people, including re-engaging with the pharmaceutical company involved and the HSE. These are real people's lives. I implore the Minister of State to find a solution to this problem and to help these people.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Alex White)<recordedTime time="2014-06-10T18:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_675">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. I wish to clarify that fampridine, fampyra, was never available to multiple sclerosis patients under the long-term illness scheme. However, I understand that the manufacturer of fampyra supplied the drug free of charge to some patients who were prescribed it by their clinician. The manufacturer has recently decided to stop supplying the drug free of charge and, as a consequence, these patients are now faced with financing the drug themselves if they wish to continue with this drug treatment.</p>
            <p eId="para_676"> The HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products under the community drug schemes in accordance with the provisions of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_677"> The HSE received an application for the inclusion of fampridine in the GMS and community drugs schemes. The application was considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by my Department and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, IPHA, for the assessment of new medicines.</p>
            <p eId="para_678"> In accordance with these procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, NCPE, conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of fampridine and concluded that, as the manufacturer was unable to demonstrate its cost-effectiveness in the Irish health care setting, it was unable to recommend the reimbursement of the product. The report is available on the NCPE's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_679"> The HSE assessment process is intended to arrive at a decision on the funding of new medicines that is clinically appropriate, fair, consistent and sustainable. In these circumstances, the HSE has not approved the reimbursement of fampridine under the community drug schemes, including the long-term illness scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_680"> I understand that studies are ongoing to assess the wider impact of fampridine on both walking and quality of life for persons diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. The account the Deputy read out demonstrates a very real human situation. The description of the very real circumstances faced by the individual concerned was very eloquent. The studies to assess the wider impact of the medicine in question are ongoing. The results of these studies will contribute to the evidence base demonstrating the clinical effectiveness of fampridine that can be used to support future applications for its inclusion on the lists of reimbursable items supplied under the community drugs scheme. In this context, it is open to the manufacturer, at any time, to submit a new application to the HSE for the inclusion of fampridine on the community drug schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_681"> I understand the manufacturer has indicated to the HSE that it intends to submit a revised application for fampridine. The HSE will then reconsider the application in line with the agreed procedures and timescales for the assessment of new medicines.</p>

            <p eId="para_682">I thank the Minister of State for his response. I welcome the indication from the company that it is trying to submit a new application to the HSE. However, time is of the essence as the end of June is not very far away. My concern, which I am sure is shared by the Minister of State, relates to the individuals whose supply is running out. The lady in Galway, to whom I spoke last Friday and whose testimony was quite similar to that of the man from Wexford, stated she was without her drugs for a very short period when she realised the consequences. She did not feel the drug was making very much difference in her life until she went without it, at which time she regressed very quickly. When she went back on the drug, she was able to do things she was not able to do when off it.</p>
            <p eId="para_683"> Can the Department take a proactive approach to this and engage immediately with the drug company to try to find a resolution to this matter? One particular chain of pharmacies is offering the drug mark-up free but it is still beyond the affordability of many. We must bear in mind also that people in the circumstances described have considerable expenses in addition to that of the drug. Providing the drug at an affordable rate or free of charge would be of some help, although it would not fix everything financially.</p>
            <p eId="para_684"> Would it be unprecedented for the Minister of State to engage directly with the company given that there is a specific problem for the people to whom I have referred? Can something be done more quickly than normal given the human cost associated with the people in question not being able to have their drugs?</p>

            <p eId="para_685">Although I believe it would probably not be appropriate for a Minister to engage directly with the company, I understand and accept very much the force of what the Deputy states in respect of the case in question. The only way the process can be triggered is for the manufacturer to submit a new application. I do not believe that has happened yet but I understand it is to happen. I will certainly give any undertaking I can to the Deputy and the House. As I said, the HSE will reconsider the application. It has to go through particular procedures in regard to balancing the efficacy of the drug against the cost. That process must be engaged in on behalf of the State. It is often very difficult when somebody is in a very particular human situation and in need of the support of a particular medicine or drug to address the opposite side of the case, that is, the fact that the drug must be assessed for efficacy and that this must be balanced against the cost. The drug in question is the subject of some comment — I do not know whether I should describe it as controversy — in the United Kingdom owing to an assessment by the National Institute for Care and Excellence, NICE, the equivalent of our assessment organisation. This is a live issue. It may be of some comfort to the Deputy to know that I will do everything in my power to ensure that once the process is triggered by an application, it will be expedited by the HSE so the matter will be addressed and dealt with as quickly as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_686">I thank the Office of the Ceann Comhairle for affording me the opportunity to raise this issue with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan. Members will be aware that persons not on the voting register may apply to register on the supplementary voting register up to 15 days before polling day. Sundays, public holidays and Good Friday are not counted as days for this purpose. I am aware of recent abuses in this regard that occurred in the local electoral area in my constituency. Persons were added to the register through the supplementary registration system and assigned to vacant addresses. I am confident these people switched their votes from their home areas to the area in question to support a particular candidate, despite the fact that, in reality, they never lived there, nor will live there in the future. Any person who applies to register to vote through the supplementary register should be required to forward with his application a document with proof of address. This could be a bill, bank statement or other evidence normally required to prove one's address. This move would stamp out the abuse which I believe led to up to 20 to 30 people voting in a particular electoral area when they should have registered elsewhere.</p>
            <p eId="para_687"> The second issue I wish to raise is the application process for persons who seek a postal vote because of their occupation. In the Ballinamore municipal electoral area of County Leitrim during the recent local elections, 406 applications were received for postal votes. The vast majority were received for reasons associated with people’s occupations. Of the 406 applicants, 368 voted, with 365 casting a valid vote. I am still asking what happened to the remaining 40 plus.</p>
            <p eId="para_688"> I believe a number of applications came from people who were living and continue to live in Australia, Canada and the United States. It is clear that these people did not make the applications themselves and that the applications were made by people acting for a particular candidate in the local election area. With regard to one candidate I know who delivered the unmarked ballot paper to the returning officer, the parent of the applicant was bewildered and could not understand how his or her son could have a postal vote considering that he has resided in Australia for the past two years.</p>
            <p eId="para_689"> I am not advocating that we suspend postal votes for persons who cannot vote due to their occupation but proposing that the Minister review the application process and ensure that a garda or authorised local government official will personally witness the application by a person rather than allowing an application form to be sent in from nowhere. </p>
            <p eId="para_690"> Why did 40 applicants in the Ballinamore area of County Leitrim not proceed to cast their votes?</p>
            <p eId="para_691">I can only suspect that once the list of voters was published and the Garda authorities were notified, attempts by some persons to vote on behalf of others did not go ahead. I urge the Minister to review these two issues and consider changes to prevent the abuse of democracy that may have happened at May's local elections.</p>

            <p eId="para_692">I thank Deputy McLoughlin for raising this very important issue, which is of interest to us all. In law, the preparation of the register of electors, including the supplement to the register, is a matter for each local registration authority. It is their duty to ensure, as far as possible and with the co-operation of the public, the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the register. It is also important that all eligible voters are enabled to vote whenever there are elections or referendums. Eligible voters who are not on the register may apply for inclusion in the supplement to the register. In order to be able to vote at any impending elections or referendums, a person must apply for inclusion in the supplement no later than 15 days before the next polling day, excluding Sundays and public holidays. As Deputy McLoughlin noted, each application for inclusion in the supplement must be signed in the presence of a member of An Garda Síochána from the applicant's local Garda station. The garda must be satisfied as to the person's identity before signing the application and may request identification.</p>
            <p eId="para_693"> Some 3.2 million voters were on the register of electors at the recent elections. This included 59,758 names added by way of the supplement to the register in advance of the elections. I am conscious of the frustration of many electors who find they are not on the register of electors when they go to a polling station and, of course, there are others who are on the register of electors who are unexpectedly there.</p>
            <p eId="para_694"> In regard to the supplement to the postal and special voters' lists, I was satisfied to have the opportunity last year to include a provision in the Electoral, Local Government and Planning Development Act 2013 to allow more time for making an application for inclusion in these lists in advance of impending elections and referenda. Previously, it was a requirement that all such applications had to be made in the two-day period after the making of the relevant polling day order. This was unnecessarily tight in the case of referenda and presidential, European and local elections. Under new arrangements applications for inclusion in the supplement to the postal and special voters' lists can now be made up to 22 days before the next polling day.</p>
            <p eId="para_695"> Returns received from registration authorities by my Department indicate that 9,278 names were included on the supplement to the postal and special voters lists in advance of the recent local and European elections. These, of course, would already have been on the register of electors.</p>
            <p eId="para_696"> I agree with Deputy McLoughlin it is a matter which is a constant source of frustration to participants in the electoral process as well as voters themselves. I am, of course, anxious to make the necessary changes in the short term to ensure that in future elections we will be able to tighten up the process and eliminate some of the anomalies that are identified by Deputy McLoughlin.</p>

            <p eId="para_697">I thank the Minister. In the review that will take place, I ask that presiding officers in the local authorities are the ones called upon as they are the people on the ground. In a review situation, I believe they should be consulted at local authority level because they are hands-on and know exactly what is happening. While I welcome the Minister's statement, it is vital a review takes place in regard to the anomalies that exist at present.</p>

            <p eId="para_698">I have listened with interest to the points made by Deputy McLoughlin. I assure him I share his concern about some of the anomalies that are cropping up too frequently in elections, particularly the need to identify the people who are registering, either directly in the formal electoral register process or through the supplementary register. We are looking at the use of PPS numbers as one of the initiatives which is often suggested to improve the register. While PPS numbers or any other unique identifier could assist the registration authorities in ensuring the register of electors is as accurate as possible, there are a number of issues that crop up and which we will have to consider before we go down that road.</p>
            <p eId="para_699"> I also remind the Deputy that the programme for Government commits us to the establishment of an electoral commission, and we are going to establish that electoral commission in 2015. This matter will be addressed by the Houses of the Oireachtas in appropriate time for them to make these suggestions again. Hopefully, we will be able to reflect the concerns the Deputy has expressed. We will be glad to enlist the support and experience of the local authorities and the presiding officers in the various polling stations throughout the country in order to find what is the best way to ensure we have a good register of electors in which people can be confident. They must have the confidence that what is in the register of electors and the voters registered there is fair and as accurate as possible. These are the matters that will be appropriate for consideration by the electoral commission in advance of the next general election.</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael McGrath<recordedTime time="2014-06-10T18:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_700">This is the first time I have faced the Minister, Deputy Noonan, across the floor of the House since he made the statement about his medical condition. I genuinely want to wish him all the very best in his recovery.</p>
            <p eId="para_701"> The issue I raise concerns the sale by one of Bank of Ireland's largest shareholders, Wilbur Ross, of his entire shareholding in the bank, and in particular the implications that may have for the State's continuing shareholding in the bank, which now lies at approximately 14%. Obviously, the headlines are being dominated by the handsome profit Wilbur Ross made on the financial investment in Bank of Ireland. I will not pass judgment on that issue because, back in the summer of 2011, there was not exactly a queue of international investors willing to invest in Irish banks. He took a punt, took a risk, and it has certainly paid off handsomely for him. It is for other market analysts to assess whether the appropriate price was paid at that time.</p>
            <p eId="para_702"> The decision he has made to sell his entire shareholding in Bank of Ireland does, of course, raise some concerns, given it comes on the eve of the first European-wide stress tests, and Bank of Ireland is one of the banks to be covered by those stress tests. Today, I spare a thought for the many thousands of ordinary shareholders in Bank of Ireland, who lost everything on their investment in its shares and, indeed, the shareholders in the other banks, who also lost everything prior to the virtual collapse of the banks and their share prices back in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_703"> The issue I want to focus on primarily is what are the implications for the State in terms of its 14% shareholding in Bank of Ireland. Clearly, given that over recent months a large stock of Bank of Ireland shares has been traded on the open market, I assume this has the direct effect of making it far more difficult for the State to dispose of its shareholding on the market if that is what the Minister was minded to do at this point in time, and, therefore, the sale of Wilbur Ross's shares will inevitably result in a delay in the State's disposal of its shareholding in Bank of Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_704"> What is the Minister for Finance's position as shareholder in Bank of Ireland on behalf of Irish taxpayers in terms of the disposal or retention of that shareholding for a period of time? In the context of the Government's efforts to secure retroactive bank recapitalisation, what is the position in regard to our shareholding in Bank of Ireland and also in regard to AIB? Is the Minister actively pursuing the option of disposing of some of our shares to the European Stability Mechanism, for example, in order for it to hold those shares and to have the result of essentially reimbursing Irish taxpayers in full or in part for the investment that was made in the Irish banks at the time the recapitalisation of those banks took place?</p>
            <p eId="para_705"> Given the very significant transaction which has taken place today - the disposal of Wilbur Ross's entire shareholding in Bank of Ireland - and despite the bank's description in 2011 of him and the other investors at that time as being long-term value investors, clearly that has not proven to be the case. His focus as an investor is on distressed assets, and he has worked the markets very well in this case and made a handsome profit.</p>
            <p eId="para_706">My focus is on the State's position in respect of our 14% shareholding, the impact of today's transaction on that and the Minister's attitude to the retention or disposal of those shares.</p>

            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Michael Noonan)<recordedTime time="2014-06-10T18:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_707">I thank the Deputy for raising the issue and for his personal good wishes to me. As the House will no doubt be aware, it was announced yesterday evening that a significant shareholder in Bank of Ireland, Wilbur Ross and Co, was selling the remaining 1.8 billion shares it held in the bank by way of a placing in the market. Subsequently, it was confirmed this morning that Mr. Ross's shares have all been sold at a price of 26.5 cent per share generating proceeds of €475 million. Mr. Ross has now sold his entire investment in the bank and will now step down from the board of Bank of Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_708"> It is worth recalling that the State secured this investment for Ireland at a time when few other investors were prepared to invest. The State has benefited from the large private sector investment in Bank of Ireland. This investment reduced the risk the taxpayer had to take on board back in 2011 to support the banking sector at what was a very difficult time for the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_709"> Ireland is now in a completely different place. Slowly but surely our reputation has been restored and Mr. Ross's investment has been followed by billions of euro worth of investment from others into Ireland, particularly in the past 12 months. There is no doubt that this investment in 2011 was a significant boost to the Irish economy and garnered investor confidence in the recovery. As a result of the billions of euro in investment secured since 2011 we have managed to remove significant risks to the Irish taxpayer.</p>
            <p eId="para_710"> The liquidation of IBRC has been very successful with 90% of the assets being sold to private investors to date. NAMA has attracted significant investment and the chairman informs me that it will have repaid 50% of its senior debt by year end - two years ahead of target. Investment interest in Irish assets remains strong, our credit rating has been upgraded by all the rating agencies. For example, we are now rated A by Standard &amp; Poor's.</p>
            <p eId="para_711"> The recovery in the bank's share price since mid 2011 has benefited the taxpayer directly in a very tangible way. The recovery enabled the State to exit its coco and preference shares in the bank at a profit while our remaining equity investment is worth €1.2 billion. As I said last December, when one includes the income received by the State for the guarantees it provided, the State has recouped a net positive cash return of over €1 billion from its overall support and investment in the bank and this is before one takes into account our remaining shares.</p>
            <p eId="para_712"> Bank of Ireland is now profitable and generating capital while I am pleased to say that our investment in AIB is also making similar progress. The State remains an important and supportive shareholder in the bank and we will manage this investment in the best interests of the taxpayer. How does this particular transaction influence our investment? It is certainly encouraging that such a significant amount of shares could be sold in the market and it fully removes the perception of an overhang from Mr. Ross. This is, after all, the third successful placing of shares in the bank in the past six months so it really demonstrates a continued very strong interest in Irish assets.</p>
            <p eId="para_713"> It also improves the depth and spread of shareholders in the bank which augurs well for when we decide to sell some or all of our stake. I note the comments from Fairfax Financial Holding's CEO, Mr. Prem Watsa, one of the other investors from the 2011 consortium, about him being a long-term shareholder in the bank. That should help minimise any short-term indigestion in the market for the shares in the coming weeks. Finally, when it comes to our remaining shares, we will bide our time and I have no current plans to start selling down our investment.</p>

            <p eId="para_714">I thank the Minister for his response. I accept that overall, the State will have made a profit on its rescue of Bank of Ireland a number of years ago. That is to be welcomed. I wish that was the case in respect of the other banks but that is certainly not the position at this point in time.</p>
            <p eId="para_715"> I will take the Minister up on his observation regarding the comments from the CEO of Fairfax Financial Holdings, Mr. Prem Watsa, about him being a long-term shareholder in the bank. I remind the Minister that Wilbur Ross said something similar about three months ago when he sold many of his shares in Bank of Ireland. He put on the record then that he had no intention whatsoever of selling the remainder of his shareholding so we must take some of these statements with a pinch of salt. These are investors who will sell at what they regard as the opportune time to maximise the return they get from their investment. It is the Minister's job as the guardian of taxpayers to ensure we are getting the best return as a state for our investment in Bank of Ireland. I accept his statement that we will bide our time. I would interpret that to mean that there will certainly be no short-term sale of the State's shareholding in Bank of Ireland. </p>
            <p eId="para_716"> I expect that it would certainly not be in advance of the ECB stress tests which will take place over the next number of months but I would like the Minister to comment on the ongoing efforts by the Government to secure retroactive recapitalisation of the banks. The Minister is pursuing that at European level with his colleagues on Ecofin. Where does that negotiation effort sit alongside the Minister's decision-making strategy concerning Bank of Ireland and the other banks? We want to ensure that the Minister is getting the best return possible for the shares we currently hold in the banks but we also want to ensure that our European partners step up to the mark and fulfil their responsibilities relating to the two year old commitment in respect of the separation of banking debt from sovereign debt. </p>

            <p eId="para_717">Investors buy shares to make money. They do so to avail of a dividend or, alternatively, capital gains. With distressed assets, investors usually go in for the capital gains that may accrue. It is worth pointing out that the purchasers of the shares this morning are also private investors so there is no diminution of the private investor share. It has just moved from one single investor to a number of private investors who paid what they thought was value in the market at 26.5 cent per share. One can debate whether or not 10 cent was a very low price on offer in the first instance but it went from 10 cent on the open market to 8 cent and stayed there for about six months. At one period, it traded at 7 cent. If anybody is very wise in retrospect, they should have been wise at the time, bought the shares at 8 cent and made even more than Mr. Ross made on the transaction.</p>
            <p eId="para_718"> In talking about retrospect capitalisation, the Deputy is really stitching a major issue on to the tail end of a debate on a Topical Issue. If he raises it in the next round of finance questions, we could have a full discussion on it but we do not really have time to do this issue justice today. It is still being pursued.</p>

        <speech by="#CharlesFlanagan" as="#Minister_for_Children_and_Youth_Affairs" eId="spk_334">
          <from>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs (Deputy Charles Flanagan)<recordedTime time="2014-06-10T18:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_719">I welcome the opportunity given by the House for statements on mother and baby homes in the Dáil tonight and I thank my colleagues on all sides of the House for facilitating these statements. I would like to begin by acknowledging the Irish women who were in mother and baby homes in this country in the last century and the children that they bore while in those institutions. Their personal stories are harrowing. The legacy of past cruelties continues to make itself felt. Indeed in recent days in the media, we have heard from women who spent time in mother and baby homes and from some of the children who came into the world in those institutions. Many of those affected want their stories told. Others may wish to have privacy and we must be respectful of that choice.</p>
          <p eId="para_720"> I am appealing to those within and outside Leinster House to be sensitive in their choice of language when referring to these matters. Thanks to the patient research of Catherine Corless, we know that 796 children died in the mother and baby home run by the Sisters of Bon Secours in Tuam during the period from 1925 to 1961.</p>
          <p eId="para_721"> Each one of those 796 children was an individual, a citizen, a son or daughter. The matters under consideration concern real people and I appeal for this fact to be borne in mind. We are dealing with personal histories in this regard and it is not the time for sensationalism.</p>
          <p eId="para_722"> Equally, insensitive language has been used in the rush to cast blame. Undoubtedly, many individuals are culpable for the cruelties of the past but I want to acknowledge the reality that Irish society as a whole colluded in maintaining the regime of mother and baby homes. If we are to face up the truth of our past as a nation, and I strongly believe that we must, then we must resist temptation to simplify our history.</p>
          <p eId="para_723"> The revelations about the Tuam mother and baby home, in particular in the context of the questions raised over the way in which burials were conducted and the high rates of child and infant mortality, brought to public attention a dark aspect of our history in terms of how single mothers were treated in the not too distant past. Members on all sides of the House and the wider public were absolutely appalled by the reports emanating from Tuam. It was immediately apparent, however, that the Tuam home could not be considered in isolation. Over the past few days, there has been a growing appreciation of the complexity of the matters that fall to be examined. Infant mortality and burial arrangements are but two aspects of the difficult range of matters to be considered in the context of mother and baby homes. I would like the commission of investigation to consider matters beyond child and infant mortality and burial. Questions remain unanswered about the nature of adoptions and vaccine trials. Significant legal difficulties have been identified in seeking answers to these questions in the past and it is my intention that the commission of investigation can make progress where past investigations have failed.</p>
          <p eId="para_724"> It is my considered view that we owe it to the women who were in mother and baby homes and the children born to them in those institutions to take a reasoned, professional approach to ensure we move with a sense of urgency without failing to appreciate the breadth of issues that need to be considered in the context of the forthcoming investigation. That is why, as an initial step, I established a group comprising senior officials across a range of Departments to gather information and report to Cabinet on the means by which this complex, disturbing and tragic situation can be best addressed. Having received a preliminary update from the group, the Cabinet agreed earlier to establish a commission of investigation with statutory powers to investigate mother and baby homes. The work of the interdepartmental group will continue no later than 30 June and its completed work will inform the Government's decisions on the terms of reference and composition of the commission. The interdepartmental group will complete its work before the end of the month. A huge volume of records, data and information exists and the group is endeavouring to identify where that information is stored. Along with the eight key Departments involved, the National Archives is represented on the group, as is the Office of Public Works. To date, Archbishop Diarmuid Martin, Archbishop Neary, Bishop Buckley of Cork and Archbishop Michael Jackson have all expressed support for an investigation into mother and baby homes. I very much welcome the support expressed and I call on all church leaders to fully co-operate and to lend their unqualified practical support to the commission of inquiry.</p>
          <p eId="para_725"> Excellent work has been carried out by a number of historians to get to the truth of the history of mother and baby homes in our State. I commend Ms Catherine Corless, in particular, for her patient work in researching the Tuam home. She has been an eloquent advocate for the children who died there over a 40-year period.</p>
          <p eId="para_726"> Today's Government decision to establish a commission of investigation underlines the seriousness of our approach to these matters. Since coming into power, the Government has shown its willingness to confront and shine a light into the dark aspects of our recent social history. A commission of investigation offers a reasonably efficient approach to matters of urgent public concern. Under the Commission of Investigations Act 2004, a commission has the power to conduct its investigation in any manner it considers appropriate within the parameters of the legislation. It must seek and facilitate the voluntary co-operation of people whose evidence it requires. It is entitled to compel witnesses to give evidence and it can direct a person to provide it with any documents in the person's possession or power relating to the matter under investigation. If a person fails to comply, the commission can apply to the court to compel compliance or it may impose a costs order against the individual for the costs incurred by all other parties arising from the delay.</p>
          <p eId="para_727"> It is also of significance that the approval of the order establishing a commission must be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas and, in this context, I welcome the support of colleagues on all sides in regard to the Government's commitment to investigate matters relating to mother and baby homes. I thank members of the Opposition who responded positively to my invitation to meet today in respect of these matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_728"> The terms of reference of the commission of investigation have yet to be established but work is under way in that regard. I would welcome further engagement on all sides of the House in progressing these matters. I very much welcome the growing national consensus in politics, in the churches and among the public that it is essential that we as a people do not shy away from our past. As well as implementing transparency in governance as we move forward, we must seek to bring transparency and openness to the actions of the past. I believe today's Government agreement to establish a commission of investigation presents an historic opportunity for our country to take a united approach in our commitment to dealing with one of the most tragic and traumatic chapters in modern Irish history.</p>

          <from>Deputy Robert Troy<recordedTime time="2014-06-10T18:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_729">I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute on this important issue. I would like to acknowledge the hard and persistent work of Ms Catherine Corless, who was determined to get to the bottom of the facts by accessing archived materials in order that the mothers and babies of Tuam could be remembered correctly. Considerable work has also been done by historians in colleges across the country on the history of mother and baby homes not only in Ireland but across Europe. None of this work should be ignored.</p>
          <p eId="para_730"> This is a sensitive and complex issue and should be discussed in a calm and considered manner. Some of the sensationalist coverage over the past ten days has not helped the people affected by mother and baby homes. It is not for the first time, unfortunately, that we, as Oireachtas Members, and society in general find ourselves discussing the need to investigate an extremely dark period in the history of our State. Recent coverage has reminded us how religious institutions, the State, families and society in general grossly failed these women and their babies since the foundation of the State. Single women who became pregnant were shunned, shamed and stigmatised. It is a fact that society treated them appallingly and the State facilitated this treatment by providing the mother and baby homes. There were homes for "first offenders" - women who were pregnant for the first time. Their babies, if they were lucky enough to survive, were taken from them forcefully or otherwise put up for adoption in Ireland or, worse still, abroad in the UK and the US.</p>
          <p eId="para_731"> People will be familiar with the film "Philomena", which outlines one person's story of her experience in Roscrea. By the time Philomena Lee secured access to her son's records, he had died and, therefore, she never met him. Ironically, she is one of the lucky ones, as many thousands of mothers still have no access to records of where their daughters or sons are.</p>
          <p eId="para_732"> Media reports last week that up to 796 babies may have died at the Tuam mother and baby home and been buried in a mass grave reignited a public debate into how mother and baby homes throughout the country were run. We have also read reports published by advocacy groups such as Adoption Rights Now, which highlighted the gross, barbaric and inhumane treatment of women and their children in these institutions. Heavily pregnant women carried out manual labour such as sowing potatoes, and scrubbing concrete floors on their hands and knees with a toothbrush. We learned how women were denied painkillers during birth, as this was seen as a way to atone for giving birth outside marriage, and how babies with disabilities were neglected.</p>
          <p eId="para_733">Books have been written and last night RTE reran a documentary that was first aired in 2011 dealing with how innocent babies were used for vaccine trials and, indeed, how in the period 1940-65, 401 infant bodies were used for dissection in the interests of medical research.</p>
          <p eId="para_734"> Unfortunately, this news is not new. While independent investigation is necessary to establish the true facts of what happened over many decades one thing is patently clear - we as a State failed in our duty to protect these women who only got pregnant but were treated as outcasts by society. I believe the Taoiseach should offer a full apology on behalf of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_735"> This is a very complex and multi-layered issue. There has been little debate on the role of the fathers. They were treated very differently by society at the time. There was no requirement in law to put the father's name on the birth certificate. This was totally unfair on the women and the babies. No doubt there are some fathers tonight wondering whether their sons and daughters are alive. The truth is that this was just as much a societal issue of the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_736"> International media reports over the past week have once again put Ireland in the spotlight for wrong reasons. The eyes of the world are now on Ireland, and how we as a society will deal with this issue will indicate how we should be judged internationally. I initially called for a full independent investigation to ensure that the full facts could be gathered and the truth of how these homes were run would be made known. We owe it to the women and it is the very least they deserve. I welcome the establishment of the independent inquiry but I note that the Government intends to complete the scoping exercise that was commenced last week by the cross-departmental group set up by the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan. This is expected to be completed by the end of June, after which there will be discussions on the scope, format and terms of reference of the commission of investigation.</p>
          <p eId="para_737"> We must establish the truth based on the facts. The last thing the women need or deserve is the sensationalising of what they have already lived through at the hands of their families, society, the State and religious institutions. These women have been wronged and they must have full confidence that if they wish to come forward, they can be assured of compassion, sensitivity and confidentiality and that nobody will be judging them. All of this coverage is undoubtedly reigniting feelings which may have been suppressed. I ask that a helpline be set up for persons who have queries. Counselling services should also be made available to those who require them.</p>
          <p eId="para_738"> I welcome the cross-party approach of the Minister. This is, after all, above party politics. I welcome that Archbishop Martin and other bishops have come forward in support of this investigation and I hope all the religious will support it. The investigation must examine all elements of what took place in these institutions and how we as a society allowed it to take place. The following issues must be examined: the unexplained high mortality rates, which were 40% to 50% higher inside these homes than among the general population; the appalling treatment of women and children which I mentioned earlier; the burial practices - in my constituency of Westmeath there are between 300 and 500 bodies buried at the home in Castlepollard but we cannot even identify the precise number of babies buried there; how children were used as guinea pigs in the trials of vaccines; how infant bodies were dissected for medical research; how babies were taken from their mothers so they could be illegally and forcibly adopted.</p>
          <p eId="para_739"> While we cannot rewrite history, this investigation, if properly framed with the right terms of reference, will have the opportunity to ensure we have an independent, transparent and factual record of what happened at these homes. I welcome the Minister's commitment again this evening that there will be future engagement with the Opposition and with interested groups. We must ensure that appropriate records are maintained for all time into the future and that all records will be sorted in chronological order, digitised and made available to persons who came through these homes and wish to find their identity. There are approximately 45,000 people who are unable to find their true identity. Only last month I met a mother and son and even though both parties consented to their records being made available, those records could not be made available. The availability of records would be something positive to emerge from a very shameful period of our past.</p>
          <p eId="para_740"> I look forward to working with the Minister in a constructive manner to ensure this sorry saga is brought to a satisfactory conclusion.</p>

          <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin<recordedTime time="2014-06-10T18:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_741">I am sharing time with Deputy McDonald.</p>
          <p eId="para_742"> I welcome the Government's announcement earlier today and we await the full details on the terms of reference of the statutory commission of investigation announced by the Minister and discussed in the House this afternoon by the Taoiseach. It is a dreadful fact that women and children placed by the State under the so-called care of religious orders and other church institutions in this country between the 1920s and 1970s were treated as outcasts and non-people. We have also been exposed to the dreadful fact that these institutions were effectively places of imprisonment for pregnant women, with many facing the loss of their child through forced adoptions, including the sale of babies by these religious orders, particularly to wealthy Irish-American families. However, the latest revelations from Tuam have highlighted more horrifying aspects of the regimes in these mother and baby homes and they demand immediate action to uncover the full truth. Foremost in our thoughts should be the surviving mothers who endured what was, in reality, their incarceration in these institutions and the surviving adopted children who wish to find out the truth about the identity of their parents, siblings and wider families, if they have any.</p>
          <p eId="para_743"> Great credit is due to an ordinary Irish citizen, Catherine Corless, who painstakingly researched the Bon Secours mother and baby home in her native town of Tuam, County Galway. She has pursued this for the past number of years and in 2013 her research revealed the scale of children's deaths and burials at the home. Between 1925 and 1961, 796 children died in the Bon Secours mother and baby home. Their names are recorded and were accessed by Catherine Corless in the births and deaths registry in Galway. What has brought this story to national and international attention is the manner of the children's burial - anonymously, without any type of individual identification or markers and apparently in a mass grave. It has caused widespread revulsion and has re-opened and highlighted anew the scandal of mother and baby homes in this State.</p>
          <p eId="para_744"> We know from the research so far that 796 children died in Tuam between 1925 and 1961. In 1933, of 120 admissions to Tuam, 42 babies died. That is a shocking 35% mortality rate. The rate in Bessborough was 39%, in Sean Ross Abbey in Roscrea it was 37.5% and in Pelletstown in Dublin it was 34%.</p>
          <p eId="para_745">At one stage, the death rate at Bessborough reached 61%. Between 1922 and 1949, 219 children died in the Protestant-run Bethany Home in Dublin. Of these, 175 were aged between four weeks and two years. A further 25 were aged from a number of hours up to four weeks and 19 were stillborn. Cemetery records indicate that the causes of death included 54 from convulsions, 41 from heart failure, 26 from starvation and seven from pneumonia. These are shocking facts and I have no doubt that the commission of inquiry to be established will bring forward even more shocking facts. As a people, we must face up to that. We must face up to the wrongs of the past and the reasons these dreadful things happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_746"> I conclude my contribution to these statements, which will be followed shortly by the substantive debate that will focus on the key arguments for action incorporated in Sinn Féin's Private Members' motion, by adding my voice to the Minister's appeal to all who have relevant information, documentation or memories of these dreadful years in these institutions that would assist the commission of inquiry in the carrying out of its remit to co-operate fully, come forward and share what they have and what they know. I emphasise that this must be a process that will definitively address the terrible years, experiences and great wrongs that have been done to all the women and children who have suffered so much in these dreadful places.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald<recordedTime time="2014-06-10T18:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_747">A number of weeks ago during April, we gathered in Mount Jerome Cemetery to unveil a memorial stone to the 219 children who had died in the Bethany Home in Rathgar. The level of distress experienced by survivors and their families at that gathering was something to behold. At that stage, the Government and the State had adopted the position that there would be no dealing with mother and baby homes and what had occurred in them. I welcome very much the fact that the position has changed. I recognise that it has changed largely because of the widespread outcry in respect of the revelations regarding the Tuam mother and baby home and the mass burial site there. That reaction of horror is entirely understandable. The reaction of shock and even disbelief is entirely understandable. However, it is important to state that this information is not entirely new. It may be new to vast sections of the general public but it is not new information to the State or its agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_748"> Religious institutions and organisations and the churches undoubtedly have a case to answer in respect of the mother and baby homes and other relevant institutions. Undoubtedly, the social norms of Ireland in past decades must be scrutinised and collectively we have questions to answer. However, when one pares it all back, this is really about the State's responsibility to each and every citizen, to those women who found themselves in those institutions and to those children who were born and in some cases died in them. Many of the children were fostered out or adopted from them. We rely in the final instance on the State to be a bulwark against warped social values or perverse practices within any privately run institution. The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, must bear in mind that the State had an obligation to regulate and inspect these very institutions in which we now know such cruel abuse occurred.</p>
          <p eId="para_749"> Speaking earlier today, the Taoiseach said the inquiry is all about the kind of Ireland that was. He has a point. However, it is equally important to state that the manner of the investigation will tell us everything about the kind of Ireland we live in now and the value we place on women and children. I welcome the fact that the commission of investigation will have full statutory powers to compel witnesses and papers. I presume those powers will extend to access to potential burial sites, some of which are in private hands. I understand the full scope of the inquiry must be thought out and itemised precisely. The central issues around the care regime or lack thereof, the infant and child mortality rates, the vaccination trials and the practices around adoption are clear issues to be addressed. There are some more.</p>
          <p eId="para_750"> I understand that the scope of the inquiry equally needs to be clarified. Just as the mother and baby homes need to be examined, so too do other institutions that were in part or in whole State funded and State regulated. They should be included in the mix. I refer for instance to the Westbank home in Greystones which only closed in 1998. That had a very clear relationship with Bethany Home in Rathgar. I refer to the Protestant Magdalen homes which have never been subjected to any public scrutiny or examination and have been excluded from any form of inquiry or redress. I refer again to the Magdalen laundries because there was huge interplay between the Magdalen laundries and the mother and baby homes. One cannot carry out anything that pretends to be a comprehensive and objective examination of those institutions without returning to the issues in the Magdalen laundries. The McAleese process was imperfect to say the least. We must now compensate for that fact in the course of this commission of investigation.</p>
          <p eId="para_751"> We have a chance now to get it right and there is an expectation on the part of survivors, their families and the broader society that we will do so. I urge the Minister to work with the Opposition benches here and, more importantly, to have a listening ear to all of those campaigning groups across the country who for many years have been telling their stories. They learned today that perhaps they will be fully heard and vindicated. I hope that nobody here in the Dáil will disappoint them.</p>

          <p eId="para_752">I wish to share time with Deputies Daly and Coppinger.</p>
          <p eId="para_753"> I welcome the Government's decision to establish a statutory commission of investigation into mother and baby homes. Such an inquiry is long overdue. That hundreds of children are buried in unmarked graves is not news. The fact of how mothers and babies were treated is not new. I wonder how the public who have known about it for so long feel about the politicians' wringing of hands now.</p>
          <p eId="para_754"> The Taoiseach told us that this was Ireland of the 1920s and 1960s, but I have a story from the 1980s, when the Taoiseach was already a Member of the Dáil. When my sister Mary was 19 she got pregnant. She went to a social worker here in Dublin and told her she was considering adoption as she was struggling with the idea of raising the child. She was put in contact by the social worker with CURA, a Catholic agency. After seven months, she decided she did not want to part with the child and would keep it. She returned to the social worker and told her. The social worker told her she was mad, ignorant and was putting the baby at risk. She was made cry before she left the room. She had her baby in Holles Street and five hours later there was a nun at the bedside with a form and a pen, pressuring her into signing. My sister did not give in. If she had, she might never have seen her daughter again. That was not the 1960s, it was the 1980s.</p>
          <p eId="para_755"> How do we treat our most vulnerable today?</p>
          <p eId="para_756">Are we proud of how we treat the 4,000 people in direct provision? Are we proud of how we export 4,000 young women each year to terminate pregnancies abroad? Are we proud of how we treated single mothers, those who find the strength to raise their children alone? In April 2012, the Minister for Social Protection announced that she would not proceed with changes to the one-parent family payment unless a credible and bankable commitment to a Scandinavian-style child care system had been put in place. There was no new child care system but the reforms went ahead. Are we proud of how we treat our Traveller children? Some of them are now on the PULSE system while still infants. Have we treated them any better than the Aborigines were treated in Australia? Have we treated them any better than the American Indian was treated in North America?</p>
          <p eId="para_757"> Last week, the Minister for Health was quoted as saying: "This is a nation that stands on its own two feet and we will protect our children". The new Minister for Children and Youth Affairs feigned shock at the Tuam story, telling the media that it happened at a time when our children were not cherished as they should have been. This is not news. We have known about this. We play games and perform for the public. They are shocked because some of them have never heard it before, so we are shocked, but we are not shocked really because we knew about it. How much has changed? To what extent do we treat our children differently today compared with then?</p>

        <speech by="#ClareDaly" eId="spk_339">
          <from>Deputy Clare Daly<recordedTime time="2014-06-10T19:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_758">There is no doubt this is an incredibly painful discussion for many people. The horrors of Tuam have opened up wounds. All Members received correspondence from the American wife of a man forcibly adopted from an institution in Ireland to America. He has been searching for his mother for a lifetime. A man in Galway talked about bringing his grandmother to a field where the bodies of her dead twins were buried in a shoebox because an infant who died at birth could not be buried in consecrated ground. This has brought many scars to the surface. I am torn between two reactions. On one hand, I have an almighty sense of relief on behalf of the campaigners for adoption rights in the Adoption Rights Alliance, who crusaded in the wilderness for years and tried to get a hearing on these issues. I welcome that the crimes done to women and children in these institutions are being recognised as crimes. People have campaigned for it for a long time. On the other hand, I find it nauseating to see the hand-wringing of the Taoiseach and hear the talk of shock over the past few weeks. The only shock is that it has taken our society so long to address it. A full report was submitted to the Department last year by the survivors of Sean Ross Abbey, which documented some of the horrors now in the public domain. Hundreds of children were buried there, unmarked and unrecognised. From visits to Tuam made by the health service in the 1940s, we know that it talked about children who were potbellied, fragile, emaciated and with high mortality rates. The State knew about these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_759"> In 2002, Brian Lenihan introduced a report by the Department of Health looking at records in institutions. The records are of full archive standard and deal in many instances with mother and baby homes. There was information showing that the Legion of Mary had sought State funding while there were high levels of infant mortality in some of the institutions it dealt with. The information is not new and we can feign shock all we like. There is no doubt the public is genuinely shocked, but what happens next will be decisive. No woman ever left a mother and baby home with a baby. The baby either died in poor circumstances or was given up for adoption, illegally in most instances. It was forced from the woman without the appropriate documentation or support. The issue of survivors and their access to adoption records has now come centre stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_760"> The Minister will be judged on how the commission of inquiry conducts itself. I am glad that we have one, but it should be conducted outside the State and be fully independent, because we all know the State was responsible for funding many of these organisations and was very happy to allow the Catholic Church to take our young women, hide them behind grey walls, exploit them and discard them and their children to save society the bother of having to deal with them. It must be addressed. The Magdalen issue also needs to be addressed, because the mother and baby homes were a tunnel through which people ended up in Magdalen homes. A full apology, in the style of the apology by the Australian Government, is necessary. I welcome that this is out in the public domain and I hope the inquiry will be genuinely independent. It is what people need.</p>

          <from>Deputy Ruth M. Coppinger<recordedTime time="2014-06-10T19:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_761">I would like to divide my time between the past and the present in respect of how mothers and babies are treated. I fully support a full investigation, which must deal with all of the homes, with all records handed over. Major issues are at stake and I wonder whether the Government and the Fianna Fáil benches will take some time to think about these issues. How did it happen that women and children born outside wedlock were treated so badly and, effectively, tortured? How did such a weak and poverty-ridden State lean on the Catholic Church for support and legitimacy, and how come it tied the morals of the church into the State and the Constitution, with the resultant horror for women and children? Then, as now, the State was made up of the same political parties, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Labour Party, that have alternated power for the past number of years. The State, not just the church, is equally culpable. The State was responsible for these women and children.</p>
          <p eId="para_762"> The Taoiseach said it was an abomination that women were treated like that in what he termed the old days. I ask the Minister to turn his attention to lone parents and children today. Who is most affected by the hammer blow of austerity dealt by this Government and the previous Government? The answer is lone parents. No other group in society is more likely, or guaranteed, to live in poverty than that group. Who is most affected by the decision of this Government and the previous Government not to build council housing? Mothers and babies, particularly single parents, are directly affected by the State's neglect in privatising the housing system. Today, mothers and babies are not shunned and hidden away, but I put it to the Minister that the current epidemic of homelessness is making victims of mothers and babies, particularly single mothers and their babies, which is resulting in serious mental and physical health problems for the women and their children. They are being affected by cuts in child benefit, rent allowance and a host of supports that allow them to make a life for themselves and for their families. I ask the Minister to note that the State is continuing to privatise the care of all vulnerable groups in society and in many cases, to private religious denominations. Will that be investigated by the commission?</p>
          <p eId="para_763"> The crime and shame of direct provision for asylum seekers has also been mentioned. This effectively guarantees that people live in a nightmare of torture.</p>
          <p eId="para_764"> I also point out to the Minister that it was not so long ago that the ranks of the Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil backbenches revolted over the idea of allowing women autonomy over their own bodies when pregnant. That did not happen a million years ago; it was very recent. The right to life does not end at birth. I hope that is noted by Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and those who denied women that autonomy in legislation arising from the X case.</p>

These are matters of some complexity and of great sensitivity, but we will not shy away from our responsibilities in this regard. We must face up to our past, but we must do so in a considered way. I intend to ensure that the interdepartmental group completes its work on schedule, before the end of June, so that we can progress the establishment of the commission of investigation. I look forward to continued engagement with colleagues from all sides of the House in this regard. I repeat my call to church leaders and churches to co-operate fully with the investigation that will take place shortly. The women who spent time in mother and baby homes and the children born to them will be to the forefront of our minds as we progress this issue with firm resolve and unity of purpose.</p>

          <p eId="para_769">I move amendment No. 1:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_770"> In page 13, to delete lines 11 to 13.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">This amendment seeks to delete lines 11 to 13 on page 13, which state:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_772">The assigning of an individual health identifier to an individual shall not be regarded in any way as indicating, in and of itself, an entitlement to, or eligibility for, the provision of a health service to the individual.</p>
          <p eId="para_773">We discussed my position on this on Committee Stage and the Minister is familiar with my views on the matter. My view is not just in reaction to the fact that this particular section - section 5(3), in Part 2 of the Bill - presents, but also has a historic root in, the former Government's commitment - with a small "c" - over many years to introduce legislation that would affirm the individual's right and entitlement to health and personal social services. I am speaking of a Bill that both the Minister and I referred to on many occasions when we shared the Opposition benches, the eligibility for health and personal social services Bill. This Bill was repeatedly promised year after year and appeared on the Government's programme for legislation, but it was never presented and eventually fell off the table entirely.</p>
          <p eId="para_774"> It is not that I take the view that an individual health identification number asserts particular rights of access or entitlement, but I am concerned by the fact that we have, in such a bald and bold way, stated in this legislation that it does not confirm entitlement to or eligibility for personal or any other services that would come under the HSE or the Department of Health's remit. Therefore, I believe this particular subsection should be removed. The introduction of individual health identifier numbers has a particular purpose - one that I support - and I have indicated to the Minister that I will not oppose the passage of the legislation. However, I feel this is a negative position to take, against the backdrop of all we argued for previously.</p>
          <p eId="para_775"> I believe we have a shared view that there is universal entitlement, and we want to get to a point at which the individual will be able to assert that entitlement and eligibility. This is something we are working towards, albeit with a different formula for its introduction. I appeal to the Minister to recognise that we are working to a shared end, consider my amendment and agree to the removal of this subsection.</p>

          <p eId="para_776">I thank Deputy Ó Caoláin. I recall his moving this amendment on Committee Stage and I recall saying that we might reflect on it. I know he is hoping for a different answer from the one I gave him then, but I have had time to reflect and am sure he will be neither surprised nor disappointed if I give the same answer again, particularly as he has indicated that he accepts the reason that the provision he seeks to delete is in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_777"> The purpose of the Health Identifiers Bill is to put in place an enabling legislative framework for a system of unique health identifiers for individuals and health service providers. The Bill is a patient safety identification initiative, not a measure to confirm rights or entitlements. Eligibility for health services is a wholly separate issue and is provided for in other legislation. Any requirement to confirm eligibility for services before issuing an individual health identifier could delay the process and, therefore, have patient safety implications. The deletion of the words sought by the amendment could send the wrong signal about the purpose of the Bill. Therefore, I do not intend to accept the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_778">I acknowledge I am not surprised. Nevertheless, it is important that the points I have made are taken on board. I am anxious that we get to a position in which people's entitlement to and eligibility for health services is affirmed. This is something that is not currently confirmed in the Constitution nor in any legislation of which I am aware, which is a major failure on the part of legislators.</p>
          <p eId="para_779"> I believe the statement in the Bill, which so negatively states that it does not accord entitlement to or eligibility for services, is unnecessary when the purpose of the individual health identifier is already well explained within the body of the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">I believe subsection 5(3) is an unnecessary and regrettable inclusion, taking as it does a most negative position with regard to people's entitlement to and eligibility for health services. I can do no more at this point in time than record the fact that I do not support the inclusion of subsection 5(3) in the legislation as now presented on Report Stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_783">I move amendment No. 2:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_784">In page 13, to delete lines 14 to 18 and substitute the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_785">“(4) (a) The Minister shall put in place measures to ensure that an individual’s individual health identifier will be made known to him or her as of right (or, in the case of a deceased individual, to be made known to the individual’s personal representative).”.</p>
          <p eId="para_786">This amendment seeks to change the text of subsection 5(4)(a), which currently states: "The Minister may put in place measures...". I have not held to the exact same words, but the critical change is that the word "shall" replaces the word "may". The Minister's text states that the Minister "may" put in place measures to assist in enabling an individual's health identifier to be made known to him or her. I am very much of the view that the Minister should do this in any event. Again, on Committee Stage the Minister argued that it is not an essential requirement and that there would be cost implications. I am speaking here for many citizens when I say that with the allocation of an individual health identifier number, many of us would like to know exactly what that number is and what it references.</p>
          <p eId="para_787"> We know from the exchanges we had on Committee Stage that it does not allow for access to clinical detail relating to an individual's historical health circumstances. However, it is important information. It is data held on each and every one of us. I would certainly like to know my IHI number, as I know my PPS number and many other numbers relevant to my life. The Minister is not committing to sharing that information.</p>
          <p eId="para_788"> The Bill only provides that he or she "may" do so, as the case might be. I believe it is an important right of the individual and the citizen to know his or her health identifier number. I can imagine a myriad of circumstances in which knowing that number would be advantageous or helpful and could be of importance healthwise, if not live-saving. Again, I put the case to the Minister that the amendment seeking to change lines 14 to 18 through the substitution I have presented would be not only an improvement but a welcome one that many would understand and support.</p>

          <p eId="para_789">I have considered the matter further since the Deputy moved this amendment on Committee Stage but I have not changed my mind. However, I hope I can clarify how the identifier system will work to greatest effect without the need for people to know their IHI unless they want to. I think that is the Deputy's principal concern, and I am confirming here that the identifiers will be accessible to those who wish to know them. There is no issue in that regard. The Bill already provides in section 5 that the Minister may put in place measures that he or she considers appropriate to assist in enabling an individual to have his or her IHI made known to him or her. It is not intended to systematically notify the population at large, individually and directly, of their IHI for several reasons. A mailing campaign to provide all citizens with their IHI would be costly, with no obvious offsetting benefit, given the way the identifier system will work. Such a campaign would include advising many citizens of a number for which they might not have a use for many years. It would also introduce unnecessary risks to privacy and the risk of identity theft, for example, due to the delivery of IHI numbers to out-of-date addresses and so forth. It is the intention that a major public information exercise will be undertaken at the appropriate time when the implementation process is advanced to advise both providers and patients about the introduction of the IHI, how the identifier system will work, the benefits of the system and how the IHIs will be assigned and managed. It will also make clear that anyone who wants to know his or her IHI can seek it from the HSE but will not need to provide it when accessing health care. That is an important point which we covered on Committee Stage. Not having or knowing one's IHI will not prevent one from receiving a service, should that be necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_790"> It should be clear, therefore, that there is no intention in any way to discourage or prevent interested citizens from being advised of their IHI. If there are difficulties, the Minister can invoke section 5(4)(<i>a</i>) to put in place measures to make people aware of their IHI and deal with the specifics of any problem. I will not be accepting the Deputy's amendment for the reasons outlined.</p>

          <p eId="para_791">The Minister's argument broadly relies on possible identity theft and other matters, many of which could apply to any of the other situations where citizens have numbers within the system - I have already made reference to the PPS number, and there are numerous other examples one could cite. I do not know that it is beyond the Minister's capacity to find a way to provide the IHI number to citizens without running the risk or risks to which he refers. I am sure there are vehicles by which that could be put in train - through the GP network, for example, or any number of other means. These numbers may very well be, in terms of the outworking of this legislation, already to hand. It is about having a willingness to find a means to do it. Now the responsibility lies with the individual, who must be proactive if he or she wishes to secure his or her number. I was not ruling that out entirely, but the entitlement is there and I believe the Minister could identify measures by which this could be done. I hold the view that this is a right and am surprised that under data protection legislation we are not entitled to this information in any event. I take the view that we are entitled to it because the number relates to us as individuals. We are clearly not going to agree. The Minister believes it is a "may" and I believe it is a "shall". I wish to press my amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_796">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_797">That Dáil Éireann:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_798">acknowledges the scandal that occurred at the Bon Secours Sisters institution in Tuam, County Galway, where almost 800 children died while in the ‘care’ of a religious order, in a State regulated institution, and were placed in a mass unmarked grave over a period of five decades, from the 1920s to the 1960s;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_799">notes the Government’s intention to give early consideration on the best course of action to take into investigating the deaths of these children and the appalling manner of their interment;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_800">recognises that the abusive practices which occurred at the Bon Secours Sisters mother and baby ‘care’ home were not unique to that one institution and were replicated in similar institutions across the State including what occurred at Bethany Home; and</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_801">calls on the Government to:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_802">— immediately initiate a fully independent judicial inquiry, with terms of reference agreed by the Houses of the Oireachtas, into this latest shameful episode involving a religious order and the failure of the State in its duty of care to its most vulnerable and defenceless citizens; the inquiry to consider the so-called ‘care’ regime in place, the infant mortality rates and the burial of children in unmarked graves at all mother and baby homes in the State; and</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_803">— set a date for the establishment of this inquiry before the Dáil summer recess and all of the report’s findings be published.</p>
          <p eId="para_804">Molaim an rún in ainm Theachtaí Dála Shinn Féin. I move the motion in the name of the Sinn Féin Deputies.</p>
          <p eId="para_805"> I want to avail of the opportunity to urge all Deputies to support the motion. We moved quickly to table this motion when it became clear that an inquiry is absolutely necessary and must be undertaken as soon as possible. We have been of this view for many years in the context of matters of this nature. I wish to show goodwill towards the Government in the context of its announcement earlier today that it is to establish a statutory commission of investigation. We await the full details and terms of reference relating to said commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_806"> We have known for a long time that women and children placed by the State in the so-called care of religious orders and other church institutions in the five decades from the 1920s to the 1970s were treated as the outcasts of society and as non-people. We have seen fully revealed the horrors of the industrial schools for boys and young men and of the Magdalen laundries for girls and young women. We know something of the regime endured by young mothers and children in mother and baby homes, which included the effective imprisonment of pregnant women, forced adoptions and the sale of babies by religious orders to wealthy Irish-American families. The most recent revelations in respect of Tuam have, as I said during the statements taken earlier this evening, highlighted more of the horrifying aspects of the regimes which obtained in mother and baby homes. Immediate action is required in order to uncover the full truth. Foremost in our thoughts should be the surviving mothers who endured what effectively was incarceration in the institutions to which I refer and also the surviving adopted children who wish to discover the truth about the identity of their parents, siblings and wider families.</p>
          <p eId="para_807"> As I and others noted in the statements taken earlier, great credit is due an ordinary Irish citizen, Ms Catherine Corless, who painstakingly researched the Bon Secours mother and baby home in her native town of Tuam, County Galway. Ms Corless has pursued this matter for the past number of years and in 2013 her research revealed the scale of children's deaths and burials at the Bon Secours home. Between 1925 and 1961, 796 children died at the home in question. Their names are recorded in the register of births and deaths in Galway and it was from there that they were accessed by Ms Corless.</p>
          <p eId="para_808"> What has brought this sorry story to national and international attention is the manner of the children's burial, namely, anonymously, without any kind of individual identification or markers and, apparently, in a mass grave. This has caused widespread revulsion and reopened and highlighted anew the scandal of mother and baby homes in this State. In the past week, some have suggested that what has been highlighted is nothing new. In one sense, that is correct. We knew these homes existed and that they were places of suffering for women and children. We did not know, however, the full extent of what occurred in them and nor do we know the records relating to them that might still be available or what facts may yet be revealed. The importance of this point was highlighted by the historian, Dr. Conor Mulvagh, in a comprehensive article in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> on 8 June last. Dr. Mulvagh indicated in his piece that last week he made contact with the Dublin diocesan archives and was informed that a number of files previously closed to the public are now open. Some of these files relate to mother and baby homes. Crucially, they were never examined by the teams which carried out the investigations relating to the Murphy, Ryan and McAleese reports. Careful searches will have to be conducted in respect of other records, particularly those relating to mother and baby homes outside Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_809"> One such institution was the Bessborough home in Cork city. In her 1998 book, <i>The Light in the Window</i>, Ms June Goulding, a former midwife at the home, described the horrors inflicted on women in Bessborough, including the denial of pain relief to those in labour and of proper medical attention after they had given birth. The author described a silent, prison-like regime where pregnant women and young mothers were treated like criminals. Even for a woman to cry out during childbirth was forbidden. The founder of the Bessborough Mother and Baby Support Group, Helen Murphy, was born at the home and left when she was seven months old. On Sunday last she spoke for all those directly affected by the regimes in these so-called homes when she said, "We want the truth to be known. We want justice to be done, and we want Bessborough to be included in any form of inquiry the Government is now going to order." She continued:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_810">We founded the Bessborough Mother and Baby Support Group as an outlet for all those whose lives were affected by this place. The purpose of it is to remember the people who were there, and especially the babies who died. But also to remember all of the mothers who gave birth there. We want to add our voice to the call for an inquiry into what went on at the mother and baby homes, how many babies died, and where are those babies buried. We want answers.</p>
          <p eId="para_811">The full facts and figures, or as many as can be uncovered, need to be revealed from the records and from the testimony to the statutory investigation. We know from the research so far, that 796 children died in Tuam between 1925 and 1961. In 1933, of 120 admissions to Tuam, 42 babies died, a shocking 45% mortality rate. The rate in Bessborough was 39%, at Sean Ross Abbey in Roscrea it was 37.5% and at Pelletstown in Dublin it was 34%. At one stage, the death rate at Bessborough reached 61%. Between 1922 and 1949, 219 children died in the Protestant-run Bethany Home in Dublin. Of these, 175 were aged between four weeks and two years. A further 25 were aged from a number of hours up to four weeks and 19 were stillborn. Cemetery records indicate that the causes of death included 54 from convulsions, 41 from heart failure, 26 from starvation and seven from pneumonia.</p>
          <p eId="para_812"> One of the shocking aspects of mother and baby homes that requires answers is the use of children for medical experiments. Vaccination trials were carried out on 58 children in 1960 and 1961. Those children were from the mother and baby homes at Bessborough in Cork, Castlepollard in County Westmeath, Mount Carmel industrial school in Moate, County Westmeath, Dunboyne and Stamullen in County Meath and St. Patrick's on the Navan Road in Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_813">Over a decade ago when the Government of the day tried to initiate an investigation into these trials, members of the medical profession took legal action to prevent the investigation and their appeals were upheld by the courts. It seems that professional reputations are more important in Irish law than finding out the truth about the gross violation of the rights of defenceless and voiceless children.</p>
          <p eId="para_814"> That brings us to the question of why these crimes were perpetrated and why were they allowed to happen. Following the foundation of the Free State, as it was then described, in 1922 an unholy and deeply reactionary alliance was formed between the political elite and the Catholic hierarchy. This was part of the carnival of reaction to the revolution of 1916-21. It was a denial of the democratic and egalitarian principles on which Dáil Éireann had been founded. In the democratic programme of the First Dáil, adopted on 21 January 1919, it was stated: "It shall be the first duty of the Government of the Republic to make provision for the physical, mental and spiritual well-being of the children, to secure that no child shall suffer hunger or cold from lack of food, clothing, or shelter, but that all shall be provided with the means and facilities requisite for their proper education and training as Citizens of a Free and Gaelic Ireland". It was also stated: "The Irish Republic fully realises the necessity of abolishing the present odious, degrading and foreign Poor Law System...". The Minister knows a good deal about history. As he is aware, the poor law system treated the poor like burdens on the local community. Rather than provide social welfare support to them, it imprisoned them in poorhouses and workhouses. In the Free State the poor law system was replaced but not by the social support envisaged by the democratic programme. Many workhouses were converted to institutions run by religious orders and these became the prisons of those regarded as the outcasts and non-people of Irish society. The most scorned among these were women who became pregnant outside marriage. Let us remember that these women had not broken any law of the State. They had, supposedly, in the minds of those who held to that view, violated the moral code of the churches, Catholic and Protestant, and breached the perceived norms of Irish society of the day. The State was content to see the churches punish them in this way and, in so doing, failed disastrously in its duty of care not only to the woman concerned but also to the children of the nation as a whole.</p>
          <p eId="para_815"> There have been attempts to place the blame on wider Irish society dating back some time and again in recent days because of the deeply conservative social attitudes that dominated in those decades. It should be acknowledged that the social attitudes of the times were disdainful of great numbers of people and cast them out of society. However, this can too easily be twisted into a view that since everyone was to blame, no one was to blame. In turn, this allows the powerful in Irish society to evade accountability and responsibility once again. The reality was that there were powerful social and economic forces, powerful men of church and State, who ruled this society and ensured women, children, the poor and the marginalised were kept in their place or what those same powerful men decided was their place. Much has changed for the better but much has yet to change. Earlier this evening the Joint Committee on Health and Children heard a report from the Ombudsman for Children. Before concluding I will cite part of it. In the investigation the Ombudsman for Children found a lack of consistency across many areas of the country in how the reporting of child abuse, including physical, sexual and emotional abuse and neglect, was handled, despite the existence of national guidelines for almost ten years. The findings include references to poor inter-agency co-operation between the Garda and the HSE, poor record-keeping, evidence of insufficient efforts to drive forward implementation of the Children First guidelines, poor quality assurance and a lack of consistent local procedures. Furthermore, there was a lack of a 24 hour external access mechanism for people reporting child abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_816"> It is very important to investigate the truth of past wrongs and abuses such as those in mother and baby homes, not only for the survivors but also for the well-being of our society today and into the future. We must learn how to do better and ensure a safer, healthier and more fulfilling future for all the children of the nation. Accordingly, I appeal to the Minister and Members to agree that when we conclude the debate tomorrow evening we do so with one voice and go forward together to resolve what has been hanging over all of us for decade after decade: a litany of tragedies and dreadful abuse of innocent women and children.</p>

          <p eId="para_817">Whenever we start to digest the full horror of all the stories that have emerged not recently but for several years we must go back to its roots. Where did it all go wrong? What was at the root of it? Let us consider this building, in particular. We are surrounded by the leaders of the 1916 Rising and icons of our struggle for independence. They helped to formulate the Proclamation, the vision for the people, that is to be found in the main foyer and which represents the hopes and ambitions they had for the people. Their thoughts would have been framed by the Dublin of 1913, as reported on during the Lock-out, when the conditions of poverty were even worse than on the streets of Calcutta. The city had some of the most appalling examples of poverty in the world and that was the challenge that faced the new State. We thought we had had a revolution. We thought we would develop a state of which we could be proud and that would address this poverty with real gusto. What we got was a counter-revolution. What we got was people who were mean and cruel in their conservatism, who wanted to control the lives of others. They turned the colonial institutions that had been so hated by the people into even worse manifestations of what they had been previously.</p>
          <p eId="para_818"> The people who ran these institutions professed to be Christian. I am a Christian and have faith in Christ. When I think of Christ, I think of love, empathy, compassion and everything that could be beautiful and challenging about this life. I do not think of malice or cruelty. I do not think of a desire to isolate and punish vulnerable women, push them away, take their children from them or have them adopted, vaccinated or let them die from malnutrition. All of this was for some ideology or to adhere to the teachings of Christ and this is what was done in our name. We are all part of it because we knew it was happening in our communities. We knew about the young women who had been banished to these institutions. We knew about the children who had escaped and had subsequently been sent back to these institutions. There had to have been reports in newspapers.</p>
          <p eId="para_819">Where were the coroners? Were there coroners' reports into these deaths and were they published in local newspapers?</p>
          <p eId="para_820"> This is the great shame of our people. It is based on a deeply conservative, malicious and cruel interpretation of faith, one that seeks to imprison people rather than liberate them, one that seeks to be cruel to them rather than give them the love, empathy and compassion they deserve.</p>
          <p eId="para_821"> Government after Government protest when they must deal with issues like this. We will have another commission and more findings, speeches and apologies from the Taoiseach in the Dáil. However, the response in the case of Bethany Home is, given the overwhelming evidence, a denial of what happened in the name of the State and a failure to vindicate that handful of people who need to be told they were right. We on this side of the House know they are right. Will this issue be addressed? Will the Government's actions match the noble words often voiced by the Taoiseach? This is the challenge. Will the Magdalen women get their full recompense speedily? Will we acknowledge that there was a conservative counter-revolution that hijacked the promise from ordinary, working class people? It was hijacked by a mean, cruel and conservative political establishment. Will it be acknowledged that all of this was part of a collective abuse of the people and their hopes and ambitions? I recall Professor Diarmaid Ferriter's series, which documented in the most brilliant and obvious fashion the counter-revolution that took place in this State. It was that environment of meanness, cruelty and narrow-mindedness that failed our people. Only when we own up to it can we set free ourselves, those women and those souls.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SandraMcLellan" eId="spk_357">
          <from>Deputy Sandra McLellan<recordedTime time="2014-06-10T19:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_822">No Deputy could be unmoved by the discovery of nearly 800 babies buried in a mass unmarked grave. In fact, the grave was a septic tank. Added to this are recent reports of old medical records showing that 2,051 children and babies in care homes were given a one-shot diphtheria vaccine for the international drugs giant Burroughs Wellcome between 1930 and 1936. The report adds that no evidence exists that consent was ever sought. This is the stuff of war crimes and holocausts.</p>
          <p eId="para_823"> I must take this opportunity to pay tribute to Ms Catherine Corless, the local historian and genealogist who brought to light this truth about the 800 babies. No Deputy, no matter how long he or she has served in the Dáil, could fail to be touched or moved to tears by the many testimonies that followed the discovery. However, emotion and tears are not enough. We were elected to legislate. This debate gives all Deputies on both sides of the House an opportunity to work together in a spirit of co-operation and to support this motion. We owe Catherine a great debt of gratitude. Unlike many others, she did not turn a blind eye or pretend it never happened. We must follow her lead and take immediate action.</p>
          <p eId="para_824"> The failure of the State to take immediate action and of the Garda to seal off the area and treat it as a crime scene has echoes of denial. If a mass unmarked grave was found in any other part of the world, the Government, the EU and the UN would rightly treat it as a crime scene. They would demand that those who perpetrated the crime be brought to justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_825"> This debate is not about party politics or political point scoring. It is about acting on behalf of the women and children who were kept at the Bon Secours Sisters institution in Tuam, County Galway, and all mother and baby homes across the State. No party will be remembered for its own motion. Instead, we must be remembered for moving speedily to bring the light of truth and justice to a very dark and oppressive time in our history.</p>
          <p eId="para_826"> The Government needs to act swiftly and decisively on this issue. The people are outraged by this latest shameful episode. The inquiry needs to consider the so-called care regime that was in place, the infant mortality rates and the burial of children in unmarked graves at mother and baby homes. There is a clear role for the State to deal with this tragedy. The institution in Tuam, along with the many others in Ireland, was regulated by the State. This was not a case of the Catholic Church operating separately from the Governments of the time. These homes were visited by civil servants and supported by the State. Sadly, there was a close, organic relationship between them. These homes would not have existed without the proactive support of the Governments of the day.</p>
          <p eId="para_827"> The abusive practices that occurred at the Bon Secours Sisters mother and baby home were not unique to that institution and were replicated in similar institutions across the State. I will put on record conversations I held yesterday with two women. One, who became pregnant at only 17 years of age in 1967, was sent to a mother and baby home by her parents. She told me that, even while she was heavily pregnant, she had to go down on her hands and knees to scrub floors. One day when she was not feeling well, she sat back on her haunches only to be kicked in the stomach. Shortly after having her baby, he was taken from her and adopted. She left the mother and baby home, was driven to the airport and was put on an aeroplane and told never to come back. After years of searching for her son, they have recently met and all is going well. She told me that she wanted the State to acknowledge her abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_828"> The second lady was born in a mother and baby home in around 1960. She was there for a number of months before being adopted into a good home. She was subjected to vaccine trials. She would like to know with what she was injected and why. After years of searching, she finally made contact with her mother last year. She had another family, but its members knew nothing about her. Her birth mother told her that she had spent 12 hours giving birth to her in a toilet cubicle without pain relief. When she was about to give birth, they put her on a commode, into which she then gave birth. The lady's mother passed away shortly after they met.</p>
          <p eId="para_829"> Women are hurting all over Ireland and abroad. They were made to feel ashamed. The religious institutions, the State and society in general should be ashamed. We need to get to the truth of the matter. I hope we can do so through consensus and cross-party support for this motion before moving swiftly to establish an inquiry.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Colreavy<recordedTime time="2014-06-10T19:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_830">There are times in politics when it is difficult to know what to say, we go past disappointment, frustration and anger when we are reminded of what we have allowed to happen in the name of religion or morality and society. This is one such occasion. I am glad the Government has agreed to move quickly on this issue. It would be entirely unseemly for any of us to use this as a political football.</p>
          <p eId="para_831"> Like Deputies who have already contributed on this motion, others will speak tomorrow about the awful treatment of women whose only "crime" was to become pregnant and of children whose only "crime" was to have been born out of wedlock. Members will speak of how pregnant girls and women were kidnapped by a coalition of church, State and, in some cases, families and local communities to be hidden behind the high, cold and forbidding walls of so-called mother and children homes, which were prisons by any other name. Some Deputies will speak of the fact that children were taken by force from their mothers and sent abroad for adoption never to make contact again, of how they were used as guinea pigs to test experimental drugs or of how they were segregated as second, third or non-class people to be shunned by wider society. Some will speak of the high death rate of children in those detention centres and of how the bodies of some such children were dumped without a prayer, a hug or a tear in unmarked graves on unconsecrated ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_832"> How could we have stood silently by when this was happening?</p>
          <p eId="para_833">We are not talking about something that happened 100 years ago. This is comparatively recent history. Why did we not believe those few courageous people and organisations who have been shouting from the rooftops for years that this has been going on? Are there remaining dark places in Ireland into which we need to shine a light?</p>
          <p eId="para_834"> I am probably angry and frustrated with myself as well as with the church, Government organisations and all those who kept silent while all this was going on. I should have listened more closely to people who said these things were happening in Ireland. I should have challenged church leaders who preached Christian rules and regulations but appeared to practise disdain, or even hatred, for vulnerable children and women. I should have called daily for local and national Government and their agents to look up from their books of Estimates, regulations and rules and into the eyes of those they were so grievously damaging but I did not, or at least I did not shout often enough or for long enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_835"> Are there dark corners in today's Ireland in our prisons, our immigrant reception centres or in family homes that do not have the resources or the supports to enable them rear children capable of achieving the best quality of life? Are we listening to or ignoring the voices of those who say there are families in deep distress today?</p>
          <p eId="para_836"> I believe that until we have minimum standards and conditions listed as fundamental, inalienable rights and we open our ears and our hearts to those who unsettle us by their message, until we have those two conditions in place, we cannot say that this will never happen again.</p>

          <from>Deputy Dessie Ellis<recordedTime time="2014-06-10T20:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_837">I welcome the news today that a commission of investigation is to be established into the monstrous discovery in Tuam. I welcome that this has been done with a pace not seen in previous cases where the State might have felt the need to close ranks and protect itself. Many lessons have been learned over recent years, especially during this Government's term, that action has to be taken and that it is only possible for the can to be kicked down the road for so long. I commend the public, who in their outcry at yet another shameful story of Ireland's abusive past, have forced this decision. Credit must also go to local campaigners such as Catherine Corless, who refused to allow this to be forgotten. </p>
          <p eId="para_838"> This is not a new story. We are all painfully aware of the terrible things done to people in this country by religious institutions under the watch of the State. Unfortunately, I believe we will continue to be shocked, angered and disappointed by more stories of this kind as Ireland continues to open up and deal with its past, but we must do this because it is not just the past of one town or one institution or order. This is the history of a people who for generations were controlled by the Catholic Church and an all-pervasive conservative and patriarchal structure that did as it pleased based on a perverted notion of morality which was the furthest thing possible from Christianity. Our entire society was complicit to some degree and today in our discoveries we are filled with shame to know that this was allowed to happen to young women and children who were treated as if they were not even human. Every family, town and parish has stories of how this repression of our humanity broke us up and damaged us.</p>
          <p eId="para_839"> The conclusion we must make is that we must unearth the injustices of our past and bring them into light so we can understand how such terrible things can be done and ensure they will never happen again. In doing that, we must then realise the folly of remnants of those brutal times in our society and move forward to a more free culture where people are not raised to feel shame or guilt for their humanity. I speak of misogyny, homophobia, racism and sectarianism, and all bigotries which devalue fellow humans and justify mistreatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_840"> Seven hundred and ninety-six children died in the Bon Secours institution. Some of them were dumped, not buried, in a septic tank. Two hundred and nineteen children died in the Bethany Home. Mothers were ripped from their families and communities, and then from their children. These deaths happened under the watch of the political establishment, which in some cases benefited directly from the slave labour of the Magdalens. Some in this House were here when the church still operated its prisons 18 years ago. Children are still hurt today by the actions of a State which devalues their lives and prioritises debt servicing and European targets. That is not to say that this issue is the same but when children live in poverty and go without basic needs such as a warm coat or good nourishment, when they are living in hotels, bed and breakfast accommodation or sleeping in crowded beds and not living as children should live, we cannot say we have fully learned the lessons of this dark period. Its unearthing is a challenge to us not just to deliver for the survivors, but for our children and the future generations who we hope will look back on these crimes as something alien to their understanding of how we treat each other.</p>
          <p eId="para_841"> Many years ago there was an old asylum in Finglas where now exists a housing estate, and a main carriageway was put through it. When it was being demolished and the housing built, unmarked graves and bones were discovered. How many more of these things happened? How many other places have we lost in terms of the history of what happened in them?</p>
          <p eId="para_842"> Mental health institutions were a law unto themselves and operated in an horrific way. Many people were buried on the grounds of some of those institutions. That is an issue we must investigate as well.</p>

          <p eId="para_843">Cuirim fáilte roimh an díospóireacht seo agus molaim mo chomhghleacaí i Sinn Féin as an rún seo a chur síos anocht, mar go bhfuil sé fíor thábhachtach go bhfuil an Teach seo ag plé na ceiste seo. Mar atá ráite cheana, ní seo an chéad uair atá seo pléite, mar ardaíodh an t-ábhar seo - an córas a bhí i bhfeidhm le blianta fada - sa Teach seo agus bhí a fhios ag Teachtaí Dála san am a chuaigh thart go raibh a leithéid ag tarlú. Ní hamháin go raibh fios ag Teachtaí Dála agus polaiteoirí, bhí fios ag daoine i gcumhacht sa Stát sna blianta a chuaigh thart go raibh a leithéid ag tarlú.</p>
          <p eId="para_844"> Sílim gur díospóireacht tromchúiseach atá ar siúl againn anocht, díospóireacht a bhrisfeadh croí an duine agus é ag smaoineamh ar na máithreacha sin a chuaigh isteach go dtí na hárasáin seo agus gur tarraingíodh a linbh uatha. Duine ar bith a bhí i láthair nuair a rugadh a pháiste a cheapfadh, sa lá atá inniu againn, go dtiocfadh daoine isteach leis an leanbh sin a tharraingt uaidh, bheadh smaoineamh maith aige ar an ualach trom a bheadh fágtha air. Tugann sin le fios nach raibh cúram tugtha do riachtanais na leanaí sin. Ní raibh an Stát ag amharc i ndiaidh riachtanais na leanaí sin mar ba cheart agus fuair méid mór díobh bás faoi chúram an Stáit agus faoi chúram na heaglaise ag an am.</p>
          <p eId="para_845"> Cuirim fáilte roimh an bhfógra atá déanta ag an Rialtas go mbeidh fiosrúchán sa réimse seo. Tá sé iontach tábhachtach go dtarlaíonn sin go scioptha, ach go ndíreoidh an fiosrúchán sin isteach ar na ceisteanna ar a gcaithfimid freagra a fháil. The inquiry must also examine the regimes that operated the mother and baby homes and the reason the mortality rate was so despicably high. It must also examine why so many of these children ended up in such an undignified burial place and, most importantly, it must look at who was responsible for their deaths. </p>
          <p eId="para_846"> Between 1925 and 1961, some 796 children died in Bon Secours Mother and Baby Home. The lowest mortality rates in these so-called homes was 34%. That means that even in the least brutal homes, one in three children died. In Bessborough, the figure was 60%.</p>
          <p eId="para_847">It was not happening in Catholic institutions only. In the Protestant-run Bethany Home in Dublin 219 people died. The State is still deflecting its responsibility in that case, despite the attempts of the campaigners, Sinn Féin and others to have the issue dealt with. I hope the Government will deal with it in a speedy manner. </p>
          <p eId="para_848"> What we are speaking about is a very dark chapter in our history - prisons, not homes, in which children and their mothers were treated brutally and a society that turned a blind eye. Children were experimented on. That brings to mind the worst aspects of the most brutal regimes of the last century. These things happened in this State and a conservative and anti-woman mentality allowed them to happen. It is not good enough to say they happened in the past and that the past was a different place. They happened because people let them happen. People - Irish people - committed these crimes or, through inaction, allowed them to happen. Today, vulnerable children are still not given their full rights. For example, the children of asylum seekers are kept in direct provision centres. It is hoped that, if nothing else, this tragic story will spur us on to ensure the children of today are cherished. That is the real legacy that we need to live up to. We have all come into this Chamber to proclaim that all of the children of the nation should be cherished equally, but how many of us will be in it when a future Government apologises to all those held in direct provision centres today? There are more people in direct provision centres than in our prisons. In the words of one asylum seeker: </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_849">If the State cares so much for children, why are they allowed to live in such inappropriate conditions? No one is illegal in any country. This is a free world, especially for children and children have a right to grow up in a normal environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_850">That is happening. As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Charles Flanagan needs to intervene. We must move as quickly as possible to get to the facts about what happened in the past, but we also need to prevent what happened from recurring in the future. The children of Tuam, Roscrea, Pelletstown and all of the other so-called homes deserve to be remembered and honoured. The individuals, 0rders, institutions or State bodies that facilitated these horrible events should be held responsible without hand-wringing or an attempt to contextualise or excuse. I thank the survivors, their families and support groups and all those who have fought to bring this horrific situation to light. I am glad that the House is united in its horror and hope this can be translated as soon as possible into a thorough and unrelenting inquiry into what happened during this very dark chapter.</p>

          <p eId="para_866">I am pleased to be back in the House to participate in a somewhat lengthier debate on mother and baby homes, following earlier statements. I thank Members on all sides for facilitating statements and the debate on mother and baby homes in the Dáil following the Government's significant decision during a Cabinet meeting this morning to establish a commission of investigation.</p>
          <p eId="para_867"> As Deputies are aware, it is less than four weeks since my appointment as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. The matters we are considering are ones in which I have taken great interest during my years in politics, in particular as Fine Gael's spokesperson on justice and later on children and youth affairs. I am privileged to be in a position to bring a proposal to the Cabinet to establish a commission of investigation to examine mother and baby homes. As Minister, I intend to drive this process forward and ensure the commission of investigation will get under way in a timely manner. Once established, it will be independent in its work. My role, therefore, and that of the Government and the Oireachtas is to ensure it is given appropriate terms of reference and a suitable expert membership to enable it to succeed in its important work. My primary focus is on the women who spent time in mother and baby homes and the children born to them in these institutions. It is difficult for us in a more modern and enlightened era to understand the harrowing situations in which these vulnerable women and children found themselves. Many times I have referred to our desire as a Government, Parliament and people to discover the truth. In so doing, we must be very respectful of those who were in mother and baby homes, many of whom will want to tell their stories, while others will want to maintain their right to privacy.</p>
          <p eId="para_868"> The Government has proposed a revised motion on mother and baby homes. The motion before us deals with matters of great national concern and tremendous personal significance for many former residents of mother and baby homes. I acknowledge the spirit with which the motion has been laid before the House by Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin and others. I, too, am anxious that we reach an historic consensus on how to proceed. I welcome the bipartisan nature of the wide support the Government's initiative in establishing the commission of investigation has received. I recognise that Sinn Féin's motion was tabled in a constructive manner. I know that Deputies Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin and Sandra McLellan gave careful consideration to the most effective approach to dealing with these sensitive issues. I know also that Deputy Mary Lou McDonald was particularly concerned that the Bethany Home be part of the proposed investigation. I can now confirm that Bethany Home will be examined as part of the process of investigation we have agreed to today. Moreover, I undertake to continue to engage with spokespersons as the Government finalises arrangements for the establishment of the commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_869"> In recent days we have witnessed a profound public debate on the role played by mother and baby homes and what it means for the country today. There has also been further questioning of the troubled history of our institutions, State and religious. There have been questions posed for the history of the communities and families to which we are individually affiliated for these institutions did not operate in isolation. Whereas in their day the women and children concerned were unjustly made to feel so much shame, we must now carry the shame for how as a country we dealt with them in their time of need. I was particularly struck by the content and tone of Deputy Pádraig Mac Lochlainn's contribution. I listened carefully to the points made by him. I do not take issue with what he said. I listened carefully to the passionate contribution of Deputy Michael Colreavy. I am sure there are many others, me included, who might have availed of an opportunity in earlier times to question the manner in which we ordered our priorities or dealt with our business. The history of mother and baby homes in Ireland in the early and middle decades of the 20th century reflects a brutally uncaring response by society, religious and State institutions to young women and children when they were in most need and most vulnerable. Young unmarried mothers were socially condemned and ostracised in a harsh and unsympathetic manner. These reminders of a wider and darker past, when children were not cherished, must be fully and openly addressed. The transparency to which we are committed as a Government in how we conduct our affairs must extend to our past.</p>
          <p eId="para_870"> When speaking about the harrowing situation in Tuam in the past week, I have been particularly mindful of the relatives of those involved and the local community. It is extremely important that the issues arising in Tuam and other mother and baby homes are addressed with the utmost sensitivity. There is no doubt that coverage in the past few days will have inevitably evoked very painful memories for people, many of whom are now elderly. It is for everyone who speaks and writes on this subject to do so with compassion and sensitivity. The known facts are sufficiently disturbing in themselves, without being added to through ill-advised speculation and sensationalism.</p>
          <p eId="para_871">I say this to my political colleagues also. Responsibility and balance are important elements of the sensitive treatment and discussion of these issues. The very valuable role currently being played by historians in making their research known to the public is of great assistance in achieving an objective assessment but this must be added to by a formal process of inquiry. The commission of investigation will build upon what is known to bring us towards a thorough and comprehensive public understanding of the many issues involved as quickly and as accurately as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_872"> As I indicated last week, the Government is strongly determined to have the issues reviewed, and we will not confine this review to Tuam or County Galway. This review into mother and baby homes will be independent and comprehensive. It will consist of a commission of investigation with full statutory powers and independence. The commission will be established under the Commissions of Investigation Acts, as passed by this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_873"> The commission's terms of reference, when finalised and brought before the House, will detail the matters to be investigated to ensure the scope of the investigation is described precisely. Under the Commissions of Investigation Act, a commission may consist of one or more members with appropriate experience, qualifications, training or expertise relevant to the matters being investigated. Where more than one member is appointed, a chairperson must be designated. The commission will seek the voluntary co-operation of people whose evidence it requires but is entitled to compel witnesses to give evidence where appropriate. It will also have powers to compel the production of documents. The detailed consideration of the most appropriate terms of reference for the commission will be undertaken speedily. I will welcome the views, submissions and observations of members of the Opposition in this regard. As the Taoiseach said today, I will be happy to engage with Opposition spokespersons in finalising arrangements for the commission of investigation. It is my hope that we can achieve consensus on the resolution approving the Government's draft order to establish the commission when it comes before each of the Houses of the Oireachtas for approval later this summer.</p>
          <p eId="para_874"> I know it is the earnest wish of this House that the commission of investigation discover the truth and establish what happened to mothers and infants in the mother and baby homes. Doing so will require us to craft carefully the terms of reference of the commission and choose its membership wisely.</p>
          <p eId="para_875"> The work under way by the interdepartmental committee, which was established last week, is preliminary in nature, but it is nevertheless playing a very valuable role in preparing the ground for the next phase, that of a formal commission of investigation. The issues involved are numerous and made more complex by the elapse of time. The work undertaken by the interdepartmental committee, which has been identifying the information available to public bodies, will assist in the process to establish the commission. The interdepartmental committee has commenced gathering information in relation to such matters as the Tuam site, the high mortality rates in various mother and baby homes, reports of conditions in these homes, and what happened to infants in these homes and what happened subsequently. This initial work will inform the drafting of the terms of reference and the resolution for this House to institute a commission of investigation into mother and baby homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_876"> It is essential that when we formally move to initiate the commission of investigation, we do so having a clear overview of these issues and the most important sources of information which any inquiry must have available to it. I believe there is all-party consensus on the importance of this matter and I hope that as we finalise the terms of reference for the commission of investigation and place the necessary resolution establishing the commission before both Houses of the Oireachtas next month we can do so on an agreed basis. It is the Government's intention to conclude this process as speedily as possible and return to the House before the summer recess.</p>
          <p eId="para_877"> Some factors that will need to be carefully considered are the scope of the inquiry and the range of issues to be included having regard to the task in hand and the effective conduct of the commission of investigation. Potentially, there are components that will demand a specific, tailored approach by the commission. A number of commentators have highlighted the fact that an important component of what is required here is a social history of these institutions. Significant historical research has been already undertaken in this area which can be drawn upon but significant further research is likely to be required, including into records held nationally and locally. It is important that the records made available include not just those held by public authorities but also those held by the relevant religious institutions. In this regard, I welcome the ready indications of co-operation that have been forthcoming from church leaders - from the Catholic Church, Archbishop Martin of the Dublin Archdiocese, Archbishop Neary of Tuam and Bishop Buckley of Cork and Ross, and from the Church of Ireland, Archbishop Michael Jackson of Dublin and Glendalough. I reiterate my call on all church leaders to co-operate fully with the forthcoming commission of investigation, and hand over all documents and information in their possession in regard to mother and baby homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_878"> The significant passage of time will likely have implications for the work of the commission. I hear what Members opposite have said, namely, that the passage of time should not in any way detract from the task at hand, but, nevertheless, time is a factor and will continue to be in the context of the work being undertaken. Many of those mothers who experienced mother and baby homes, certainly in their earlier days, are unfortunately no longer with us to offer their first-hand account. While many mothers have since passed on, there will be a range of views among all of those surviving - both mothers and children - as to how they would wish to see their records and personal experiences addressed in any inquiry. We need to take account of their wishes in the context of the ongoing public debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_879"> The challenge is to establish a commission of investigation in a manner that is capable of addressing these and other factors while effectively and properly representing the experiences of those involved and the wider social conditions that influenced how mother and baby homes operated in the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_880"> As I have done previously and as Members have acknowledged, I pay special tribute to Ms Catherine Corless, the local historian in County Galway whose work has brought this issue to the fore in recent weeks. I know from contact with officials that she has offered her co-operation, and this will be certainly of assistance as we embark on a wider examination of practices in mother and baby homes throughout the country, including that in Tuam, County Galway.</p>
          <p eId="para_881"> Detailed, painstaking work is required to ensure we can establish a true and clear picture of this part of our history. There are challenges inherent in this task but we must organise an effective investigation process and face up to our past and learn from it. The commission of investigation that the Government intends to establish will be the means by which we will achieve the goal - so widely shared inside and outside this House - to bring into full public view the operation of mother and baby homes in the State since its foundation.</p>

          <from>Deputy Paul J. Connaughton<recordedTime time="2014-06-10T20:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_882">I am thankful for the opportunity to speak on this matter. I welcome the Government’s announcement today that a commission of investigation is to be set up to get to the bottom of it. As someone who represents the constituency of Galway East, I have heard an awful lot about this matter locally in recent weeks from quite a number of people. I have no doubt the same applies to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and to Deputy Keaveney.</p>
          <p eId="para_883">We have heard an awful lot about this locally in recent weeks from quite a number of people, probably from people who knew about this for quite a long time and who are somewhat confused as to why it has become such a public issue now, given it had been raised by quite a number of people previously.</p>
          <p eId="para_884"> The first point is to acknowledge that the commission is being set up. It should be set up as quickly as possible and we must ensure it has all the power it needs to bring people in front of it, and that those people then go on to supply the information that is needed to get a full and true picture of what actually happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_885"> The people of my generation do not remember these homes and know little about them. We probably know most about them from films such as "Philomena" or "The Magdalene Sisters", which is how we got our information. Therefore, to hear about what went on in Tuam in that period is extremely shocking and something to which we cannot really relate. The one thing I have found most heartening is the number of people who have contacted me to say that we have to get to the bottom of this, one way or another.</p>
          <p eId="para_886"> The way we start to do that, which is extremely important, is to talk first to those who have survived the mother and baby homes. We seem to want to talk to a lot of experts and people who have a mass of opinions about these topics, and they will all play their part. However, from listening to people who had first-hand experience of this, I believe they need to be listened to first in order to hear what they lived through and survived. We need to allow them an opportunity to get the care and attention now that they deserved to get many years ago, but which was never given to them. If we start to do that in the first part of the commission, it would be a good day's work.</p>
          <p eId="para_887"> When I listen to people talk about those times, it is clear the church had much more control over the country than perhaps it has now. However, it is all too easy just to blame the church and, while it played its part, there were many other people in society at the time who knew of this and perhaps acknowledged it but wanted to do nothing about it. It is all part of our national shame that this was the case. All too often in politics, we look for a scapegoat, for someone we can blame, and put it all down on top of them, and then, when we have the inquiry, we move on and say that is another good day's work done. However, we have to acknowledge that, in those times, politicians and other people in very professional capacities knew what was going on and decided to do nothing about it. We would be wrong to continue on without acknowledging that Irish society at the time played its part in what went on in these homes, because it is acknowledged that what happened in Tuam was an absolute disgrace and a shame, but that is only one part of the country. We need to get to the bottom of what happened, we need to know who played their part in it and what can be done to help those who have survived.</p>
          <p eId="para_888"> There is no point in taking part in a report like this on the number of young people and babies who lost their lives unless we learn lessons from it. As a Government, as is true for previous Governments and for Governments to come, we all too often throw around the slogan, "We cherish all of our children equally", when we just do not do so. As someone who has been elected to this House for three years, I still find it quite upsetting that, in this day and age, we have parents coming to us with a child who is looking for an occupational therapist or a physiotherapist, who is on a massive waiting list and is simply not getting the care and attention they deserve. They certainly are not being treated equally or like everybody else. If we really want to cherish all of these people equally, those parents have to have that burden lifted off their shoulders or those children will not have all the opportunities that we have had, in common with those in the mother and baby homes, who were not given a fair chance. In 2014 and further on, we have to do everything we can to support those children and their families.</p>
          <p eId="para_889"> If this inquiry teaches us anything, it is that no matter a person's income background or social background, they deserve to get that care and attention. Unfortunately, we still have children in our society today who are not getting it. If this Government could set anything to do in the next number of years, it is important we look after those children as well. Let us remember those who lost their lives in a very shameful way but let us ensure we are not back here again in 20 years talking about another lost generation.</p>

          <from>Deputy Áine Collins<recordedTime time="2014-06-10T20:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_890">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion. There is no doubt the recent highlighting of the treatment of mothers and babies since the foundation of the State has shocked the nation, and rightly so. Despite the fact books were written and reports were made on the issue since 1929, for some unexplainable reason society as a whole did not react to the serious consequences these practices had on women, children and society over a 60 year period. Despite the fact we considered ourselves during the period as holy Catholic Ireland, these massive, unchristian abuses of women and children were taking place.</p>
          <p eId="para_891"> There seems instead to have been a totally unholy alliance between church and State and, indeed, the establishments of civil society that allowed this premise to continue for so long. This is yet another huge reflection on how our society, church and State ignored the plight of young single mothers and their children. If somebody knew this was happening anywhere else in the world, we would have portrayed the appearance of shock and horror at this uncivilised and barbaric behaviour, yet it happened under our noses and on our watch, and we knew about it. Because of some moral or civil snobbery, as a society, we regarded this kind of treatment of so-called fallen women and their children as acceptable. The very silence of church and State was immoral.</p>
          <p eId="para_892"> Any inquiry will find it difficult to apportion blame, even though the State and churches were to blame for the day-to-day mismanagement and outrageous neglect of these mothers and their children - our children. Society as a whole, especially the establishment element in our society, by its silence condoned what was happening. It is difficult to understand how politicians, journalists, judges, barristers, doctors, nuns, teachers, bankers and law enforcement agencies allowed these situations to continue over a prolonged period. I am sure that any inquiry will show many very good people were involved in trying to help these mothers and their children, but the overwhelming attitude of society, which regarded these women and children as somehow less equal, hampered their efforts to change the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_893"> There is no doubt that the attitude towards established religions influenced greatly this social attitude. This was very evident when it came to adoptions. The churches, both Catholic and Protestant, were more concerned that the adoptive parents belonged to the right church rather than whether they were suitable to be good parents. There was a prevalent attitude that these unmarried mothers had no rights whatsoever, but church and State thought they had the right to act as sole guardians and do what they considered was appropriate for these children. They decided they should be adopted, sent to foster homes or exported to places like America. It would seem also that these institutions decided that some of these children could be used in medical experiments.</p>
          <p eId="para_894"> Much has been made of the question of whether the mother gave consent for these adoptions or experiments. This does not really matter. Consent given under such duress could not and should not stand up legally in any event. If a person is in a position where their parents, church, teachers, state and society in general have condemned them, they are broken. That person then has no choice but to concede to what they impose upon them. I believe this societal attitude over many years contributed and still contributes towards women and childbearing. Is it any wonder that, even today, so few women are involved in politics, business and positions of influence in our society? Not only must we investigate and expose the wrongs of the past and deal with those issues, in doing so the religious orders who carried out the wrongs in Tuam and many other places need to make a public apology for what has happened. We must examine our current practices to ensure injustices are not still occurring in a subtle manner. For example, in a few years, will we be examining the way in which we have treated the children of asylum seekers?</p>
          <p eId="para_895"> The Government is constantly trying to deal fairly with legacies from the past while at the same time putting in place safeguards for the future. The appointment of a Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is a huge step in that direction. I welcome the decision of the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, to set up an inquiry that is appropriate to deal with these issues. Legacy issues need to be dealt with fairly and comprehensively, and one hopes we in Ireland, as a society, will be fair and just to all our people in the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_897">I welcome the opportunity to contribute further to what is an extremely important debate. I welcomed the establishment of this independent commission in an earlier contribution and I compliment Sinn Féin on using its Private Members' time to bring forward this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_898"> I outlined earlier how I would like to see the terms of reference for the independent investigation framed. I believe that how we deal with this will determine how we are judged as a society.</p>
          <p eId="para_899">This is an extremely dark period in our history. The news and the stories that have emanated in the past number of days are, unfortunately, not new. The recent media coverage has just reignited a debate and brought the issue to the floor of the Dáil this week. </p>
          <p eId="para_900"> Undoubtedly, the State, religious orders, society and even families were all complicit in the appalling treatment of women and babies in these homes. While some might say that these were different times and that we were a poor country, it is never the wrong time to do the right thing. While I welcome this full independent investigation, we must acknowledge that it is long overdue. I compliment the advocacy groups and historians who over the past number of years continued to highlight the issues and stories and correlate the facts that have again been brought to our attention in the last number of days. We now have an opportunity to get things right and to ensure that the terms of reference are right. At the very minimum, this is what these women and children deserve. There are in the region of 45,000-plus survivors of these homes who have no access to their proper identity. That is something that we can address as legislators in the Dáil. </p>
          <p eId="para_901"> It is very important that the Minister secure a supplementary budget from his colleagues around the Cabinet table and the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform to ensure that the children of today do not suffer while we try to compile a report on our past mistakes. We passed the children's rights referendum ensuring the rights of every child would be protected. That in itself was no panacea for all ills. While we can never undo the wrongs of the past, we can ensure that we never again fail children. While we are addressing and acknowledging the wrongs of the past, we need to look at what we are doing at the moment and how we are failing children, regardless of whether the issue is children in direct provision, which is effectively institutionalised poverty, or children in care who are being failed by the system. Representatives from the office of the Ombudsman for Children appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children today. They cited examples from the past two years, including one in which a child in the care of the State was passed around 11 times in four months. Will those who will take our places in these Chambers in the future talk about how we failed the children of today? The biggest thing we can do in terms of acknowledging the wrongs of the past is to ensure that these wrongs are not repeated now or in the future. Another example is how children with special educational needs are not legally entitled to preschool education. This is discrimination and a blatant breach of a human right. These are things we need to address.</p>
          <p eId="para_902"> Many speakers have spoken about the need to keep this above party politics and the need for a consensus approach. I welcome that and the Minister's consultation with the Opposition spokespersons earlier on. I ask the Government and Sinn Féin not to divide the House on this motion tomorrow night but to come together to agree a formula of words to ensure we can be united in ensuring that the facts are known and the issue is addressed.</p>

          <p eId="para_903">I thank Fianna Fáil for giving me an opportunity to speak on this issue this evening. I commend the Minister and the Government for acting so quickly to establish a commission of inquiry into what occurred in the mother and baby homes. It is important that one particular action that went on in some of these institutions is not again brushed under the carpet. I am referring to the use of some children in care homes as human guinea pigs by the State, through its agencies, and the British pharmaceutical company Wellcome as part of the clinical trials of the three-in-one whooping cough vaccine. As the Minister is aware, from 1961 up until the late 1970s children were used to test out vaccines, because during that period there had been a significant increase in the number of adverse reactions to the whooping cough vaccine. A former Minister for Health admitted while in office that the side effects generally recognised as occurring occasionally following the administration of the whooping cough vaccine included mental retardation and paralysis. The trials that took place in 1973 were approved by the National Drugs Advisory Board and a licence was issued to Wellcome for a two-year period, yet these trials were still ongoing in January 1976.</p>
          <p eId="para_904"> There are serious and significant question marks over the consent, if any, that was sought or obtained to use children in care homes as guinea pigs, as well as the ethics of such trials. The Laffoy commission had powers to compel and secure documents and to provide answers. Documents were obtained but, because of a High Court judgment, they were never acted upon. While the Minister for Health is preparing legislation to preserve testimony given in confidence by abuse survivors of these institutions, despite earlier assurances that such information would be destroyed, we now find out that documents provided by the successors of Wellcome, the religious orders that were responsible for these homes and the State agencies that were involved in these clinical trials were returned to the original owners in 2012. The evidence that was given by victims on condition it would be destroyed is now being retained, but evidence that could throw some light on why these children - some of whom suffered long-term damage as a result of being involved in such trials - were treated as guinea pigs was returned to the successors of those who ignored these children's most basic constitutional right, which is the right to bodily integrity. Is this not a further abuse - current abuse - of the former residents of these institutions?</p>

          <p eId="para_905">I refer to a newspaper report from <i>The Irish Times</i> dated 11 January 1940 that contains a criticism of the care of children born to unmarried parents by Dr. W. B. F. Collis. I will quote from the article and I ask Members' forgiveness with respect to the use of some archaic terms. The article outlines Dr. Collis's observation that "as for the illegitimate babies, over 300 per 1,000 died before they reached the age of one year, and many more afterwards." When he was asked the reason so many illegitimate children died, he replied that it was the attitude towards them. He said he believed their deaths arose from neglect and that there was no such thing as an illegitimate child, but that there were illegitimate parents.</p>
          <p eId="para_906"> It is striking that the mortality rates, forced adoptions, forced labour and the mechanics of shame were largely in the open. Society shamed women and children into homes. Society's shame ensured the existence of these dark events in our past. It involved the unsayable and the unthinkable but not the unknown, because it was known. These homes have to be seen in the broader context of this country's fondness for confining large numbers of our population in various institutions, including the mother and baby homes, industrial schools, Magdalen laundries and mental health facilities. I am told that at some point in our history, more people were locked up as a proportion of our population than in the Soviet Union. As a society, we must face up to our own past with respect to institutions. </p>
          <p eId="para_907"> In respect of Tuam, we know that almost 800 children died in the mother and baby home - a mortality rate that was far higher than the prevailing national infant mortality rate. We know that their deaths were recorded but the circumstances of their burial were not recorded. We know that some, if not all, of the bodies were buried in unmarked graves in or near the site of the home.</p>
          <p eId="para_908">There are some skeletal remains in a tank. It is reported that this is most likely a septic tank or a crypt which lies on a local authority estate on the Dublin Road, Tuam. This is a high mortality rate and this burial practice raises alarm for the community I represent. The Tuam home, however, is not unusual in comparison to other homes, as the Minister alluded to in his earlier statement. There are many questions we need to have answered about such homes, including the Bethany Home, which are mentioned in the motion. The State, the church and society combined to shame these women and their children. They sought to separate them from the so-called respectable society to punish them for actions which were not crimes under statute. These women violated the most harsh and unforgiving social codes that existed at the time and this resulted in this form of treatment for the most vulnerable people. The State and the church combined and engaged in forced adoptions, aspects of which continue to echo in our laws by our refusal to permit those who are peppered across the world to access their information, which rests on files. This long history of forced adoption in the country needs to be faced up to and we need to examine amending the law where necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_909"> Worse still, those who were not adopted were often sent as virtual slaves into communities to work on farms or in businesses owned by so-called respectable people in society. I met a number of former residents over the past number of days. They are entering old age, as the Minister said, and they have a living history that needs to be recounted and recorded. I also met others who were not adopted or farmed out but were sent to the infamous industrial schools. A number of them endured physical, mental and sexual torture at the hands of the organisation responsible for the running of Letterfrack industrial school.</p>
          <p eId="para_910"> Clinical vaccine trials were carried out on children in mother and baby homes. What did the State know at the time? This information is not new. We have known for more than a decade about these trials but we need to know the extent of this practice and the State's complicity in it. Who signed off on them in the Department of Health? Were medical officers in charge of the trials in Tuam and other mother and baby homes? Will the inquiry establish facts around this and assign blame and responsibility to institutions, groups and individuals? I look forward to co-operating with the Minister in that respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_911"> Tuam is the current focus for this story. A State initiative is needed to establish facts in respect of what is emerging about the absence of a formal burial location for almost 800 missing bodies. The matter is causing considerable distress to many families that suspect that their relatives are buried there. It is also causing significant distress for people living in the area. I have been contacted by a number of them and their distress has been intensified by an accumulation of speculation and rumour. I call on the Minister to move quickly to establish a proper investigation of the site. If only one body is discovered, almost 800 children will still be unaccounted for. Even if all the bodies are found buried in a neat row with obvious care, it will still mean the mortality rate was in excess of the national rate at the time. The site in Tuam should be properly secured, as should all the records connected with it. It should be ensured all homes co-operate with the provision of files. The grave concern around this is the historical aspect of generating a picture with respect to the data, files and ledgers that existed.</p>
          <p eId="para_912"> The mention of malnourishment being listed as a cause of death is worrying and requires investigation, as does the function and management of the dying rooms. What are they? Who was monitoring them on behalf of the State and of the church? Has the church been spoken to regarding its willingness to co-operate with the provision of records? Who provided oversight at the time on behalf of the State and the church? Were any concerns noted at the time? If so, what actions were taken? Who was negligent? Most important, the finances of the home need to be investigated. Where did the money paid over by the civil authorities to those operating the homes go to? Who benefited from these resources? Are accounts available to the Minister with respect to the conduct of an investigation to establish fact?</p>

          <p eId="para_913">I wish to share time with Deputy Pringle.</p>
          <p eId="para_914"> When we hear the term "mass grave", we normally associate it with countries in conflict such as Rwanda, Cambodia, Iraq or Bosnia but we now have a mass grave in Ireland, which is disturbing. As the Minister said, these revelations are a reminder of our darker past when children were far from cherished. The oft-quoted principle in our Proclamation about cherishing the children of the nation equally was not adhered to. This issue also demonstrates society's attitude to women at the time. They were not cherished or valued. Men were involved in every pregnancy but the blame and shame, rightly or wrongly, lay with the women. The horrible expression, "fallen women" was used but we never heard about "fallen men".</p>
          <p eId="para_915"> This is an indictment of our society, which had an unforgiving attitude towards women who became pregnant outside marriage. The homes were society's way of getting rid of the problem and the religious orders were under pressure to assist in this regard. This is also an indictment of a class driven society because there was one way for the pregnancies of women of a certain class and a different way for those who came from poorer backgrounds. This issue is a further indictment of previous Governments, which did not respond to calls from organisations for investigations. I refer to the work of Dr. Deeney who was a lone voice and who faced the ire of both church and State when he called for the closure of one of the homes. However, it was closed.</p>
          <p eId="para_916"> I heard the Minister on the radio news at lunchtime talking about the commission of investigation. Lessons must be learned from the drawbacks of the McAleese report and the Ryan commission for the investigation to be successful. All parties need to be involved and all the documents must be released. Will the laundries be included in the commission's terms of reference, which a number of organisations are calling for, given the close association between them and the mother and baby homes?</p>
          <p eId="para_917"> We often ask whether we ever learn from our history and I am not sure that we do because we are creating a Magdalen laundries-industrial school scandal for the future through the direct provision system and the deplorable conditions in which some foreign national children live. Has the Minister a recorded mortality rate for infants and children in direct provision? If so, how does that compare with the national rate?</p>
          <p eId="para_918"> We have to learn to deal with the horrible atrocities of our past and we have had many dark moments. These not only concern industrial schools and mother and baby homes. Many atrocities happened in the North during the Troubles and I refer, in particular, to the Dublin-Monaghan bombings. Yesterday, President Higgins referred to remembering those conflicts ethically and to use our memories as tools for "reconciliation and not revenge".</p>
          <p eId="para_919"> Above all, there is a need for sensitivity because many of the women who lived in mother and baby homes did not reveal the details of their background to their families and that has to be respected.</p>

          <p eId="para_920">An extract from <i>The Tuam Herald</i> in November 1948 following a visit by two politicians to the Bon Secours mother and baby home concluded that they paid a high tribute to the work of the sisters in charge and the entire management and seemed pleased with the good work in the institution. At the time the visit took place, a child was dying on average every two weeks in this institution. These deaths were repeated in mother and baby homes throughout the country. There is a tendency to blame the religious for the regime in operation in these homes and there is no doubt that it was far from Christian how these children and their mothers were treated but this was done in the full knowledge of the State and many citizens. We were a shameful, craven society and these atrocities continued in mother and baby homes, Magdalen laundries and industrial schools right up to the 1990s.</p>
          <p eId="para_921"> I welcome the Government's decision to commence a commission of investigation into the events in mother and baby homes and I also welcome the decision to include the Bethany Home. It is the least we can do to ensure the truth is told about the events that took place in the homes. The inquiry has to allow the survivors to tell their story and have it recorded. It is only through this process that people can begin to heal and come to terms with what was done to them in our name. As a society, we must learn from the investigation. We have to make sure such crimes cannot be repeated.</p>
          <p eId="para_922"> However, unfortunately, there is an ongoing situation, which has been mentioned by previous speakers. A Minister will have to stand in the House in a few years and apologise for the wrongs that have been done in our name to many children and adults in direct provision during the early part of the 21st century and for the treatment of asylum seekers in hostels throughout the State. The system as it is operated is effectively a series of open prisons where people who have come to the country for protection end up being segregated and abandoned in hostels, suffering from isolation and deteriorating mental health. There are children in this society who were born into direct provision and they are growing up in these prisons. What harm are we doing to them? People have been living in hostels for more than ten years waiting for the State to deal with their cases. This wrong has to stop. I call on the Minister to make it his business to make sure this system is ended now in order that we do not have to apologise to these children in the future.</p>
