#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I have received notice from Senator Ulick Burke that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:The need for the Minister for Transport to outline if it is his intention to recruit the much-needed additional driving testers from outside the Department as opposed to from within it where there is already a pool of highly-qualified driving testers available with the relevant experience, knowledge and expertise.I have also received notice from Senator Feighan of the following matter:The need for the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to comment on the future of the Arigna Leader tourism programme.I have also received notice from Senator Higgins of the following matter:The need for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to address the deficiencies and defects as outlined by the Ombudsman in a report to his Department on the fishing vessels lost at sea scheme 2001.I have also received notice from Senator Bannon of the following matter:The need for the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to give an update regarding essential funding for Legan neighbourhood watch and community alert, County Longford, under the programme of grants for locally-based community and voluntary organisations as this group provides an invaluable service to the local community and is urgently in need of such funding.I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected the matters raised by Senators Ulick Burke, Feighan and Higgins and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator Bannon may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I often think when called upon for expressions of sympathy it is a matter of no joy but of great concern. For the Fine Gael Party, this is an intensely sad time. On behalf of my party and its Members in the Seanad, I express deep sympathy to the McMahon family on the sad death of their dear father, father-in-law and brother, Larry McMahon. We are honoured that in the Visitors Gallery are Lorcan, Ronan, Conor, Ciarán, Niamh, Claire, Larry's sister, Sister Pascal, his son-in-law and daughters-in-law. This shows a huge family commitment and this big presence bears witness to the late Larry McMahon's strong commitment as a family person, a person steeped in the tradition of the family. This is a fine family who suffered a loss not that long ago in the death of their dear mother, Ursula.I listened to the expressions of sympathy in the other House this morning in order that I would pick up the texture and colour of them. There is no doubt that, as a devoted husband, when Larry McMahon lost his wife, Ursula, it seemed as if the spark had gone from his life, which diminished within him the will to stay and fight his ill health.He was a wonderful public representative, whether it was as a community activist, a local representative, a Deputy or a Senator. Throughout all the strands of public life he served, Larry McMahon brought his unique blend of commitment to community involvement, family strength and devotion to his own area or his own patch.He served for 22 years as a Fine Gael Deputy and Senator. He was a member of Dublin County Council for more than 30 years. He was elected Fine Gael Deputy for Dublin South-West in a by-election following the resignation of Kevin Boland from the then Government and Dáil during the arms crisis. What seems a far distant event is not so distant, and it is epitomised here in the Visitors Gallery by his family who, as younger people, lived with him through those traumatic times in which he entered national public life. Great stress is rightly placed on commitment to public service, pro bono publico. In this consumer age, an age often seen as one characterised by greed, commitment to public life is not often talked about, highlighted or publicised enough.I knew Larry McMahon well around Leinster House. He was unfailingly courteous and nice when one would meet him, whether on the corridors, in the lift, the canteen or elsewhere. He was pleasant, affable and somebody with whom one would like to linger and have a few words. That trait is one that is not commented on sufficiently. People either have it or they do not, but he had it in abundance.On behalf of my party in the Seanad, I express our sympathy to his lovely family, his extended family and to his dear sister. In this House where he was an avid and hardworking Senator he will be remembered with great fondness. Equally, in Leinster House in general the remembrances of Larry McMahon will be of a good man who did his duty for his country, county and constituency.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I would like to echo the comments of the Leader of the House, Senator O'Rourke in her tributes to the former Senator, Larry McMahon. The family were very pleased and honoured that the Cathaoirleach of Seanad Éireann, Senator Kiely, was able to attend the funeral mass in Boharnabreena last week. They wished that I put on the record that to have such a senior office holder, the Speaker of this House at the funeral of their late father was something they very much appreciated. It is difficult for a family such as the McMahons, who have seen the ups and downs of politics, to lose their mother and father within such a short space of time. Ursula and Larry were a fine double act, not just in their family but also as a significant source of stability in the constituency branch of our party for over three decades.In recent years Larry was able to continue to enjoy his connections with the former Members of this House. One of the best recent developments is that we now have a retired members' association where former colleagues can come together regularly to meet and discuss issues. Larry enjoyed that very much.Larry McMahon was synonymous with politics in Dublin South-West for over three decades. He represented his local community in Boharnabreena and the Glenasmole Valley. While the constituency has many problems and challenges to address, it is by far the most beautiful constituency in the entire Dublin region, comprising the Dublin Mountains and the remaining old rural parts of the county. He was before his time as an environmentalist in defending the importance of rural sustainable communities in large urban areas.The Tánaiste said in the other House this morning that he saw the importance of villages thriving within Dublin because the city is not one urban sprawl but contains communities, particularly old rural ones, that need to be recognised. He grew old with Tallaght, saw the great challenges in that community and responded to them over many years.As the Leader said, he was a distinguished member of Dublin County Council for almost three decades. He came to prominence in 1970, on the resignation from the then Government of Mr. Kevin Boland, following the turbulence of the arms crisis. He won that by-election and remained a Deputy for the constituency until 1982. He is one of a small group of politicians who had to fight three general elections between 1981 and 1982. He lost one and won two. The election he lost was that which led to a Fine Gael Government that lasted almost five years, from 1982 to 1987. Larry McMahon's family, and his supporters in our constituency, suffered grievously for a politician who had been on the wrong side of political destiny.He enjoyed his time in this House from 1982 to 1992. On one famous occasion, in 1989, he achieved a win for the independent spirit in our party when having failed to obtain a nomination on behalf of his party, he received one from other Members and went on to win his seat as an Independent Fine Gael Senator. However, after the election took his rightful place on these benches.It is a great example of a politician that he can win votes from all parties and none over the course of a Seanad campaign. The fact that he received a poke in the eye from the apparatchiks in Mount Street added to his campaign.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	4	It was a sign of the respect he had achieved throughout the country among council colleagues. He had strong convictions and a strong connection with his faith and believed that many decisions taken in the 1980s by our party and others were not the best ones. He held those views until the end, was sincere in his convictions and did not mollify his views to suit the trends of the time.He was passionate about the European Union. He was a dedicated member of the EU Council, believing passionately in the European project on which he spoke here regularly. I admit I was one of the parachutists who came into the Dublin South-West constituency but he was very kind to me when I eventually managed to win the seat for our party in 1997 and then lose it in 2002. The late Senator McMahon was the second person to call to commiserate with me in 2002 and I will never forget that kindness to me and my family at that time. I greatly appreciate all the wisdom and experience he shared with me over that difficult time when I was deciding whether to remain in full-time politics. I sympathise with Lorcan, Ronan, Ciarán, Conor, Niamh and Claire and his sister, Sister Pascal. The family has lost a great father and a great brother. The country and our party have lost a loyal public servant. It is only right and fitting that the House takes this opportunity of reflecting on Larry's public service, on his belief in his political party and his belief in democracy; his service will be looked up to as the years go by.I extend the sympathy of my Fine Gael colleagues in this House to the McMahon family at this difficult time.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	5	On behalf of the Independent Members I wish to be associated with the words of the Leader of the House and of Senator Brian Hayes. There is very little more to be said. I served with Larry McMahon for two terms in this House. I knew him for many years prior to that because he was part of the old County Dublin constituency. Although Councillor McMahon was based in Boharnabreena which is the part of the county farthest away from where I lived, he had long tentacles that stretched into the middle of my parish. The extended McMahon and Ward family of north Dublin ensured that in the early days when the county was all one constituency there would always be votes for Larry McMahon coming out of the Rolestown box. His brother, Pat, was a very good neighbour of mine for many years. When I was a teacher I had great pleasure in having Larry's nieces and nephews as my students. The extended McMahon family has always been a fantastic family.Larry was a stalwart within his party and within the political system. As the Leader said, he was a man of exceptionally courteous behaviour. He was also as argumentative a man as one could hope to deal with in a day's walk. He and I held many differing views on issues being discussed at the time. However, whatever arguments we had about issues either in this House or outside, it never became personalised; he always argued on the issue in hand and on the point of principle. He was a politician to be proud of, the kind of politician of which there are some in every parliament, who despite differences of views will be held in widespread and universal respect. He was prepared to exchange views and argue and engage with people who held views completely different from his. The creative tension between differing points of view allows political progress to be made. This was his great contribution.My extended family of in-laws would have been closely associated with him and involved in the old County Dublin executive of the IFA and associated activities. I can assure the House that were he here today, he would have a matter on the Adjournment or be demanding a debate on what action this country was planning to save the poultry industry from avian influenza. He was a turkey farmer and had a wealth of commitment, experience and knowledge of the industry. He would be hammering the table and insisting on being heard on the subject.Larry was committed to his party but he had rows with its members as often as he had rows with any of the rest of us. His great strength was that he stood by his beliefs and followed them to the limit, which is really all that one would ask of a committed politician.I could say more but I would simply be repeating what has already been said by others. Caithfidh mé a rá gurbh duine den scoth é. Rinne sé a dhícheall ar son a Dháil cheantair agus ar son saol polaitíochta na tíre go ginearálta. We offer our condolences from these benches to the extended family and to his party. Ar dheis Dé go raibh sé.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	6	I served here for a good number of years with Larry McMahon. While we did not always agree, he was a person with whom one could have disagreements without having any serious personal conflict. We were always on good terms outside the House. He was a good humoured and sociable man, and was agreeable to deal with on a personal level. Without a doubt, he stood for, and did, what he believed to be right in politics. There is no better compliment one can pay to any active politician than to say that he was driven by beliefs that were more important to him than mere electoral success. Like the rest of us, he was not averse to trying to get votes. However, he never gave me or anyone else the slightest hint that his principles were ever for sale in order to improve his electoral prospects. He believed that people respected those who told them the truth about themselves. I respected him for that, although we did not always or often agree. In the greater picture, however, political disagreement is a minor matter. The quality of the individual is far more significant. As somebody with whom one could discuss life's ups and downs, Larry McMahon was likeable and respected.Living, as I do, some 160 miles from Dublin, I would not have known much about his family but it is striking to hear the unanimous view of my colleagues on the intensity of his family's strength and support for him, and his loyalty to them. It confirms my views of him as a man who had convictions and loyalties that were based on what he believed to be right. He lived according to that creed, which is a good tribute to be able to pay to a former colleague. On behalf of my party and on my own behalf I wish to extend sympathy to his immediate family, his extended family and his party. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.
#JohnMinihan	unknown-#JohnMinihan-party	unknown-#JohnMinihan-dob	unknown-#JohnMinihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	7	On behalf of the Progressive Democrats, I wish to be associated with the remarks of previous speakers in offering our sympathies to the family of the late Larry McMahon. I never met Mr. McMahon but anyone with an interest in politics, and particularly that famous by-election, would know who he was. Having listened to the tributes today, both here and in the Lower House, the point that comes across is his sense of decency. In Cork, they would call him a decent man. He made a contribution to public life at various levels and in difficult times. If we value our society, we recognise that it starts with our family, the extended family, the community in which we live and the extended community. The commitment made by politicians is not only made by them but also by their families. Not alone do we salute the contribution Larry McMahon made to public life but we also salute the support his family gave him in making that contribution.On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I wish to extend my sympathy to his children and his sister. Across the political divide, everyone has universally acknowledged the contribution that Larry McMahon made on behalf of his community and the Fine Gael Party to the service of the State.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	10	I am sure the Leader will agree we all have the responsibility to condemn outright the riots on the streets of Dublin last Saturday. We all have the responsibility to support the Garda in its difficult task of ensuring public safety on our streets.That is the easy bit. It is harder to understand why so many people in this country still believe the demonstrators from Northern Ireland have no right to march on our streets. We should look at a worthwhile proposal which I ask the Leader to consider with her Government colleagues. There is a need for a public inquiry into the events which took place last Saturday, not merely in terms of whether the Garda had the manpower required or whether the intelligence was of a particular variety. We need to consider why so many people believe those demonstrators had no right to march last Saturday and why a new, virulent neo-nationalism has taken hold in this country, particularly among young people, which believes that — in the words of DP Moran in the 1880s — Ireland is just for the Irish. We need to inquire into this matter because in post-Agreement Ireland, parity of esteem must exist not just in Northern Ireland but on the streets of Dublin too. I am concerned that the image portrayed on Dublin streets last Saturday is one which will help to harden hearts and minds in Northern Ireland.There was a lack of political leadership on this issue last week from all political parties. When politicians were asked whether they believed this march should take place, most of them said "no comment". If we are really honest we should inquire into the circumstances behind this and ask why this new, virulent neo-nationalism has taken hold among some sections of our society. I ask for a public inquiry.Can the Leader say when we are likely to have a debate on the very fine report which Judge Harding Clark issued yesterday concerning the practices of Dr. Neary, a consultant in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda? For 24 years, women were violated as a result of this gynaecologist's practices. The House must examine the judge's report and its recommendations. It is important to ask whether we have other such examples. The Coombe Women's Hospital has on its website all information and details on procedures of pregnancy and birth. Is that the case in every other maternity hospital?It is necessary to debate this issue and for the State to respond to the plight of these women. The Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children will meet the Patient Focus group today, which I welcome. However, there was a slowness on the part of the State to recognise the scale of this problem. In 1998 it was brought to the attention of the Department of Health and Children and the North Eastern Health Board. It took years before the full gravity of the situation in Drogheda was realised. We must learn lessons from this and I ask for a debate to take place in the near future.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	11	I also would like a debate on last Saturday's disturbances. I hesitate to ask for it because it would simply consist of asking how many gardaí were there, what was the intelligence beforehand, and whether the Minister should take responsibility. The issue is simple. It is absolutely frightening that a large number of people in this country believe that the march should not have been allowed to take place and fail to grasp the importance of free speech and protest in a democracy. That is more valuable to us, as democrats, than anything else. We must also reflect on our failure as educators to inculcate tolerance in a generation of people. We, as politicians, must also focus on our failure to deliver the acceptance of difference as a national norm of democracy. I would like to discuss these issues in the House.We should forget about the events and focus on the mindset that gave us last Saturday. Why is it there and whose failure is it? We must all take responsibility. During last week, I stated to people that the marchers were likely to be applauded as they walked down O'Connell Street, and that people would take no notice as they went about their shopping. I was completely taken aback and it shows how out of touch I must be with views held by people. I would like to discuss this issue because we have clearly disgraced ourselves again. We must examine it.I will make a plea which people have heard me make before. I ask the Leader, on behalf of this House, to write to media outlets, particularly RTE, and ask them not to besmirch the definition of "republicans" by using the word to describing these intolerant thugs. Whatever else they are, they do not subscribe to the view that Catholics, Protestants and dissenters should share the same space. Perhaps we ask that they be described as "neo-nationalists". That is what they are. There is not an ounce of republicanism left in these people and it matters little that they describe themselves as such. They are not republicans and it cannot be accepted that they should describe themselves as such. They must be ostracised from that tent immediately.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	12	It is imperative that we have a serious and long debate on the report on the activities of Dr. Neary. The report and what happened raise profound issues about the way we do business in Ireland. We have a deferential view of authority which means that nobody must question. The report makes clear that people noticed but they did not feel they had the right, authority or support to challenge it. A midwife began the process of questioning.This issue involves such peculiarities as a formal complaint to the Medical Council being lost. I thought such complaints were dealt with in a proper, orderly fashion because of their importance. I would like to have a serious debate on the broad issues involved.What happened last Saturday was an appalling disgrace. I will not apologise on my own behalf or on behalf of the Irish people for it, other than to state I am sorry we have such people among us. They are not the Irish people. I am no longer prepared to tolerate the kind of nonsense written by a journalist in The Irish Times today. That journalist wrote that for people on the left wing like me to call this a manifestation of drunken bowseyism and not to make excuses for the protesters on the grounds of their alienation from Irish society is to betray the left. I am not betraying the left. I would betray left wing values if I defended a collection of drunken bowsies who poured out of the O’Connell Street pubs and latched onto an issue which was encouraged by their own sectarianism. Their bigotry would just as easily have been directed against immigrants, gays, lesbians or any of a number of categories as the people who wanted to march on Saturday.I wish to point out a fundamental of republicanism. What happened last week is not alone in what we should not allow to be attached to the word "republican". Anybody who shot or killed an Irish Protestant who did not agree with him or her is not fit to be called a republican. This did not begin last Saturday, although it was an ugly, unpleasant manifestation. The concept of shooting or killing somebody because he or she would not let one get what one wanted is anathema to any form of Irish republicanism. The central issue is the appalling behaviour of what I would describe as drunken bowsies, but I would not give them a political title. They were drunk, they were bowsies, they found an issue and they started a row.I believed there was a possibility that some people would try to disrupt that march and I am astonished that nobody in our security services had a back-up plan to deal with it. I am still horrified at the sight of inadequately prepared members of the Garda Síochána in the front line without proper equipment and support being assaulted and it taking so long to provide the response to which they were entitled. One issue in this debate is the sort of society that produces that sort of drunken behaviour. Another issue is how we failed to anticipate what might happen and to have the backup to do something about it. I would like us to debate the issues.
#JohnMinihan	unknown-#JohnMinihan-party	unknown-#JohnMinihan-dob	unknown-#JohnMinihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	13	I join with previous speakers in condemning what occurred on O'Connell Street last Saturday and support the position and courage displayed by members of the Garda Síochána in the situation in which they found themselves. Senator Brian Hayes said there should be a public inquiry. I do not agree. He may mean we need a public debate. I am not sure a public inquiry would get the results we need. I concur with him that, regardless of the outcome, the views held in this country must be debated in public and at length. I hope this House will show leadership on that issue.Thuggery was displayed and Senator Ryan referred correctly to drunken bowsies. Hopefully those people will be identified and brought before the courts. Even more worrying are the string-pullers who orchestrated and gathered those drunken bowsies. On RTE Radio 1 recently an e-mail was read from a school teacher who said students under the age of 18 were canvassed outside as they left school early last week to come to O'Connell Street on Saturday where a fight was guaranteed. We must get to the mobile phone, string-pulling brigade behind these drunken bowsies who will join a riot regardless of the issue. I hope that a Garda investigation will uncover some of these people.I support the Garda's soft-handed approach to the parade. The Minister has made it clear that we could have had a ring of steel around O'Connell Street blocking it off and closing businesses. If that had been done we would complain about the extra costs incurred to marshal a peaceful parade. An operational decision was made by the Garda. It did not work out and matters got out of hand. However, we should not dump on the Garda Síochána over the decision that was made. It needs to be supported.The key message that must emerge from this is that we must learn, as a society, that understated resentments are still being tolerated and public debate is needed to uncover that. Equally, we must support the organs that police the State and show total commitment to the Garda Síochána for the level of commitment it displayed last Saturday.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	14	I remind the House that some 20 Senators have indicated they want to speak, and therefore I must ask Members to be brief.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	15	I, too, join with others in condemning the thuggery that took place on O'Connell Street last weekend. There is a lesson to be learned, namely, that the Garda needs adequate resources to deal with incidents such as this. The force is inadequately resourced at the moment. That is evident from talking to gardaí not alone in the capital but also in rural parts of Ireland. Right across the country elderly people are living alone or in isolated areas and they cannot sleep at night because they are afraid of intruders. This is something about which complaints are made to us, as politicians, on a regular basis. Criminals are running amok in our country. A major problem in the midlands, and indeed in the rest of Ireland, too, is that there is a Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who has no regard for rural communities. As the Leader knows, the Minister has been invited to the midlands several times to address this whole issue. In the Longford-Westmeath division alone there has been a 5% reduction in gardaí since this Administration took office more than nine years ago. Despite the increases in the local population and in the crime rates——

We can be proud as a State that they showed such restraint in what was an extremely dangerous situation for them. Unfortunately, the opportunity to embrace the moment for all peoples on this island to be able to protest peacefully was lost. The propaganda advantage was given to those who probably have equally extreme views, on the other side of the political divide. There are lessons to be learned and I hope the House will have the opportunity, with the Minister attending here, to debate the issue with him.I support the call for a debate into the report by Judge Maureen Harding Clark into the episodes that occurred at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda. The victims experienced harrowing treatment. This must be seen as a public service failure. In that regard, it is essential that the appropriate checks and balances are in place throughout all areas of public services to ensure that situations such as this, whether due to malfunction or whatever, can be detected and rectified. I hope the necessary management evaluation systems will be put in place. This matter is of recent origin. Many of the other matters we deal with in this House are, perhaps, more historic in nature.One issue which struck me was the extensive number of missing files, which put the victims involved at a very serious disadvantage. I welcome the statement from the Minister for Health and Children intimating that the Government will, hopefully, take steps to address that issue. In other situations, again, where investigations were carried out, the number of files missing on a selective basis is astonishing and highly worrying.Will the Leader indicate if we can bring an all-party motion before the House in support of the Kennedy-McCain Bill in the US Senate?

As many Senators have said on a number of occasions, many Irish people are seriously disadvantaged by the current US immigration policy. If an all-party motion were to come before the House the Leader could bring it to the attention of people in the appropriate place in the US in order for us to lend our voice in support of the momentum that is behind that Bill.

We should have a debate on this as soon as possible because, unfortunately, the ethos of the hospital contributed significantly to what happened there. We need to look at what happened in the past but we also need to address the fact that there are public hospitals in this country where the hospital's ethos comes before the ethos of the woman and her consultant, even though that practice may be perfectly legal in this State and the woman may be in a hospital which was not of her choosing. I urge the Leader to arrange to have this debate as soon as possible because this issue is extremely serious for Irish women today, not just the practice of one man over 25 years in one hospital.
#TerryLeyden	unknown-#TerryLeyden-party	unknown-#TerryLeyden-dob	unknown-#TerryLeyden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	25	It would be appropriate for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the House. I understand he is due to make a statement in regard to the riots in Dublin last Saturday. I commend the restraint shown by the leaders of the main political parties in their approach to this issue and in their approach to the Minister who has a very difficult task.I also wish to place on record my respect for the courageous gardaí of all ranks who put their lives at risk to defend the capital and the public.

#TerryLeyden	unknown-#TerryLeyden-party	unknown-#TerryLeyden-dob	unknown-#TerryLeyden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	31	I appreciate that. In the Reclaim the Streets debate in 2002, the gardaí were severely criticised for taking strong and rightful action against thugs at that time. The same applied in 2004. I have looked at the records over that period and it is clear that the Garda did not get much praise——
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	32	Senator Leyden can make those points in the debate.

#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	40	I would very much welcome a debate on the events of last Saturday. We have all been shocked by the revelation of a strain of sectarianism, hooliganism and racism that was evident in last Saturday's events. As other speakers have said, we need to deal with what has been revealed in the events that took place on O'Connell Street last weekend.It is outrageous that the lives of gardaí would be put in jeopardy——

That is the core issue.I would also welcome an early debate on the report of Judge Maureen Harding Clark into medical practices at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda. As Senator Henry noted, the report examined what took place at this hospital over a period of years and the hospital's ethos rather than the activities of just one consultant. We are all thoroughly shocked at what took place. I thank Judge Harding Clark for her thorough, clear and high quality work on our behalf. Certain questions must be asked about how women are treated in maternity hospitals in this country.
#LabhrasOMurchu	unknown-#LabhrasOMurchu-party	unknown-#LabhrasOMurchu-dob	unknown-#LabhrasOMurchu-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	43	We all agree that what took place last Saturday, which has been condemned by all right thinking people, was outrageous. The question has been asked as to whether the group from Northern Ireland should have been allowed to parade in O'Connell Street. The decision to allow the group to march down O'Connell Street was correct, particularly since it came down here to highlight and remember the victims of the war in the North. For this reason, the group should have been shown respect.However, there is a danger that we can overstate the case and in doing so, implicate this country. I listened to the views of visitors to Dublin who took part in a vox pop and not one of them blamed the Irish people for the trouble that occurred. None of them said that they would not return to Ireland and they all agreed that the trouble was the work of a minority. It was not right for some people to look for scapegoats in the first 24 hours after the riots. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was the first to be scapegoated, followed by the Garda Síochána and republicans. This scapegoating serves no purpose.We should examine the positive side of the affair. The Garda Síochána has come out of it——
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	44	The Senator can make these points in the debate.

This is not solely due to the restraint demonstrated by the force but also to the compassion it showed those caught up in the riots. The gardaí put the safety of these people before their own.None of us should use this occasion for political or other purposes.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	46	Many Senators wish to speak.

#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	52	I welcome the opportunity to have an in-depth discussion following the events of last Saturday. Approximately eight years ago, the people on both sides of the Border gave their support to the Good Friday Agreement. The concept of tolerance and acceptance of alternative points of view is at the core of the Agreement. Sadly, the test of tolerance failed on the streets of our capital city last Saturday. We must reflect deeply on the matter. I agree with Senator O'Toole that we must also reflect deeply on the intolerance and sectarianism which, unfortunately, are at the core of the beliefs of too many people on this island.We must also reflect on the language of politics. We speak of reclaiming the streets but we must reclaim the language of politics. Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, the Labour Party and the Progressive Democrats are all republican parties. A group such as Republican Sinn Féin is certainly not a republican party. It is a neo-nationalist Nazi party.

#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	55	I hope the points will be made. If there is to be tolerance, acceptance and understanding on the island, we must challenge the extremists. Senator Ryan referred to drunken bowsies, which was part of the problem. However, we must consider who conducted the mayhem and vandalism, because they were not drunken bowsies. They were professional agitators.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	56	Does the Senator support the call for a debate?

We have taken for granted and ignored these issues because we have been in a comfort zone for too long.
#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	58	I did not think I would ever find myself being an apologist for the Orange Order. However, it is unfair to tar all its members with the one brush. It is an organisation which includes many different members, some of whom are trying to open up and some of whom are trying to strengthen that aspect of their culture which is conservative rather than aggressive. We should recognise that aspect.I support and commend gardaí on what they did both in regard to pre-planning and in the execution of their duties on Saturday. There should be two debates, one on how gardaí deal with street demonstrations and the possibility of trouble and the other, which is a deeper question, on how society deals with multiculturalism and tolerance. Perhaps we could link the issue with other matters, including celebrating 1916 and asking ourselves how the aspirations and values of the proclamation can be expressed in a modern, multicultural Ireland. These are two separate issues. I agree with Senator Minihan that it would be better to deal with the issue in that way than by a public inquiry.I support Senator Henry and others in asking for a broader debate on the report into what happened at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital. We must debate the choices people have and the ethos with which they will be treated in public hospitals.
#JimHiggins	unknown-#JimHiggins-party	unknown-#JimHiggins-dob	unknown-#JimHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	59	I join with the other speakers in supporting the call for a long debate on what happened on Saturday. I commend Senator Maurice Hayes, in particular. When people were going in different directions because of the short timespan, he wrote an excellent article on his analysis of what happened and where we should be going. He will make a valuable input to the debate in this House.On the issue of decentralisation, figures published at the weekend show conclusively that this proposal is dead and buried. It was supposed to happen in 2007. It was a fait accompli that 10,000 civil servants would be transferred to the regions. It is obvious that the uptake is so negligible that we can either erect the tombstone or try to revitalise and regenerate the programme. I want to see the programme go ahead but it is obvious this will not happen. It was a botched, “back of the brown envelope” job which was not properly conceived. There was no dialogue on the issue and we need to have a debate on it.

#JimHiggins	unknown-#JimHiggins-party	unknown-#JimHiggins-dob	unknown-#JimHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	62	Two weeks ago in the other House, the Fine Gael leader, Deputy Kenny, raised with the Taoiseach the possibility of an agreement between all parties to my relinquishing my Seanad seat in order to give it to a representative of the Irish emigrant community. These are a forgotten people, the Irish diaspora, to whom we pay an amount of lip service.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	63	The House does not have time to debate that matter this evening.
#JimHiggins	unknown-#JimHiggins-party	unknown-#JimHiggins-dob	unknown-#JimHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	64	The Taoiseach's reply was civilised and generous. Last week, the same issue was raised by the Fine Gael leader in this House, Deputy Brian Hayes. In contrast, the reaction from the Leader of the House was far from generous. She was very ungracious and feline in what she said. She spoke about me getting a wadge of money and not being here. First, I am here when I can be. When I am here, I have something to say, which is worth listening to. Second, in regard to getting a wadge of money, this is the wadge of money I want to give up. Third, her comments were a little churlish coming from someone who has approximately four incomes between pensions, etc.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	65	We are not debating the issue.

I agree there is a certain cohort among our community which was opposed to this parade because of those who would march in it. For once, however, I find myself in agreement with Senator Ryan that it did not matter to most of the rioters who was marching; the parade was merely an excuse for sheer thuggery by an out-of-control mob.However, we must also look to the reasons for this event. It is a more violent manifestation of what is already happening in our society. Such violence and anti-social behaviour is happening to a lesser degree in every town and city and it is something we can no longer tolerate. It may be the case that there are insufficient deterrents. My learned friends who deal with such behaviour in the courts are not applying the rigours of the law. We must introduce more cases of mandatory sentencing so that effective deterrents are in place to finally bring an end to this type of thuggery and yobbishness.

Some Members of both Houses have been critical of the training gardaí receive in the Garda College in Templemore. They may change their minds following Saturday's events. Gardaí demonstrated in those circumstances the high level of effective training they received in Templemore.

I call on the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children to immediately establish a forum where patients with legitimate complaints can be heard. Consultants and psychiatrists who were struck off elsewhere have been appointed in this State. As a member of the Mid-Western Health Board, I was aware of complaints regarding the abuse of psychiatric patients by a consultant who had been struck off in another country. It was like banging one's head against a stone wall to have those complaints listened to and investigated. This is unsatisfactory and it continues to happen.

#NoelCoonan	unknown-#NoelCoonan-party	unknown-#NoelCoonan-dob	unknown-#NoelCoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	90	Yes.

#GeraldineFeeney	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-party	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-dob	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	91	I support other Senators in calling for a debate on what happened on the streets of Dublin last Saturday. I congratulate the members of the Garda Síochána for their wonderful conduct under the circumstances. When one looks at the television coverage and sees the behaviour of the young gardaí, male and female, one must be so proud of how they kept the situation under control and brought matters to an end within a short time. I agree with Senator Bradford that whoever were the rioters, they acted under no republican banner. No political party would claim them as republicans; there were no republicans on O'Connell Street last Saturday.I congratulate Judge Maureen Harding Clark on her report. I have only glanced through it but I sat on the Medical Council that heard the inquiry into Dr. Michael Neary. For three years I listened to the harrowing and heartbreaking stories of the women affected. I have another point to make in this regard.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	92	The Senator should be brief.

One must imagine a situation where a person who underwent a hip operation wakes up in hospital to find his or her leg has been amputated. Such a situation might arise once or twice. If it were to happen a third time, we can be sure every man, woman and child would shout "Stop". The women patients at our Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda had nobody to shout "Stop" on their behalf. When this issue is debated, we must ask why the senior clinicians, those of the same seniority as Dr. Neary, did not shout "Stop". Why did the anaesthetist and pathologist who were involved in each of these cases not put up their hands?

#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	96	I make no apologies for returning to the subject of Sellafield. The British Government this week announced its intention to privatise the nuclear plant at Sellafield. While we have been in discussions with the British authorities about closing it down, the reality is it may soon be outside the direct control of the British Government. This debate is urgently required and it should happen immediately.
#AnnOrmonde	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-party	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-dob	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	97	I support the call for a debate on the awful disturbances that took place on Saturday. I ask the Leader for a wide-ranging debate so that all Members can express their views. The youngsters of 16 and 17 years of age who took part in these disturbances are drop-outs from society. We must ask why such behaviour arises given the success of our economy. Why does our quality of life seem to be deteriorating in some respects? The debate must be wider than the events of Saturday because there are frightening implications for the future of society.In regard to the medical activities of Dr. Neary in Drogheda, we must ask why such an authoritarian administration was in place for such a long time. I would like to dwell on that aspect when the debate takes place.
#PaulCoghlan	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-party	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-dob	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	98	In the absence of water cannon and other armoury, the Garda did well on Saturday. We would not, however, wish such events to recur. I add my voice to the call for a debate when I will discuss the other points I wish to make on this issue.It is some weeks since we spoke about the plight of the Great Southern Hotels but there is still an absence of clarity. The Leader was disposed towards a debate on this issue and I earnestly call again for it to take place. The hotels are a long time in State ownership and many jobs are at risk. The Minister must come to this House to debate the matter.We are all concerned at the plight of those living in the beautiful Black Valley in Kerry. The Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources visited the area, gained an understanding of the issue and reached unanimity on the way forward. Last week, however, the Minister declined the paltry €10,000 for the feasibility study required to decide on the best system. This was a pilot case which would solve the matter for all the other communities throughout the State facing similar difficulties.
#CamillusGlynn	unknown-#CamillusGlynn-party	unknown-#CamillusGlynn-dob	unknown-#CamillusGlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	99	I add my voice to those who called for a debate on the events of last Saturday. Those who perpetrated the violence were not republicans but thugs who are the dregs of society. It was a missed opportunity because no republican worthy of the title would miss a chance to build bridges over troubled waters. These people, however, were intent on burning bridges. The gardaí did a fantastic job and I agree with Senator Minihan who said if they had done otherwise, some would have said it was a waste of resources and they would have been accused of killing a midge with a sledge.In regard to Judge Harding Clark's report, as a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, I heard a report from Patient Focus some years ago. There is no doubt the revelations on that occasion would have been a worthy script for a horror film. It brings into focus some fundamental questions, including the question of audit of activities, which was referred to by others. Irrespective of his or her position or profession, nobody should be outside the realm of audit, as happened with regard to the individual concerned in this case.If people had been doing their job, this would not have happened. In my capacity as chairman of the former Midland Health Board for two years, I was consulted by the chief executive officer under the 1970 Act on his decision to suspend three colleagues, which he was obliged to do. I willingly told him to do what was correct. There can be no hiding place for people who perform as this individual did.

Many people were cruelly and callously denied that allowance by the previous Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan. I hope the Minister will not appeal this decision to the Supreme Court.

#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	102	We had a debate on the issue some time ago. We fought for the very decision the High Court made yesterday. Will the Leader contact the Minister for Education and Science immediately on this issue and ask her not to appeal the decision? Those who wish to continue with their postgraduate studies should not have to go to the courts to establish their entitlements. We talk about poverty and anybody who heard the person who was successful yesterday on television and radio would clearly understand the position in which he and many others found themselves in the past year.

#PaschalMooney	unknown-#PaschalMooney-party	unknown-#PaschalMooney-dob	unknown-#PaschalMooney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	105	I was reminded of a comment made by Miriam Lord in her excellent analysis of last weekend. Senator Minihan referred to string pullers with their mobile phones which indicates there was an orchestrated, focused attack rather than something involving a yobbish, random element. When they decided to relocate from O'Connell Street to Leinster House, the quote from one of these young thugs was "The Leinster House, where is that?" It shows it is not enough to say we need to educate people. Perhaps we are, to some degree, talking in a vacuum.I echo what Senator O'Toole said and I support the call for a deeper debate on this issue, although not necessarily an inquiry. We should have more than just statements because democracy is a fragile flower and we were lulled into a false feeling of security in the post-Agreement era, about which Senator Brian Hayes spoke. Senator O'Toole speaks for me and I am sure for many other Irish people in that we did not think there would be any difficulty about people with a particular point of view marching down the main street of Dublin.For some considerable time, a parallel universe has been in operation in this society where people do not recognise the legitimacy of the State and the right of the Garda Síochána to speak for us and who believe their army is the legitimate army of this country. I make no apologies for saying it is a wake up call for democracy and that what went on last Saturday may not be an isolated incident. In a sense, it did not surprise me because anybody who has gone to Lansdowne Road in the past few years will have seen people wearing the jersey of a particular football club. Given the number of sectarian comments spat out by these people at somebody who might have at some time played for the opposing club, one should not have been too surprised to see the same element on O'Connell Street last Saturday. It is all bound up in the attitude that perhaps we have been silent for too long in tolerating naked sectarianism in our society. Perhaps it is time we, as politicians, took a stand on this issue.While I fully understand Senator Higgins's noble aspirations in regard to Irish emigrants, I do not share his view because the diaspora is diverse and complex. Who would represent the diaspora if he stood down? Perhaps we should look into our own hearts and acknowledge that politicians in both Houses should address the long-standing neglect of the issues raised by the diaspora. We, in this elected Chamber, should address those issues rather than pay lip-service to appointing an individual who may or may not represent the diaspora.
#JohnPaulPhelan	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-party	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	106	I agree with the point made by my colleague, Senator Ulick Burke, about the back to education allowance and yesterday's High Court decision. The Minister for Education and Science should come into the House to debate where we go from here. I will not repeat all that was said.I join colleagues in expressing disgust at what happened on the streets of Dublin last weekend. I was a bit taken aback by comments I heard from some Senators. I do not believe all the supporters of a particular soccer club are sectarian just because they wear its jersey. I am a supporter of the club in question and I have a jersey but I do not believe in throwing stones or protesting against people who want to march down O'Connell Street. I do not agree that the alleged bigotry of the Orange Order should be an excuse for the behaviour of these people last Saturday. They bring disgrace on us. They call themselves republicans and wear the tricolour over their shoulders but they do not know what it means. Surely the essence of republicanism is a tolerance of diversity which they clearly do not have. They should not be referred to as republicans. We should have a debate on this issue.I agree with colleagues who called for a debate on the report of Judge Harding Clark and the activities which went on for many years in the hospital in Drogheda. We should hold it as soon as possible. There should be recompense for the women whose lives were ruined by the activities in the hospital.I agree with my colleague, Senator Higgins, who called for debate on decentralisation. It was clear over the weekend that the Government's plans for decentralisation are in tatters.

The Minister for Finance or the Minister of State at that Department must come to the House to discuss the issue as soon as possible.Will the Leader arrange a debate on the provision of communications infrastructure? I refer in particular to the seemingly imminent sale of Eircom by Valencia to an Australian consortium which seems intent on further downgrading our communications network. It would be useful if the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources could come to the House. Last week representatives of the Australian consortium said they had called on the Minister as a matter of courtesy before going any further with this proposed venture. We should request the Minister to come to the House to hear his views on the future of our communications infrastructure.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	109	There has been considerable discussion here today on the Irish diaspora. We could do something positive and support Senator Jim Walsh's call for a debate on the Kennedy-McCain Bill. It would be particularly opportune in light of the upcoming St. Patrick's Day celebrations when many Irish politicians will travel to the United States and have an opportunity to meet their counterparts.Considerable debate on that Bill is taking place in the US. There are a number of counter proposals to the Bill and there is little doubt there will be a compromise on it. I am concerned about some of the compromises coming forward. It would be helpful if a resolution from this House were put forward to assist and support the efforts of the politicians who will travel to the United States to put forward that clear message from this House. I recognise that the Leader will have a difficult job in trying to arrange a debate on that Bill between now and the St. Patrick's Day celebrations. I ask if that could be done with the agreement of Members on all sides of the House.
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	110	I join in calling for a debate in the aftermath of last Saturday's riot and request that it be extended to include tolerance towards minorities in our society. I compliment the gardaí on their bravery and restraint in defending people and property. It is not the first time they have had to do so against so-called republicans such as we had last week. It was a disgrace.On my local radio station on Monday there was almost total condemnation of the riot. However, I was appalled that a text was received from a guy who said he was delighted to be there among the thugs throwing stones at gardaí. I hope that text will be forwarded to the Garda authorities for their investigation into the riot. I join Senator Minihan in hoping that all the CCTV footage that is available will be furnished to gardaí and that every one of the culprits will be apprehended and brought to justice.

The Minister has agreed to come to the House from 2.20 p.m. to 3.20 p.m. tomorrow. Before Members intervene I point out that he will come here to give an account of what happened in Dublin last Saturday. That will involve the factual matter of his reporting on what happened. He does not have to do that, but we telephoned him on Monday about this matter. He will report to this House on what happened.As Members spoke, I was aware of the need for a second debate. We will proceed with a debate on the facts of what happened last Saturday between 2.20 p.m. and 3.20 p.m. tomorrow. That debate is not to take from the need for a wider debate which we hope can be presaged——

#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	115	That is a matter for tomorrow's Order of Business. I wanted to explain the position as many questions were raised on the matter.I agree that those who took part in the riots were not Nationalists or republicans; they were thugs. What happened last Saturday was simple thuggery of the worst kind. From the media coverage of the riots, I saw a relatively young person run away with a big bag of goods — a looter from a shop. What I saw reminded me of a bad manifestation of a Seán O'Casey play.During all the years I have served in public life, the Neary report on what happened in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda is about the worst subject on which we have ever had a debate. The exploitative and condescending way in which women and their wombs were dealt with was extraordinary. A woman looks on her womb as having the potential for fecundity. However, in these cases it was whipped away without a word, only to be mentioned months later almost as an aside. It was indicative of the culture that prevailed at the time between the consultant and the patient, to which Senator Henry referred in a broader context. Clearly, that attitude is not evident now.I had considerable experience of that some years ago with my dear husband. That condescending attitude was indicative of how consultants treated patients at that time. The attitude was that patients did not need to know information so they were not given it. The attitude was patronising and to the effect that "You should stay back in your bed, Missus".It was appalling for women to be treated in that way and quite the worst thing with which we have had to deal. I hope everybody continues to highlight it. It can be very easy for matters such as this — where women have been violated, as a Senator said — to be swept under the carpet. We will have a debate on the matter. We are trying to arrange a debate on the Neary report for next week.Senator O'Toole rightly spoke about thuggery and the failure of tolerance. There was also a failure to accept difference among people. Those people were not republicans. We cannot say that enough. I do not care what they said they were but they were not republicans of any fashion or hue, not in the meaning of the word.I agree with Senator Ryan's comments on the activities of Dr. Neary. He called the people involved in last Saturday's riot "drunken bowsies", which is what they were, as they ran out of the pubs. Regardless of what the march was about, they were going to join the fray.Senator Minihan supported the courage displayed by gardaí, with which I very much agree. He mentioned the CCTV coverage and I understand that footage has been made available to gardaí. Senator Bannon raised the issue of the thuggery in O'Connell Street but called also for a debate on law and order in rural Ireland.Senator Jim Walsh expressed his support for gardaí. He said he regarded the Neary report as highlighting a failure in the public service. He also raised the case of the missing files. The Senator also called for an all-party motion on the Kennedy-McCain bill, about which we will speak after the Order of Business.Senator Henry called for a debate on the ethos in hospitals as it affects women, with which I agree. Senator Leyden referred to respect for gardaí and other matters.Senator O'Meara called for a debate on last Saturday's activities and said people have a perfect right to be able to walk down O'Connell Street. She also raised the Neary report. I agree with her praise for Judge Harding Clark. I do not have the report as I do not believe copies of it were put in Members' pigeon holes. However, from what we read, the judge appears to have produced a matter of fact, sensible report.Senator Ó Murchú said people should have been allowed to march last Saturday. He also referred to the Orange Order.Senator Bradford referred to the Good Friday Agreement and pointed out that what has not happened in that regard is a respect for diversity, to which we signed up.Senator Maurice Hayes made the point that there are many shades of orangeism. He also raised the matter of having two debates — one on last Saturday's events, which is necessary as a matter of reportage and a deeper debate. The Senator supported Senator Henry's call for a debate on the Neary report.Senator Higgins praised the comments of Senator Maurice Hayes and spoke about decentralisation. I refute the notion that decentralisation is dead and buried. He said also that he would not relinquish his Seanad seat until he got somebody from the diaspora to take it.I want to respond to what I regard as a very snide remark by Senator Higgins. He was not here when I stood up in this House and gave a very full report of the rendition issue. I spoke to each member of the committee privately. I said that it was not my wish that it was ending in this manner.There is much idle comment as to the reason I was not here last Wednesday to vote. I am very clear on these issues. I always vote with my party. I was not here because last October I accepted a public engagement, and the Whip will bear me out. I was fully paired for that matter, despite idle chatter from another corner of the room.With regard to pensions, I do not have a teacher's pension. I gave it up voluntarily. I hope every other teacher would do the same. I have a public service pension which I earned. I want to make it clear that I never took money in my life for which I did not work.

I have only ever worked in the public service, first as a teacher, for which I was paid. I am sure the Senator does not object to that. I did not take a pension because I did not think it was right. When I went into public life it followed that I would then take a public service pension, which I do. The idea that I take a wadge of money for nothing is factually untrue. I regret that people take a wallop of money for which they do not work. It is incorrect and unethical. Be that as it may——

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	136	I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the Seanad today on the subject of the national drugs strategy.Sometimes much of Government's work goes unseen and unnoticed by the general public. Despite the growth and diversity in methods of communication, it is still quite difficult to put our message across in some detail. Today I am happy to discuss what the Government is doing, and wishes to do, to disrupt drugs misuse and to alleviate the problems it causes.Tackling drug misuse is an international issue and is not an easy task. The United Nations Office on Drugs estimates that the value of the global illicit drug market for the year 2003 was over $429 billion, an obscene amount of money when one considers the damage done by illicit drugs. It has been claimed that, after oil and arms, the illegal drug market is the third most profitable in the world. This illustrates the scale of the task we face.The use of drugs, particularly strongly addictive substances such as heroin and cocaine, has numerous social and economic costs. Drug-related deaths, blood-borne disease and other health consequences, are only part of the picture. These costs affect the individual, the family, the community and the State. No country has overcome the drugs problem. Neither the relatively heavy-handed approach of the United States, nor the softer touch of the Netherlands, has resulted in a drug-free population. There are no fully tested models to use; there are no quick and easy answers. Our national drugs strategy, however, which runs until 2008, demonstrates the Government's commitment to addressing drug misuse proactively and decisively. The strategy's balanced and complementary focus on reducing drug-related harm, and continued efforts to disrupt the operation of the drug market, are valid policy goals.There are encouraging signs of progress in recent years, whether in the areas of drug seizures, the expansion of treatment services or prevention programmes in schools. The landscape has changed very significantly recently and we must acknowledge the work being done. While there is no room for complacency, it is important that we do no lose sight of the positive developments. We have made solid progress and will continue to do so in the future.The drugs situation is dynamic and changing and our policies need to be flexible to meet those changes. The progress made in recent years is the result of co-operation and partnership. While working in partnership can be difficult at times, we must focus on the fact that working in a united way is more beneficial than taking a fragmented approach.The national drugs strategy addresses several aspects of the problem of drug misuse, namely, supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research. Implementation of the strategy, across a range of Departments and agencies, is co-ordinated by my officials in the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. We launched the strategy in 2001, having recognised that we needed to address the issue of drug misuse across Government, not just through one Department or agency. In doing so it was apparent that we would have little success if we did not work in partnership with communities. We have made considerable progress in implementing the 100 actions set out in the strategy. This is borne out by the review of the strategy, published last year. The review process included a comprehensive public consultation through which we engaged with and listened to communities.The review was overseen by a steering group, chaired by my Department and made up of the relevant Departments and agencies as well as the community and voluntary sectors. It sought to assess the impact and direction of the strategy at its mid-point and concentrated on identifying beneficial adjustments to the strategy.The steering group found that the current aims and objectives of the drugs strategy are fundamentally sound. The review found encouraging signs of progress since 2001 when the strategy was first launched. This suggests that the Government's current approach to tackling the drug problem is proving to be effective. The review highlighted the need to re-focus priorities and accelerate the roll-out and implementation of various key actions in the remaining period of the strategy up to 2008. In this context, a number of new actions and amendments were identified. Rehabilitation emerged as an important issue during the consultation process. It was felt by many that although there have been significant improvements in treatment provision, a lot more work is needed with regard to rehabilitation. A working group chaired by my Department was established last September to develop an integrated rehabilitation provision as the fifth pillar of the strategy.The working group includes representatives from a range of Departments and agencies involved in delivering rehabilitation services, as well as representatives from the national drugs strategy team, the national advisory committee on drugs and the community and voluntary sectors. The terms of reference of the group include examining the current provision of rehabilitation services in Ireland and recommending actions to develop an integrated rehabilitation service for the future.The working group has held a number of meetings, as well as consultations with interested parties. It is envisaged that its recommendations will be finalised by mid-year and that it will report to the interdepartmental group on drugs and to the Cabinet committee on social inclusion at that stage. Central among the bodies involved in dealing with the problem of drugs misuse is the national drugs strategy team. This is a cross-departmental team involving Departments and agencies operating in the drugs field with representation from the community and voluntary sectors. It plays a vital role in overseeing the work of the local and regional drugs task forces.The local drugs task forces were established by the Government in 1997 in the areas worst affected by drugs. Twelve of the 14 in total are located in Dublin, with the others in Bray and Cork. Membership of the task forces includes representatives of all the relevant agencies such as the Health Service Executive, the Garda Síochána, the probation and welfare service, the relevant local authority, elected public representatives, the youth service, FÁS, voluntary agencies and community representatives. The local drugs task forces prepare local action plans, which include a range of measures dealing with treatment, rehabilitation, education, prevention and curbing local supply. In addition, the task forces provide a mechanism for the co-ordination of services in these areas, while at the same time allowing local communities and voluntary organisations to participate in the planning, design and delivery of those services.There is no doubt that the local drugs task forces have played a very important role in recent years in tackling the drug problem and they continue to be key players in dealing with the problem in the worst affected areas. Many services and facilities have been established in recent years through the local drugs task force system. Since 1997, almost €125 million has been allocated to support this work across the 14 task force areas. In overall terms, over 450 community-based projects have been established, employing more than 300 staff and delivering services such as advice and support for drug misusers and their families; community drug teams offering treatment; outreach and crisis intervention services; and drug training programmes for community groups. The focus of the task forces is on the development of community-based initiatives to link in with and add value to the programmes and services already being delivered or planned by the statutory agencies in the areas. In recent months I have allocated approximately €850,000 to 15 projects under the emerging needs fund and with the finalisation of much increased financial allocations for 2006, I envisage bringing the total allocations under this fund to over €3 million in the near future.The success of the local drugs task forces can be largely attributed to the positive and active involvement of local communities. I look forward to the same active involvement from communities in the regions in the implementation of all the regional drugs task force plans.The creation of the regional drugs task forces, covering all parts of the country outside the 14 areas, is further proof that the Government is delivering on the commitments in An Agreed Programme for Government. The regional plans were submitted last year and approved in September. Allocations totalling approximately €5 million annually were made to the ten regional drugs task forces. With this funding the regional drugs task forces have begun to implement a range of drugs programmes in communities across the regions.Members will be aware that drugs are not just an issue for Dublin and the establishment of the regional drugs task forces show that the Government has fully recognised this fact. Furthermore, I envisage the level of funding will be increased in future years as the regional drugs task forces get up and running. Drugs misuse is a complex issue which is not confined to urban areas or to one region of the country.The illicit drug market can be read as having three interrelated levels. The global market incorporates drug production and international trafficking. The next tier involves the importation and distribution of drugs at a national level. The final tier is that of the local drugs market. The national drugs strategy specifies a number of challenging supply reduction targets for the Garda Síochána in terms of all drug seizures and these targets are being met.The success of Garda operations has resulted in significant drug seizures. Drugs with an estimated street value of approximately €49 million were seized in 2002, rising to €100 million in 2003 and to €132 million in 2004. Successes such as the big increase in seizures of cannabis resin, amphetamines, cocaine and ecstasy in 2004, are testament to the focus that our law enforcement agencies have placed on supply control over the period of the strategy to date. Customs and Excise has seized almost €197 million worth of illegal drugs between 1999 and 2005. I have no doubt that such success will continue especially with the recent acquisition of a mobile X-ray scanner and increased numbers of drug detection dogs.The young people's facilities and services fund was established by the Government in 1998 to assist in the development of youth facilities, including sport and recreational facilities and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop. The main aim of the fund is to attract at risk young people in disadvantaged areas into these facilities and activities and divert them away from the dangers of substance abuse. The target group of the programme is young people in the age range of ten to 21 years. Approximately €99 million has been allocated from the fund for the development these youth facilities. Many of these investments have been made in areas where, traditionally, there has been a dearth of facilities in the past and where there was very little proactive encouragement given to at risk young people to become involved in activities and programmes as alternatives to drug misuse.The Health Service Executive has also made great strides in the provision of treatment. Almost 8,000 heroin misusers are receiving methadone treatment, well over double the number treated in 1997. The estimates from the national advisory committee on drugs indicate that the number of heroin users has begun to fall in Dublin and has stabilised at relatively low levels nationwide. In order to help prevent recovering addicts from relapsing, approximately 1,000 places are available for recovering drug misusers under the special FÁS community employment scheme.The social, personal and health education, SPHE, programme is compulsory in all primary and post-primary schools. It provides young people with the knowledge and self-confidence to say "No" to drugs. The national drugs awareness campaign contains four phases and is aimed at different societal groupings.The joint drug prevalence survey was undertaken in partnership between the national advisory committee on drugs and the drugs and alcohol information and research unit in Northern Ireland. It is hoped to conduct another such survey later in the year. In 2005 I launched four pilot cocaine treatment projects to examine different methods of treatment for cocaine use. Independent consultants have been engaged to conduct an evaluation of the pilot projects. The four projects to be rolled out will be concentrating on intravenous cocaine users, poly-drug users using cocaine, problematic intranasal cocaine users and problematic female cocaine users.The strategy covers all illicit drugs and action was taken in that regard late last year, following the sad death of a young man who had consumed magic mushrooms.I wish to assure the House that there will be no relaxation in the current classification of cannabis. It is my view that a change in the law on the possession of cannabis, or a reclassification of the drug, would be of no benefit whatsoever in tackling drug abuse. It would aggravate the problem because it has been proven that long-term cannabis usage can trigger mental illness, such as schizophrenia and depression.The Government has proved itself to be committed to tackling the drugs problem. This is made patently clear by our financial investment in the area. In 2004, the allocation for drugs initiatives was €26.756 million. This was increased by 18% to €31.5 million last year. The recently published Revised Estimates Volume provides for €43 million for 2006, which is an increase of 37% on last year's allocation. It represents a rise of 60% on the 2004 figure. One may claim that those figures are small but it is important to realise that once projects are piloted and evaluated they are mainstreamed and then transferred to the Department of Education and Science, the Garda Síochána, a local authority or the Health Service Executive. There is probably another €25 million worth of projects that started at local drugs task force level, which have been mainstreamed out and where the funds have been transferred.I wish to restate the Government's commitment to playing its part in the efforts to prevent drug abuse. Tackling the drug problem is a key priority for the Government and will continue to be so. Few areas of Government, if any, have enjoyed such an increased level of financial commitment.I thank Senators for allowing me to address the House. I look forward to hearing their comments.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	137	I welcome the Minister of State to the House and acknowledge the personal interest he has taken in this area. He knows what is happening on the ground and is an advocate of action to prevent drug abuse.It would be remiss of us not to refer to what occurred in Dublin last Saturday. On today's Order of Business there were many comments on what might be the underlying causes of last Saturday's catastrophe. Emphasis was placed on the responsibility of the Garda Síochána, including Garda supervisors, as well as the strategy beforehand and what sort of pre-planning was carried out. Senators also referred to underlying causes, including the motivation of those involved.I wish to focus on a certain element, which comprised young people on drugs. Anecdotal evidence is available that some, if not many, of these young people were on drugs at the time. That leaves us with a serious dilemma in terms of how we move forward with this debate. The Minister of State's Department is tied into it because we cannot deal with drug abuse sporadically. We must consider all aspects of the problem.In his initial remarks, the Minister of State said that much of the Government's work goes unseen and unnoticed by the public. I respect that work. Unfortunately, however, the public has noticed that some work is not going on. Last Saturday, people could see that young people had taken drugs, although I know there was a lot of alcohol involved also. There were other underlying motivating factors as well but drug abuse was evident.We find ourselves in a serious crisis, witnessing for the first time a two-tier society. The Minister of State and Senator Brady will know that if there were people on drugs last Saturday it is not a one-off situation because it is happening every day of the week. Members of the Garda Síochána have to put up with this type of behaviour daily in certain areas of Dublin because young and not so young people are off their heads on drugs. Television coverage has brought the problem into the public domain due to the magnitude of what occurred last Saturday.The Minister of State, my fellow Senators and the Garda Síochána know that situation is not new. Members of the Garda Síochána are at the coal face in dealing with this ongoing problem every day and that is why we find ourselves in a major dilemma. The Minister of State is making a genuine and credible attempt to fight the war on drugs but gardaí are on the frontline and are not winning that daily battle. Gardaí to whom I have spoken say they do not have the answers because it is as if this problem is insoluble. The difficulty will not go away unless we come up with answers to deal with drug abuse in cities and towns.As regards the deficit in community policing, there are many proactive local authorities and politicians who want to tackle crime. Local authority members want to work hand in glove with gardaí and others involved in trying to sort out crime. New legislation has been introduced by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform but local council representatives must become involved in the mechanisms for dealing with crime.Three weeks ago, Donegal County Council passed a motion, tabled by my colleague Councillor Bernie McGuinness, inviting the local Garda chief superintendent to attend the council chamber. The aim is to see how the council and the Garda Síochána can work more closely, proactively and productively to deal with drug abuse.Community policing is not happening but there must be better communication between local communities and the Garda Síochána. Communities are frustrated because gardaí may be landing en bloc or may lack inside knowledge. A proper mechanism should be established to link members of the Garda Síochána and those working locally against drug abuse. Currently, however, communities have little confidence in the procedures being used to combat this serious illness.As regards rehabilitation and reintegration, more emphasis must be placed on pilot projects in satellite towns outside Dublin. There are three successful pilot projects in Dublin but such projects are required elsewhere. The Minister of State acknowledged that such issues also arise in rural towns the length and breadth of the country. We must examine the possibility of providing more funding for these projects.The Minister of State said that the United States has not solved the drugs problem. That is accurate. The Minister of State also referred to the Netherlands, which uses the softly-softly approach and still has not come up with all the answers. However, the reality on the ground for Ireland as an island is very much about policing the harbours. That is not an easy task, and is a very frustrating one for many people involved when they see resources for harbour patrols and so on being taken back. Today, there are more drugs than fish coming through our harbours. That is a sad reality for an island community when we have invested millions of euro into our harbour development and fishing fleet. Thirty or 40 years ago, if one said there were more drugs than fish coming through our harbours, people would have laughed, but that is the reality. More and more restrictive measures and procedures have been applied to fishermen out trying to earn a living for their families while we apply no measures or restrictions on drug importation at our harbours, the drug ports of entry.We must find where the drugs originate. I know marine affairs are not in the portfolio of the Minister of State. It is a matter with which many Ministers find it difficult to deal, and they do not stay long in the area, but Ministers with responsibility for marine affairs are putting more pressures and restrictions on the fishing industry than we are on the drug industry.Last Saturday saw the emergence of a new generation of drug users. A few university graduates of the 1970s recently got in touch with me to say they had done extensive research on the drugs problem in inner city Dublin in the 1970s. The fear now is that we are looking at a second generation of drug users. Even though the evidence is only anecdotal, we should consider the social problems of inner city Dublin with regard to these new sons and daughters. Are we to continue considering new solutions? We must still look at preventative measures for the third generation. We must look at rolling out social and youth work programmes, youth facilities, community facilities and youth workers in every town and village in the country. We owe it to this third generation of sons and daughters in our cities and countryside.I approve of the Minister of State saying that at-risk young people must be considered and coming up with a definition, but there is no definition for an "at-risk young person" because every young person born in this country is at risk. We owe it to them and to their parents to ensure proper procedures and facilities are in place to prevent them engaging in anti-social behaviour, such as we saw last Saturday, or becoming caught up in drugs. That is a debate for another day.The Departments are not working together on a proper strategy. The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs is going one way, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is going another and the Department of Social and Family Affairs in yet another. The direction is not sufficiently clear.

I cannot agree with Senator McHugh's last point about the lack of co-ordination. The previous Government was the first in the history of the State to have a social inclusion committee.

The drug strategy introduced in late 2001 was a very far-sighted initiative and has paid very significant dividends on the streets. Whatever about the input by people on drugs to the rioting last Saturday, it is not true that the vast majority of the rioters were from Dublin's north inner city, as certain commentators stated. The addresses of those arrested show they came from all over the city.We deal with the drugs issue every day. Dublin has probably the most active local drugs task force in the country. It was one of the first to be set up. Contrary to popular myth, the task forces were not set up under Deputy Rabbitte when he was in Government. He initiated the idea but unfortunately, when Fianna Fáil got into government, we found there was no money to implement the strategy. We allocated the money.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	141	The Senator should stop playing politics and discuss the issue. He is talking of events in 1996 and 1997, more than ten years ago.
#CyprianBrady	unknown-#CyprianBrady-party	unknown-#CyprianBrady-dob	unknown-#CyprianBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	142	I am discussing the issue. I am laying the foundation for what I am about to say, namely that we are making progress on drugs misuse. The Senator cannot just dismiss things for the sake of it. The drugs trade was estimated to be worth about €1 billion in this country last year. Some 300 kg of cocaine alone were seized last year. In 2004, 18 kg was seized. The consensus is that any drug seizure represents about 10% of what is getting through, and by extrapolation, one is talking of a serious sum of money. There were 18 gangland killings last year, more than half linked in some way with the drugs trade.I commend the gardaí on the work they are doing and urge the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to increase funding for drugs squads around the country. The youth diversion programmes have been mentioned. In the north inner city we take part in the community policing forum. The criminal justice Bill, due shortly, will allow for such fora to be set up around the country. The north inner city community policing forum is a huge success in the area, with face to face interaction between the community, the gardaí, Dublin City Council and the public representatives. It has paid huge dividends, particularly regarding drugs issues. People can go in confidence to gardaí without anyone knowing, and pass on useful information.Kids and young people will always want to experiment. We must educate them in how to protect themselves from getting involved in drugs. There is no doubt the availability of drugs throughout the country, but particularly in Dublin city pubs and clubs, has increased, but we must educate our children in how to deal with those who approach them selling drugs. Peer pressure plays a major role in young people first becoming involved in drugs.The Minister of State has noted the initiatives taken and the public information provided. The social, personal and health education programme or SPHE is now compulsory in schools and has played a major role. One of the pillars of the drugs strategy is treatment and I am glad to see that following the review, rehabilitation is now part of the strategy too. The debate on methadone treatment is ongoing. We now have a population of users and ex-users who have been on methadone for a number of years, and a review of the system is needed. Alternatives are available. Total abstinence programmes throughout Dublin and the entire country are proving very effective on the ground.New drugs are now available. Cocaine has been mentioned and as the Minister of State noted, the drugs strategy is actively tackling the increase in cocaine supplies. It is interesting to look at the Garda drug seizures from last year. In December 2005 alone, 3.5 tonnes of cannabis, 4,500 ecstasy tablets and 12 kg of cocaine were seized. Crack cocaine is a particularly lethal form of drug. It is easily produced, cheap, has devastating effects and there is no treatment for it. Whatever we went through during the 1970s and 1980s with heroin, crack cocaine will be ten times more difficult to deal with. We must examine new ways of tackling these problems.Methamphetamine and LSD are new. At present, methamphetamines have a devastating effect in the United States. It is seen as a more serious issue than the heroin epidemic of previous times. We must examine these issues now. Task forces throughout the country have made suggestions. The Minister and the Department will listen to them. The local and regional task forces have proved extremely successful.Major investment has been made in local areas through the young persons' facilities fund and the RAPID programme. Investment is not only in leisure facilities and playgrounds. It is also taking place through organisations such as Dublin City Council investing in housing and improving its services, extra resources in schools and child care. Recently, an issue was raised regarding a community representative on the national drugs task force and that has been resolved. The extra investment made by the Minister of State will prove to be extremely effective.It is no coincidence that the areas where drugs misuse is most prevalent are those with the lowest take-up of third level education. In the north inner city that figure is 8%. The national average is 50%. We must examine these areas. I commend the Minister of State and the Department. The strategy has proved successful and will continue do so in the future.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	143	It is tempting in a debate such as this to bash the Government. Perhaps I will end up doing so. However, it is not where I intend to start. I am pretty good at it.We need reflection as well as political conflict in the area of substance abuse. It was drawn to my attention that the UN International Narcotic Control Board published a report today which should be disturbing reading. It lists Ireland among the countries where cocaine use is increasing, and among the European countries with a high incidence of cannabis use. We must deal with this issue in a number of areas.What the last speaker stated is entirely true and extremely important. For far too long we have ignored the significant correlation between social deprivation and the use of heroin. We have created the most unequal society in terms of income distribution in the OECD, outside of the United States. According to a variety of indicators, this is a profoundly unequal society. We seem to have an unspoken consensus that it is not appropriate to speak about the vulgar expenditure of the beneficiaries of the affluence of the past ten years. In the 1980s we were among the highest spenders on executive cars. I presume we are now at the top of that list.We never managed to put together an ethic to address the affluent and state to them that they are part of a society from which they have benefited and it is now their turn to give back. Instead, we decided that we will capitulate to the greed of the extremely rich. We have done so in a variety of ways. Before we get into a silly political debate, I do not believe it began in 1997. However, it was accentuated as affluence and riches became more apparent. We decided through the political process to hand out an extraordinarily disproportionate amount of our national affluence to people who were already well-off. We left those already deprived in a worse situation with housing crises, poor uptake of education and a bad health service.There will be arguments forever as to whether there are sufficient places on drug rehabilitation programmes for the people who want to take them. Every week contradictory figures are presented. However, there does seem to be a succession of personal testimonies from people stating they cannot get access to drug treatment programmes. I am not entirely certain as to why that is. I know the classic answer to dealing with drugs involves cutting off supply, education and demand reduction. I am surprised the phrase "demand reduction" did not appear much in the Minister of State's script. He used the word "prevention". However, "demand reduction" is a more appropriate phrase.I had the interesting experience in 1998 of visiting Switzerland, along with the Minister of State's colleague Deputy Pat Carey, and Deputies Gregory and Durkan as members of the Joint Committee on European Affairs. We observed a heroin prescription programme in the city of Saint Gallen. The most striking element was the unanimous view of city authorities, police, medical people and everyone else we met that it was successful and that it achieved a number of purposes, including stabilising the lives of people who were unsuccessful in a variety of heroin withdrawal programmes. The other major achievement was a reduction in drug-related crime.It was astonishing to hear the police in particular speak about it. They ended up with the most ironic job of all, as they transported the high-quality heroin from storage to the clinics where people came on a daily basis and spent three Swiss francs to be provided with clean heroin and needles and an extremely healthy environment in which to inject. Everybody states that such programmes do not work and can produce statistics to show that some of the Swiss experiments did not work. However, we must accept that the standardised programmes, such as those in the United States, did not work either.Addressing drugs as drugs per se and stating repeatedly that we will stop does not appear to work. We must deal with larger global issues such as the chaos in Afghanistan, which allows the world to be flooded with heroin. Among the horrors of the Taliban regime, one of the positives was a strong ethical belief that the production and sale of narcotic substances was improper and wrong and they endeavoured to stop it. Once the Taliban went, the warlords, who are now the allies of the Western world, returned to their old habits. We must address our friends in the United States, about whose feelings my colleagues on the other side of the House are so sensitive. We must ask them in a positive and reasonably friendly way to take action on the renewed trade from Afghanistan. That is one way to deal with supply.If we are to deal with the willingness to use drugs in this country, we must examine the composition of society and those whose introduction to drugs is a spin-off from a hopeless life without prospects or a future. We must transform their lives, give them hope, a future, a chance for an education, a job and an escape from the appalling circumstances in which they live. Despite having the resources we have failed to do that.If we are to persuade young people that drug taking is bad we must be honest with them. While there are good reasons to persuade young people not to use cannabis we should not generate scare headlines about it. Although we know the effects of long-term cannabis use, the vast majority of young cannabis users are not long-term users. Whether it is justifiable in societal terms to give a young person a criminal record for possession of a small amount of cannabis is a valid question. From talking to young people I know the gardaí do random searches of young people who happen to have long hair and beards and are in certain parts of the cities. Although they behave impeccably, the gardaí search them, in some cases, several times. Whether that creates a climate in which they can be persuaded that they should avoid illegal substances is questionable. A culture that glorifies alcohol and that spends million of euro on cigarettes is in a difficult position from which to lecture young people on the danger of substances that will not kill a fraction of the number of people who will die from alcohol and tobacco in any year.
#KateWalsh	unknown-#KateWalsh-party	unknown-#KateWalsh-dob	unknown-#KateWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	144	I am grateful for this opportunity to contribute to these statements and I welcome the Minister and his officials to the House. The five objectives of the national drugs strategy are supply reduction, prevention, treatment, research and co-ordination. It is right that Government policy reflects the complex nature of the problem facing our communities. There can be a temptation to focus solely on the policing element of drugs policy. While I welcome the recent breakthroughs on drug seizures I commend the Minister on his determination to create greater societal awareness, equip young people and vulnerable groups with skills and supports necessary to make informed choices and seek greater understanding of the factors that contribute to Irish people, particularly young people, misusing drugs.The dedicated members of our police force have made great progress in dealing with drug abuse in communities across the country, not just in so-called drug blackspots. In my constituency, north Kildare, a cocaine mixing site was recently discovered in Maynooth. First rate work by members of the Garda national drugs unit led to the seizure of equipment and material that could have been used to make more than €4 million worth of drugs. One can imagine the harm that could have done to drug users, whether children or adults, and to their families. This House must commend the Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs with special responsibility for drug-related issues, the Garda and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on their efforts. We must support the new criminal justice Bill, which will introduce increased sentences for gun crimes and a range of other measures to tackle dangerous gangs that are often financed by trading in drugs and death. The Bill is currently before the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights. I urge Members to support it on Second Stage.Having worked for many years at community level I am conscious that national strategies have relevance at local level. One of the key recommendations of the national drugs strategy is to establish regional drugs task forces throughout the country. These groups have representatives from local authorities, the local VEC, the HSE, Departments, the Garda and the voluntary sector among many others. It is important that we continue to implement a strategy to tackle drug misuse, especially in the regions. We need innovative approaches to tackle the drugs problem on a regional basis, to research, develop and implement a co-ordinated response to drug misuse using a partnership approach. I commend the Minister of State and the Government on their work to date.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	145	I have outlined the structures and goals the Government is pursuing. We are trying to do it in a balanced way and with a complementary focus and to hit on the different pillars of the strategy. Ideas, goals and strategies are financed by taxpayers' money, which must be put to good use. The figures I provided for the allocation of the extra funding given in the last few years reflect the Government's commitment. We have €43 million this year, a 37% increase on last year's allocation, which was 18% higher than the previous year. Those figures represent expenditure only by my Department as co-ordinating Department. The Department of Health and Children spends more than that and the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Education and Science and agencies such as FÁS also spend money. The total spending by the different arms of the State on cracking down on drugs, treating and guiding people and providing alternatives is between €150 million and €200 million.I hope I am not being blamed for the problems of last Saturday. There are many gurriers, hoodies or whatever one calls them out there. They are out in various suburbs every night of the week and certain events bring them into Dublin city. They usually wait until the afternoon of 17 March. They seem to have come early this year. The events of last Saturday were not caused solely by people who have tried drugs on a few occasions or weekly. My constituents are not usually equipped with petrol bombs. Other people provided the brains, or lack thereof, behind the event.In response to Senator McHugh, we are putting a fortune into treating drug users. Almost 8,000 people now take methadone. I accept that six, eight or ten years ago the policy was to put drug users on methadone. Although it stopped people robbing and mugging to get their next fix it is not the long-term solution and that is why we have a number of rehabilitative projects. FÁS has reserved approximately 1,000 CE places. Rehabilitation has been upgraded to a pillar of the strategy. We hope for better co-ordination and better emphasis on long-term effects because many of these people are not lost forever. They have families, they live in communities. Although it is difficult to pull some of them back, if one gives them a chance, works with them and provides treatment, many can make a useful contribution to society. I mentioned the young people's fund. There are many poorer, disadvantaged communities, particularly around Dublin, which were built in the 1970s and early 1980s and never had many recreational facilities. Some €100 million has been invested in sporting and youth facilities to give them a chance. There is not much point in telling young hoodies not to take drugs unless one can ask them why they do not go to a sports club, the youth café or put their energies into something else. That is what we are trying to do. Young people, thankfully, are full of energy. We do not want them throwing stones, but want that energy going elsewhere. Perhaps I have a one-track mind which is all about a football field. People may want to become involved in cultural diversions or whatever.At least heroin, which was the original scourge, has its substitute treatment, methadone. Cocaine is now a growing problem, but there is no substitute for it. The best that is on offer is counselling and behavioural therapy. Even in the areas of Dublin where there was a major heroin problem, the numbers have more or less stabilised. The users are getting older and fewer young people are becoming involved with heroin. It is even perceived to be something of a "loser's drug" within the communities. Sadly, they are not all playing football and I know they may be dabbling in other things. We are trying to work with them, however.We are spending €43 million this year, plus another €25 million that started at community level and which has now been mainstreamed into other areas. There are about 600 people involved, about 300 on the drugs side and 300 on the facilities side. That is over 600 jobs which started and developed at community level, mainly in the Dublin area. That is a large figure.Perhaps some of the people who have been working in this area for years are becoming frustrated. They may have thought the drug problem could be solved with just a couple of dozen people working on it. I understand that, and we can all be somewhat disappointed and frustrated. Nonetheless, there is an enormous investment by the State in this area.Senator Ryan spoke about Switzerland, consumption rooms and prescribing clinics. I also saw them when I went to Switzerland and Germany two years ago. He also cited the UN narcotics board. When it heard that I was going over to look at these facilities it was horrified and asked me to reconsider. The UN narcotics board is ideologically a drug-free advocate and, as such, is perhaps too theoretical. The board was horrified at the notion that I was even going to look at some of these liberal areas. There is no single answer. The general health of drug misusers is important. We are giving them far better services and treatment and their general health is much better.We are not going to liberalise cannabis. That would be a foolish thing to do. The Garda concentrates its time on the big fish, not on 16 year olds, apart from giving them a few scares now and again. However, we are putting in the resources and the strategy is in place. It is a massive challenge. Drugs will not go away, but I hope that Members see we are carrying out the strategy and meeting the challenge head-on. If we pull together with the communities on the ground, who are vital in all of this, we can continue to make progress. Sadly, I do not expect to be able to tell the Seanad at some point that we have got rid of drugs in Ireland. It is a case of curbing the abuse and reducing it.

They as much as I are anxious that the Minister, in presenting himself here, will be able to clarify the points raised in this motion and if he cannot do so satisfactorily, take the only course open to him and offer his resignation.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	148	Misleading this House and the farming community is a resigning matter. To refer to the Minister as "the grim reaper" or the personification of the death of Irish farming is to describe someone who has single-handedly set about destroying the Irish agricultural sector. This has precipitated the exit from the land by so many farmers whose livelihoods are being destroyed by the implementation of the nitrates directive. The directive which the Minister signed into law against all common sense, includes regulations that are unworkable, impractical and not based on accurate scientific information.He further compounded this iniquity by failing to suspend the introduction of this regulation in light of the revised scientific evidence. The Minister had the nerve to stand in this House last December and tell me that he had the support of all the farming organisations when he signed the directive into law. In case the Minister has any desire to deny this or suffers from memory loss as regards his words, he said: "They, the farming organisations, were prepared to support hard decisions because they knew that is the only way to deal with the imposition which falls on us following the introduction of the nitrates directive."This is quite extraordinary. I have not met one farmer or farm leader who gave any indication whatsoever they were prepared to support the Minister's actions on this issue. Conscious as I am of the Minister's tendency to become somewhat heated, as witnessed in this House last week——
#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	149	The Senator does not have that tendency at all.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	150	——when he used some unparliamentary language, I will phrase my next remarks very carefully. It is not overstating the case to say that the Minister's statement in this House last December was an untruth, and an extremely costly one for the Irish farming sector. This is certainly a resigning matter. The Minister has treated this House with utter contempt. The farming organisations that he claimed, on 14 December, supported him, walked out of the social partnership talks in protest at the regulations introduced by him. His spin and untruths have been contradicted by those organisations. Last week in Ballymahon, County Longford, the Minister was confronted by farmers when he was attending another function. He failed to meet the farmers when the local Deputy requested that a meeting be organised in Ballymahon last week.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	152	The Minister got a rap last week on this particular issue. He was confronted by 150 farmers from the counties of Longford and Westmeath who were very angry at what he is doing, trying to destroy the industry. The nitrates regulations signed into law by the Minister last December will impose limits on the maximum amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus that may be applied to land. However, the regulations he introduced are not based on science or any objective assessment of water quality in Ireland which is among the best in Europe. BP has confirmed that nitrous concentrations in Irish surplus waters are well within the mandatory limits. Water quality in Ireland is among the best in Europe. This was confirmed by the most recent EPA water quality report which showed that 98% of the 301 sites tested were better than the EU standard. At the recent World Economic Forum, which the Minister attended, Ireland shared the top spot in Europe with Norway and Sweden for 100% achievement in water quality.The regulations will decimate the pig, poultry and dairy sectors and reverse years of progress to achieve best practice in the country's dairy and beef farms, as well as imposing serious restrictions on thousands of farmers already in the REP scheme. Prior to the introduction of these regulations, farmers were assured that the environmental standards required under the REP scheme represented best practice but the nitrates regulations effectively reverse this position.There was a clear lack of co-ordination between the Departments involved. It was very irresponsible to designate the entire country as a nitrates vulnerable zone without a full evaluation of the impact this will have on farming practice. The regulations place obligations on farmers to prepare and maintain additional records of fertiliser requirements, purchases and stocks for five years. REPS farmers who met the highest international environmental codes do not fulfil the requirements set out in the nitrates directive. I have spoken to several farmers and farm advisers in regard to this issue and they are of the same opinion. The nitrates directive will impose a cost of €1 billion on farmers, which is a direct threat to the viability of many commercial farmers, yet the Government's approach was to get the issue off the table rather than to support this industry, which accounts for one quarter of our net exports, and negotiate on its behalf.Two key problems are evident with the rules as they currently stand. Intensive producers and those who require early grass will now be severely restricted in their operations due to limitations on both nitrates and phosphates. This will put Ireland's food production at a significant commercial disadvantage compared to other countries within the European Union due to our reliance on a grass-based production system. The level of scale-back on production required to comply with these new rules will make the majority of current operations no longer viable. Small producers, even with a very extensive production system, will have to invest significant amounts of money to address the issues of rainwater and water run-off. This will put a severe financial burden on the operations of many small producers with inadequate housing and holding facilities, especially those with marginal land, with limited land on which to spread such dirty water.The Minister's decision to defer the implementation of Part 3 of the regulation clearly demonstrates that basing the implementation of the nitrates directive on scientific advice was shelved in favour of reaching a politically expedient conclusion. The Minister also has serious questions to answer on why vital elements of the scientific advice provided by Teagasc were not included in the final statutory instrument. Both the Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Agriculture and Food failed to prioritise a practical and sensible implementation of the nitrates directive. Part 3 has now been briefly deferred but there are no guarantees that it will be dramatically altered. The deferral appears to be a delaying tactic to take the heat off for a couple of weeks or so.The remainder of the regulation, especially the parts dealing with nitrates, came into force on 1 February 2006 and will have a serious impact on farmers. The regulation should be suspended in full, pending the production of revised scientific information by Teagasc. Irish phosphates regulations are out of line with what is happening in the rest of Europe. It is not proposed anywhere else to ban phosphate use on all lands which test at over ten parts per million. Irish phosphates regulations are currently by far the strictest in Europe. In most countries the phosphates limits have not yet been discussed, while in Holland the policy is for the achievement of a balance by 2015.The current best estimate is that somewhere between 13% and 17% of the country's grassland will be allowed to take in some limited pig or poultry manure. It now appears that farmers will not get the level of waste management grants they were promised by the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, in July 2005 to help them adjust to the requirements of the directive. These grants were supposed to help farmers cope with the implementation of the nitrates directive but now farmers will not get the level of funding they require. This is a case of negligence on the part of the Minister. She has dragged her heels on the introduction of this system and in applying to Brussels for its approval.Revised farm waste management grants were due to come into effect from 1 January 2006 but not only have they yet to be approved by Brussels but the level of grants for farmers is now set to be significantly reduced. Thousands of farmers will lose out and the level of funding provided will not be sufficient for them to build extra waste storage facilities.Farmers have serious problems getting planning permission through their local authorities. It can take up to six months to get an environmental impact statement and it now appears that these farmers will not be in a position to avail of grants. Late last year the Minister assured farmers that the maximum level of grants would be available until 2008. However, we know from the EU Commission that they will only apply until 2006, a point which Fine Gael highlighted on 19 April 2005. Farmers will not be able to fulfil the planning requirements of local authorities in the short time available as most local authorities are over-stretched with regard to staff and so on. It is impossible to imagine farmers having their developments completed in time.I call on the Government to support a fair solution to the nitrates issue. I have no doubt the Minister and the Government have been incompetent in their handling of the implementation of the directive. By supporting the motion, Senators from the Government parties will have an opportunity to stand by Irish farmers as it calls for a breathing space to ensure a balanced and implementable set of rules can be put in place to secure a future for farmers.I call on the Minister to amend the nitrates regulations to make them practical and workable. As a result of his gross incompetence in regard to the implementation of the nitrates directive the Minister is leaving the vast majority of Irish farmers in limbo. They are faced with significant capital costs as the action plan has not taken into account existing farming practice and proposes to be implemented in a bureaucratic manner. There is no doubt there was a major lack of co-ordination between the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Department of Agriculture and Food. The designation of the entire country as a nitrates vulnerable zone without a full evaluation of the impact it will have on farming practice was irresponsible. I hope the Minister will address these issues this evening and postpone the implementation of the regulations.
#NoelCoonan	unknown-#NoelCoonan-party	unknown-#NoelCoonan-dob	unknown-#NoelCoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	153	I second the motion. I welcome the Minister to the House and look forward to a constructive debate on this hugely important issue which will have serious repercussions for the farming community.The first four paragraphs in the motion point out that the Minister does not have the support of the farming community. It is obvious he has lost the confidence of all the farming organisations. This is borne out by the recent withdrawal of the IFA from the social partnership talks. There is a clear indication that farmers are anything but happy with the Minister's performance to date.The motion also refers to incompetence on the part of the Minister by signing into law regulations which go beyond current best farming practice, as supported by Teagasc and as set out in the rural environment protection scheme. The guidelines for this scheme are set out in the green book, which according to Teagasc is the bible for best farming practice. I would have expected the Minister would take advice from Teagasc and the farming community as the REP scheme has worked very well up to now.I saw a television debate between the Minister, Deputy Roche, and the head of the Moorepark research facility, Dr. Pat Dillon, in which the Minister looked clearly uncomfortable. The heat of Dubai possibly upset him. The Minister for Agriculture and Food wiped her hands of this matter and passed the poisoned chalice to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who is very uncomfortable with such a responsibility. The Minister for Agriculture and Food abdicated her responsibilities to the farming community and allowed the Minister to take the flak for it, which was a clever move on her part. There was complete disagreement between the two Ministers and the head of Moorepark Research Centre.Somebody must have tried to con farmers and somebody did not tell the truth. The Minister could clarify matters tonight and let us know who is and is not telling the truth in this regard. The head of Moorepark Research Centre clearly stated that Teagasc has not signed off on some of the issues for which the Minister clearly tried to blame Teagasc. There is complete disagreement between Teagasc, which is a scientific organisation, and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government when the two should be working hand-in-hand in the interests of Irish farming. This deadlock would be funny if it did not have such serious implications for the farming community.In respect of this issue, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is up to his neck in slurry. He knows his position is wrong.

#NoelCoonan	unknown-#NoelCoonan-party	unknown-#NoelCoonan-dob	unknown-#NoelCoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	155	The farming community has clearly told the Minister that everyone in the country, with the exception of a few city-based people who believe farmers are amadáns, opposes him. The Minister should deal with the spin that 20% of the water in this country is poor quality. This spin is based on the water report and uses 25 parts per million, which is illegal and not even the objective at the moment. The studies in question have been carried out on the basis of 50 parts per million and in that context, Ireland, Switzerland and Norway come first. Why has this spin been produced?The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is more responsible for the pollution of Irish water through the activities of local authorities and industrial waste than the farming community. Farmers are as concerned about the environment as anyone else. It is in their interest to be concerned about it because they and their families live and work in the country. They accept that there is a need for the environment to be safeguarded but not to the point where they are put out of business, which is what these regulations will do.I do not wish to be personal because I wish to have a clean and honest argument tonight with the Minister. I appeal to him to listen to farm leaders and the people in rural Ireland before it is too late. He knows that these regulations are unworkable. An official from the Department, Mr. John Sadlier, who accompanied the Minister earlier this evening, told the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government that the regulations are not written in stone.

I withdraw my comments.I hope the proposals are not written in stone and that where alternatives and improved scientific advice are available to the Minister, he will take them on board. This advice is available to him. At a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government, Dr. Séamus Cross from Teagasc stated that the phosphorus and nitrogen levels permitted in tables 12 and 13 of the action plan were not signed off by Teagasc. However, the Minister chooses to disregard the advice of Teagasc, which one would expect to be the expert body in this field.This matter is very serious. We must remember that the farming community has been challenged and driven to despair by successive legislation and directives implemented by this and previous Governments. Examples include the animal remedies regulation, the nitrates directive and prescription-only medicine. Is the Government attempting to drive farmers off the land? We will be left with a countryside composed of trees and animals but lacking people. The Government is mounting a sustained attack on farmers and somebody has to say "Stop". I am asking the Minister to call a halt to this attack on farmers.The farming community has always been adaptable. It took part in negotiations leading to the single farm payment. We were told then that the payment would eliminate bureaucracy, which is the one scourge of the farming community. However, we have more bureaucracy and regulation than ever before. Farmers must engage in more record keeping. Inspectors from the Departments of Agriculture and Food and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government visit farms. Farmers now need two full-time secretaries to deal with all the record keeping imposed on them where once they only needed one. The situation is unreal and is not what farmers signed up to.Farmers and the public will accept a measure which is practical and workable. If these regulations are introduced, 15% of agricultural production will be wiped out straight away. The chief executive of Arrabawn Co-op has spoken to me about its concerns. Could the Minister tell us where this co-operative and local authorities are supposed to dispose of their sludge? The chief executive of Arrabawn Co-op told me that in the last three years, the number of its suppliers has decreased by 27%.If the Minister is given more time to assail the farmers of Ireland there will be none left. He is safe enough in the garden county of Wicklow but he should remember how important is rural Ireland. He should treat this issue in the same way as he treated incineration. In other words, he would favour it but not in County Wicklow.

Both Senators Bannon and Coonan made excellent speeches. According to the last part of the motion, Fine Gael wishes to implement the directive in a manner which is practical and workable for all farmers and does not unnecessarily go beyond what is required under EU law. However, the motion does not take into consideration the different types of farmers in this country. I represent many small farmers whose requirements might differ from those of larger farmers. At least Senator Bannon accepts that EU law is in place in this regard.We must comply with this directive which was adopted in 1991 so it is 15 years since this measure was discussed.

#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	162	I also remind Senator Bannon that former Fine Gael Deputy, Ivan Yates, was Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry from 1994 to 1997 and had the opportunity to do something about this. The simple fact is that this matter was left hanging until the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government had the courage to grasp the issue. The Government must address it because Ireland will incur daily fines if we do not implement the directive.After the judgment against Ireland in March 2004, we were forced to act very quickly. It is to the credit of the Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Agriculture and Food that meetings were held to discuss the issue, some of which I was glad to attend as a member of my parliamentary party. The Government acted quickly in respect of nitrogen and phosphorus.The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has stated that he is waiting for advice in respect of Part 3 of the regulations and phosphorus. I was glad to see that he referred to nitrogen limits. Most of the farmers I represent would not have a problem with these limits but I would welcome if a way was found to improve the situation for more intensive farmers. We would also like to reach a resolution on the derogation soon. This issue was referred to by the Minister.When I examined the limits and the different zones of A, B, and C, I remembered when life was simple and farmers, being very good keepers of the environment, would probably spread manure on a fine day. This was the traditional practice. There was good weather in November and December and, if life were simple, we might say this should continue. However, we all appreciate that this will not happen in the future.I welcome the Minister's reference to the different grants that will be available as part of a farm waste management package. It will be important to put these in place. Farmers must have arrangements in place by 1 January 2007 to divert clean water away from animal manure and slurry. Different dates apply to pig farmers and other farmers but the regulations will apply to all farmers from 1 January 2009. This is a welcome package.We have been getting different information from Teagasc, which has sometimes been speaking with two voices. It was obvious in the programme in which the Minister was engaged, to which Senator Coonan referred, which has been disappointing. When the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government wrote to the director of Teagasc for information, he said that it had been working on the matter for three years. He said that many meetings were held and the amount of material requested on all aspects is quite large and will take several weeks to complete and compile. In addition, the staff involved are currently busy preparing new material requested urgently by the Department. While there was a delay in obtaining information, I hope the Minister has provided sufficient time so that we will quickly receive the required information on phosphorus. Information for farmers is very important. What the Department of Agriculture and Food announced in regard to an advertisement in the farming press is very welcome. We also welcome the explanatory booklet which is designed to explain the new rules clearly and simply.The proposals for a derogation laid down in the nitrates directive 2004 is important. It has been stated that the derogation is vital for 10,000 extra intensive dairy farmers. I hope the derogation will be agreed by the middle of the year. It is unfair to say that all farmers and farming organisations are annoyed with the Minister. I will quote from an article in the Connacht Tribune which refers to the chairman of County Galway IFA who welcomed the setting up of a sub-committee to review the new report from its scientific staff on the implementation of the nitrates directive. The article reads as follows:Mr. Silke said that this was a very positive move and added that he was also delighted that the boycott of Teagasc had also been lifted. He said that the IFA had no problem with any staff member working with Teagasc ... But Mr. Silke was confident that the review by the independent sub committee would make it more palatable and workable for farmers of all size holdings.The president of Macra na Feirme, Mr. Colm Markey, is also quoted in the newspaper as saying that the establishment of a special sub-committee represented a light at the end of the tunnel in relation to the whole nitrates directive debacle. He also stated as follows:I am hopeful that this sub-committee will prove an effective structure to allow the Board and Teagasc's scientific staff work more closely together to resolve outstanding issues ... There is a need in the whole nitrates debate to recognise a much broader range of factors that influence the effective and responsible use of fertilizers.This requirement has been clearly laid down by two farming organisations. These farm leaders recognise the need to monitor water. In the EPA report for 2005, the director general said that the EPA issued a number of reports in 2005 on water monitoring. Water quality in Ireland remains of a high standard, with a declining incidence of serious pollution, even though eutrophication and the lack of municipal waste water treatment continued to be the biggest problem. I was pleased that the report paid tribute to the Department for the extra staff the EPA received in 2005. There was a significant increase in staffing levels which will allow the EPA to carry out this work to a very high standard.Water quality is at the centre of the directive. That the situation is being improved in terms of public supplies is welcome. The Minister will be aware of my views on small group water schemes that must be improved and updated. I pay tribute to him in this regard. Some €58 million has been allocated this year for small water and sewerage schemes in County Galway, while €258 million has been allocated for next year. This is a sizeable amount of money which will help with the water services programme in County Galway.I agree with what Senator Coonan said about sludge. My colleague, Senator Ulick Burke, raised what is happening in East Galway, the area we represent. Much of the sludge coming from overloaded sewerage schemes and Mutton Island in Galway city has been landed on farms throughout the county. The nitrates directive will help to deal with this issue because it is appalling that people can dump sludge and cause a terrible smell in an area. The directive will go some way towards stopping this indiscriminate dumping.

I also welcome the Government's amendment which notes that 20% of ground water in Ireland has nitrate concentrations above guideline drinking water standards, that 27% of Ireland's rivers are affected by eutrophication and there is widespread bacteriological contamination of ground-water and drinking water supplies by livestock manure. I do not think this aspect has been given sufficient publicity. I do not think enough people know what is happening. I do not think people realise that the Minister is trying to protect all the citizens of Ireland to ensure that they have better drinking water, river water and lake water.I disagree totally with the Fine Gael motion which panders to the farmers' lobby, just as the Government has been doing——

#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	169	The place of agriculture in Ireland has changed. When I graduated from university in 1960, agriculture was the mainstay of the economy. It now accounts for a mere 3% of our gross national product. It is time we woke up to the fact that what is in the farmers' interests is not always in the interests of the country as a whole. In cases such as the one I quoted from the amendment, the farming interests are directly opposed to the national interest. It would be a tragedy if, because of this short-term political expediency, the national interest is not allowed to prevail.A few weeks ago in the Joint Committee on European Affairs, I stood up to the president of the IFA on this matter. I said then, which was no less than the truth, that the farmers were holding the country to ransom in this area. Meanwhile, we allow them to go on polluting the water of this country, which is the property of all the citizens, not just the farming community. After I made that intervention, which got a lot of media attention, I received a telephone call from a man who served on one of the internal committees that had recently been considering this matter. He said that at every meeting the representatives of Teagasc came in for repeated brow-beating by the farmers' representatives, in an attempt to get them to change their scientific recommendations in the farmers' favour. The truly scandalous aspect is that all this improper pressure appears to have had an effect, and Teagasc is apparently now ready to change its position on the issue.If Teagasc does so, it will have totally compromised its scientific integrity and become instead just a mouthpiece for farming interests. I have always supported and admired the work of Teagasc. It should, however, be concerned with science first, last and always. Scientific laws cannot be bent to suit anyone's needs; they stand on their own feet and should always be recognised and respected as such.I welcome the Minister's statement of yesterday which seemed to show a somewhat belated reluctance on his part to stand up to the pressures now raining down on him and on the Government. To strengthen his backbone, I remind him that he is the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, not the Minister for Agriculture and Food. His first responsibility and that of the Government is to the people of Ireland as a whole, those who stand to benefit from the immediate and complete implementation of the nitrates directive. The Minister has shown such responsibility tonight.We must, for once, stop listening only to the voices of farmers. Instead, we must listen to the opinions of ordinary citizens, who have a totally different set of interests in this matter. I am on the side of the people on this issue, and on the side of the European law we have been flouting blatantly for far too long. I support the Minister in this debate.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	170	I am grateful to my friend and colleague, Senator Quinn, for allowing me time to take part in this important debate. I agree with him that the Minister has, to some extent, come out with his hands up with regard to the amount of chemicals being used. This is a serious problem. Some weeks ago, I heard representatives from Teagasc partaking in a radio discussion. They seemed to be in some confusion because they spoke on the one hand about airily scientific standards and, on the other hand, seemed prepared to modify those standards because of the economic damage perceived by farmers in this matter. Like Senator Quinn, I ask whether this is good science. I have much sympathy for Teagasc, particularly the way in which its board is constituted. Farmers and their interests are heavily overrepresented. We must remember, as Senator Quinn observed, that it is all of us as taxpayers who pay their wages. We are entitled to expect respect for correct science.Last Tuesday, 21 February, the author of a leading article in The Irish Times observed that it seems the Government will give in to the farming lobby. I sincerely hope this is not the case. There is much misinformation on the part of farmers. They say, for example, they are not responsible for pollution. This is not true; they are massively responsible. They are the worst polluters of water and account for more damage than all the other main groupings, including sewerage works, industry and so on.

#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	172	The facts and figures are there. One does not have to be a scientist to appreciate the reality of the situation. Farmers also say that we hardly need a water pollution policy because everything is fine. Others, however, have been saying there is a serious problem in this regard for many years. Senator Henry was one of the first to raise this issue.Some 30% of our rivers are either moderately or slightly polluted and the water quality has deteriorated significantly in the past 30 years. Almost one third of rivers are eutrophic, which I understand means they are enriched as a result of the use of fertilisers. This enrichment leads to excessive plant growth which blocks out oxygen. This is not a positive development. The principal cause of this is not even slurry, which is very unpleasant and is responsible for fish kills, but the phosphorus content in the nitrates.I rely on information in the newspapers for this debate, some of which is very well-informed. It seems farmers are using twice as much nitrate as they need.
#NoelCoonan	unknown-#NoelCoonan-party	unknown-#NoelCoonan-dob	unknown-#NoelCoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	173	That is nonsense.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	174	This information is from Teagasc. Approximately half the agricultural land in Ireland is saturated with phosphorus, with dangerous amounts running off and polluting rivers or remaining in the soil. Only 25% of the phosphorus that is applied is taken up by plants for nourishment, while three quarters of it is useless to the farmer and builds up in the soil where it does environmental damage as it runs off into the water table.It is astonishing that this aspect of the directive is the one that will apparently be weakened. I appeal to the Minister not to do so. The arguments are clear — we are overusing nitrates and only 25% of them are absorbed by plants. It is almost witch-doctoring in agrarian terms. In response to the bullying that is taking place, it seems Teagasc has, in the last several weeks, revised its recommended limits for agricultural use upwards to a point where it now recommends a higher dosage than its own scientific research indicates. Here we have more of the bullying by strong lobbies, including vintners and farmers, that so bedevils good governance. Farmers are pushing our scientists into doing something which their own scientific understanding and the facts registered by them contradict.I urge the Minister to be tough and to stand up to them. I cannot think of another person more able to do so.

Let us have no more Irish solutions to Irish problems. We must look after the health and safety of the public by accepting and implementing the scientific evidence. Much of the nitrate applied to the soil seems to be wasteful.
#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	177	I welcome the Minister and his officials. I begin by pleading that we be saved from The Irish Times. It is unfortunate that this motion, which makes serious accusations against the Minister, is before the House. I am sure he will rebut those accusations very capably, as he has always been able to do. From my dealings with him when he was a Member of this House and subsequently, I have never known him to be misleading in any of his utterances here or elsewhere. I am sure he was not misleading in this case and he is well capable of rebutting the arguments put forth today.I will deal with the broader issues relating to the nitrates directive. It has been discussed in an unfortunate context and this has worsened over recent weeks. The debate has been extremely simplistic on many occasions and some contributors, myself included, have found our words and questions interpreted as anti-farmer. It has been put to me that my intervention at the Joint Committee on European Affairs was anti-farmer. If being pro-environment, pro-consumer and pro-water quality is considered anti-farmer, I plead guilty. I say this having worked in agriculture all my working life. Protestations from some farmers that they are the protectors of the environment are pure bullshit.

#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	179	The word is appropriate in the context because we are discussing slurry, among other issues.I made the point that there are cowboys in this business just as there are in every other business. The president of the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, came to the meeting of the Joint Committee on European Affairs and made points about the generality of the issue, which is that we use very small amounts of nutrients relative to other European countries. That is true. However, we are not dealing with the generality but with the particular. We are dealing with those who will not abide by the general standards of good farming which have been enunciated by Teagasc. I recounted at the meeting that in driving from Kerry very early in 2005, on a night when rain was teeming from the heavens, I repeatedly encountered people spreading slurry. There was only one place the nutrients in that slurry could go; they did not go into the ground but into the waterways.There is a problem with our waterways and it is no good saying that farming is not a contributor. I accept it is not the only contributor — there are others, including the local authorities, which have been exempt under legislation. There are phosphates in household detergents which are significant contributors. Hormones come out of waste water into our water courses. Farming, however, is a contributor.It is not a question of either this or that. We do not have a choice. That is why the motion is cynical. If the Opposition found itself in Government in the morning, it would have to do exactly the same thing. This matter was adjudicated on by the European Court of Justice. This directive has been in place since 1991, so we have to accept we must do something. We can debate the nature of what we might do——

That is a very significant amount of money. We have derived very significant benefits and we must accept our responsibilities.It is untrue to say the implementation of the directive will drive thousands of farmers out of business. Some 10,000 dairy farmers have a problem.

#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	188	Some 10,000 dairy farmers use large amounts of nitrogen, and probably must do so. However, they are being squeezed so much economically — to say nothing of science — that they will have to reduce the amount of nitrogen they use for purely economic reasons.I have been involved in this business for a long time and numerous efforts were made over the years to predict what would be required by crops in terms of nitrogen and phosphates. Those efforts were made internationally in climates much more predictable than others. We know what a ten tonne crop of wheat will reduce in the soil. That is straightforward. However, we do not know what the soil will contribute to the crop. That depends on the climate and a whole host of factors. It is an extremely difficult thing to predict.Teagasc has been unjustly vilified in this regard. Over the years I, and thousands of people in this country, have benefited enormously from the advice of Teagasc and its predecessor, ACOT. It contributes immeasurably to the welfare of farming in this country and that should not be forgotten. It should not be used as a political football to prove a point. That is wrong and should not happen.There is another error in this motion and it comes back to the original charge made against the Minister. At the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs on 15 February, the president of the Irish Farmers Association said he accepted a nitrates directive must be implemented. I regarded that statement as so significant that I wrote it down at the time and welcomed it when it came to my intervention.

I hoped we would be able to have a debate which had more light than heat in it but I am not sure it is going that way. This debate is reflective of what has been happening in regard to this issue, particularly in recent months, and it is not working. It has become an issue of pro or anti-directive meaning pro or anti-farmer, rural Ireland or agriculture. That is not assisting this debate. We should get back to a proper discussion on what the directive is about. I would say to Senator Dardis that the debate must be on the workability of the directive.Before Christmas my brother, who is a farmer, asked me what the Minister was doing with this directive. He is a progressive farmer who is committed to high environmental standards but he cannot understand why a directive is being brought in which looks as if it will put farmers out of business. The confusion surrounding this issue is making the situation worse. We should review the current situation.I come from an agricultural background, although I am not engaged in agriculture so I do not have a direct interest in the directive. However, as a public representative from a constituency in which agriculture is a very important issue, I have an interest in it. Agriculture is also a very important issue for the country and we are at a crossroads in this regard. Senator Coonan and I attended a meeting on Monday morning in Nenagh with Arrabawn co-operative setting out to us the difficulties it is encountering. One of the issues was this directive. Irish agriculture faces a serious challenge and considerable change. I have no doubt the industry will manage it in its own way.As Senator Dardis and other Senators said, the debate on this important directive is relevant to consumers and to everyone in the country but the fact it has become a nasty row between farmers and others is not helpful. I appeal to the Minister, who is responsible for this area, to do what he can to try to get the debate back on track. I also appeal to the IFA to return to the table. It will not work if people walk away from the debate saying they will not engage.The issue in respect of Teagasc is very damaging. I have not had time to research and get a briefing on the scientific advice so I will not go into it because I do not understand it as it is complex. However, it appears we are looking at conflicting advice. Senator Norris said Teagasc should not give in to farmers' lobbying. I do not see it that way. I hope the latest Teagasc report will tell us and the Minister what we need to hear. I expect a scientific organisation funded by the State to do just that. From where I am standing, Teagasc has been quite damaged by this whole episode. The public needs an explanation from Teagasc as to what is going on in terms of the advice given to the Government and, indeed, why the Minister has taken that advice in the way he has. That is fairly critical to the whole debate.The regulations which have been signed are inconsistent with the set of regulations and rules which apply to REPS and given that a REPS farmer will be out of sync with the provisions directive, one must ask what is happening in terms of this directive. It is unworkable and if that is the case we will have get it to a stage where it is workable. It does not serve farmers or consumers that the debate on the directive has gone the way it has and that the issue is at this stage where we are up against the implementation of the directive in terms of fines, our relationship to the EU, a court judgment and so on.The directive does not serve the wider issue of protecting the environment, which is the core issue. This is about water quality. In north Tipperary alone — Senator Coonan and other Senators will be aware of this — Lough Derg is polluted as a result of the run-off of nitrates and the over-use of phosphates from a number of sources, of which farmers are one. By-laws have been introduced and considerable work has been done on the ground, particularly in the catchment areas of the rivers flowing into the lake to reduce the amount of phosphates and other pollutants. That work needs to continue and it is a long-term process. We must create a partnership in terms of protecting our environment while ensuring the agricultural sector continues to operate not only for producers but consumers.This directive should not be about putting farmers out of business and making it impossible for people to be engaged in agriculture. The future of agriculture is hugely important for far too many areas for us to take a blithe approach to it. I look forward to the Minister's response to this debate. I hope he will address the issue of workability of the directive and of making sure that it works for the environment, consumers and for producers on the land, namely, farmers.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	195	I am pleased to have this opportunity to discuss the nitrates directive in this House and I hope to throw some light as opposed to some of the heat that has been thrown on it. I agree with Senator O'Meara on two issues. One is that this directive is about protecting water resources. The presence of nitrates in our water resources is nasty. People in rural Ireland are drinking those waters and we have to ensure there is an end to the presence of nitrates in these resources. Phosphates are nasty or as, the Senator said, they have a nasty effect, eutrophication being one of those effects, and there must also be an end to the presence of phosphates in our water resources.If we care about our environment I could not put the position any better than the Senator's colleague, Deputy Howlin, did when in 1996 he said that our water resources, our rivers, our lakes and our groundwaters are national assets. He said it is essential that we protect these valuable assets and that economic progress does not bring about deterioration in the quality of our waters. Deputy Howlin was right in pointing out that is what we must do. It is what the nitrates directive requests us to do.It is a disgraceful fact that 15 years after the directive was signed into law and 15 years after we agreed to do that, we still have not met our responsibilities. It is also a fact, which is unpalatable but must be recorded, that every other member state of the European Union has met its requirements in this regard because we all care about our environment. I believe that farmers care about it and that much of the blame laid on them is unfair because they are not the only source of pollution.This Fine Gael motion condemns me for "signing into law regulations which go beyond best farming practice". Has that party forgotten that it was the then Minister for Agriculture, Mr. Yates, who in 1996 introduced the code of good agricultural practice, this document that I have in my hand? It had the full support of the farmers organisations at the time and was written in conjunction with the then Department of the Environment. It was signed jointly by both Ministers and subscribed to by Teagasc. This code is the baseline document. All the rhetoric and the huff and puff about the directive must bear relationship to it. Under the nitrates directive, this code of voluntary practice was to be prescribed into Irish law but it has not been.Does Fine Gael not realise that in many respects the 1996 code went even further than the current regulations? Following our discussions with farming organisations we successfully negotiated in detail on specific points made by those organisations. Does Fine Gael not realise that the nitrogen limits prescribed by me in the regulations are less onerous than those in the 1996 document? I will give specific comparisons because I hope that one or two Senators might actually read the document. I draw Members' attention to page 51 and ask them to examine table 12. In the 1996 Fine Gael-Labour Party document, the stocking rates on less than 1.5 livestock per unit provides that nitrogen is supplied at zero. That is in the document to which the Members' opposite subscribe.

That is the truth. It is on page 51 of the document signed by the former Minister, Mr. Yates, who was a good Minister for Agriculture, and the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, who cares as much as I do for water quality. If Members read appendix 3 — table 1, they would note that it is virtually the same as table 10, which has been much vilified, since this is the document that deals with indexation which is at the heart of the issue, and yet the documentation and the wording are the same. After ten years, why is this proposal being put by the second largest political party in the country?I draw Members' attention to the storage capacity on page 13 of the document and ask them to compare the provisions at paragraphs 2.7 and 2.8. I could go on but I do not wish to because I am sure I do not have the time.The reality is that we are up against it. We should have done this a long time ago but we did not do so. We have already failed in a European Court judgment. We face daily fines. We should not be implementing this because we have lost a judgment or we face daily fines. We should be doing it because we care about our environment and our health. It is wrong for any political party to simply stick its head in the sand, particularly when ten years ago that same party took a directly opposite view.

There is no EU directive of more significance to water than the nitrates directive. How can Fine Gael, which rightly prides itself on being a party which is progressive, stick its head in the sand in that regard? I cannot believe that Fine Gael put down this motion asking me to delay the introduction of the directive further. Even if it were in my power to do so, it would be the wrong action to take. It is time we stopped the prevarication and got on with the job.In 1996, my predecessor as Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, and the then Minister for Agriculture had no problem in putting their names to the best practice guidelines booklet. If Members read the booklet, the introductions they wrote could not be better written today. In the Dáil last week, Fine Gael members asked me to postpone implementing the nitrates directive.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	202	In complete contrast, the Labour Party in the Dáil last week asked me who was standing up for the environment. I say to Senator O'Meara that I am. Her party's spokesperson in the Dáil last week indicated his impatience with this process, and he was right because we cannot continue to delude ourselves that we can ignore the realities. One wonders whether Fine Gael cares one whit about Irish water quality because there is not a single word in this motion, which I suggest Senator O'Meara should read, about the quality of water in this country, the health implications of bad quality water and the implications for rural houses and farming.To paraphrase Deputy Howlin's contribution, Ireland's water resources are a major national asset. They supply our drinking water. They support rich natural habitats, including salmon and trout fisheries. They provide a wide range of commercial, industrial, recreational and amenity uses. They support rural life, and we should protect that resource.The Environmental Protection Agency, in its well-regarded state of the environment report, estimated that in Ireland agriculture is the source of 73% of all phosphorus and 82% of all nitrates. Senator O'Meara told me to look at the science. That is the science. I am not a scientist and I will not second-guess an environmental scientific report which is much respected.The nitrates directive aims to tackle eutrophication of waters due to excessive inputs of phosphorus and nitrates. Eutrophication of inland fresh waters has been identified by the Environmental Protection Agency "as probably Ireland's most serious environmental pollution problem", yet the second largest political party in this country wants me to ignore that reality. Nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphates are essential to agriculture but we must get the balance right. Farmers spend €400 million on artificial fertiliser. A 5% reduction in that would put €20 million a year into their pockets.Ireland is the last of the EU 15 member states to adopt an action programme under the directive. We are in the present position because we have failed to do this. We would not step up to the plate and do what needed to be done. The debate on phosphates is fascinating. It would not have occurred when Deputy Noel Dempsey, as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, wanted to do this. In 2001, shortly after the point when his progress stalled, the French phosphates case brought phosphates to the fore.The financial consequences for Ireland and Irish agriculture of doing what Fine Gael asks tonight would be utterly devastating, if we remove the public health issue altogether. We would face daily fines of God knows what size. Farmers would have a problem because if we are not cross-compliant, farm payments will be disrupted.Senator Dardis made the most important point, namely, there are 10,000 dairy farmers who desperately need the derogation. One of the Opposition Senators also mentioned this issue. The farmers want to go from 170 kg to 250 kg. I entered the nitrates committee on 12 December 2005 because I had the guts to sign this regulation on 11 December. It is critical to every progressive dairy farmer that we achieve that derogation. This latest nonsense has caused the suspension of discussions on the derogation which will stay suspended as long as Part 3 is suspended.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	204	I did not interrupt the Senator. He should have the courtesy to listen to me because although what I am saying may be unpalatable in many ways, it is the truth. The Senator will please have some forbearance.We face daily fines and will lose the opportunity to negotiate the derogation. Farmers, particularly the 10,000 dairy farmers, will face difficulties as a result and, because of cross-compliance, will face disruption. At the end of that process we must implement the nitrates directive because it is obligatory. We signed up to it in 1991. One might say we should not have done so but we did. We have an obligation to ourselves to protect our environment. There can be nothing more important than protecting our water.Consultation has been the cornerstone of the development of this programme. I paid tribute last year, and do so again today, to the extraordinary leadership we had last year and the work we put into the process. I pay tribute also to Mr. Walshe, recently appointed president of the Irish Farmers Association, who took the trouble to speak to me personally on this issue. My door is open to all farm leaders. I am willing to listen but I also have to take decisions.In October last, my Department, together with the Department of Agriculture and Food, jointly issued a consultation paper with the full text of the draft regulations. I agree with Senator O'Meara that the different voices coming from Teagasc have done serious damage to the organisation. That is a great pity because there are some extraordinarily talented people in the organisation. They are good scientists but good science should be objective and clear, and not be based on the whim or pressure of the moment.When Teagasc said in January, after the regulation had been signed, that there may be some new scientific findings on phosphates I said I was willing to listen. I respect Teagasc but I also expect it to respect itself and to produce robust scientific findings. I cannot have credibility in Brussels, and will not serve farmers, if I go with scientific findings which make no sense or which I do not believe. I would be doing a disservice to Ireland and Irish agriculture.Teagasc has been involved throughout the process. It was involved in the production of the code of good agricultural practice and is referred to in the code. The code, which is relevant today, states that it is the passport to a cleaner environment and sustainable agriculture. This document was published in July 1996 by my colleague and friend, the former Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, and Ivan Yates. Both men are from my county and talk sense. It makes no political or agricultural sense for us to start spinning as we are doing.We won significant concessions in our negotiations last year and now put all of that goodwill at risk for no reason. At the end of the day we will have to go back to Brussels and negotiate. We have won concessions on timing and procedures for land application, requirements on the capacity of storage vessels, general provisions for storage management, and the monitoring of the effectiveness of such measures.If any Member of this House or any member of any farming organisation doubts what I say he or she should take the time and trouble to compare the code with the figures we have. That has not been done objectively. That is the problem, there is now more heat than light in this debate and objectivity has been put aside. The only way to serve farming interests, protect farmers and our environment is by being objective, looking at the scientific findings, and dealing with the issue.Teagasc and I appear to be at variance. I said I will accept any robust scientific findings I receive from Teagasc. The standard Teagasc guidelines have been at the core of this process. They were at the core of the code produced in 1996 which is largely transposed into these regulations. I can demonstrate to anyone who wishes to question me that these regulations are less onerous than the 1996 code because we were able to negotiate specific arrangements by listening to the farming organisations.The Teagasc guidelines on crop nutrients are at the heart of this process and the action programme adopted in July 2005 reiterated Teagasc advice. The specific quantified phosphorus limits were subsequently published in the draft regulations issued by both Departments in October 2005. I do not wish to be pedantic but regulations were published at different times on which there was public consultation. Teagasc never suggested that it had problems with the regulations.On 8 December 2005 Teagasc presented a one and a half page document asking whether we could rewrite some of the tables. This document was never formally presented. Up to 15 years after the directive came through I would have expected something more solid than that.I remain willing to listen and if Teagasc produces robust scientific evidence to protect the environment and which fulfils our requirements under this directive I will consider it. I do not want anybody in this House to be under any illusion about our position. We are in this position because we prevaricated and it is time that stopped.After I made the regulations in December 2005, Teagasc indicated that it may be possible to review part of its advice on the application of phosphorus which could improve the effectiveness of the regulations. I will listen to that advice. I contacted the Commission that night and it agreed to accept my putting Part 3 on hold for some weeks.The board of Teagasc is meeting elsewhere or will meet soon. I hope the material it produces is copper-fastened scientific information. This must be objective and withstand scrutiny otherwise it will damage the whole cause. I am not prepared to prejudge anything that comes from Teagasc which has been requested to provide, as a matter of urgency, the necessary scientific case to support the revisions it has suggested. The Minister for Agriculture and Food made it clear that if revised fertilisation tables are brought forward and if they are supported by robust underlying science, the Government will be prepared to make a case to the Commission for a revision of the current limits. However I stress it will need to be supported by robust science. When the Government goes to the Commission next time, it must bring a case that will stand up. Any new formulation will therefore require the strongest possible support.In agreement with the farming representatives and in accordance with the Government's commitment under Sustaining Progress, Ireland is pursuing with the European Commission and with the other member states a derogation in the appropriate cases from the organic nitrogen limit of 170 kg per hectare as set by the directive. In response to a Senator who asked the reason I set the limit of 170 kg, that limit is set in the directive to which Ireland signed up in 1991. There is no point in saying it does not occur because the figure is in the directive. It is critical for Irish farming and in particular for 10,000 dairy farmers and their families, that we achieve a derogation limit of up to 250 kg if possible.The scientific case in support of the derogation was prepared by the Department of Agriculture and Food and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, in consultation with Teagasc. I am well aware that the implementation of the regulations will require changes in certain farming practices but these changes have been signalled for many years. I refer to the former Minister for Agriculture, Mr. Ivan Yates, a fellow County Wexford man. In 1996 he stated that effective and efficient farm management of waste has the double benefit of avoiding pollution and maximising the nutrient value of farm waste. This is a common sense statement and I cannot understand the reason Fine Gael is leading a debate. The Government's objective at all stages has been to negotiate the best possible terms from the Commission to allow optimum and least-cost solutions to the implementation of environmental requirements under the directive. The Government has a responsibility to achieve that balance and it has been achieved.The extent of the goodwill extended towards Ireland was nothing short of incredible. As late as the night before we signed I obtained additional marginal concessions to help farmers in places like County Leitrim and County Donegal. One concession was to delay the start date until 1 February which effectively gave farmers a respite until the end of this year. It is regrettable that this goodwill is being wasted and that we are not doing something progressive and positive to help farmers to deal with these responsibilities now. It is regrettable to be having a futile debate when we should be showing leadership. We are where we are because we did not show leadership.Under the terms of the Sustaining Progress agreement, the terms of the Department of Agriculture and Food modernisation grant scheme were improved substantially in order to assist farmers to prepare for the nitrates programme. I agree with Senator Bannon on one point. I have had an extraordinarily courteous reception from all farmers, including the farmers I met the other day. I have never refused to meet farmers because I have found them, when in a one-to-one negotiation, to be very decent people who are willing to listen and who are aware of the extent of the challenge. I was very pleased to meet with Senator Bannon's constituents the other day. The Senator was present at the meeting and he knows it was a cordial meeting. We shook hands in a civilised fashion and we agreed to disagree on some issues. The Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, has also announced a further revision of the farm waste management programme to be introduced shortly. She has introduced specific proposals to help pig and poultry farmers who will become eligible for the first time for grant aid for storage as this is an issue for those farmers. I met the mushroom farmers recently in County Cavan and in County Monaghan. These are impressive people who have built up small holdings. They need us to show leadership, to make decisions and to get on with the job. Further prevarication is damaging to their interests. The grant level to all farmers is being increased by up to 70% in some instances. The Minister for Agriculture and Food with my strong support has been looking at new technologies, such as anaerobic digestive systems. There are ways of dealing with the specific problems in specific sectors without damaging our water courses.Higher environmental standards have been promoted by the EU with the result that member states, including Ireland, have gained immeasurably. Agriculture is no different from other areas such as business, industry and energy where changes have been made. I agree with Senator O'Meara that Irish farmers have shown themselves to be more robust and more capable of adjusting than anyone imagined 20 or 30 years ago and good leadership and objective direction plays its part. Compliance with the nitrates directive is not optional, it is obligatory as is compliance with all directives. Ireland is finding itself in difficulties with Europe because we put our heads in the sand and do not accept the obligation. More important than it being obligatory, it is in our interests as a nation to protect these resources. This point was made by Deputy Howlin in 1996.Senator Quinn said that these are critical resources which must be protected. We can put our heads in the sand and hope the directive will go away but I warn Fine Gael that this will not happen. We can either take all the hits such as the fines, the problems with derogation and with cross-compliance and we can destroy Irish farming by doing nothing or we can make progress. I urge the farming organisations and all in politics to become engaged in the constructive way forward on this issue. Putting our heads in the sand and hoping the issue will go away will not work. It is too important a national issue to be addressed by scaremongering or distortion of which there have been some appalling examples. No Minister, no matter what his or her political persuasion, wants to destroy Irish farming. Such an argument is fatuous nonsense.As Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, I have a first responsibility to protect the environment and I have a responsibility to protect the health of the nation, and a responsibility to protect the water asset of the nation, all of which I intend to do. I want to protect it in a way that does not trespass unduly on farming and which does not cause difficulties for farmers. I have every confidence that farmers and farming organisations can achieve that balance.As with any regulations, if genuine improvements can be made, I am prepared to do so. However, I will not do anything that would be detrimental to the interests of Irish water quality or involve further prevarication. If this decision is not made now, a worse decision will be forced on us in the near future. There is no benefit in prevarication, no benefit in self-delusion, no benefit in putting our heads in the sand and all these actions could damage farming. I urge Fine Gael to withdraw the motion.
#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	205	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Fine Gael motion. The Minister concluded his remarks by suggesting we withdraw our motion but this will not happen. I hope that this debate will be constructive — as is always the case in this House — and we can reach the maximum degree of consensus.The Minister is aware that the farming community is gravely concerned about the possible impact of the directive. I would be the first to concede that this debate should have been held over the course of the past ten or 15 years and the present dilemma might have been avoided. It is only at the 25th hour that the public and the farming community is tuning into this issue. I am disappointed the debate on this issue has commenced so late in the day. I am somewhat disappointed that there has not been more public dialogue between the Departments and the farming organisations on the matter. I am also disappointed that, from an agricultural perspective, it seems the Minister for Agriculture and Food did not adopt a more hands-on approach when the regulations were being framed. I appreciate, of course, that it is Deputy Roche's responsibility, as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, to take charge of the debate. However, it would have been more helpful and reassuring for farming families if the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, was seen to be more hands on, although that is something we cannot reverse. She is now involved in a dialogue with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government but it would have offered farmers more reassurance if she had adopted a more hands-on approach initially.I have attended a number of public meetings on this issue, as have colleagues of the Minister's own political persuasion. They have reported to him, as I can, that there is grave disquiet among the farming community. Some of the concerns may well be exaggerated but there is still a concern among many farmers that the regulations, as currently constituted, could halt farming activity in many areas. We have a duty to respond to those concerns.The issue of Teagasc is crucial. I welcome the Minister's statement that if new, robust scientific evidence is brought forward he will respond and react to it. The scientific evidence must be robust because we cannot expect Teagasc to change reports and recommendations for the sake of pacifying anyone. It is disappointing to reflect on Teagasc's role in recent months. I have attended a number of debates at the Joint Committee on European Affairs where we heard presentations from Teagasc officials. It appeared at those meetings that the figures being presented to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government were not based on best scientific practice. I recall asking the officials about the level of scientific evidence they were presenting but their replies were not satisfactory. Over the course of the next few crucial weeks, I hope we will get a definitive and verifiable set of figures from Teagasc, which will allow the Minister to make the necessary amendments.Senator Quinn and others expressed surprise at our party putting forward this motion. They felt that somehow the sentiments expressed in the Fine Gael motion were an attack on farming and the rural environment. It has been said before, although that does not make it a cliché, that farming communities have been great defenders of our rural environment. Only a tiny minority of farmers — as is the case with industrialists and local authorities — have damaged our environment. We all know it is in the interests of farmers to ensure we have the best possible environment, including water quality. We must work towards achieving that because it is in all our interests.Given that the directive must be signed into law and that cross-compliance must be adhered to, it is crucial for the Minister's officials to respond, if possible, to whatever figures are produced by Teagasc in the next few months.I have been approached by many farmers on this issue, particularly those who are currently signed up to REPS. They are genuinely fearful that the regime of best environmental practice, under which they were operating, is under threat. We need to clarify that situation to ensure that those people can continue their environmentally-friendly farming as they have done heretofore.I am interested in what the Minister said about supporting new technology to deal with the fall-out the directive would have on pig and poultry farmers. Farmers in those two sectors were the first to sound the alarm bell, while their colleagues in other sectors are probably only tuning into the debate now. If there is a possibility of dealing with some degree of waste from pig and poultry units through various new systems, including anaerobic digestion, the Government will be obliged to respond by putting grant aid in place.The Minister also said his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, has proposed a new scheme of farm pollution grants. I am disappointed that there has been so little progress on that announcement which was made well before Christmas. In the run-up to every meeting of EU Agriculture Ministers we are told that progress has been made and that the scheme has almost been sanctioned but it has not been sanctioned to date. Come next winter, nitrates directive regulations will be in place to some degree so many farmers will require a system of additional pollution control measures, including extra slurry storage capacity. The farm pollution control scheme, which the Minister for Agriculture and Food has announced, is a vital component in putting that infrastructure in place. I hope the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, will be able to get the EU to sign off on her grant scheme in the near future.

It is in the interests of the Minister, Opposition spokespersons, the IFA and farming families that we reach a workable consensus which will protect our environment and defend agriculture. We are all in this together and there will be no future for agriculture if we cannot protect our environment.

#PeterCallanan	unknown-#PeterCallanan-party	unknown-#PeterCallanan-dob	unknown-#PeterCallanan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	212	I join with other speakers in welcoming the Minister, Deputy Roche, to the House. It is my first opportunity to take part in a debate here which he has attended. I am delighted to have such an opportunity. I congratulate him on the excellent work he is doing at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, which includes the nitrates directive. The Minister's responsibility is great and we trust that he is more than up to the job. I was going to refer to the 1996 signing off on this matter by the former Deputy, Ivan Yates, the former Minister, Deputy Howlin, and the farming organisations. There is no need for me to do so, however, because the Minister has already dealt with it.I can agree with many of the things that Senator Bradford said. He will be aware, as I am, that we on Cork County Council engaged successfully with the farming organisations on the introduction of a pilot scheme concerning the nitrates directive to protect water in the region. We undertook that scheme collectively. Senator Bradford and I are both aware of the ill-effects caused by algal bloom in the River Lee. The Government amendment contains a very nice word "eutrophication", which I now know means nutrient enrichment and pollution. We are aware of the consequences of water pollution.The EPA, Teagasc and the farming organisations were involved in the project. A scheme was put together which was helpful. However, farmers have been somewhat wronged by this motion. It is unfair, of no use or help to them, and is to their disadvantage. Farmers were also criticised by those who spoke in favour of the amendment and against the motion. Those who spoke in this manner may not have done so for the sake of being critical but because they did not know the facts.The use of chemical fertiliser has been reducing over the past ten years. The cost of fertiliser over those years has gone through the roof, and the advice from Teagasc has been to farm to a level of requirement. That is a fact of life. Moreover, going on revised advice from Teagasc, nitrogen and phosphate usage has reduced by 40% since 1995. There is no doubt that the use of phosphates was more than liberal on some farms and that the use of nitrogen on some farms was over-liberal. Cost factors are helping to bring that into line, as will the nitrates directive.I hope I will be forgiven for singling out Senator Dardis. He is a man of great competence. Before I ever heard of him I remember reading him in  The Farmers Journal, when he was writing on agricultural matters. He was always a leading agriculturist. One could listen to his advice, take it and always know it was good. However, I must disagree with him tonight. I too am in favour of clean water and a clean environment, but I am also in favour of farming. I do not think Senator Dardis meant what he said.

#PeterCallanan	unknown-#PeterCallanan-party	unknown-#PeterCallanan-dob	unknown-#PeterCallanan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	214	The nitrates directive has been in place since 1991. The purpose of the directive is to protect the water supply against pollution by agriculture. Sooner or later Ireland was obliged to implement the directive and comply with its provisions, and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has done so. The regulations to give legal effect to Ireland's nitrates action programme were signed by the Minister last December and came into effect on 1 February 2006. The provisions of the regulations will be phased in over three years.I am pleased to note the constructive decision by the Minister, in consultation with the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, to defer Part 3 of the regulations, namely, the nutrient management section, to give Teagasc an opportunity to review the advice previously given on fertiliser limits. Both Ministers will consider the revised Teagasc material shortly and then make contact with the Commission with a view to seeking agreed changes.Fine Gael has made comments which have caused confusion. It is not right for Fine Gael to attempt to disrupt and destroy a fine industry such as we have.

We are told that Ireland is obliged to implement the nitrates directive and does not have an option to postpone its implementation now. We are also told that Ireland must face up to the reality that the nitrates directive is European law and must be implemented.We do not want to pay the fines, and it would be outrageous for this Government to allow itself to be put in a position where it had to pay fines from taxpayers' money. The directive must be implemented. It affects agriculture as well as the taxpayer. The threat of a fine is not solely a financial consideration in Ireland. Failure to implement the directive would have a serious impact on a range of payments to Irish farmers. The Commission insisted on the undertaking that Ireland would implement the nitrates directive when the current round of rural development measures was approved in 2000. Failure to implement it would affect REPS payments, compensatory allowances and forestry, and put early retirement schemes at risk. Furthermore, the Minister is making a new proposal for expanded schemes and for Leader programmes. The single farm payment would be put at risk. The Opposition motion is asking us to put those payments at risk.

However, when I read the background I was very surprised to hear that the directive was first meant to come into force in 1991. It amazes me that it did not come into force much earlier and that successive Governments have resisted its implementation for so long. The reasons have been put forward by the Opposition in the motion. I condemn the motion because the Minister should be commended for hastening this in his early days in office, and the directive should have been implemented a long time ago.It is not particularly easy for a Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to put such a directive in place because he is quite certain, particularly given the constituency he represents, to meet the sort of resistance which we are coming across in the House today. That resistance is purely opportunistic and panders to the farming lobby at the expense of the rest of us.I commend the Minister on his action, because that is what ministerial office is about, while being in Opposition is, unfortunately, about creating trouble and difficulties for people who are taking decisions which they ought to take in those positions, even at a small political cost. I also commend the Minister on the speech he made because it seems he wrote his own speech, an unusual experience for Ministers speaking in this House.

It is a tribute to this House that the Minister has taken the time to read the motion and reply to it in a quite robust fashion.I see this motion very simply. It is an issue of a strong but diminishing farming lobby against an issue of water quality. Those of us who are not farmers cannot possibly afford to allow a small farming lobby to hold the Government, the rest of the nation and the environment to ransom on the basis that it will cost farmers a certain amount of money. God knows these guys have had plenty of warning that this was coming. It is no use for them to now state that they want to get out of the EU, to walk out of partnership talks and to make dramatic gestures when this has been coming for a long time. I understand the Opposition has to do what it has to do. However, the motion is an unrealistic piece of absolute and utter nonsense.Were this directive to be postponed any further, my understanding of what I read this evening and in the past is that our water quality would remain endangered, low by European standards and unacceptable in terms of hygiene for everybody in the country.

That is not acceptable politics in this House. It is cheap politics to pander to this lobby for a short period of time and hope that everybody else will forget because the water cannot be polluted if no one can get it. The Minister has taken the right decision at some political cost.Apparently, we are falling behind the rest of Europe in terms of water quality, and have been doing so gradually for approximately 25 to 30 years. That is not acceptable. It was time to call a halt to this deterioration in water quality. It is the height of irresponsibility to put this issue forward as some type of victimisation of the farming community. It is not acceptable politics and I commend the Minister on what he did today.Farmers do pollute the environment. Let us spell it out and hear Fine Gael state it. Farmers are not the only people who pollute the environment but they do so. The EPA has found that they do so.

I support the Government amendment. The Fine Gael spokesperson on agriculture in the other House has been quite active on television. The motion condemns the Minister, "for his failure to suspend the introduction of these regulations in light of revised scientific evidence". I did not think the Minister had received any scientific evidence yet. I wonder why it was included in the motion.I compliment Teagasc on its work in agriculture down through the years. I always considered Teagasc an outstanding independent adviser to farmers. It has developed farming throughout the country. Teagasc advice, when taken on board by farmers, has ensured that farms have continued to be viable. It has been a pioneer in developing many farming enterprises in the past.We are discussing fertiliser use and examining the type of fertiliser used on land. This will cause farmers to realise the amount of hundred weights of fertiliser they spread per acre. They will now examine testing the land properly to ensure that the required amount of fertiliser will be spread in keeping with the directive. They will continue to grow adequate crops.We must recognise the tremendous developments that have taken place in water quality. We all recognise that this country depends largely on water sourced from underground. We can no longer take any risks with that water. We must recognise the contribution that farmers have made over the past number of years regarding the land and housing. They have ensured that contaminated water is no longer let into the ground.Points were raised regarding the difficulty with record keeping. From what I gathered from the Minister's statement, the record keeping required is standard and if a farmer was not keeping such records he or she would not be able to continue in farming.The Acting Chairman is indicating to me. I am sorry the time is short. I do not want to cut in on Senator Scanlon's time. I compliment the Minister on his drive to ensure the derogation is increased to 250 kg. It is 170 kg at present. The Minister stated on many occasions that as soon as he can and when this is cleared, he will move to get that derogation for farmers, which will allow them to make a living and continue to farm.

#EamonScanlon	unknown-#EamonScanlon-party	unknown-#EamonScanlon-dob	unknown-#EamonScanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	252	It has been discussed already today. We are sick of hearing about the length of time this directive has been around, since 1991. In 1996, Ivan Yates, Deputy Howlin and the IFA attempted to deal with what was an extremely contentious issue in the directive. At that time they suggested 170 kg per hectare. The Minister had no alternative to signing the directive. We must get that derogation up to 250 kg. Much of today's discussion was about dairy farmers. Many dry stock farmers also need the 250 kg derogation. At present, that derogation is at a standstill because discussions cannot take place. I believe that derogation can be achieved and must be achieved for Irish farmers.Senator Coonan complained about the record keeping attached to the directive. I do not know whether he has read the requirements. They are extremely simple and include the total area of holding, storage capacity of the holding and an estimate of the annual fertiliser requirement. All of these are simple and any farmer could state the answers to the approximately ten questions off the top of his or her head.Senator Bradford referred to the hands-on approach of the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan. The Minister ensured the increase in the grants for storage tanks. I know it is at a standstill at present. However, the only issue to be resolved is whether it can be drawn down over one year or three years. I hope it is three years because one year is not long enough to obtain planning permission and to provide the storage tanks.I wish the Minister well and I know he has the interests of farmers at heart. This issue must be grappled with. I agree with the Minister that Senator Bannon should withdraw the motion.

I have listened to the Minister and he has taken responsibility for health, the environment and agriculture and has pontificated on all those areas. I want him to stop and think that he, as Minister, presides over a group of local authorities which has contributed more in one day than the farming community has done in ten years. Many of the Minister's colleagues have told this House that the farming community has been the greatest protector of the environment. The draconian measures introduced by the Minister will mean that people will be jailed for failing to keep receipts. If the Minister's party colleagues were jailed for non-availability of receipts for other activities our jails would be full.

He took advantage of the former Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, who was lackadaisical in his efforts to preserve farming communities. Some Senators behind me would have praised the former Minister for his stance on this issue. I suggest Senator Ross put on his wellies and visit some of the farmers in his county. He might then see what his suggestions would mean in reality. I ask that the Minister eliminate, not postpone, the draconian measures he has included without thinking.

Farmers across the country demand that this be resolved in a logical and scientific way as a matter of urgency. It is important to remember that this Government is trying to introduce by the back door a draconian new licensing system for farms and farmers. This is a diversion from the Government's promise following decoupling that it would give farmers freedom to farm. That will not happen under this legislation. The Minister should waste no time in getting himself out of the mess he is in but should act before it is too late. He should defer the introduction of his draconian legislation by bringing in amended legislation as a matter of urgency. Farmers and rural people are angry.

Will he indicate if it is the intention of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, to recruit the much-needed additional driving testers from outside the Department, as opposed to within the Department, as there is already an available pool of highly-qualified driving testers with relevant experience, knowledge and expertise?I am sure the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, is well aware of the situation prevailing in County Galway where some 40,000 people are currently on the waiting list for driving tests. The proposal to outsource driving tests would present serious difficulties, especially for those staff already involved. Despite the increased number of people applying for driving tests, the number of driving testers has reduced in the past three years. Outsourcing of testers is not the answer. Instead of recruiting ten testers on a two-year contract, as proposed by the Department, why can at least 20 testers not be recruited from among departmental staff as there is a ready-made panel of top quality people available? With additional personnel becoming available from other Departments where they are surplus to requirements and the training that has been agreed for staff which will start in April next, surely this option would provide a better solution to the existing problem?The backlog for driving tests is only a smokescreen for many of the other shortfalls within the system. No long-term plan has been devised, nor has adequate finance been put in place to address the problems, despite the fact that the waiting list has been growing in recent years. The proposal to outsource the testers will not solve the problem. Trained persons from within the driving test section are most suitable to carry out the work, if given the resources. There is considerable disquiet within the driver testing section regarding the outsourcing of testers.Continual monitoring of standards and procedures are required and there is already a track record of experience and efficiency in the section. How will this be done if the service is outsourced? How will the standards be tested and maintained? If outsourcing were to take place it would result in problems and industrial relations would be brought to an all-time low. The Minister may be aware of the frustration in the service at present and nothing should be done to aggravate this situation.The Driver Testing and Standards Authority Bill is currently on Committee Stage in the other House. Driving testers are gravely concerned about their status as civil servants which will be affected on the passing of the Bill. In many cases they have been employed as civil servants for over 20 years and they do not want their status to be downgraded. Counsel for the Department stated that civil servants joining the proposed road safety authority, RSA, would retain their Civil Service status but the latest utterings from the Department suggest otherwise. I hope this issue will be clarified in terms of those staff who are currently civil servants. It would appear that the RSA is just a new name for the old Driver Testing and Standards Authority, DTSA.How much finance has been allocated for this new proposal? The non-registration of cars from other European countries has become an issue following recent road tragedies. It is important that the Minister would examine this matter and consult with testers. He should at least give them a hearing so that a proper structure can be put in place to address the backlog of 40,000 people on the waiting list for driving tests. Better standards can be put in place by existing staff, as opposed to an outsourced service which would not be monitored in terms of safety and standard of driver testing. It is a "from-the-hip" response to a very serious problem and I hope the Minister will re-examine the issue with a view to consultation and agreeing proper methods of carrying out driver testing.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	270	I thank Senator Ulick Burke for raising this issue on the Adjournment and giving me the opportunity to put the situation in respect of driving testers on the record on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen.The Minister for Transport has repeatedly made the point that the delay in providing driving tests is a matter of regret to him. The Government believes this not only represents a poor service to the public but is also hampering the development of initiatives which we wish to pursue and which will contribute further to road safety. It is our objective to eliminate the backlog of driving tests by mid-2007 and the Department of Transport has developed a package of measures in consultation with staff interests to achieve this aim.This package seeks to maximise the contribution made by the available pool of existing driver testers. The main element of the package is a bonus scheme which, at a cost of approximately €2 million, is an incentive to existing driver testers to undertake more tests. A very high number of the existing driver testers have indicated that they will participate in this bonus scheme. This initiative will make a significant contribution to the reduction of the backlog over the coming 18 months.Furthermore, in a unique cross-departmental and cross-union agreement, a further seven civil servants from the Department of Agriculture and Food are being trained as driver testers and will start working in April to reduce the backlog. Later in the year, they will be augmented by another ten new recruits on two-year contracts. This increased volume of testing is putting administrative staff in Ballina, who are often the first point of contact between the public and the Department, under considerable pressure but they are making a major contribution to resolving a difficult situation.The final element of the package is a proposal for the temporary use of outsourcing for a set period. Temporary outsourcing of a set number of tests for a set period of time would not only provide access to additional staff resources but also to training options and to infrastructure and facilities that are regarded as necessary to overcome the backlog.A number of unions have questioned whether Sustaining Progress permits this form of outsourcing. This disagreement reflects a genuinely held difference of opinion on the meaning of clauses in Sustaining Progress. Departmental and union officials have worked hard together to reach solutions. Although good progress has been made, it is not expected to be sufficient to eliminate the backlog as quickly as possible.The question of temporary outsourcing was referred to arbitration and a finding of the arbitration board is expected shortly. However, I think it is important to put on the record of this House that the Minister for Transport has stated that he appreciates the level of service and commitment the existing staff, both testers and administrative staff, have given and continue to give to the delivery of a driver testing service. They will continue to be the backbone of the service into the future. He has assured them that he will continue to secure and provide the resources needed to improve the public service infrastructure.In tandem with eliminating the backlog, the Minister for Transport is determined to support a better public service delivery of the driving test to the benefit of both customers and staff. Ultimately, if we can conclude agreement of our backlog proposals, there are substantial gains to be made. These include a major contribution to road safety, improved customer service for applicants, the advancement of further road safety reforms and assist in reducing insurance premiums.
#FrankFeighan	unknown-#FrankFeighan-party	unknown-#FrankFeighan-dob	unknown-#FrankFeighan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	271	I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment, and the Minister for coming to the House. This issue concerns the Arigna Catchment Area Community Company, to which the Minister has been very helpful. The Minister is aware that this company deals with all the electoral areas in County Leitrim and north Roscommon — Boyle, Castlerea, Ballaghaderreen and Strokestown. Of this area, 90% has been designated a CLÁR area.The area of Leitrim and north Roscommon has long been associated with both population decline and rural decline. The Arigna Catchment Area Community Company has gone a long way towards addressing this problem in a collective and planned way. The company is certainly having an impact on the area and in terms of creating jobs. Leitrim and Roscommon are the only counties in Ireland where deaths exceed births. Three quarters of the total catchment area is rural, with only four towns having a population of over 1,000.The Arigna Catchment Area Community Company has a proven record. I understand, based on statistics from the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, that it is among the top three Leader programmes in the country. However, I am worried about the call to abolish the Arigna Leader programme and reorganise the programme on a countywide basis.The Arigna Catchment Area Community Company is a unique Leader programme. People in north Roscommon do not simply deal with the entire county. They shop in Carrick-on-Shannon, Sligo or towns in Leitrim. They have worked very closely in a joint tourism initiative between north Roscommon and Leitrim. A new structure should be developed which can collectively address the shared problems of Leitrim and north Roscommon. It is about people and delivering maximum resources and the Arigna Leader programme has proved it can do this.The area's dependence on the building industry is worrying. A considerable amount of construction is taking place as part of the upper Shannon renewal process. I am concerned that this work will come to a halt and that there will be no cohesive body in place to deal with the problems caused by a decline in the building trade. Many farmers have moved into the building trade and the same grouping will not be present.I can understand the Minister's perspective but if the Arigna Leader programme is joined with the rest of the county, it could result in the programme losing out on cross-Border funding. For the past 15 years, people in north Roscommon witnessed other counties availing of the International Fund for Ireland while north Roscommon was unable to avail of it. The area is now receiving funding for some projects through the Arigna Leader programme and people are very satisfied with this situation.If people think the Leader programme should be reorganised on a countywide basis, it could be argued that all existing agencies should be disbanded and reorganised similarly. Attempts are being made to introduce decentralisation, both from Dublin to the regions and from county towns to regions where programme delivery is needed. Arigna is nearly 40 miles from Roscommon. I am not saying that the Leader programme will be based in Roscommon but we must examine decentralisation on a county basis. This is a vital argument to ensure the future of the Arigna Leader programme in north Roscommon and Leitrim.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-01 00:00:00	Prelude	272	I thank Senator Feighan for raising this issue on the Adjournment and welcome the opportunity to clarify what I have previously clarified in respect of the procedure currently taking place. The Leader area-based rural development initiative is delivered in County Leitrim and north County Roscommon by the Arigna Catchment Area Community Company based in Arigna, County Roscommon.Under this EU co-funded initiative, €3,495,000 was allocated to the group to fund the delivery of its business plan for the period 2000-06. The business plan must be delivered in accordance with operating rules issued by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, which is the managing authority for Leader in Ireland.Under the initiative, funding is available for a number of projects, including rural agritourism. The Arigna Leader programme has allocated €714,000 from its budget to fund rural agritourism projects. It has funded the development of tourism accommodation and integrated marketing campaigns for its area. Significant projects in place include the Leitrim-Roscommon walks network, Wild Rose Leisure on Lough Gill, the Agriculture and Farm Heritage Museum, Ballinamore, County Leitrim, and the development of walking and cycling routes in north Leitrim. As Senator Feighan noted, I have visited the area and hold the work carried out by the Arigna Leader programme in high regard. The fruits of its work are clear.From 2007, a new rural development programme will be introduced which will cover all rural areas. The introduction of this new programme will provide rural development organisations and the communities they serve with opportunities and resources to work together for the betterment of their communities. Such opportunities will include rural tourism measures. The cohesion process aims to improve arrangements under which community and local development initiatives are delivered, and it is being further advanced this year. I allocated funding of €3,373,527 to city and county development boards in support of cohesion proposals developed by community and local development agencies. There will be a further €4,273,000 in cohesion funding available this year in support of improved cohesion and volunteering.It is important to understand what I am trying to achieve. The core objective of the 2005-06 round of cohesion funding is the alignment of local, community and rural development organisations to achieve full area coverage of these programmes by the end of 2006. The local development social inclusion programme, LDSIP, should cover everyone in the State who needs a service, including lone parents, Travellers or anyone else, regardless of whether they live in the poshest or poorest road in town. The partnership must cover everyone and focus on the target groups. It is intended that the LDSIP will cover urban and rural areas in all parts of the State. Subject to discharging our obligations under EU requirements in regard to the selection of companies in rural areas, this will involve rural and local development groups coming together to secure a unified overarching structure which will provide full area coverage. In urban areas, this will involve local development groups securing full area cover, which is not currently the case in Dublin. Major areas and pockets of disadvantage were omitted.The major advantage of such an approach is that the State will be able to deliver programmes such as the rural social scheme through these new unified structures because they will have all-area cover. My preference is for unified overarching structures based around county boundaries, where practicable. One could point to home and a Gaeltacht Leader partnership, but for linguistic reasons, one cannot service it through the local partnerships. However, I will consider variations across county boundaries on their merits. I want to make it clear that I have not closed that door.As regards Leitrim and Roscommon, there are currently five companies providing services, two Leader companies and three partnerships. The intention from 2007 is that Leitrim and Roscommon will be served by fewer integrated companies, providing both local and rural development programmes. Proposals on the exact area covered by such companies are being developed by the relevant agencies. In this regard, proposals from Roscommon County Development Board have just been received in my Department and proposals from the Leitrim County Development Board are currently awaited. On receipt of proposals from both counties, the matter will be considered further in consultation with the local agencies on the ground.The concern appears to be that it will be three versus one vote locally and I will sign off on it. I assure the Senator that the Leader and partnership programmes and the rural and social scheme will be delivered by one agency in one area the next time round. This aspect is non-negotiable.In the long-term, people will see the merits of making the partnership go nationwide. However, if a good case is made and agreement is obtained, I am open to flexibility on whether to stick rigidly to county boundaries. I have purposely allowed for some leeway because I accept that one size does not fit all. What people in the area want is what will determine the outcome. Even though I do not know how I will work it out, I am sure the Senator will advise me on the issue.

I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, to the House and congratulate him on his new appointment.The fishing vessels lost at sea scheme was introduced by the then Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey. The scheme was launched in June 2001. The closing date for receipt of applications was 31 December 2001. The purpose of the scheme was to compensate families or individuals who had lost fishing vessels at sea by restoring to them the equivalent tonnage of the lost vessel. While it seemed a great idea and an excellent scheme, it turned out to be more a scam than a scheme.First, the scheme was only advertised in the three marine publications, The Marine Times, The Skipper and The Fishing News. There was no publication of the scheme on national or local radio, on television or in the national or local print press. As a result, individuals or families who had lost fishing vessels and were no longer involved in fishing were unaware of the scheme and, therefore, could not apply. One such family was the Byrne family from Bruckless, County Donegal. Francis Byrne was the owner and skipper of the Skifjord which sank off the Donegal coast in October 1981. Mr. Byrne, his son, Jimmy, and three crewmen were lost. Two of the bodies were never recovered. Francis’s widow was left to rear her surviving eight children.The Byrnes were out of fishing and were totally unaware of the scheme. They applied late via the Minister and local Deputy, Deputy Coughlan. Their application was rejected because it was too late. Danny Byrne, son of the deceased owner and skipper, contacted me. I took up the matter with the Ombudsman. Nothing I can say here can adequately express my admiration for the diligence with which the Ombudsman delved into the issue and arrived at the conclusion that the scheme was "seriously deficient and flawed".When the Ombudsman went digging for information on the Skifjord— five people had been drowned — the Department of the Communications, Marine and Natural Resources replied that it had no record of the Skifjord case. When the Ombudsman persisted, the Department eventually recovered two extensive files on the Skifjord “in deep storage”. What a Department. What a mess. What a scam.The net outcome is that the bereaved and-or financially bereft families who could have or should have qualified for the scheme never even knew about it. How could they as they were not among the chosen few? Four months before the scheme was launched, the then Minister, Deputy Fahey, sat down with two of his Galway West constituent applicants from the Aran Islands and unveiled the proposed terms of the scheme to them. One of them was so patently ineligible that a senior civil servant advised the Minister that the application should be rejected. However, it was not rejected. The official was overruled — enough said. The applicant in question, and another of the Minister's crony constituents got 75% of the available tonnage.This was an EU-approved scheme. The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, and the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, must reply in the first instance to the queries raised by the Ombudsman. However, I am certain of one thing. If no action is forthcoming from the Minister, Europe will act vigorously.

Following consultation with the fishing industry representative organisations, the fishing vessels lost at sea scheme was introduced in June 2001. The purpose of this scheme was to enable qualifying applicants, who were otherwise unable to do so for financial or related reasons, to provide replacement capacity for the purposes of introducing a replacement vessel in respect of fishing boats lost at sea between 1980 and the establishment of the fishing boat register in 1990, in order to continue a family tradition of sea-fishing. The scheme did not provide financial support for the acquisition of a fishing vessel itself.The scheme was announced via press advertisements placed in The Marine Times, The Skipper and The Fishing News. The Department also wrote to the representative organisations, as well as the potential applicants which were then known, with details of the scheme. The closing date for receipt of applications was 31 December 2001. Some 68 applications were received and six were successful. All applications received were assessed in accordance with the terms of the scheme. Unsuccessful applicants were refused on the basis that they failed to satisfy one or more of the scheme’s criteria. The amount of capacity made available was based on the capacity of the lost vessel that was the subject of the application. The total amount of replacement capacity made available to the six successful applicants was 283.7 gross tonnes and 1,071.01 kw.In January 2003, over 12 months after the closing date, an application under the scheme was received in the Department from a family in County Donegal. The vessel in question had sunk in October 1981 off the Donegal coast with the tragic loss of five lives. The family was informed that its application could not be considered because it was not received by the closing date.In December 2004, the Office of the Ombudsman wrote to the Department indicating that it was examining a complaint from the family in question in regard to its application under the scheme, and seeking specified information. The Department provided the information and documentation required in full. Following further correspondence, the Ombudsman suggested a "serious defect" of the scheme was that fishing representatives and 16 individuals were contacted in regard to the scheme but that the Department was aware of other cases and did not contact them. The Ombudsman also suggested the scheme be reviewed and that relevant cases not contacted by the Department at the time of its launch be considered eligible to apply and have their cases examined.Having considered this letter, the Department wrote to the Ombudsman pointing out, inter alia, that it was not necessary to have identified all potential cases in advance of launching the scheme. As is the case with any call for applications, tenders or expressions of interest, the Department could have no definitive way of knowing in advance the number of vessels that might be covered by the scheme. Furthermore, and critically, due to changes in EU rules introduced since the scheme was launched, it would not be possible to reopen it. The allocation of further capacity under this scheme or any similar scheme would now be in breach of EU legislation in so far as vessels would be licensed and entered on the fishing boat register without the removal of equivalent capacity from it.The purpose of the scheme was clearly to sustain or maintain a family tradition of sea-fishing. Any replacement capacity granted would have to be used by the family of the applicant only and could not be sold. Accordingly, it was reasonable that the then Minister, in introducing the scheme, would do so in a way that reasonably targeted persons involved in the fishing industry, as was consistent with the purpose of the scheme. The fact that persons no longer involved in the fishing industry were not specifically targeted was not inconsistent with the purpose of the concession being introduced.In the case of any administrative scheme there must, if there is to be any certainty in public policy making, be some cut-off date. The cut-off date for applications for this scheme was 31 December 2001 and the family's application was received more than a year late. The decision to refuse the application in question was, therefore, reasonable.Furthermore, the legal environment has changed radically from the time the scheme was introduced. As I already indicated, member states are precluded from entering new capacity into the fleet without a compensatory withdrawal of at least the same amount of capacity. Even if the scheme had been left open-ended, it would have been terminated as of 31 December 2002. Accordingly, I do not accept the scheme was deficient, nor do I propose to review or reopen it as EU regulations do not now allow for such a scheme.
