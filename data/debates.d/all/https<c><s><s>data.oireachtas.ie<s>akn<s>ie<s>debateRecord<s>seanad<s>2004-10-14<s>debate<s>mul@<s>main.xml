          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to clarify the position regarding the urgent necessity of an extension to the Shannon water scheme to include Loughhill, Ballyhahill, Glin and part of Shanagolden.</p>

          <from>Mr. Finucane</from>
          <p eId="para_7">Some 14 months ago, the tragic death of Róisín Ruddle occurred after she was sent home because an operation could not proceed at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin. The then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, promised an investigation into the affair but there is still no sight of it 14 months later. Last Monday, operations on two children were cancelled with one child already gowned and ready for theatre. That child's operation was first scheduled for last June but was cancelled. Can one imagine the emotional trauma of the child's parents? Some 20 heart operations on children at Crumlin hospital have been deferred. Will the new Minister for Health and Children take action to rectify the situation at Crumlin hospital to ensure there are no more tragic losses?</p>

          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_8">I support Senator Finucane on this matter and the fundamental problems behind it need to be examined. There is a shortage of intensive care nurses and the Government claims we cannot produce enough of them. However, the reason for the shortage of nurses is because they go abroad where they are paid twice the salary they would receive in Ireland. The number of training places for intensive care nurses must be increased. Fees must also be waived on the basis that a commitment is given by those trained nurses to work in Ireland for seven years. This is done in many other areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">This difficulty runs throughout the health system up to consultants. The shortage of consultants is caused by a shortage of doctors. This is because the majority of medical college entrants are women, of which 70% work for less than five years. I accept it is their choice but if I was in charge of training, I would ensure that the outcome took this into account. The shortage of therapists is due to the same factors. If the colleges cannot produce enough therapists, intake to courses should be increased to make it easier for people to train as speech therapists and physiotherapists. These management problems can be fixed. Solutions to these difficulties need to be addressed firmly rather than just talked about. I call for a debate on the matter with the new Minister for Health and Children to find an agreed solution.</p>

          <p eId="para_10">I agree with Members on the apparent recurring crisis at Crumlin hospital. It is rich of the Tánaiste to tell the Opposition not to play politics with the issue. Does that mean we should not mention it? It is our moral and political obligation to raise such issues and endeavour to find a solution.</p>
          <p eId="para_11">I compliment the Tánaiste and the Progressive Democrats on sorting out Fianna Fáil on the overseas development aid issue. The Tánaiste made it clear there has been no change in Government policy and that it looked forward to Ireland meeting its commitments and reaching the UN target in 2007. I spend a lot of time here giving out about the Progressive Democrats but I compliment them on what I hope will be the restoration of the Government's credibility on the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_12">I wish to put a name on the record which I cannot even pronounce. Lyman Hams is a 13 year old Palestinian girl who was murdered by an officer of the Israeli defence forces last week on the evidence of other members of the same defence forces. That is a worse offence than all of what we saw and which outraged us so much about United States troops in Iraq. We saw nothing as brutal as that. It is time we began to wonder about whether we should allow a state, which apparently tolerates such activities, to be part of what we call the community of democratic states. I say that while being fully aware of the horrible things that have been done by suicide bombers. One cannot run a civilised society if incidents or activities such as that are, in any way, diluted or tolerated. That is why I wish to put that young girl's name on the record of this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">Can we have a debate on competitiveness? When we have debates on competitiveness, it inevitably ends up being entirely about wage rates. According to the World Economic Forum, this country's competitiveness problems have very little to do with our wage rates and a lot to do with our lack of technological development, our weaknesses in infrastructure, our poor institutional arrangements and the excessively centralised nature of our economic decision making which is good code for the mess the Department of Finance keeps making of everybody else's efforts to operate efficiently. It is high time we had a debate on competitiveness. A good report has been written by the World Economic Forum which should be the basis of that debate. I do not think we are that overwhelmed with business and I ask the Leader to consider it at an early stage.</p>

However, there is one area in which we have more than met our commitments, namely, the €40 million which this Government gave to the GAA two weeks ago to help it complete the great facility which is Croke Park. I remind the Leader I am most certainly not speaking outside of Government. However, I am quite disturbed that €40 million of taxpayers' money should be given out without strings attached.

She can fool some of the people some of the time, but she certainly will not fool people into thinking the Hanly report is good for the 26 communities due for a hospital downgrade under the Hanly reform programme. I have asked that the Minister come to the House to set out her health policy, in particular on the Hanly report. I call on her to publish Hanly II as soon as possible.

If Hanly II has to take into consideration a decentralised service or cutbacks, we have to look at an all-Ireland health strategy, not just a Twenty-six Counties strategy.

This sounds like the introduction of rates on properties, a property tax by the back door. It is very important that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government comes to the House to discuss this issue. We would all agree there is a need for some kind of reform and additional funding in local government but it would not be acceptable to have a return to property tax and rates on property.

Our lack of competitiveness has put the continuation of some form of Celtic tiger in serious jeopardy.</p>
          <p eId="para_75">A recent newspaper article revealed that Motorola had decided against locating its European finance unit in Cork despite IDA hopes to the contrary. We need to get our act together. We have spoken about it indirectly in the Seanad but we need to have a serious debate about our lack of competitiveness.</p>

          <p eId="para_76">I support Senator Leyden's call for a general debate on planning, particularly in regard to An Taisce. Another body that needs to be considered in this context is Dúchas. I accept that the previous Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government made great efforts in terms of dismantling the structure of Dúchas but some issues remain outstanding, especially in regard to the development of infrastructural projects throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_77">Dúchas ecologists and some engineers tend to take a retrograde view of the development of infrastructural projects. Most projects involve a long drawn out consultation between Dúchas and local authorities with the result that water and sewerage projects do not go ahead as quickly as they might. This impacts on the issue raised by Senator White, our competitiveness. Without the required level of infrastructure to develop rural areas in particular there is no chance we will be able to develop along the lines discussed. I would appreciate a debate on planning matters at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>

I do not know where such a debate could be fitted in, but I shall endeavour to find out.</p>

Senator Dooley called for a debate on planning and Dúchas as regards interaction with the local authorities. Senator Kitt wanted a debate on planning and mentioned the shortage of medical personnel, which echoes Senator O'Toole's comments.

It is premature to insert a definition which relies on legislation that may be repealed in the near future.

It will probably take two or three months to go through the Houses and she is allowing only a six-month timeframe thereafter within which people must comply. Six months is not sufficient. Next year we will be using a new payment system for farmers, the single farm payment, which will not be due until the end of next year. There should not be any onus on farmers to pay until those payments arise because in the interim there are no facilities for farmers to get payments due to them from the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_116">I accept the Minister's point regarding people who make an effort but the officials may not accept that and there will be a difficulty later on. There should be a definite timeframe for farmers to pay the arrears so that they can benefit from this offer.</p>

I am concerned by Senator Coonan's suggested closing date of 31 January 2006. In some cases one may not be able to come within that timescale because of difficulty with title and so on, and the goal would not be achieved. One of the benefits of the scheme is that all payments would be processed as quickly as possible. I do not disagree with the Senator but setting a closing date may create a problem he does not envisage.</p>

          <p eId="para_118">I am concerned at the confusion in the House on the need for a clear title and in some cases to take out grants of administration. My Department does not require clear title for redemption of an annuity. Those annuitants, however, who need to raise finance to avail of the offer may need to show clear title in order to obtain a loan. These people need to ensure their title is now in order. In the event that it is not in order they should act without delay and instruct their solicitors. On the enactment of the Bill I intend to introduce a scheme bringing forward the buy-out. I anticipate the scheme will commence in the spring of next year for six months to the end of autumn 2005.</p>
          <p eId="para_119">There is no need to extend the scheme beyond the latter half of 2005 because individuals will have the best part of 12 months from now to organise the title and finances. I cannot predict interest rate movements in the future but I am aware that annuitants may obtain commercial loans below the annuity rate now paid. It would be imprudent for individuals to delay in taking up the offer as there will be no decrease in the amount tabled and interest rates may rise. On this basis I appreciate the concerns expressed by both Senators, particularly as we know it is in the nature of Irish people to leave dealing with such matters until the very last minute. We will ensure that people showing true form legally, through a solicitor, will be dealt with favourably.</p>

          <p eId="para_120">The Minister has clarified the point somewhat but she needs to do more work on it. Next year, under the new system, the farmers will not have been paid by the time her deadline arrives. For the sake of the extra few months she should give the farmers that co-operation. Many of them are struggling to survive in farming and many farmers have left the land over recent years. We should not make it harder for them to survive on the land. I appeal to the Minister to ensure they will have received their single farm payment for 2005 before the deadline. This will make it easier to pay; it is all about money.</p>

          <from>Mary Coughlan</from>
          <p eId="para_121">The Senator is absolutely right. It was of grave concern to me that a few farmers had very large arrears and considerable land holdings too, although I doubt the Senator is speaking of them. There are 15 annuitants with arrears in excess of €20,000 and a further 34 with arrears between €10,000 and €20,000. In total, 49 cases owe €1 million. That is a considerable sum of money. We have had two previous opportunities for a buy-out. We are all sincere in saying that if someone is under pressure we will try to facilitate them. That is why there were two previous buy-outs and a large reduction was given last time. There is a write-off for the small landholders as they are in most need of care. Few of these land holdings are in disadvantaged areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_122">I appreciate the Senator's concern but while there are difficulties with title, as we all know, the fairest way to deal with people under pressure is to ask their solicitors to advise the Department that they are dealing with this and are anxious to participate in the scheme. I will keep a watching brief on this. We have spoken about this in the Department and it is the best way to deal with it. Many of those with considerable arrears would have been receiving their grants over the years and the best solution is for them to deal with this at a commercial level. The annuities were paid at 11% but one can raise a commercial loan for much less.</p>

However, I was not suggesting that any of the arrears be written off and I do not see a finance deficit in the proposal in one of my amendments. I asked that the Department agree a schedule with farmers for the payment of arrears to give them some time to pay the arrears and bring them up to date. This applies particularly to medium-sized farms which are experiencing some financial hardship. In order to avail of the scheme they must pay their arrears in full. Much of the arrears payment comprises interest accumulated over the years. I am not suggesting that the arrears should be written off but that there be a timeframe and a plan for payment.</p>

All Members of both Houses would agree that we have moved on. The Land Commission has been gone for more than 20 years. We want landowners to be landowners, which is the best way to deal with the issue. It is on this basis that we are trying to impress on people the need to deal with the issue as quickly as possible. On the last occasion we had an adjustment of repayments to give a reduction of 10% and still we find ourselves in this situation. With the legislation passed heretofore, the sincere expectation was that people would get their affairs sorted out. Unfortunately, this has not happened. Concerns have been expressed at the way we allowed arrears to build up. As the Senator knows, many people would not be particularly enamoured with that situation. On this basis we need to introduce this legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_135">The Minister has proposed that the Department would be able to hold back payments due to farmers to offset against arrears of land annuities. Farmers should be subject to the same laws of the land as everybody else. The system of revenue sheriffs exists for those who do not pay their way. It is grossly unfair to introduce this legislation giving power to the Department to take farmers' money. This is robbery of another kind. This touches a nerve concerning collections of money for land down through the years. The Minister should seriously reconsider this proposal. The other legal systems for collection of moneys due should be used and farmers should be treated in the same way as every other citizen.</p>

At present only 2,300 such persons exist and this number should be considerably reduced after the proposed buy-out goes ahead. We have discussed this matter to ensure no delay will be caused in the Department. My view is that we should issue these certificates immediately on a turnaround basis.</p>

Departmental civil servants should be obliged to be fair and balanced in their interaction with farmers and other sectoral groups. I appreciate the Minister's response and I will withdraw my amendment on that basis. When the Department of Agriculture and Food is producing legislation in the future, perhaps it will consider the insertion of a provision that will oblige the Minister to interact with the Department's customers — in this case, farmers — in a fair and practical manner.</p>

          <p eId="para_154">Section 5 requires those who are registering a land transaction, as defined in this section, to furnish beforehand a clearance certificate to the Land Registry to confirm that no arrears of annuities are due to the Department. Clearance certificates will be issued by my Department. Under section 5(2), as currently drafted, the Land Registry does not require that a certificate of clearance in respect of annuity arrears be furnished in the case of a site transfer of one hectare or less.</p>
          <p eId="para_155">One of the Bill's main objectives is to reduce the level of arrears of annuity payments that has developed in recent years. The amount of such arrears is approximately €5 million at present. Amendment No. 13 will ensure that farmers who do not avail of the buy-out scheme and have not maintained annuity payments in the past will be obliged to discharge all outstanding arrears where they are receiving capital from the sale of a portion of their land.</p>
          <p eId="para_156">I am conscious that farmers with annuity arrears may make voluntary transfers with no consideration passing. A site may be transferred from a farmer to his son or daughter, for example. In such circumstances, my Department will, as in set-off situations, discuss the annuity arrears position with the farmer concerned before deciding to issue a clearance certificate to the Land Registry. The House should note that if there are no annuity arrears, the clearance certificate required will be issued to the annuity holder without undue delay. Annuity holders are obliged, just like all mortgage holders in the State, to ensure that their financial circumstances are in order at all times. The proposed amendment will ensure that we meet the overall objective of the Bill, which is to reduce the number of annuity holders with arrears. I ask the House to accept the amendment.</p>

In tabling this matter on the Adjournment, I am conscious of the fact that the scheme was ratified by Limerick County Council in its assessment of need at a December 2003 meeting. It was fifth in its priority sequence and I know that the matter has been passed on to the Minister of State's Department. The area about which we are talking is in the extreme west of the country. It embraces Loughhill, Ballyhahill, Glin and parts of Shanagolden, where the quality of water provided to urban communities is acceptable. However, there is an entire rural network there and in many cases people are not part of group water schemes. The council has justified this with the very successful Shannon Estuary water supply scheme, which has the capacity to cope with all those extra areas. It has put forward a submission which would lead to a very coherent policy for the whole area. Perhaps the Minister of State might indicate the timeframe for the Department to provide funding to proceed with the much-needed extension in the area.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_167">I do not know whether I will be able to answer the Senator's last question, but I thank him for raising this issue. I would like, first, to give a brief overview of the major investment being made by the Department in improving water services infrastructure throughout the country, and especially in Limerick, under the national development plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_168">Last May, the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, published the water services investment programme for the three-year period from 2004 to 2006, which was made up of 869 schemes at different stages of development with a total national investment value of €5 billion. Almost 150 new projects, worth €556 million, have been added to the rolling three-year programme since last year. It is the most significant milestone yet in the push to bring our water services infrastructure up to a world standard.</p>
          <p eId="para_169">The total allocated to Limerick county and city under the latest phase of the water services programme comes to over €142 million, extending to some 22 individual schemes, including bundled schemes. Among those are major sewerage projects for Limerick city, Adare, Patrickswell, Athea, Askeaton, Foynes, Shanagolden, Glin, Kilmallock, Dromcollogher, Hospital, Pallasgreen and Bruff. The programme also includes major water supply schemes such as the upgrading of the Clareville water treatment plant, the provision of trunk water mains to serve Patrickswell, Adare, Croom, Pallasgreen and Oola and extensions and improvements to the Shannon Estuary water supply scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">Funding has also been provided under the serviced land initiative to bring additional residential sites on stream as rapidly as possible to meet housing needs at several locations around the county. It is clear from all this that a very large number of towns and villages in Limerick are directly benefiting from the drive to bring our water and sewerage infrastructure up to a modern standard.</p>
          <p eId="para_171">With regard to extension of the Shannon water scheme to include Loughhill, Ballyhahill, Glin and part of Shanagolden, the framing of the water services investment programme took into account the lists of water and sewerage schemes provided by the local authorities in response to my Department's request in 2003 to produce updated assessments of the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments.</p>
          <p eId="para_172">An extension of the Shannon Estuary water supply scheme to Loughhill, Ballyhahill and Glin was fifth on the list of schemes submitted by Limerick County Council for the period from 2004 to 2006. A water supply scheme for Shanagolden was included as a longer term priority for the period from 2007 to 2012. Owing to the level of competing demand and the need to prioritise individual proposals on a national basis, it has not been possible to include those schemes in the programme. However, the position will be reconsidered when my Department is drawing up its next water services investment programme, having regard to their placing in the most up-to-date assessment of needs available from the local authority at that time. I assure the Senator that I will report back, having listened to what he said. It will be taken into account in framing the next programme.

          <p eId="para_174">Yes. The programme was operating from 2004 to 2006. On the basis of what the Minister of State said, the scheme would probably be considered in the context of a programme beyond 2006.</p>

          <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_175">Yes. I am not sure, but it seems to be the practice to add some schemes, since the programme is rolling. It was certainly the case last year that some were added. That happens every year. However, it seems that it will be beyond 2006. If it is a rolling programme, that might be adjusted this year or next to 2005 to 2008. I am not quite sure, but it need not necessarily mean that one must end the current three-year programme before starting another. It is often done on the basis of a rolling programme adjusted on an ongoing basis. I hear what the Senator is saying and I will raise the points he made in the Department.</p>

          <from>Mr. Dooley</from>
          <p eId="para_177">I thank the Minister of State for attending today to respond to this matter. He will know from the matter submitted that it relates to the extension of the co-operative service to the east Clare area. I know that the Minister of State is familiar with the county, including the eastern part.</p>
          <p eId="para_178">The co-operative service is a major component of the primary health care strategy produced by the Department of Health and Children. As it stands, the lower Lough Derg region in County Clare is the only area in the county to which the co-operative programme has not yet been rolled out. It is known in County Clare as Shannondoc and is working very successfully in the north and west of the county and in the Ennis region. Parts of east Clare are very rural and quite a distance from any towns or villages where people live. Obviously, the service would be of immense benefit. The area stretches from Whitegate through Mountshannon, Scariff, Killenena, Feakle, Flagmount and so on down to Ogonelloe and across to Killaloe. It also takes in an area in Bridgetown and around Broadford, heading towards the Limerick border. The central region referred to as part of the Mid-Western Health Board region also takes in a small part of County Limerick on the eastern side and also part of north Tipperary from Ballina out to Newport.</p>
          <p eId="para_179">It is critical that we get this moving. I know that the doctors of the region have come together. They are prepared to work and have a plan in place. I understand all that is required is Department sanction. In many cases throughout the country there is difficulty in finding personnel and in getting doctors to agree on the strategy for the out-of-hours service. That is not an issue in this matter. My understanding is that the programme will be ready for launch in about four weeks if the Department can approve it, provide the money and look after the technical aspects.</p>
          <p eId="para_180">I ask the Minister of State to give due consideration to the request. The service would be of immense benefit and ensure that the people who live in that diversely populated area have the comfort of knowing that medical personnel are on call. The region is also important in terms of tourism and while the population is quite spread out during the winter, there is a concentration of population, with all the difficulties that can entail, particularly associated with Lough Derg. It is important that the service be put in place as soon as possible.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. B. Lenihan)</from>
          <p eId="para_181">I thank Senator Dooley for raising this matter on the Adjournment. It is a very important matter in County Clare and in what is now the Mid-Western Health Board functional area.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">One of the key objectives of the Government has been to promote, develop and provide an effective and efficient system of general practitioner out-of-hours co-operatives. This has been an important development in improving the working conditions of the general practitioner and the delivery of service to the patient.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">There are out-of-hours co-operatives in all health board areas at present, the majority of which provide full out-of-hours cover. The level of patient satisfaction with the service being offered by the co-operatives is very high both from the patient and provider perspectives and the development of such co-operatives plays a central role in the Government's primary care strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">The Department of Health and Children has provided €46.5 million to health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority between 2000 and 2003 for the expansion of out-of-hours co-operatives. In 2004, in excess of €26 million was allocated into baseline funding, bringing the total to in excess of approximately €70 million by the end of 2004. This figure does not include the fees paid to the participating general practitioners.</p>
          <p eId="para_185">A very good example of a successful implementation of such a co-operative can be seen in the Shannondoc service which has been operating in the former Mid-Western Health Board's area. Since its inception as the Department of Health and Children, the Department has provided over €7.827 million in funding to Shannondoc. The first cell of the co-operatives started in the mid-west in May 2002 in Clare. The co-operatives was extended to cover Tipperary north on 15 October 2002. The co-operatives in the Mid-Western Health Board now involves 110 GPs working on a special consultation-type payment basis, providing services in parts of counties Limerick, Clare and Tipperary.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">Submissions have been received, and a meeting has been held with officials from the Mid-Western Health Board with regard to the funding required to expand to this and other areas of the region. Decisions on the geographical areas to be covered by co-operatives and the order in which development occurs are matters for the relevant health board, which must have regard to the range of financial and other issues involved. Further expansion will be considered in the context of service requirements, health board proposals and funding availability. I should point out that my Department has requests for funding for co-operative expansion from several health board areas.</p>
