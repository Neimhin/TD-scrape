            <p eId="para_10">I welcome the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross. I always knew he would be in that seat one day.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#KieranODonnell" eId="spk_3">
            <from>Senator Kieran O'Donnell<recordedTime time="2016-06-16T10:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_11">I, too, welcome the Minister. It is particularly significant that he is a former Member of the House, but the issue I am bringing up is more significant. As a Senator based in Limerick city, the upgrade of the N20 to a motorway is the number one infrastructural project for those living in Cork and Limerick. If one travels from Cork to Limerick, the N20 is approximately 100 km in length and the journey takes well over an hour and a half. In the past 12 to 14 months alone, there have been nine fatalities along the route. Therefore, we need a motorway from a safety perspective, if for no other reason. If one drives on the M7, it takes just over two hours to travel from Limerick to Dublin, a distance of 200 km.</p>
            <p eId="para_12"> We speak about the need for regional development, but we need to put it into action. There is a need for balanced regional development, with the Cork-Limerick-Galway axis acting as a counter-pole to Dublin which is bursting at the seams. There is a need to upgrade the N20 to expand the western corridor from Limerick to Cork. Many of my constituents in Limerick commute on a daily basis between Limerick and Cork. Many have businesses in both locations and a rising tide will lift all boats for us in the southern region.</p>
            <p eId="para_13"> There are a couple of aspects to the issue. Route selection has already taken place and the plan was submitted to An Bord Pleanála. However, due to the finances, the project was discontinued in November 2011. What is required is a ministerial direction to restart the scheme. Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, formerly the National Roads Authority, should be required to prepare an updated business case for the M20 route which would stand on its own merits. It would provide the engine to drive growth in both Limerick and Cork. I understand the project would be costly, but the Minister will know, as a former member of the Committee of Public Accounts, that we are looking for value for money. Construction of the motorway which would be 80 km in length would lead to the travelling time being cut by about 30 minutes. One would be able to commute from Limerick to Cork in just over an hour. We are at a comparative disadvantage in the region in that we have a substandard road linking the second and third largest cities in the country. This being a modern economy, we have to ensure the project will take place.</p>
            <p eId="para_14"> Much of the work in terms of route selection, including environmental impact studies, the signing of motorway orders and holding oral hearings, had started with An Bord Pleanála. I understand the Minister will probably have to go through the same process again, but if the existing route is the one that will ultimately be chosen, much of the work will already have been done. </p>
            <p eId="para_15"> I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this Commencement matter. What I want from the Minister is a clear direction that he will get the planning process under way again. I know that a mid-term review of the capital plan is due to take place in the next year. Will he ask TII to upgrade the business case in order that he can kick-start the process?</p>

            <p eId="para_21">That is right. I congratulate Members on being elected to the Seanad. It is a great honour and this will be a great Seanad. Seanad reform is coming. It is wonderful to have a House in which there is no overall Government majority to ram things through. The Government will have to talk to other parties and Independent Senators to get legislation through. That is welcome and I believe the Seanad will play a significant role, something it has not played in the past. I look forward to being in the House frequently in the next five years.</p>
            <p eId="para_22"> I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to address this matter. I welcome him in the Seanad, although I am sorry that he is here because he was a very good Member of the other House, something which also applies to Senator Paudie Coffey. No doubt they will be back in the Dáil in the near future.</p>
            <p eId="para_23"> As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and the provision of funding for the national roads programme. The planning, design and implementation of individual national road projects are matters for Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, formerly known as the National Roads Authority, NRA, under the Roads Acts, 1993 to 2015, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned. Within its capital budget, the assessment and prioritisation of individual projects are, in the first instance, matters for TII in accordance with section 19 of the Roads Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_24"> Ireland has just under 100,000 km of road in its network and the maintenance and improvement of national, regional and local roads place a substantial financial burden on local authorities and the Exchequer. As a result of the financial position, there have been very large reductions in the Exchequer funding available for roads expenditure in the past few years. For this reason, the focus has had to be on maintenance and renewal rather than on major new improvement schemes. The proposed upgrade of the N20 was one of a range of proposed road development projects which had to be deferred.</p>
            <p eId="para_25"> The capital plan published in September 2015 outlined proposed transport investment priorities to 2022. The transport element of the plan was framed by the conclusions reached in my Department's strategic investment framework for land transport. The report highlighted the importance of the maintenance and renewal of transport infrastructure, together with targeted investments to address particular bottlenecks and critical safety issues. The capital plan provides €6 billion for investment in the road network in the period to 2022, with €4.4 billion earmarked for the maintenance and strengthening of the existing extensive network throughout the country and €1.6 billion for new projects. Allowing for the commitments relating to public private partnership, PPP, projects, the balance available for new projects within the available capital envelope was limited.</p>
            <p eId="para_26"> Given the funding constraints, a project of the scale of the M20 would have absorbed a<i>
							</i>substantial proportion of the budget for new projects. In the circumstances, as I understand it, the decision made by my predecessor was to provide for a mix of smaller scale projects across the country to address particular constraints, including bottlenecks and port connectivity. While it will not be possible to address all of the demands for improvement schemes in the period of the capital plan, the plan provides for the gradual build-up of capital funding for the road network towards the levels needed to support maintenance and improvement works. In this context, a number of important projects in Cork are included in the plan, including the upgrade of the Dunkettle roundabout and the N22 road between Ballyvourney and Macroom. In addition, the plan provides for the commencement of the N28 upgrade scheme, subject to necessary approvals.</p>
            <p eId="para_27"> We are all conscious that the recovery of the economy is generating spending pressures across the system, including capital investment needs. As part of A Programme for a Partnership Government, there is increased emphasis on the need for spending on public services, but the Government must still operate within EU fiscal rules and this constrains options. As the Senator mentioned, there will be a mid-term review of the capital plan which will provide an opportunity to assess progress and consider what scope there is for increased levels of investment, depending on economic growth. I expect the position on the M20 project to be considered as part of the review.</p>

            <from>Senator Kieran O'Donnell<recordedTime time="2016-06-16T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_28">Will the Minister request or direct Transport Infrastructure Ireland to prepare an updated business case for the M20 project? The business case conducted in 2009 clearly indicated the need for a motorway route between Limerick and Cork. It is a huge concern and priority for my constituents in Limerick. Furthermore, the fact that there have been nine fatalities along the route in the past 12 to 14 months provides an added impetus for the project to get under way. The Minister should request TII to produce an updated business case to be delivered to him. I ask him to inform the Seanad of the outcome of that review.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#ShaneRoss" eId="spk_11" as="#Minister_for_Transport,_Tourism_and_Sport">
            <from>Deputy Shane Ross<recordedTime time="2016-06-16T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_29">I take the Senator's point about the number of fatalities along the route. The matter is very serious and I have heard about it from many other sources apart from the Senator. I am not yet familiar with the road network of Ireland, but this is one road that has been highlighted by the Senator and others.</p>
            <p eId="para_30"> Regarding Transport Infrastructure Ireland, I will not necessarily do exactly as the Senator wishes. However, I am due to meet its representatives shortly - I am due to meet representatives of all of the semi-State bodies - and I will put the question the Senator has asked to them and listen to the case they should or should not do this. I will make a decision after I have talked to them.</p>

            <from>Senator Paudie Coffey<recordedTime time="2016-06-16T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_33">I welcome the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, to the House which is very familiar to him. I served as a Senator with him for a term, from 2007 to 2011. I also served for a term with him in the Lower House. This is my first opportunity to publicly wish him well with his portfolio. He brings vast experience to the office and I believe he will do a good job. He has a good understanding of what is required in the areas of transport, tourism and economic development.</p>
            <p eId="para_34"> As we heard in the earlier debate, transport and tourism are undoubtedly key economic components of the economy. Like the roads mentioned by Senator Kieran O'Donnell, other infrastructure such as the rail network, ports and airports is critical to unlocking the economic potential the regions offer to the economy. I have often compared Dublin and its environs to an economic vortex which sucks economic activity from the regions, as well as young educated people. They come to Dublin where jobs are be found and, unfortunately, do not return to the regions. Until we address the long-term strategic decisions in the context of regional and critical infrastructure development, we will not change that position.</p>
            <p eId="para_35"> There is a unique opportunity for all of us, including the Minister, to make strategic decisions in the interests of sustainable regional development. For that reason, I raise an issue of which the Minister is well aware, the long-term sustainable future of Waterford Airport. It serves the south east, a region that has been under-performing owing to the deficits in critical infrastructure provision. In fairness, some of them have been addressed in the past few years. With the development of the motorway to Waterford, one can already see the economic development it brings. Investments made by the Department and the Minister's predecessors in tourism initiatives have also brought about economic activity. I refer to the Viking Triangle in Ireland's oldest city, Waterford, and the Déise Greenway which is due to open later this year and which will link the oldest city in Ireland with one of the most beautiful harbour towns in the country, Dungarvan. It runs across the middle of the county of Waterford, with the coast on one side and the Comeragh Mountains on the other.</p>
            <p eId="para_36"> Waterford and the south-east region are very proud of what they have to offer. However, we need help in delivering the critical infrastructure that would allow us to layer economic activity and employment on top of it. Waterford Airport has experienced some difficulties during the years, with operational airlines coming and going. VLM Airlines is the most recent at the airport, but it has announced that it is to discontinue its services to Birmingham and Luton which are important connections to the United Kingdom, our neighbour, which bring people to the region who generate the activity I have mentioned.</p>
            <p eId="para_37">The board of and management team at Waterford Airport have worked assiduously in very difficult circumstances. The previous Government supported the airport through the worst economic times the country has experienced by providing grant aid of more than €5 million to keep it going. However, we now need to move to the next level. A runway extension at the airport is critical to allow jet aircraft to land there and in order that more operators will be interested in bringing passengers to and from not just Waterford but also the wider south-east region, where all the economic indicators are showing that we are underperforming. The south east can contribute to the economic recovery. It can contribute to job creation, in which we are all interested, but, more importantly, it can also contribute to the sustainability of the economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_38"> The Minister has a critical role to play. I understand he faces challenges and that he must spend his money wisely in terms of capital investment. If, however, he invests in this project, it will be a move he will not regret.</p>

            <from>Deputy Shane Ross<recordedTime time="2016-06-16T10:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_39">I thank the Senator for his kind words and congratulate him on his election to the House. I look forward to meeting him here in the near future. I thank him for raising this matter. I am well aware of the difficulties he is experiencing, particularly in the context of the airport in Waterford. A ministerial colleague, Deputy John Halligan, chews my ear off daily about the matter. The Senator can rest assured that his raising it in this House is extremely useful and adds to the strength of the argument which undoubtedly can be made. To reassure him and anyone who might think otherwise, I do not believe the benefits of regional airports can be measured in the annual profit and loss accounts or balance sheets alone. I know that there are serious regional benefits for the entire locality in Waterford and the other areas in which airports are located.</p>
            <p eId="para_40"> My Department has for many years operated a support programme for regional airports, including Waterford Airport, with substantial levels of funding provided in recognition of their contribution to balanced regional development. The latest iteration of the programme covers the five-year period 2015 to 2019 and was approved in August last year by the European Commission as being in conformity with its 2014 guidelines on state aid for airports and airlines.</p>
            <p eId="para_41"> The national aviation policy which was published by my Department last year acknowledges the role played by the regional airports in counties Donegal, Kerry and Waterford, as well as Ireland West Airport Knock, in promoting a level of international connectivity to support the tourism and business sectors in the regions in which they are located. I should mention that an extra €10 million in capital funding is being provided in the programme for Government for regional airports. This is additional to the €28 million already provided for this purpose in the capital plan for the period 2016 to 2022 and will enhance my Department's ability to further support the four airports mentioned.</p>
            <p eId="para_42"> In terms of capital support, my Department's regional airports programme provides Exchequer funding for the four regional airports to assist them in implementing necessary safety and security related projects, including requisite measures in these two areas to comply with regulatory requirements. The funding provided by my Department for such safety and security purposes is vital for these smaller airports and it is no exaggeration to say that without this Exchequer support, the airports would almost certainly be unable to continue to facilitate scheduled passenger services. In the past five years Waterford Airport has received €9.6 million in operational and investment support from my Department. In April this year a further €157,500 in grant aid was approved for a number of security projects, including the provision of new X-ray equipment, at the airport.</p>
            <p eId="para_43"> While our support programme for safety and security measures is important to the airports, it does not extend to investing in the provision of new capacity or expansions in airport infrastructure. The Exchequer is not in the business of investing in airports for development purposes and has not engaged in such investment, whether at State or regional airports. However regrettable, commercial decisions of that nature - for example, in extending a runway to cater for larger aircraft, expanding the capacity of a terminal building or the building a new car park - are one for airport authorities. I am aware that the authorities at Waterford Airport have ambitions to extend the runway and I understand they are pursuing local interests for funding for these plans. I will give them all possible encouragement. I was disappointed to hear last week that VLM Airlines, the only remaining commercial operator using the airport, had withdrawn its London-Luton service. It also withdrew from another route last month. However, I understand the airport is in detailed discussions with a number of airlines with a view to securing a replacement carrier.</p>

            <from>Senator Paudie Coffey<recordedTime time="2016-06-16T10:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_44">I acknowledge the Government support provided in recent years. I was closely involved in ensuring, in conjunction with the Minister's predecessors, that grant assistance was in place for the past five years. I am also conscious of the efforts made by the Minister of State, Deputy John Halligan, with whom I am working on this matter. I know that it is also of deep interest to my colleague, Senator Grace O'Sullivan, who is present in the House. As Oireachtas Members from Waterford and the south-east region, we want to work with the Minister on it. He is correct that the board of and management team at Waterford Airport have already made big advances in obtaining compulsory purchase orders to secure land for the runway extension. They have the support of the local authorities in the region which have put their money where their mouths are to support the airport. They are also active with business and commercial interests in raising funding to ensure the runway extension will be delivered.</p>
            <p eId="para_45"> Having said that, we still need support from the Minister and his Department. He is right in saying this is not just about the balance sheet. It also concerns the knock-on economic benefits access brings to a region. I have mentioned some of the jewels in the crown in the Waterford area. They are also to be found throughout the south east. Ireland's Ancient East is a programme that is being run by the Minister and his Department. Waterford city and county, as well as the region, will play a major role in emulating, in a different way, the economic benefits the Wild Atlantic Way has brought to the west. We need to do the same in the east and the south east. Waterford Airport is a critical component of that effort. We look forward to working with the Minister to try to advance what are not just local interests but also regional and national interests to avail of the benefits of economic activity. As my colleague has said and as many colleagues in this House will continue to say, we need to develop critical infrastructure in the regions if we are to unlock their inherent potential.</p>

            <p eId="para_47">I assure Senator Paudie Coffey that I am sympathetic to everything he has said, but he must realise the restrictions within which we work. As a former Minister of State, he will be aware of them. They are not just restrictions on the Exchequer but also the restrictions imposed by the state aid rules under which we work. We have to abide by them. The Minister of State, Deputy John Halligan, has asked me to visit the airport and I am willing to go and have a look at it. I will, of course, inform the Senator when I am going. I am very wiling to explore the avenues which are open to us to ensure the crises which Waterford Airport met in recent weeks on foot of VLM's decision will not be repeated.</p>

            <p eId="para_52"> I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, and congratulate her on her appointment. That said, I was expecting the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, to be here. I know that the Cathaoirleach and the Leader of the House cannot dictate this, but I seek assurances that when a matter is raised with the Minster who has overall responsibility, he will be here, unless there is a good reason for him not being present. It is not fair to send new Ministers of State into the House to deal with issues such as this when they are not in a position to give a definitive response to any supplementary question asked. That said, I welcome the Minister of State and wish her a successful career in the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_53">I was in it for a period and hope she will receive proper delegation of authority and responsibility, signed by the Minister, unlike in the past when no such delegations were made. Ministers had full responsibility and did not delegate any responsibility to Ministers of State. It is very important that all Ministers of State insist on this happening and having their delegated responsibilities signed off on and approved by the Government. </p>
            <p eId="para_54"> I raise the issue of the withdrawal of approximately €8 million for a rehabilitation unit at Roscommon University Hospital. In a statement published in the <i>Roscommon People </i>on 3 June Dr. Gerry O'Mara, a consultant geriatrician at the hospital, stated: "I believe that if this project does not go ahead, this hospital will eventually lose its inpatient beds and be allowed to wither."</p>
            <p eId="para_55"> It was announced in May 2015 that the Health Service Executive, HSE, had approved the provision of €7.85 million to build a ten-bed unit which would operate as a satellite centre for the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Dún Laoghaire. The HSE has now stated that, owing to funding constraints and competing priorities, no funding can be allocated for the project in 2016. It has confirmed that funding for the unit was included in the capital programme for the period 2016 to 2021 and that it is not intended to commence the project until later in the programme. </p>
            <p eId="para_56"> Roscommon University Hospital lost its year-round, 24-hour emergency unit. By way of compensation, it has gained a new endoscopy unit which has been partially opened and is very welcome. However, the loss of the emergency department was a disaster for the hospital and represents a broken promise by the Taoiseach and the former Minister for Health, Senator James Reilly. That promise, made prior to the general election in 2011, resulted in the reward of two seats for Fine Gael in the constituency of Roscommon-South Leitrim. It is most regrettable that the emergency department has been completely pushed aside and was not included in the new programme for Government. The restoration of the service in Roscommon has been sacrificed for seats at the Cabinet table and other positions. The people of Roscommon will never forgive or forget those who set out to destroy the future of Roscommon University Hospital which I have stood by through thick and thin. During my period in office we held on to the emergency department. The emergency department is at the heart of any hospital. We need to ensure the emergency service will be restored at Roscommon University Hospital. I commend the people who have protested every Saturday, in all weather conditions, against the loss of the emergency department.</p>

            <p eId="para_57">I congratulate the Cathaoirleach on his new role and wish every Senator well in this term. Like my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, I hope to be here for the next five years to engage and debate with Members of Seanad Éireann.</p>
            <p eId="para_58"> I thank the Senator for raising this issue which I know is of importance to him. The Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, sends his apologies and hopes to engage with the Senator on the matter at a later date. </p>
            <p eId="para_59"> Roscommon University Hospital is a model 2 hospital within the Saolta University Health Care Group. It provides a significant range of hospital services for patients in the region, including extended day surgery, certain acute medicine services and local minor injuries services. It also provides a wide array of diagnostic services, including endoscopy, laboratory medicine, point of care testing and radiology, as well as specialist rehabilitation medicine and palliative care services. The hospital has 86 inpatient beds and includes an acute mental health unit.</p>
            <p eId="para_60"> Roscommon University Hospital plays an essential role as part of the Saolta group of hospitals and will continue to do so into the future. We know that future growth in health care will be in the areas of chronic disease management, day surgery, diagnostics and rehabilitation services. The activity levels of model 2 hospitals such as Roscommon University Hospital will continue to increase in the coming years as these hospitals specialise in providing these services to meet the needs of the local population. A new endoscopy unit at the hospital opened on a phased basis on 1 June. When fully operational, all endoscopy procedures will be carried out in the new unit, freeing up theatre capacity for more day surgery cases to be carried out. The official opening of the unit will take place later this year and I am sure the Senator will attend, with many colleagues.</p>
            <p eId="para_61"> The specialist rehabilitation unit planned for Roscommon University Hospital was one of the many projects included in the HSE's multi-annual capital plan for the period 2015 to 2019 and internal HSE approval was granted to progress development of the unit in 2015. The spatial plan for the hospital was approved in the first quarter of 2016 and the project team, comprising hospital, clinical and estates personnel, is being assembled. Following this work by the project team, the project will move to the next stage. The HSE has advised the Department that funding for the project will be considered in the 2017 to 2021 multi-annual capital plan period. It is my expectation that every effort will be made to fund the project as early as possible in that time period.</p>

          <p eId="para_63">Although everyone is not present, I have a couple of suggestions to make because as it happened yesterday, the Order of Business was cumbersome in many ways and went on for too long. While we must sort it out at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, I suggest the Order of Business not last for more than one hour. I am simply thinking out loud and not dictating or imposing or anything like that, but I have a notion about the rota of speakers. The leader of each group, for example, would be a speaker each day, but then, because Fine Gael is the biggest party, the Government side might have at least four speakers with the Leader. Perhaps Fianna Fáil and the different groups might have three speakers with their leaders. Moreover, speakers could rotate if someone had something in particular to say. At present leaders have three minutes. Perhaps by readjusting the limits, they might have four minutes to speak on some important issues about which people were passionate. Members could rotate and would curtail their contributions in order to have a more streamlined and focused Order of Business rather than having everyone hopping up and down. While it is not my style to stymie debate, at the same time, had there been a Minister waiting in the ante-room yesterday to deal with important legislation, he or she would not have been happy with me for having, as we might say in west Cork, a leadránach Order of Business.</p>

I express my congratulations to him and his family. I have known one of his daughters, Aoife, for a long time as I was in the Gaeltacht with her almost 20 years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_66"> I wish to address the House on the tragic death of a nurse at Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin. While the matter is being looked into by An Garda Síochána, I express my sympathy and that of Fianna Fáil to her work colleagues and family.</p>
          <p eId="para_67"> There is a growing sense of fear and frustration among families about reports that bin charges could be on the rise again from 1 July. Any rise in charges is a struggle as people are still doing their utmost to pay their mortgage and other bills. The policy change agreed to by the former Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, to pay by weight could result in charges increasing from €200 to €400 a year. That is unrealistic and completely unfair. Last January the former Minister had the audacity to state the pay-by-weight system would result in savings of 87% for customers. Instead, they face a doubling of bin charges. Unless action is taken now, Members will face a situation that could quickly become uncontrollable. Waste will be disposed of illegally and there will be chaos in the making of payments. People are faced with a double whammy of standard fees being increased under the pay-by-weight system which will add extra costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_68"> The reaction on Joe Duffy's radio show in recent days has come from reasonable people with genuine concerns and lectures on competition will not resolve the issue. There are no exemptions for low-income households, the infirm or people with young children. In today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> Miriam Lord describes it as "the wheelie bins are coming". Unless the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, takes immediate action to address the genuine concerns expressed, we will be faced with marches on the streets and more people being unable to pay bin charges, with which they have been co-operating in recent years. The pay-by-weight system will penalise families with young children, particularly those in the nappy stage. Families tend to produce more rubbish. Options for recycling have already dwindled in the city and there are no substantial plans to have an education system to advise people on how to keep waste to a minimum. The Government must listen to the concerns being expressed and not keep ignoring the problem in the hope it will go away, as it will not. I call on the Minister to come to the House to explain the actions he intends to take to address this problem and to address the exorbitant bin charges that are being sold to Members as climate change measures. Personally, I do not buy this.</p>

          <p eId="para_71"> The Public Health (Alcohol) Bill which was approved by the previous Government last December provides for minimum pricing and the health labelling of alcohol products and so on. During the last Dáil I was Chairman of the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport which published a report on sports sponsorship and so on. There is a need to progress the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill and, in terms of sports sponsorship, to identify other streams of funding for sports bodies. In that context, I welcome the announcement yesterday by the Minister of State, Deputy Patrick O'Donovan, of a fund of €1 million for the Camogie Association and the Ladies Gaelic Football Association for training and so on as an indication of equality of provision in sport. Had the Government not provided this funding, the two organisations would have had to seek it elsewhere. Will the Leader invite the relevant Minister to come to the House to provide us with an update on the progress of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill? I am aware that there are obstacles in that regard from a European Union point of view, but I would very much welcome receiving an update on the issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_72">On behalf of the Sinn Féin group, I, too, extend sympathy to the family of the nurse who tragically lost her life in Crumlin hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_73"> I also wish to raise the issue of bin charges and the anxiety being caused by the proposed increases. This was to be expected once the decision to privatise such an essential service was made and the chickens are now coming home to roost. Citizens need to be protected from the folly of that decision and what privatisation will bring, as happened in the case of the privatisation of eircom, the main communications company. </p>
          <p eId="para_74"> I draw the attention of the House to No. 6 on the Order Paper, non-Government motion No. 1 which deals with Seanad reform, the rationale for which I would like to explain. The motion seeks the establishment of a time-limited committee and commends the report of the working group on Seanad reform. In this regard, we were happy yesterday to support the Bill tabled by the Independent group. There are two key reasons we are of the opinion that a committee on Seanad reform needs to be established and given the task of coming back to the floor of the Seanad with its recommendations within six weeks. First, there are 42 new Senators in this Seanad. It is important that these new voices be heard and have ownership of the reform process. Second, there is a need for the Seanad to be distinct from the Dáil and play a key role in the scrutiny of European policies and directives, as well as the North-South initiatives that permeate the report. We agree with this, but we are concerned that the Bill does not reflect it. In particular, we are concerned about the absence of speaking rights for MEPs and MLAs and believe this issue needs to be examined. We are mindful of the major failings of all previous reports on Seanad reform which never reached implementation stage. Notwithstanding this, we believe a time-limited committee, as described in the motion, would enhance the final outcome in an inclusive and collaborative way. We, therefore, ask that No. 6, non-Government motion No.1, be taken next week.</p>

          <p eId="para_75">I join other speakers in congratulating the Cathaoirleach and the Leas-Cathaoirleach on their appointment.</p>
          <p eId="para_76"> There are two issues I would like to highlight. The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation will be in the Seanad today for a debate on the issue of delivering sustainable full employment. I express the hope we will also hear during the debate about proposed legislative measures to reflect the recently agreed Labour Party motion in the Dáil on employment issues, including if-and-when contracts, protection in cases of insolvency and, crucially, given the process of development of public procurement policies in the context of trade agreements such as the CETA and the TTIP, protection of employment standards in such policies. These are legislative issues which we know are on the table. I look forward to us having the opportunity to speak again to the Minister about these concrete measures and the need to move forward on them.</p>
          <p eId="para_77"> Today is Bloomsday. It is a day on which the arts, Ireland's heritage and culture are celebrated across the world. I am sure others will speak more knowledgeably on that issue. It is important, however, on this day that we address the concern widely expressed about what has been perceived as a roll-back on the commitment to the arts. It is unfortunate in the context of the future debate on the heritage Bill that the term "heritage" is not reflected in the title of any Department. Ireland lags behind the rest of Europe in its funding of the arts. We need to move towards an average figure of 0.6%, the average figure across Europe, as opposed to the current figure of 0.3%. I urge the Leader to inquire of the Minister for the Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht what opportunities the Seanad may have to engage on Culture 2025, the plans related to our sustainable development goals and the right to cultural participation. I look forward to having an opportunity to discuss these issues with the Minister. </p>
          <p eId="para_78"> I am slightly concerned about the proposed change to Standing Orders. I believe the current system which allows for a diversity of voices to be heard is important. I am sure, however, that we will have an opportunity to discuss this matter further through the appropriate channels. I would support the imposition of a one-hour limit on debate.</p>

          <p eId="para_80"> As stated by Senator Alice-Mary Higgins, today is Bloomsday. It is also the first anniversary of the tragic accident that occurred in Berkeley. We should remember those who died on that day and those who were seriously injured. There were six fatalities. Eimear Walsh, Olivia Burke, Ashley Donohue, Niccolai Schuster, Eoghan Culligan and Lorcán Miller died in the accident, while the many casualties, some of whom were seriously injured, included Jack Halpin, Clodagh Cogley, Aoife Beary, Sean Fahey, Conor Flynn, Niall Murray and Hannah Waters.</p>
          <p eId="para_81">It is important to remember those who died or were injured and their families and friends. It was a very tragic day, particularly for the area I represent in Dún Laoghaire. I apologise to Senator Gerard P. Craughwell if I am being parochial, as it was a national tragedy which affected all of these young people who left Ireland for the summer on J1 visas to experience a different culture and earn some money before returning to college. Some of them did not make it back alive. It would be good for the House to remember them on this the first anniversary. It was a very dark day for south Dublin and the country in general.</p>

          <p eId="para_82">I sound a warning on the issue of reform of the Seanad. This morning I heard about the scrutiny of European Union legislation. At our meeting I warned about this as it could be extremely dangerous. People are being given the impression that legislation of the European Union will be scrutinised without anything being clearly defined. There is an enormous amount of material spewed out every week from the Europe Union and if we set ourselves up as a monitor and a watchdog, we will fail and the public will rub our noses in that failure. The other issue is that of speaking rights. Elected Members of this House have speaking rights. Others can and should be invited, but they do not have speaking rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_83"> Today is Bloomsday and it is wonderful. I have attended three or four events already and the city is throbbing with energy. So many places not mentioned in <i>Ulysses</i> have small groups of people wearing straw boaters and actors are performing. We had the Lord Mayor for breakfast in the James Joyce Centre and I attended the wonderful Westland Row community breakfast party before travelling to Sandymount Green. Joyce's power of reputation helped to save North Great George's Street, as one of the crucial buildings, No. 35, was identified. It is now the centre of the Joycean ménage in Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_84"> That brings me to the inner city. I note that the Taoiseach spent some time there, which I very much welcome. It was about bloody time. The north inner city of Dublin has been grotesquely neglected throughout my entire lifetime, including when the Prime Minister of the country, former Deputy Bertie Ahern, represented the constituency and did sweet damn all for it. Apparently, the Minister responsible for tourism, transport and whatever else you are having has decided to demand that Stepaside police station be reopened. That issue is on the agenda. I would like to hear the same said about Fitzgibbon Street Garda station. I was lied to in this House about it, as I was told it was being closed for refurbishment. That was rubbish; it was closed down. Now there are murders every second day of the week, while there is a drugs problem in the north inner city. We are down 136 gardaí, about which something must be done. What about the stripping of every decent thing from the north inner city and its replacement with down-market drug clinics that people would not have in Ballsbridge or other affluent suburbs in the country?</p>
          <p eId="para_85"> The late Tony Gregory was a great friend of mine and I remember the time when he initiated the debate on the Criminal Assets Bureau. He did not call it the CAB, but he said something had to be done to link income tax collection, the social welfare system and the Garda. Essentially, this was realised with the establishment of the CAB. After Veronica Guerin was shot, the then Government took the idea on board and claimed credit for it, but I made sure in this House that the late Tony Gregory was remembered. In concert with him in the Dáil, in this House I asked that the money taken by the CAB be reinvested in employment creation, housing provision and education services in the north inner city. It should be ring-fenced as it was bled from the veins of the most vulnerable people in the north inner city, but the Department of Finance squashed that suggestion. It is time for major reinvestment in the north inner city.</p>

          <p eId="para_89">I reiterate that today we should remember the terrible tragedy that occurred in Berkeley last year. It is every parent's nightmare when their children travel to the United States on J1 visas to seek employment for the summer. We all receive calls and everybody tries to help. I compliment the Irish centres, especially those in California, that rallied around the parents when they came last year after all the people mentioned had been killed and injured. They deserve incredible support. Senators may know that there are problems with the J1 visa programme this year as students must be pre-employed before being issued with visas. That is wrong and, from what I gather, the process was initiated by one or two agencies. I do not believe what they are doing is legal and I am certainly looking into the matter. It is one for further debate at some stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_90"> I will read a letter that I received last night. It is from the White House and states:</p>

          <p eId="para_98"> It would be very good to have a debate on the diaspora. I agree with Senator Billy Lawless that there are concerns about the reform of the J1 visa programme. I was concerned about statements made by the Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, on cherry-picking the emigrants he wanted to attract back to Ireland. If there is a pick-up in the economy, as we are told, it is important that people be invited and encouraged to come back and that we make the environment suitable for that to happen. I am concerned that the Minister of State was speaking about cherry-picking engineers and professionals with degrees, etc. The diaspora is so diverse; there are many Irish people across the globe and many issues that must be discussed. It would be good to know what his vision is for the role. There are serious matters to be addressed, including representation in the Houses, voting rights and how we work to help the undocumented Irish abroad, etc. Irish people abroad need us to address issues of that nature in the House. It is good to have Senator Billy Lawless here to represent that cohort. I know that there are many groups that are in contact with us regularly. A debate on issues concerning the diaspora would, therefore, be very pertinent.</p>

          <p eId="para_99">Today is Bloomsday. I note that Senator David Norris, a great Joycean scholar, has left the Chamber. I add my voice to that of Senator Alice-Mary Higgins on the status of the arts in Ireland, particularly with their perceived, if not real, downgrading from a Department structure perspective. There is the lack of a Minister of State with responsibility for the arts. One of the Taoiseach's nominees to this House five years ago, former Senator Fiach Mac Conghail, director of the Abbey Theatre, added greatly to the debate on the cultural importance of the arts sector to social and political life.</p>
          <p eId="para_100">That is also an omission. Will the Leader invite the Minister to come to the House to discuss the issue of arts funding and the importance of the arts? This is the only country in the world that has a musical instrument as its national symbol. While we often view the arts and cultural life as being somewhat of a luxury, from my work in the equality field, I know that those on the edges of society often do not have any other means of expressing the lives they lead and their trials and tribulations. The only way they can do so is through the arts. </p>
          <p eId="para_101"> Following on from what Senator Catherine Ardagh outlined, there is quite a level of unease and disquiet on the issue of waste charges. I heard on radio this morning that the Minister intended to meet various private sector companies next week to discuss the issue. It would be a good idea to have a calm debate on the floor of the House because when there is a vacuum, fears can be raised. As Senator Catherine Ardagh rightly said, people have fears about how they can meet bills as the situation continues. </p>
          <p eId="para_102"> I hope we can progress the issue of the arts and their importance to the country. I also hope we can have clarity on the issue of waste charges. To this end, we should invite the relevant Ministers to come to the House to further the debate.</p>

          <p eId="para_103">Keeping to the cultural theme, I wish the House a happy Bloomsday, particularly Senator David Norris. </p>
          <p eId="para_104"> Like every football fan on the island, I am delighted to see both Irish teams competing in the European Championships this year. To qualify in the first place was a massive achievement and although both teams are playing well, we are still awaiting a first win. I hope it will come tonight when Northern Ireland play Ukraine. That said, I cannot help but think how much stronger an all-Ireland soccer team and an all-Ireland football association would be with the likes of Kyle Lafferty and Shane Long playing alongside each other and, more importantly, the pooling of grassroots resources in a united effort to get more boys and girls off the couch and on to the sports field. With a lifetime involvement in many sports, I have seen at first hand the benefits of cross-Border co-operation in sport, whether in playing schoolboy rugby matches in Belfast or a more recent visit to Craigavon to play American football of all things. Sport is always the winner and one of the best tools to break down many barriers. The exemplary behaviour of both sets of Irish fans, including Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin, has been heartening against the background of hooliganism over the weekend in Marseilles and, unfortunately, again last night in Lille. The tribute paid by fans at the game against Sweden on Monday following the tragic death of Ballymena man Darren Rodgers was not just fitting but also very moving. It shows how far both sets of fans have come since the dark days of the Troubles, when my late father and his friends were afraid in a Dublin pub to cheer Gerry Armstrong's goal against Spain in 1982 for fear of abuse and when Republic of Ireland fans dreaded the sectarian atmosphere in Windsor Park. Thankfully, those days are passing, if they have not completely passed. The issue was raised in the previous Seanad by Senator Catherine Noone and former Senator Paul Bradford. With a new Government in place, I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport who is a keen football fan to engage with us in the Seanad and talk to his Northern counterpart, as well the CEOs of the two football associations, to build on the progress made through the Setanta Cup and follow the example of the GAA's international rules team, the Irish rugby team which had a great win at the weekend, the Irish hockey team which will be travelling to Rio de Janeiro to compete in the Olympic Games for the first time and the Irish cricket team which is battling the showers in their match against Sri Lanka in Malahide. Let us merge the two soccer teams and every sports team on the island to put Ireland on the strongest possible footing in every sports contest.</p>

It has been said on numerous occasions that a totally new hospital was to be built there. It was then said there had been setbacks and that there would be an extension. On his next visit to the House, will the Minister for Health give us a comprehensive update on the suggestion at the hospital in the past few days that the project will be delayed to 2017 and that it will be a much modified scheme? The staff and those who run the hospital are unhappy. There is, therefore, a need for greater clarity on this major project.

          <p eId="para_106">I welcome Senator John O'Mahony's remarks about the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill. It is great to see movement on it, considering that it has been seven years in the making. In December 2009 alcohol was included in the national substance misuse strategy. In the intervening seven years we have failed our fellow citizens by allowing alcohol misuse to be an acceptable part of our culture. The Bill will go a long way towards helping to change our attitudes to and relationship with alcohol. On a daily basis I see the mental health issues, devastation and heartbreak caused for families all over the country. We must remember that we are enacting the Bill to protect them and future generations. It is important to know how much we are drinking if we are trying to stay within the low-risk weekly guidelines on alcohol consumption and it becomes even more important to track our alcohol intake when one considers that the most comprehensive survey of alcohol consumption ever carried out in Ireland reveals that we underestimate what we drink by about 60%.</p>
          <p eId="para_107"> Alcohol marketing, including advertising, sponsorship and other forms of promotion, increases the likelihood that adolescents will start to use alcohol and drink more if they are already using alcohol. Young people’s drinking patterns have a direct effect on their health, development and welfare. Therefore, reducing their exposure to alcohol marketing is a child protection issue, yet every day, in numerous ways and through numerous media, children and young people are continually exposed to positive, risk-free images of alcohol and its use. Owing to the lack of effective regulations, young people are poorly protected from these sophisticated and powerful influences on their drinking behaviour and expectations. They are bombarded with positive images of alcohol through the marketing of brands and products. In effect, the alcohol industry has become a child's primary educator on the use of alcohol. Marketing can shape youth culture by creating and sustaining expectations and norms about how to achieve social, sporting or sexual success; how to celebrate, relax and belong. The failure to protect children from exposure to alcohol marketing is associated with earlier and increased alcohol consumption. Restricting advertisements for alcohol products to content about their nature will mean that advertisements will be less likely to glamorise alcohol or make it appealing to young people as they will no longer see alcohol products aligned with physical performance, personal success, social success and a variety of other positive outcomes.</p>
          <p eId="para_108"> Minimum unit pricing is a targeted measure designed to stop strong alcohol being sold at very low prices in the off-trade, particularly supermarkets, where alcohol is frequently used as a loss leader and sold below cost. The easy and widespread availability of such cheap alcohol has contributed to a dramatic shift in alcohol purchasing and consumption habits from pubs to the off-trade sector which now accounts for the majority of alcohol sales in Ireland. Minimum unit pricing is able to target cheaper alcohol relative to its strength because the price is determined by and directly proportionate to the amount of pure alcohol in the drink product. Minimum unit pricing will be effective in reducing the level of alcohol consumption; the harm caused by alcohol, including deaths, hospital admissions, crime and workplace absences and the associated costs. In the analysis it was estimated that with a €1 minimum unit price, the number of deaths attributable to alcohol would be reduced by approximately 197 per year after 20 years, by which time the full effects of the policy would be seen owing to the time lag involved in many serious alcohol-related illnesses such as cirrhosis of the liver and alcohol-related cancers. We would also see almost 6,000 fewer hospital admissions per year and a reduction in alcohol-fuelled crime and the number of workplace absences. The total societal value of these reductions is estimated at €1.7 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_109"> The alcohol companies will lobby to have the core elements of the Bill changed. We need to listen to words of warning from Dr. Margaret Chan, director general of the World Health Organization, WHO, who stated in April 2013 that he development of alcohol policies was the sole prerogative of national authorities. She said that, in the view of the WHO, the alcohol industry had no role in producing the formula of alcohol policies which had to be protected from distortion by commercial or vested interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_110">I would welcome enactment of the Bill by both Houses without the undue influence of the alcohol industry. We need to do this for the well-being of our fellow citizens, the future of the country and to ensure a reduction in the impact of alcohol on families across the country.</p>

          <p eId="para_111">As Senators know, this is National Carers Week. A very important contribution to the care provided is the assistance provided by the private nursing sector. Nursing Homes Ireland made a presentation yesterday. Unproductive meetings represent one of the issues the organisation has raised with me, one I am sure it has raised with other Oireachtas Members. When its members meet the Department of Health to discuss an issue, they are advised that it is one for the HSE, but when they meet the HSE, they are advised that it is one for the Department. Nursing Homes Ireland has suggested - I have raised this matter previously - that a forum be set up to ensure clear communication. When the organisation meets the Department, it also wants to meet the HSE, the IMO and the INMO in order to be able to deal with all issues. It also wants to see a formal structure being put in place to deal with care of the elderly, not just in nursing homes but also in the context of associated issues such as delayed discharges from hospital. A forum would ensure all issues could be dealt with. It might only meet every four or six months, but it would ensure the attendance of all of those involved in the care of the elderly. Even though I have already brought the matter to the attention of the Minister for Health, I ask the Leader to do the same because I want the issue to form part of the debate on health care and long-term planning.</p>
          <p eId="para_112"> The provision of care for the elderly will be challenging in the next 15 years because the number of people over the age of 65 years will increase from 600,000 to over 1 million by 2031. Therefore, we need to ensure we provide services sufficient to meet these challenges. Let me give another important figure. some 51% of all hospital beds are occupied by people over the age of 65 years, which poses a challenge, particularly given the fact that we have a growing elderly population. We must provide more services in order to tackle the discharge process in hospitals. We need to debate this important issue. I, therefore, ask that the Minister for Health, his Department and the HSE work together and take this challenge on board rather than continue the constant buck-passing that has continued for years. We need to create an efficient and effective service, but we can only do so in working together. I, therefore, ask the Leader to bring this matter to the attention of the Minister as I want it to form part of our debate with him.</p>

There are more than 200,000 SMEs in Ireland and they account for 99% of all businesses. They employ approximately 74% of those who work in the private sector. There is significant support available for exporters in the form of advice and mentoring, but support is not all about the provision of finance. The exports sector is an important sector for us, even though it is small. The vast majority of small and medium-sized businesses, however, do not export. I want the Minister to have an opportunity to speak to us to outline her vision and strategy for those small businesses that do not export. </p>
          <p eId="para_114"> On the second matter I wish to raise, as I am new here, I am not sure whether we can invite someone to come to the House. Can we invite the new Minister for Finance in Northern Ireland, Mr. Máirtín Ó Muilleoir, to address us? He is an entrepreneur who has created businesses and is very much involved in the community. From my perspective and knowledge of enterprise and entrepreneurship in Ireland, I know that the relationship between entrepreneurs in the North and the South is hugely important. A fair amount of business takes place between entrepreneurs on both sides of the island. I, therefore, ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Finance in Northern Ireland to inform Senators about strategies in place for entrepreneurs in the North. As it happens, I am due to meet him next Wednesday morning to discuss the sector and believe the meeting will prove helpful. It would be a big step forward if the House could invite such persons to address us, particularly when we have a very strong common interest.</p>

          <p eId="para_116">I did not get to speak yesterday, even though I had prepared a speech. There was such a big crowd yesterday that I decided to hold off until today.</p>
          <p eId="para_117"> I take the opportunity to congratulate the Irish team on their outstanding performance against Sweden in Paris on Monday and wish them continued success in the next games. I acknowledge the tens of thousands of Irish soccer fans who have travelled to France as incredible ambassadors for Ireland. They have shown the world how to create and enjoy a positive, safe and fun atmosphere in which we can all join. They have done us proud and I urge them to keep it up.</p>
          <p eId="para_118"> I offer my sincere condolences to the family of Darren Rodgers, a Northern Ireland football fan from Ballymena who tragically lost his life at the weekend in Nice. I also express my deepest sympathy to the families of the victims of the Orlando nightclub shooting whose lives were abruptly and brutally cut short. There are no words of comfort for all of the families who lost loved ones in this barbaric act of terrorism. May they rest in peace.</p>
          <p eId="para_119"> Before I address the specific reason I am speaking today, I congratulate Senator Denis O'Donovan on being appointed Cathaoirleach, Senator Paul Coghlan on being appointed Leas-Chathaoirleach and Senator Jerry Buttimer on being appointed Leader of the House. I wish all of my colleagues in the Twenty-fifth Seanad a successful term.</p>
          <p eId="para_120"> I am delighted that in my first speech in the Twenty-fifth Seanad I will refer to statements made by the Minister for Health which were published last Tuesday and Thursday in the <i>Irish Independent</i>. I welcome his statement that he plans to close the gap between the self-employed and PAYE workers. Like many others in the Oireachtas, including Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell, I have campaigned on the issue of social protection and sought social welfare benefits for the self-employed. In the past five years, with others, I campaigned continuously in the Lower House to have the issue of the social welfare status of the self-employed addressed. This is the only country in Europe which is industrialised that does not provide social protection for the self-employed. There are 330,000 self-employed persons with no such protection. If they get sick or suffer a disability in the morning, they will be entitled to nothing. In the five years I was a Deputy there was the Mangan report on social insurance and I hope it will be implemented. It is a huge issue for the self-employed. If we want people to create jobs, we need to put a safety net in place. I will table a motion that I hope will be supported by all parties. I also hope all Senators will support the plans of the Minister for Health for the self-employed. I call on the bigger unions that represent self-employed persons to come on board. The elephant in the room on the last occasion was whether participation in the initiative should be voluntary or made mandatory. I suggest it be mandatory because nothing in the sphere of social protection works where participation is voluntary. As I said, I will table a motion on the matter that I hope will be supported by everybody in the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_122">It is welcome that on Bloomsday we celebrates a great writer. James Joyce's imagination and creativity caused him to be an exile in that he chose to live outside the country. His departure was a great loss to it, although he remembered Dublin. Interestingly, it has been said that if Dublin was laid to waste, <i>Ulysses</i> could be used in reconstructing the city because it is so topographically and geographically correct. I ask that we remember this great writer today.</p>
          <p eId="para_123"> I would never presume anything about the background of Senators because I have a great belief that when they join this Chamber, they come with a wealth of knowledge and expertise. I know that Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin is not present, but I wish to point out that I come with a wealth of experience in the arts.</p>
          <p eId="para_124">I was reared and have worked in them. There are young children in the Visitors Gallery who are very welcome. I know that singing, dancing, drama, the visual arts and sport mean a great deal to them. Many of them might go on to have a career in these areas. I worked in the arts from when I was a child, right up to being involved in Dublin City University, the Larkin concert series, the artists in residence arts in education programmes, and know what the arts mean to culture and creativity and how they have a language above and beyond politics. In Palestine where there was terrible trauma and terror, I saw how the arts had superseded them. I point out to Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin that the Taoiseach has a spokesperson on the arts in the Seanad, one who is very vocal, perhaps verbose and very dramatic, although it is great to be a visual aid for one's subject. I hope to continue to do this and argue as a spokesperson on the arts with all parties in the House in the future. We should never presume about the expertise of whoever is sitting in front of or behind us or about what he or she brings to the House, as one can see with the new brilliance in backgrounds which the 42 new voices and faces have brought with them.</p>

          <p eId="para_126">I endorse the request that the Leader invite the Finance Minister in the North, Máirtín Ó Muilleoir, for whom I have great personal admiration and respect, to make a presentation to the House. His passion for people, equality, investment and prosperity is palpable. As a whirlwind of politics and human endeavour, it would be good to have him here. Is Gael go smior é chomh maith.</p>
          <p eId="para_127"> Will the Leader urgently invite the relevant Minister to come to the House to discuss the report produced by the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, Dr. Michael Maguire, on the police investigation of the Loughinisland massacre? I do not know if Members are familiar with the damning report published by Dr. Maguire on the police investigation into that atrocity. When Loughinisland is mentioned, it conjures up many images and memories. I recall that my family was holidaying in Minerstown, which is approximately a 20 minute drive from Loughinisland, after enjoying the match like everybody else. When word arrived, we were put in the car and taken home, such was the palpable fear that this was not the end of such events or that something equally bad or much worse would happen. When we say the word "Loughinisland", we might reflect on The Heights Bar, the image outside the bar and the fact that this week and in the coming weeks many of us will gather at home, in pubs and clubs to watch and cheer on Ireland as the team progress through another international tournament, just as the people who were in The Heights Bar were doing. We think of the photographs of the six men who lost their lives: Adrian Rogan, aged 34 years; Malcolm Jenkinson, aged 54 years; Patrick O'Hare, aged 35 years; Eamon Byrne, aged 39 years; Daniel McCreanor aged 54 years, and his uncle, Barney Greene, aged 87 years. They were slaughtered because of their faith and support for a team in a terrible time. When I think of Loughinisland now, I think of the campaigning families of these men whose stand for justice and truth has been beyond admirable. It has been extremely difficult for them. They have faced obstacles and obstruction, but the report published by Dr. Maguire validates their stand. Not only was there collusion and obstruction in the investigation into the event but that collusion reached the highest level. I will quote a brief paragraph from what is a long and frightening report on the institutional and deliberate failings in the investigation:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_128">I have found that Special Branch held intelligence that paramilitary informants were involved in a range of activities, including command and control of Loyalist paramilitaries; the procurement, importation and distribution of weapons; murder and conspiracy to murder. They have not been subject to any meaningful criminal investigation.</p>
          <p eId="para_129">It is incumbent on the Government, not just as a body that upholds the rights of Irish citizens but also as co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, to take a clear, strong stand after the Fresh Start agreement on the policy of the British Government in recent times to use national security as a veto to block any further investigation or truth recovery process. This does not just apply to what happened at Loughinisland but also to the case of Pat Finucane and any investigation of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. This should concern not only the Members of this House but also the Government. Given the severity of the report, I ask the Leader to respond as urgently as possible. It was discussed in the Dáil this week and it is incumbent on us to hear from the Minister on what he can do to maintain the pressure and ensure there will be no such veto and that no shutter will be pulled down on a future investigation.</p>

          <p eId="para_130">Will the Leader invite the relevant Minister or Ministers to come to the House to address an issue that is close to the hearts of people from rural Ireland - the cuts in funding for regional and local roads? Thankfully, in recent years a great deal of money has been spent on the surfacing of regional and local roads which have been brought up to a satisfactory standard. Unfortunately, however, in recent times funding has been cut dramatically, so much so that the road network is crumbling under our feet or the tyres of our cars. We talk about looking after and protecting rural Ireland, but one of its most important aspects is providing access to rural areas. I, therefore, ask the Leader to invite the relevant Minister to come to the House to address the issue. When the Minister is here, we might also discuss the reinstatement of funding for local improvement schemes for private lanes, for people who lived on country boreens. Until recently, there was funding available which was specifically ring-fenced for their maintenance and upkeep. That funding was cut a number of years ago to such an extent that the network of such roads is also crumbling. The issue is particularly relevant to rural Ireland and I ask that the Minister come to the House to address it.</p>

          <p eId="para_131">I wish to raise a point that came to mind as I travelled the country during the Seanad election campaign. It is a bugbear of mine. It might seem small, but not when it comes to the promotion of tourism. Directional road signs in Ireland are atrocious. Unless one has a satnav, one cannot find the areas we should be marketing as tourist attractions. Will the Leader and the Cathaoirleach ask the relevant Minister, in either the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport or the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, to instigate an audit of road signs throughout Ireland, particularly small road signs? Ireland probably has the best tourist destinations, but that is no good unless one can find them. Members will be aware from the Seanad election campaign that the satnav does not always work. There should be good old-fashioned signs. Perhaps we might learn from the French. When one arrives in a village or town, one should be directed towards its centre and see signs to wherever one wishes to go. When travelling in Ireland, one might be travelling to a town that is, perhaps, ten miles down the road, but its name is not given on the sign, while the name of the town five miles further on is. That is basic. There is a need to conduct a simple, proper audit of road signs throughout the country to ensure we can market Ireland in the best possible light.</p>
          <p eId="para_132"> There is another aspect to this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_133">IDA Ireland brings prospective employers to various parts of the country, while Enterprise Ireland wants people to locate in rural villages. I represent an area which is both urban and rural and we need to be able to find a place. Good old-fashioned signs are still as important as they were 20 or 30 years ago, in the pre-satellite navigation era. This may seem to be a very simple matter, but it could yield an enormous dividend from a tourism, business and personal perspective. I ask that the Minister be invited to come to the House to discuss this matter and that such an audit be carried out.</p>

          <p eId="para_139">I was a slow starter, but I got there. I came to understand the deficiencies of the mobile phone system very well, as I am sure did many others. I am not talking about broadband or Wi-Fi but basic mobile phone coverage, which is very important. Invariably, I found that one particular network worked but another did not. The State obviously issues licences to mobile service providers. The time has come to invite the Minister for Communications, Climate Change and Natural Resources to the House to discuss the issue of mobile phone coverage and mobile services in general. One will invariably find on the new motorways that one will not get a service. I do not use the phone when I am driving, but I pull in now and again to use it. On most of the new roadways, however, one can forget about doing so.</p>
          <p eId="para_140"> I would also like to say something about the customer service provided by the mobile network providers. If one happens to have the misfortune of going into a mobile phone shop, one will generally be obliged to queue for service. I was in one such shop the other day and there were several elderly people present, but there were no chairs for them to sit on, despite the fact that the queues were lengthy. There are many other issues I could raise, but it is a little late in the day to do so. I ask the Leader to accommodate a debate on mobile phone services at his earliest convenience.</p>

I commend all of the Irish Americans and the Irish centres all over the United States of America for their tremendous work in promoting Irish culture, heritage and the connections that sustain links with the Irish currently residing on the other side of the Atlantic. As Minister of State, I had the honour to visit the mid-west of the United States in 2015 and in the cities of St. Louis and Indianapolis I met a very proud Irish community. However, the members of that community were very concerned that the traditional links with Ireland were weakening. Some of the Irish people who had been to the forefront in promoting Irish links had passed away or were no longer as active as they had been. There is a concern that the mid-west which has not seen the same level of interaction as areas on the east and west coasts of the United States needs to see more sustainable linkages being developed in the areas of culture, education and business. It is important that this House recognise those links. I know that Irish Americans really appreciate it when Irish representatives, be they mayors, Ministers or other representatives of the State, travel to the United States to strengthen these links. I urge the Leader to invite the Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora, Deputy Joe McHugh, to come to the House for a debate on the issue. I know that such debates are appreciated. In this House we must consistently refer to and recognise the importance of the diaspora.</p>

I intend to bring a SIM registration Bill to the floor of the House in the coming weeks which will aim to ensure all SIM cards sold by mobile phone operators will be registered in a database and that anyone who wishes to buy a SIM card will have to produce a utility bill or a passport to do so. Mobile communication is great and the ongoing advances made are wonderful but, unfortunately, the possibilities associated with such communication are being abused, particularly by gangland criminals who are buying multiple SIM cards at will. There is no minimum age limit for the purchase of a SIM card. Children as young as nine or ten years can go into a mobile phone shop with €50, buy ten SIM cards and walk away. The cards can then be inserted into electronic devices and used to cause mayhem. It is not good enough. In many other European countries there are registration systems in place for SIM cards and it is time a degree of control was taken of the pay-as-you-go market. I hope the House will support the forthcoming SIM registration Bill and send it to the Lower House for approval.</p>

I am surprised that Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin did not remember that it was his party colleague, the former Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, who signed the order which followed the standard of the polluter pays principle. I agree that we should have a debate on waste policy. In that context, Sinn Féin has tabled a Private Members' motion on the issue which will be before the House next week for debate. Oral hearings on the topic of incineration are being conducted in Cork by An Bord Pleanála. Many people are against incineration, but landfill sites are not able to cope with the amounts of refuse being generated. It is important that we educate ourselves and the next generation on the importance of recycling, reducing and reusing waste material. We must reduce the amount of waste going to landfill sites.</p>
          <p eId="para_157">If we are to have effective prevention measures, it is important that people be rewarded on the basis of how they treat and dispose of their waste. The Environmental Protection Agency and the Central Statistics Office produced data which showed that 87% of householders would see a reduction in their charges, that 8.5% would see no change and that a small number would see an increase. I am pleased that the Minister is meeting the bin companies. Senators Rose Conway-Walsh and Catherine Ardagh are correct - people should not have to pay more. Private operators should not exploit their customers. One of the major tragedies in the elimination of municipal waste collection services was that the waiver system in many coastal areas was removed. It is important that we be proactive. To that end, the Minister is working with the bin companies which should not be exploitative but which should instead work with their customers to ensure proper charges are applied. We will take up the issue. As I said, awareness and the segregation of waste are important. We should continue along that route. </p>
          <p eId="para_158"> I refer to the motion in the name of Senator Rose Conroy-Walsh. As I explained at a meeting earlier, there are a number of discrepancies in it. Therefore, as Leader of the House, I cannot allow it because it would have implications for the Cathaoirleach and the House. It is not in keeping with Standing Orders. </p>
          <p eId="para_159"> Based on the remarks made in the House yesterday, I look forward to the Twenty-fifth Seanad bringing about change in how it works and does its business in terms of how it is perceived across the country by the Fourth Estate, citizens and constituent members. I am not afraid to examine the electoral system or the internal workings of the Seanad, but let us do so in the context of what is best for democracy and representation in the country. Let us put aside our vested interests and put the country and the people first in the reform of the Upper House, of which we are the current occupants. A generation has gone before us and another will come after us. It behoves us, therefore, to do the right thing and I hope we will all do so because it is important that we continue to be representatives of whoever put us here.</p>
          <p eId="para_160"> I agree with Senator Niall Ó Donnghaile on North-South relations. It is incumbent on us to carry on the work of the last Seanad and the work done by many of us in committees in working with our partners from the Northern Ireland Assembly. We are living on the one island and must work together to ensure the Good Friday Agreement will be implemented and the quality and standard of life of all citizens, whether Catholic or Protestant, will be espoused and advanced. That is our duty. To be fair, the Orange Order visited the previous Seanad. That is a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in the context of Senator Pádraig Ó Céidigh's request that the Minister for Finance in Northern Ireland be invited to come to the House. It is important that we continue to build bridges and relationships. As Leader of the House, I look forward to doing so. In that regard, Senators will find no obstacle placed by me. The record shows that while I was Chairman of the Joint Committee on Health and Children, committee members visited the Assembly in Belfast, while a reciprocal visit was made to Dublin. It is important that we continue that process.</p>
          <p eId="para_161"> Senators Alice-Mary Higgins, Aodhán Ó Ríordáin and Marie-Louise O'Donnell referred to the arts. I note the passion of Members of the House for the arts and, in particular, the eloquence of Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell. I am pleased that she is spokesperson on the arts because she brings to the Seanad not just knowledge but also a passion for, interest in and experience and wisdom of the arts. I assure Members that the Government is committed to the arts, for which the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys, retains full responsibility. There has been no dilution of roles; the buck stops with her, as can be seen in the programme of work of the Government, as part of which she is committed to producing the first ever national policy on culture, with a view to its publication in in the next couple of years. Culture 2025 is the plan to which she is committed. Having said that, the Government as a whole is committed to the promotion of the arts, culture and heritage, of which there will be no downgrading by it. Significant funding was provided for the arts at a time when the country had no money. I remind Members that €30 million was provided for the National Gallery of Ireland, €8 million for a new expansion project at the National Archives of Ireland and €10 million for the renovation of the National Library of Ireland at a time when the country was bereft of money. That was the legacy of the previous Government which will be continued by the Government. Let us ensure we continue that policy to keep the arts at the forefront of everything we do.</p>
          <p eId="para_162"> I join other Members in offering sympathy to the family and colleagues of the nurse who died in Crumlin. It was a tragedy, but we must await the results of the post-mortem. It is important, however, that we acknowledge that a human life has been lost and that people are mourning today. On behalf of the Government and Members, I sympathise with the family and staff affected.</p>
          <p eId="para_163"> Senator Gerard P. Craughwell referred to the motion in his name on the terms and conditions of councillors. Yesterday Senator Paddy Burke tabled a Commencement matter to the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, on class K PRSI contributions. As I said yesterday, it is important that we speak with a unified voice on the terms and conditions of councillors. We should not bat as individuals in trying to score political points. Ní neart go cur le chéile. If we stand together as members of a body elected by councillors, we can effect change, but if we go off on divergent paths, we will all end up on the road less travelled and not achieve the result we all want to achieve. Senator Gerard P. Craughwell can move his motion during Private Members' time. The Government will be happy to work with him on it and I will happy to talk to him about it. I am not saying he is trying to scoring political points, but we must work together on the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_164"> Senators John O'Mahony and Frances Black referred to the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill 2015 which had reached Committee Stage in the previous Seanad and which I am pleased to say was restored to the Order Paper yesterday. The Government is committed to taking it at the earliest possible opportunity. A large amount of work has been done on it. I refer Senators to the work done by the Joint Committee on Health and Children which engaged in strong pre-legislative scrutiny of the issue. I compliment Senator James Reilly and the former Minister Alex White on the work they did in progressing the Bill, without which it would not be on the Order Paper. We need to address the issue because alcohol misuse is costing the nation dearly in terms of its effect on people lives and the qualify of life of families and the number of working hours lost. Too many homes are affected by the blight of alcohol.</p>
          <p eId="para_165"> Senator Alice-Mary Higgins referred to the Department of Arts, Heritage, the Gaeltacht and the Islands. We will return to that issue. </p>
          <p eId="para_166"> Senator Gerry Horkan, among others, referred to the anniversary of the deaths of the young people who died in Berkeley. It is important that we remember them. Young men and women are on flights across the Atlantic heading off to enjoy a new summer experience. I spent a summer in America on a J1 visa. It is important that we provide young people with such opportunities. I welcome Mr. Brian O'Dwyer and Mr. Mike Carroll from New York. They were most helpful in working with Irish-Americans and providing jobs. To that end, Irish community centres and members of the diaspora in the four corners of America have helped many young people. As Senator Paudie Coffey said, it is important that we remember the young men and women who died in Berkeley. I thank him for raising the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_167"> Senator David Norris referred to what was happening in the inner city of Dublin. I do not want to cause a political row by going into the issue, but I do not think it was the late Tony Gregory who formed the Criminal Assets Bureau. However, Senator David Norris is correct in that the inner city of Dublin requires regeneration, to which the Government is committed. The Taoiseach and Ministers visited the area this week and it was not, as some people said, a circus; rather, they went to listen and continue the work being done. I have worked in deprived areas. It is important that the arms of the State reach into such areas and work in a cross-departmental way to help the people living in them. </p>
          <p eId="para_168"> Senator Billy Lawless referred to a letter he had received from President Obama who I am sure he will be able to persuade to speak in the Seanad at a later date. That would be a nice gesture. It is good that he is a Member of the House and it is important that the President has acknowledged his role. He is not a token Member. He has a valid mandate to represent the diaspora. I look forward to working with him in that regard. </p>
          <p eId="para_169"> Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh also referred to the J1 visa programme. I would be happy for the Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, to come to the House to discuss the issue of voting rights for the diaspora. It is important that we reach beyond our shores and acknowledge that the diaspora has an important role to play.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">As Senator Paudie Coffey correctly said yesterday, there is a skills shortage in some areas. Therefore, because of the shortages, the Minister responsible is right to single out certain professions or appeal to people with particular skill sets.</p>
          <p eId="para_171"> I have referred to the contribution made by Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin.</p>
          <p eId="para_172"> Senator Neale Richmond's comment on a unified North-South soccer team was interesting. I am not sure how the Football Association of Ireland and the Irish Football Association would feel about it, but perhaps it is something we should consider. The Senator might suggest the issue is one that could be discussed by the committee with responsibility for matters to do with sport. We all join in wishing every success to the Northern Ireland soccer team tonight and the Republic of Ireland at the weekend. It is important that we continue to build on what has been achieved and that Irish soccer fans continue to show the importance of being good ambassadors for the country. We have seen videos on social media showing the fun Irish soccer fans are having, but I sound a note of caution and ask all Irish supporters to be careful and take their time and not to travel off the beaten track. A consular service is available, should they need to avail of it. In case anyone gets into trouble, they should add the contact number in their mobile phone or put it in their wallet because for whatever reason people can get lost. It is important that Irish supporters continue to have a good record. It would be a shame if their good spirit and the manner in which they are viewed across France were to be damaged.</p>
          <p eId="para_173"> Senator Victor Boyhan mentioned the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Dún Laoghaire. He is correct in saying it is a very important facility and the men and women who work in it do a tremendous job. It is long overdue an overhaul. I will ask the Minister for Health to come to the House to comment on the issue. As a short-term measure, perhaps the Senator might consider tabling it for discussion in the Commencement debate. He is correct that it is one we must put on the radar.</p>
          <p eId="para_174"> I spoke about Senator Frances Black's contribution. </p>
          <p eId="para_175"> Senator Colm Burke referred to the HSE and the Department of Health. He is correct in saying that if we were engaged in new politics, the HSE and the Department would be involved in new business measures and operate differently. The Minister for Health is to be congratulated on initiating his ten-year strategy, but it should include all stakeholders, including those suggested by the Senator. It would be similar to the concept of social partnership, which did not include a political element. In that context, I welcome the creation of a Dáil policy committee to consider a ten-year health strategy. I hope, however, that the Minister will expand the committee to include Members of the Seanad who could play a constructive role in health policy formulation. The committee the Minister has established is a good one, but he should go further and model it on the social partnership system.</p>
          <p eId="para_176"> I referred to Senator Pádraig Ó Céidigh's remarks about small business and the Minister for Finance in Northern Ireland. It is a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. As Leader of the House, I would have no problem if the Senator, as well as Senator Niall Ó Donnghaile, wrote to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_177"> I congratulate Senator Ray Butler on making his maiden speech. I welcome him to the House and compliment him on the work he has done to promote the needs of the self-employed, an issue on which he has always been very vocal. I look forward to bringing the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, to the House to discuss it. The Senator is correct in saying there is a deficit when it comes to the self-employed. I hope the Mangan report will be the starting point in making improvements in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_178"> I have mentioned Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell's reference to the arts. </p>
          <p eId="para_179"> Senator Niall Ó Donnghaile referred to the events that had occurred at Loughinisland. I would be happy if the relevant Minister came to the House to discuss the issue. I will try to facilitate the Senator's request in that regard. </p>
          <p eId="para_180"> Senator Robbie Gallagher is correct in saying roads are important. Now that we are in a period of economic recovery, it is important that we invest in upgrading regional and national roads, in particular. I will follow the Senator's suggestion that the Minister responsible be invited to come to the House to discuss the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_181"> Senator Kieran O'Donnell is correct about road signs. Those of us who travel throughout the country are aware that road signs can be misleading and also dangerous in many parts of it. A plethora of commercial signs are now beginning to get in the way also. This is a matter we should discuss with Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the relevant Department and local councils. I will certainly arrange to have the Minister responsible come to the House to discuss it.</p>
          <p eId="para_182"> Senators Ned O'Sullivan and Martin Conway raised the issue of mobile phone coverage. It is worrying that the quality of the signal is decreasing in some areas. I cite the Cork to Dublin road as an example. I can pinpoint three or four locations where coverage disappears automatically. It is an important issue. As Senator Michelle Mulherin said to me, from an economic point of view, it is one we must address because if investors consider mobile phone coverage is not good enough or that it is poor and patchy, they might think twice about investing here.</p>
          <p eId="para_183"> Senator Paudie Coffey mentioned the diaspora and Irish-American centres. He is correct in saying we should discuss them. </p>
          <p eId="para_184"> Senator Diarmuid Wilson referred to education issues. I am a former director of an adult education service and believe adult and continuing education are very important. I will invite the Minister for Education and Skills to come to the House to discuss the issue. </p>
          <p eId="para_185"> Senator Martin Conway's Bill on SIM cards is one we should accept and embrace as it relates to the issues of data protection and safety.</p>

          <p eId="para_186">The Minister, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, has been patiently waiting outside with her staff for some time. That is another reason we should try to be a little more strict in the time allocated for the Order of Business. I will achieve this in due course. I formally welcome the Minister and wish her every success in her new portfolio.</p>

          <from>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor)<recordedTime time="2016-06-16T12:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_187">I thank the Chathaoirleach for his good wishes.</p>
          <p eId="para_188"> I welcome the opportunity to address the Seanad on the important issue of getting people back to work. I look forward to working with the House. I respect the way in which it does its business. The Government's goal is to achieve sustainable full employment. We want all people to have the opportunity to enjoy rewarding work. We want to ensure all people can participate and contribute to their full potential to the economy and society.</p>
          <p eId="para_189"> A Programme for a Partnership Government sets out our ambition to help to create 200,000 additional jobs by 2020, of which a total of 135,000 are to be created outside Dublin. We also want to reduce the unemployment rate to 6%. Our target this year is to add 50,000 new jobs and we have made a good start in that more than 15,000 new jobs were created in the first three months of the year. In early 2012 the first Action Plan for Jobs was launched. At the time the unemployment rate was above 15.1%. In May this year it fell to 7.8%. A total of 155,000 more people are in employment today than in 2012. It surpasses the original target to have an extra 100,000 people at work by the end of 2016. The Government is committed to sustaining the rate of job creation and delivering full employment by 2020. </p>
          <p eId="para_190"> The enterprise agencies of my Department have been pivotal in addressing the jobs challenge in recent years. Employment in Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland-supported companies increased by 22,000 in 2015. The local enterprise offices supported the creation of more than 3,500 new jobs. I wish to give the message loud and clear that the unemployment rate has declined in all regions since 2012. A total of 20,000 jobs were created in the past year alone outside Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_191">Almost two thirds of the new jobs created by Enterprise Ireland clients and over half of the jobs created in IDA Ireland companies in 2015 were outside Dublin. However, we cannot be complacent. It is my job to ensure jobs will be created in regional areas. In 2015 we developed eight regional action plans for jobs to ensure the recovery would be felt in every region. The overall target is to grow employment in each region by 10% to 15% by 2020 and we have set up a regional implementation committee to oversee and drive each plan. The programme for Government also commits to reducing each county's unemployment rate to within 1% of the State average.</p>
          <p eId="para_192"> The first progress reports on the implementation of the regional action plans for jobs will be published in the second half of this year. As I mentioned, the number of people out of work has declined considerably since its peak in 2012. However, unemployment remains too high. The Government is placing particular priority on youth unemployed and the long-term unemployed. In May this year the youth unemployment rate was 15%, down from 20.8% in 2015. However, we cannot be complacent about youth unemployment and must ensure that group is targeted. The number of long-term unemployed declined by 27,000 in the past year which, of course, is welcome. However, I am conscious of the fact that we must continue to reduce this number further.</p>
          <p eId="para_193"> As unemployment continues to fall, it is timely to focus on the quality of employment provided. Quality of employment is a key determinant of the well-being of individuals and households. The number of part-time workers increased by 3.7% in the year to the end of March 2016. Women are more likely to work part-time than men. Two thirds of part-time workers are women. In some cases working part-time is by choice. It is positive that we have such flexible opportunities. There are also people working part-time who would work additional hours if they were available. The number of underemployed part-time workers declined by almost 14% in the past year. The level of underemployment among women fell by 15.1%. We need to ensure this trend will continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_194"> Ireland has a comprehensive suite of employment rights legislation. We strongly protect those who work on a part-time or temporary basis. On the matter of zero and low-hour contracts, the Government is preparing an appropriate policy response to the University of Limerick study. It was essential that stakeholders be given an opportunity to consider and respond to the study and the large number of submissions received require careful consideration by my Department. The submissions will inform the policy response to be considered by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_195"> In July the Low Pay Commission will make its next recommendations on the national minimum wage for 2017 and its recommendations must be evidence-based. We want to have a minimum wage that is both fair and sustainable. We want to assist as many low-paid workers as is reasonably practicable without creating significant adverse consequences for employment or competitiveness. I look forward to receiving the report and taking it forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_196"> Innovation is at the heart of Government policy on enterprise and creating high quality jobs. Leadership in science, research and innovation play a crucial role in attracting, developing and nurturing business. They are also essential ingredients in creating and maintaining employment. Research and development active firms also do better in job creation and exports. The Innovation 2020 strategy sets out the vision for Ireland to become a global innovation leader. Innovation 2020 is focused on delivering a strong sustainable economy and a better society. We want to see greater numbers of enterprises engaging in research and development. We need more enterprises progressing to a point where innovation is embedded as a key part of their business model. We have a target to increase the spend on research and development to 2.5% of GNP by 2020. That is a key priority for my Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_197"> I am acutely aware that the rising economic tide may not yet have reached every business. Through the Action Plan for Jobs, we have made significant progress since 2012 to make it easier for SMEs to do business in Ireland. This strong focus on SME competitiveness and growth will continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_198"> Creating a fertile environment for entrepreneurship and start-ups is one of my top priorities. This includes targeted actions by Enterprise Ireland and the LEOs to promote female entrepreneurship. The level of participation by female entrepreneurs in Enterprise Ireland's high potential start-up programme increased to 20% in 2015. The target was 18%.</p>
          <p eId="para_199"> The Action Plan for Jobs is working. However, we cannot be complacent as we remain vulnerable to external shocks, key among which are Brexit, increases in oil prices and exchange rate movements. </p>
          <p eId="para_200"> We must protect the gains in competitiveness achieved in the past few years. Ireland has moved to seventh place in the IMD global competitiveness rankings, but more remains to be done. I will be working with the National Competitiveness Council and my ministerial colleagues to ensure we will see progress on the key competitiveness issues. We need to address the issue of costs for business. We also need to prioritise action to remove infrastructure bottlenecks. We need to ensure we have sufficient skills and talent supply.</p>
          <p eId="para_201"> I have asked my Department to initiate the process to develop the 2017 Action Plan for Jobs, which is under way. We will be consulting widely with external stakeholders in the coming months. As I said, we want to gather the best ideas for sustainable job creation. My priority is to deliver a business environment that will be among the most competitive internationally. I want to use our collective resources across government to support enterprise and sustainable employment growth in all regions. Through collective action, I am convinced we can achieve sustainable full employment by 2020.</p>
          <p eId="para_202"> I am delighted to be here and look forward to hearing Senators' ideas. I want them to know that the door is open in the Department and that if we can help, we are available to do so. Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the LEOs are all available. I ask all Senators to familiarise themselves with the plan for their region which is available on the web. As I said, if we can help, we will be delighted to do so.</p>

          <from>Senator Aidan Davitt<recordedTime time="2016-06-16T13:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_204">Ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a dhéanamh leis an Aire on her new appointment. No doubt she will bring great enthusiasm to her new post.</p>
          <p eId="para_205"> I listened intently to the Minister's forecasts. Some 200,000 jobs are to be created by 2020, of which 135,000 will be created outside Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">This is starting to sound like a sketch from <i>Alice in Wonderland. </i>The new quote of 200,000 jobs to be created is welcome and we would be delighted to see them being created. One would have to agree that the Mad Hatter came up with the figure of 68% or 135,000 jobs being created outside Dublin, given that the current figure is 50%. I cannot see how the figures add up. However, I wish the Minister well. As she said, there has been a great improvement in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_207"> The document goes on to deal with the issue of IDA Ireland site visits. It is easy to see that jobs follow site visits. Some 50% of all site visits were in Dublin where 48% of IDA Ireland supported jobs were created. It is no coincidence that the unemployment black spots of the north east, north west and midlands receive an average of 2.5% each of site visits. IDA Ireland is doing a great job, but there will have to be a focus outside the M50. The local IDA Ireland park in Mullingar contains one business which was relocated from elsewhere in Mullingar after lengthy negotiations undertaken by my fellow Oireachtas Member, Deputy Robert Troy. The estate is a place about which IDA Ireland forgot and it is only 45 minutes from the M50 and waiting for use.</p>
          <p eId="para_208"> Rural Ireland has been strangled to death following the closure of Garda stations, Army barracks, schools and the abolition of town councils, which were all Government-led. Services fled - banks, post offices, shops and retail centres. We need to lead from the front and give country communities hope.</p>
          <p eId="para_209"> Skilled manufacturers and tradespeople need support with the apprenticeship model. It is unfair that they have to suffer the loss of trainees while at college and also expect them to contribute €16,000 over four years to fund the programme. That is the reason the number of apprenticeships is at an all time low of 8,000, down from a peak of 30,000. This is an issue on which the Minister could focus.</p>
          <p eId="para_210"> Another subject which was glossed over by the Minister was wage discrimination. When we come into and leave this world, we are in the hands of nurses. Teachers are the people who model us, encourage us and introduce us to the world of learning during our formative years. Members of the Garda and the Defence Forces protect us and put their lives on the line every day in order that we can have a normal functioning society. The wage discrimination the Government forced on gardaí, nurses, teachers and soldiers who start on a gross salary of €22,000 to €25,000 is degrading. If the Taoiseach wants to keep the recovery going, he should start with those on whom we are so dependent. None of these starter public servants is on a living wage, which has become a divisive issue in their workplaces. When formulating her document, I ask the Minister to look at these areas and if there is anything I can assist her with, I will be happy to oblige.

          <p eId="para_212">I thank the Acting Chairman for the introduction. I could return some of the compliments and enlarge on them. Be that as it may, I appreciate his kind remarks and wish him well. I know that he will chair the session with great skill.</p>
          <p eId="para_213"> I congratulate my great personal friend, the Minister, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, on her appointment. I am delighted for her and think she will bring to her office tremendous energy and natural leadership skills. I wish her well. I am confident that she will get results.</p>
          <p eId="para_214"> By way of background to this debate, there is nothing that gives people more dignity than a job. It is crucial to their family and friends and their self-worth. It is important to keep that perspective in mind. The dignity given by work is so important and it is sadly absent from those who do not have it. It is well established that the way to remove people from the poverty trap is to get them employment. The intergenerational effect of getting them back to work is enormous. About three generations will be affected by somebody leaving unemployment. The great success of our times and the recent past has been reducing unemployment. No other achievement is greater and we should revel in it and be proud of it. Since 2012, 155,000 more people are at work. We are about to break the 2 million number of people in employment. In May the unemployment level was 7.8%. Of course, we are not happy with that level, but it represents a huge change from a rate of 15.1%. The youth unemployment rate has fallen by 5% in the past year from 15%. All of these achievements are enormous. As a people and a nation, we can be proud of them because every individual in the country contributed to this outcome. In that context, I congratulate the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, previously the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, and his Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, on their achievements in that sphere. What has been achieved to date should give us confidence that we can finish the job and get much more done. The big challenge is to bring back our emigrants. We have an enormous pool of talent among them and need to get them back. With their new experiences, the great education with which they left and their natural flair, they will come back and create jobs. It will, therefore, have a domino or multiplier effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_215"> There are some things that are not glamorous but which need to be said in this debate. We need to keep the public finances under control as we have to remain competitive. If we keep the public finances under control, borrowing for the provision of infrastructure will be cheaper and money will be available to us. Inward investment will be attracted. In addition to keeping the public finances under control, we need to maintain the correct tax environment. Also - this is not a very popular concept - we need to maintain wage control. The greatest act of patriotism and selflessness in which workers and their organised bodies can make is to engage while achieving realistic and well justified pay increases as the economy improves and show the level of restraint that will allow for further job creation. What is now called for is a new patriotism. It is the new Christianity in action, the new meitheal or the new commitment to the common good. With that in mind, we need to see everything in terms of job creation and need to be restrained in our wage demands. If there is industrial unrest, it will adversely affect inward investment and create difficulties. </p>
          <p eId="para_216"> One good aspect of job creation to date is the cross-sector increase in the jobs created.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">Some 9,500 new jobs were created in the construction sector in the first quarter of 2016. That is important. There is great potential to increase the number of jobs in the sector as the housing crisis is tackled. There is a need for major emphasis on apprenticeship training, upskilling workers and creating the skills required among displaced former construction workers in order that they can re-embrace the sector. </p>

          <p eId="para_223"> I am well aware of the achievements in spreading jobs regionally, but I am anxious that far more IDA Ireland itineraries include visits to rural areas. Will the Minister look at the shortage of visits in IDA Ireland itineraries to areas like my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan to see if the number can be increased in the coming years?

          <from>Senator Rose Conway-Walsh<recordedTime time="2016-06-16T13:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_225">I thank the Minister for coming before us and congratulate her on her appointment to her new job. It is lovely to see a woman here as a Minister. She is the first woman Minister to appear before us.</p>
          <p eId="para_226"> Any debate on sustainable jobs must include a discussion of what constitutes a sustainable labour market. We know that the labour market is crucial in creating sustainable jobs in communities and in terms of the economic, social and cultural well-being of society. According to data taken from the most recent quarterly national household survey, the level of employment has increased by 2.4% in the year to the end of the first quarter of 2016. This represents an increase in total employment of almost 47,000 jobs, of which 31,000 were full-time and 16,300 part-time. This represents an increase of 2.1% in the level of full-time employment and almost 4% in part-time employment. While I welcome the increase in the number of people at work, I do so cautiously on the back of the recent CSO figures that provide us with evidence that there has been zero growth in the west. This does not come as a surprise to those of us living in the west, as for every new job created, there are job losses every day. We only have to look at the loss of over 200 jobs last week in Sligo, with the closure of the family-owned McCormack Garages. I extend the solidarity of this House to all of those affected by these job losses and their families.</p>
          <p eId="para_227"> I cannot mention job creation in the west and rural Ireland without begging the Minister to speak to her ministerial colleagues about the need to fast-track broadband provision. We need to have the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in the House to discuss how we can fast-track its provision. It is not good enough to cite 2022 as a date for its provision. I can see the problem. I cannot communicate with the Houses of the Oireachtas because I do not have a proper broadband service where I live. The Minister does not need me to tell her that without an adequate broadband and telecommunications service, the Government’s jobs plan is not worth the paper on which it is written. </p>
          <p eId="para_228"> We need to talk about emigration and its impact in terms of the reduction in the number of people unemployed. Emigrants are employed in other countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_229"> Alongside the lack of employment opportunities, we must examine the fact that the labour market is characterised by major problems with low pay, the increase in the level of precarious work and increasing industrial unrest, as outlined. This promotes inequality and jeopardises economic growth. Ireland now has the dubious distinction of having the second highest number of low-paid workers in the OECD. Contrary to the Government’s spin on the figures quoted, I find the high rate of increase in the number of part-time jobs extremely worrying. I say this because all of the research shows that part-time workers make up a high percentage of those who are concentrated in low-paid employment sectors. They are the ones who are most vulnerable to exploitation, being on low pay, in precarious work and on if-and-when contracts. They also tend to receive less training to assist their development, which is worrying in terms of how they progress. Low pay and weak workers’ rights architecture are bad for workers, the economy, communities and society.</p>
          <p eId="para_230"> By continuing along the track of non-standard work, we are creating a new community that I call the working poor. They are the ones who have to pay for everything and do not have adequate income to do so. They are the ones who struggle to get to the end of the week or the month, worrying whether they will have enough to pay their ever-increasing bills. That is why we see such outrage at the increase in bin charges in terms of what the extra cost may mean for people. We are talking about mothers – it is mostly women – who are looking at their sick children and wondering if they can get through the night without having to bring them to the GP because they cannot afford the €40, €50 or €60 fee they will have to pay. They are trying to balance taking their child to the GP and doing the shopping at the weekend. That is the reality. They are the people I see every day. We must remember that these families are not just working in the private sector; there are also low-paid workers in the public sector, including teachers, gardaí and clerical staff in local authorities, who are barely able to survive on the wages they are receiving.</p>
          <p eId="para_231"> Low pay exerts significant pressure on the State in terms of social transfers, with the result that it ends up supplementing the pay of vulnerable workers. In 2015 alone, it spent a record €350 million in subsidising the incomes of thousands of families in low-paid work. There has been a rapid rise of about 60% in recent years in the number of workers in receipt of family income supplement and other social transfers. Essentially, employers’ profit margins are being topped up. This highlights the extent to which workers and their families are at risk of poverty. The transfer of wealth from the State is, in essence, reproducing, year in, year out, huge profits for large companies that see nothing wrong with bullying and exploiting their workforce.</p>

          <p eId="para_236">I wish the Leas-Chathaoirleach well. He will perform his role with great aplomb. I also congratulate the Minister, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, on her appointment.</p>
          <p eId="para_237"> In the brief time available I want to speak about the constituency I represent, Limerick, and the theme of sustaining full employment. Many jobs have been created in the past three to five years, which is to be welcomed. However, I want to look at the issue of sustaining full employment in an Irish context, with Limerick, both urban and rural, being regarded as a microcosm.</p>
          <p eId="para_238"> Competitiveness is the key to employment creation.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">A couple of things would bring competitiveness. On employment costs, it is important that the marginal rate be brought below 50% for staff take-home pay. It is welcome that the JobBridge programme is to be discontinued. It served its purpose for a period, but it was open to abuse, although not by everyone. Now we are considering the provision of sustainable jobs. We have to get a handle on insurance costs, which is a huge factor. The low cost of energy is external to us, as is the rate of exchange for exports. The Brexit debate may have an impact, but that is something we cannot control. I hope the Taoiseach’s intervention will encourage people in the United Kingdom to vote to stay in the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_240"> I want to see balanced regional development in Limerick, with the 2030 plan progressed, in order that we will have the infrastructure required, particularly buildings in the city centre that IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland could showcase. I would also like the Hanging Gardens and the projects on the Cleeve's and opera centre sites to be expedited. That is extremely important. IDA Ireland has committed to bringing 66 projects to the region by 2019. We will hold it to that commitment. The development of the knowledge box is critical.</p>
          <p eId="para_241"> There are several villages in rural east Limerick, including Cappamore, Murroe, Caherconlish, Castleconnell and Ballyneety. Many people have emigrated from rural villages, as well as cities. The real challenge in terms of sustainable employment is to get emigrants back and people to set up businesses in their communities. It is not always about foreign direct investment; we need to create an environment for the person from the area who wants to set up a business. There are weaknesses, including the speed of, and access to, broadband. Pressure has to be kept on the national broadband plan, particularly in rural areas such as east Limerick. I find that mobile phone coverage in many areas has got worse rather than better. Something needs to be done about the matter. This is extremely important in attracting people into rural areas. Access by road is not as big a factor as the other two in the Internet age. What incentives can be used to encourage people to set up in a rural village? We need to put thought into this. They may be tax or grant incentives, or access to services, but a rural area needs to compete on an even keel with an urban setting when people are deciding where to set up a business. In villages businesses have been sustained against all the odds, but they need people to come to provide extra employment in order that they can survive and prosper. They offer benefits in terms of the numbers of pupils in schools and existing businesses. I look forward to welcoming the Minister to Limerick and showing her what it has to offer and what she can bring to promote it.</p>
          <p eId="para_242"> On a national level, we must have a proper review of skill shortages, not just at third level education but also in the case of apprenticeships. Germany has a model under which when young people leave school they can move into apprenticeships. I look forward to the Minister’s comments.</p>

          <from>Senator John Dolan<recordedTime time="2016-06-16T13:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_243">I congratulate the Leas-Chathaoirleach on his appointment yesterday. As the lone male member of the Civil Engagement group, I join Senator Rose Conway-Walsh in welcoming a female Minister to the House. In her opening words she spoke about "getting people back to work" and my jaw dropped. However, the paragraph picked up at the end when she said "all people can participate ... to their full potential." The programme for Government refers to the goal “to deliver sustainable full employment” in order that all people will have the opportunity to enjoy rewarding work and participate and contribute to their full potential in the economy and to society.</p>
          <p eId="para_244"> It is extremely important for us to recall that the coin has two sides, but I sounnd a word of caution: because it is written does not mean that it will happen. There can be a slip between cup and lip. There was huge impetus to get people back to work. We remember Dell, Waterford Crystal and others in the first few months. We all have micro-memories of job losses among people close to us, of small local enterprises that went to the wall overnight and never made the news, but it is very important to keep that in mind that they were all real people. </p>
          <p eId="para_245"> When things go wrong in the economy, people on the margins - those with disabilities or mental health problems, those who carry the burden of addiction and various issues and the long-term unemployed - are affected. Before coming here I used to drive through Ballybough in Dublin’s north inner city. In the great days before the collapse the queues of people collecting their unemployment benefit extended out onto the street. There is a hard core of unemployed persons and although the figure has come down, 6% is still high. They are to be found in Dublin and the rest of the country. The people with the problems I mention are to be found in every community. That has to be at the core of our considerations.</p>
          <p eId="para_246"> In the 1980s there were fewer than 1 million in the workforce. We are now edging up towards 2 million and still have a bit of work to do. When we talk about the diaspora, the parents and families of people with disabilities do not go to Dublin Airport to meet young people. People with disabilities cannot be part of the diaspora. Up to ten years ago we sucked people from all over the world into the labour force, but we did not take people with disabilities. There were almost 100,000 long-term unemployed persons in the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_247"> In the early days of the last decade manufacturing industry went down the tubes. We did not notice it because there was another crane on the skyline. Young lads ran from the agriculture sector onto diggers, dumpers and trucks because that was where the big money was. We degraded manufacturing and agriculture, which are not the exciting sectors for the workforce. However, we were very proud of the agriculture sector in the dark days when both it and the agrifood sector kept the flag flying for us internationally. There are parts of the economy that are not connected with research and development and the high-flying new technologies but which are important and provide real jobs for people across the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">I challenge anyone in this Chamber or elsewhere to give me examples of when he or she heard about disabled people losing their jobs when the bust came. They did not, as one cannot lose what one does not have. I do not state this in a recriminatory sense but simply to observe that we missed out when we were top dog and there was full employment. We had money to burn, but we still could not do it for people who badly needed to be in the workplace.</p>

          <p eId="para_253"> A robust model of sustainable employment needs a few things. Ireland has a worldwide reputation and relationships, which is a soft but valuable asset. The ambition must be providing employment for all. Dependable and comprehensive public services are also needed. I refer to the economic, social and that old-fashioned term, the social wage. While there will be upward wage pressure, we can dampen expectations if we have dependable social and public services. As for people with disabilities and others, issues such as education, training, social protection, mobility and transport must be considered. Members must look outside the core areas they normally consider and pull them together.</p>

          <from>Senator John O'Mahony<recordedTime time="2016-06-16T13:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_254">I congratulated the Leas-Chathaoirleach this morning when he was not in the Chair and now that he is installed, I do so again. I wish him well. I also welcome the Minister, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, and congratulate her on her elevation to her ministry. She has good west of Ireland roots and the issue of spreading jobs to the regions is top of her agenda, which is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_255"> One thing the previous Government got right was job creation. As the Minister stated, what we must do now is spread jobs. Senator Rose Conway-Walsh mentioned that, effectively, the reduction in unemployment was due to the fact that everyone had emigrated. However, it is a fact that there are an extra 155,000 people working. As many of them would have been obliged to emigrate had the jobs not been created, I greatly welcome their creation, as well as the statistics for the reduction in the level of long-term and youth unemployment, which is also a priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_256"> Another issue that has arisen recently concerns the JobBridge programme. We are in a different place than in 2011, at which time the JobBridge programme served its purpose. Many people secured full-time employment as a result of being part of it, but we are now in a different space. It is welcome that the programme is to be phased out because it is no longer needed as much as it was then.</p>
          <p eId="para_257"> The key issue the Minister addressed in the context of regional growth and the spread of jobs to the regions is absolutely crucial. It can be done in a number of ways. As the Minister mentioned, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the local employment offices, LEOs, are in place. I wish to be constructive, but people, businesses and potential employers are falling through the cracks because the LEOs operate mostly in the areas of mentoring and providing many services in a one-stop shop, which is an excellent idea. I have been involved with a number of small businesses that had the potential to employ more than ten people. However, as they were not exporting, Enterprise Ireland was not applicable to them. Similarly, foreign direct investment was not involved. The key for small businesses and the self-employed is to somehow put in place structures to support the five, ten or 15 jobs in indigenous Irish companies. The incentives are not in place for them and one is accused that if the jobs were created by companies coming in from abroad, there would be bells and whistles. I ask the Minister to give consideration to this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_258"> Some agencies have been set up. In this context, I will mention the Western Development Commission in the case of the west and the north west. Its remit covers the five Connacht counties of Mayo, Galway, Leitrim, Roscommon and Sligo, as well as counties Donegal and Clare. It has done excellent work in providing jobs and through the Look West campaigns because there are many advantages to be gained in relocating to the west that are not available in urban areas. However, its budget is very small. In a possible model for the rest of rural Ireland, the commission could provide the incentives for the sector to which I refer that has been left out at. I urge the Minister to consider this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_259"> The broadband issue was mentioned earlier. The findings of a survey were issued this morning. They suggested 20% of small businesses were not operating online. In many cases I imagine this is not by choice; it is simply that they do not have broadband. While 2022 has been mentioned, that is the date by which every house and business in the country will be connected. A great deal of work is under way in the roll-out of broadband. It is important that this process be speeded up. I am aware that the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, is anxious to do this. However, when people hear the date 2022, they ask whether no one will have broadband in rural areas before then, whereas many will have it.</p>
          <p eId="para_260"> Competitiveness is another issue the Minister addressed. Another success of the previous Government in the past five years was in the tourism and hospitality sectors with the 9% VAT rate, but we are in danger of losing that edge of competitiveness again due to increasing costs. This issue must be monitored, but there are huge opportunities. I welcome the Minister's enthusiasm because while I am aware of other issues and services that must be upgraded, as well as restoration and so on, one must not lose sight of the objective of full employment. It is achievable and I wish the Minister well in that task. I look forward to working with her.</p>

          <p eId="para_262"> Comments have been made in the Chamber on how, statistically, we have done much better in recent years in bringing down the unemployment rate, which obviously is to be welcomed. In that time the previous Government also managed to provide many protections for workers' rights. It not merely increased the national minimum wage twice, but I also refer to the reintroduction of the joint labour committee, JLC, system, the employment regulation orders, EROs, and collective bargaining legislation. Consequently, a threshold of decency was provided for in the economy. However, I remind the Minister of the Private Members' motion that was passed by Dáil Éireann only two weeks ago. It was in the name of the Labour Party and written by Senator Gerald Nash who did a huge amount of work in the Minister's Department in the previous Government. The motion reads:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_263">That Dáil Éireann:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_264">affirms that, as economic conditions continue to improve, it will stand up for working people and ensure that employees secure a fair share of growing national prosperity;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_265">accordingly calls for a programme of incremental increases to the national minimum wage until it is pegged at 60% of median earnings, and for a living wage of €11.50 per hour to be adopted throughout the public sector;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_266">believes that, alongside tackling low pay, we must address the root causes of insecurity at work, commit to further protections for vulnerable workers in precarious employment and bring an end to exploitative employment contracts that foster increased casualisation of workers;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_267">calls therefore on the Government to prepare and introduce a legislative package that will protect and enhance workers’ rights by:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_268">- ending the abuse of "if and when" contracts;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_269">- combating bogus self-employment;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_270">- ensuring freelance workers have the right to collectively bargain;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_271">- extending the transfer of undertakings regulations, TUPE, to workers in services such as catering and security;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_272">- protecting workers in "informal" insolvencies and collective redundancies;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_273">- providing statutory redress for the victims of workplace bullying;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_274">- promoting employment standards and the living wage in public procurement; and</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_275">- preventing unilateral reductions in pay;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_276">notes in particular the University of Limerick report to the Government, Study on the Prevalence of Zero Hour Contracts among Irish Employers and their Impact on Employees, and, commissioned following the outrageous treatment of Clerys workers in June 2015, the Cahill-Duffy Expert Examination and Review of Laws on the Protection of Employee Interests When Assets are Separated from the Operating Entity; and</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_277">commends the recommendations set out in both reports and calls on the Government as an urgent priority to prepare legislation for their implementation.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">As the Minister is aware, the motion was passed by the Dáil, the main House of the Oireachtas. I would like to hear her comments on it because I may have misheard, but I have been led to believe she is not minded to accept the report from the University of Limerick. If that were the case, it would fly in the face of the expressed will of Dáil Éireann and what is right and just, particularly given that the Clerys workers are this week marking the first anniversary of their disgraceful treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_279"> I will touch on the issue of dignity of work and how work is so important for those in the vulnerable sectors of society, which is often forgotten about in the economic debate. During the turbulent time when unemployment levels crept up it was often said unemployment cost the Exchequer €27,000 for every person unemployed, including the loss of VAT receipts and welfare payments, but this completely misses the point. It is the loss of dignity and self-worth that is the major deficit caused by unemployment. There are sections of society that are not necessarily benefiting from the Action Plan for Jobs. During the Celtic tiger period more than 100,000 people were in consistent unemployment. Whatever action plan the Government comes up with and whatever efforts are made to reduce unemployment, they do not seem to permeate into every sector of society. The comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities should have been part of the Action Plan for Jobs, but during the tenure of the last Government the Department did not really want to know about the strategy which effectively was run as an equality measure within the Department of Justice and Equality. That is disappointing because if one looks at certain sectors of society such as those living in disadvantaged areas, members of the Traveller community, people with disabilities and migrants, one can see that there are particular barriers and issues that they face in gaining employment, being protected in work and ensuring their employment rights are enhanced. In the context of that comprehensive employment strategy, perhaps the Department might again look at how it can engage with and drive it and be more positive about it because when I was involved in putting it together, I felt the engagement of the Department was less than positive. </p>
          <p eId="para_280"> I wish the Minister well in what she is trying to do. The threshold of decency is everything. Having statistics that we can roll out and being able to say unemployment has come down are laudable and all very well, but dignity in work and the threshold of decency in the economy are everything. Workers' rights and the sense of dignity a worker has every morning in getting up and going to work are what keeps society together. I reiterate my request to the Minister that she deal in a positive manner with the Labour Party motion that was passed in the Dáil with the support of other parties two weeks ago.</p>

        <speech by="#RayButler" eId="spk_92">
          <from>Senator Ray Butler<recordedTime time="2016-06-16T13:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_281">I wish Senator Paul Coghlan all the best in his new position as Leas-Chathaoirleach. I also congratulate the Minister on her elevation to her new post. She has always been a great people person and is the right person for the job.</p>
          <p eId="para_282"> Rebuilding the economy to support job creation, leading to the delivery of sustainable full employment, has been a key objective of this and the previous Government which I had the pleasure of serving under. In 2011 Ireland's employment rate was below the EU average, while its unemployment rate was the fifth highest. The Action Plan for Jobs was introduced in early 2012 when the unemployment rate was 15.1%. Today, it has fallen to 7.3%, with 155,000 more people employed by the end of the first quarter of 2016, bringing the total number of employed to just under 2 million to date. Stimulating growth in all regions has been a priority to ensure all areas achieve their economic potential, allowing communities to benefit locally.</p>
          <p eId="para_283"> We continue to make great strides with incentives such as the Wild Atlantic Way and the recently launched Ireland's Ancient East which includes my local area of Trim, south Meath and Meath west. We have seen the recent opening of hotels and businesses along the west coast, increasing employment locally and substantially building the tourism industry. Another incentive was the filming of certain scenes from the hugely popular "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" on the magnificent site of Skellig Michael in County Kerry. These scenes have placed Ireland's rare beauty centre stage all over the world and can only have a positive effect on tourist figures for this year and many more years to come. In 2015 the tourism industry reached a record number of visitors, beating the previous record set in 2007. We are working towards creating an additional 50,000 jobs in the industry by 2025. To date, the lower VAT rate of 9% for the hospitality sector, together with the removal of the travel tax, has been successful in boosting tourism levels and moving forward is now imperative. It is vital to maintain value for money for visitors to ensure continued growth in the industry. </p>
          <p eId="para_284"> We have been successful in attracting major multinationals to the country with our highly educated and motivated workforce. Another reason is the 12.5% corporation tax rate which has been controversial with some US politicians, some EU member states and certain members of the Opposition who seem to oppose everything. It is important that we maintain this rate of corporation tax to attract support and increase job creation. However, we must not become complacent either. It is SMEs that employ most of the workforce. Together with our up and coming entrepreneurs, these companies need to be encouraged and given support to start up and continue to grow. </p>
          <p eId="para_285"> It is imperative that certain areas be addressed to facilitate and encourage further growth among SMEs and thus enhance employment for others locally. The issues I have pencilled in are bank loans and the Irish Credit Bureau. During the height of the recession I said the bureau was not fit for purpose. It was all right before the crash, but when the crash happened, many businesses fixed their bank loans. Because of this, despite the fact that they are repaying them, they have defaulted in the eyes of the Irish Credit Bureau and will not obtain loans for the next five years. It is an issue at which we must look. The businesses concerned are paying their way, but they face difficulties when they look for more credit facilities to move forward and employ new people. I recently visited a furniture factory in Navan. The owner had renegotiated his loans, wanted to move on and could have employed ten people straightaway, but he could not do so because he could not get the money. It is a significant issue. We must examine the Irish Credit Bureau. </p>
          <p eId="para_286"> Another issue that I raised this morning and on which I will soon table a motion relates to social protection for the self-employed. The motion will call for implementation of the Mangan report. </p>
          <p eId="para_287"> Another issue concerns commercial rates, in respect of which there are huge levels of debt.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">I am speaking to the owners of businesses that are in debt to the tune of €40,000 to €70,000 in commercial rates. A sum of €10,000 or €15,000 in commercial rates on 1 January 2016 might not be a whole lot, but if it is not paid by 31 December, it will be adding up and a mountain heading into next year. We have to look at commercial rates which should be charged based on a profit system instead of square footage.</p>
          <p eId="para_289"> The other huge issue which many Members have raised today is broadband provision in rural areas. There was a report this morning that 20% of rural businesses did not have broadband. In certain areas I imagine some of them do not even have mobile phone reception. To kick the can down the road to 2020 is to kick it too far. We should be implementing this measure in the next three to four years.</p>

        <speech by="#JenniferMurnaneOConnor" eId="spk_93">
          <from>Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor<recordedTime time="2016-06-16T14:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_290">I am delighted to welcome the Minister. I was also delighted to meet her in Carlow last Friday. It is great to see a female Minister. I am thrilled and wish her well. It is great for women because I always think we have to fight for everything.</p>
          <p eId="para_291"> I want to talk about the south east which, as the Minister knows, continues to have the highest unemployment rate. There is an action plan for jobs, but I was disappointed recently, when researching this issue, to discover that IDA Ireland had visited Dublin more than 100 times last year, while there were two visits to Carlow. Will the Minister look after rural Ireland which is so important? Towns like Carlow, Bagenalstown, Hacketstown and Tullow also need employment. We need IDA Ireland to visit us more often. Will the Minister address the issue and revert to me on it?</p>
          <p eId="para_292"> As the Minister knows, in the past week there has been major coverage in all of the newspapers of the issue of a university for the south east. It is massive for Carlow because Carlow Institute of Technology is one of the biggest employers in the county, employing more than 700 people. Furthermore, it is crucial to have university status in the south east, especially in Carlow and Waterford. Figures show that 7,260 people are missing out on higher education places because of it. It is crucial for students and parents who want to give their children an education that can open many a door. Will the Minister commit on this issue which is crucial for the south east?</p>
          <p eId="para_293"> I know that the issue of apprenticeships has been addressed. Apprenticeships are vital in building a skilled workforce and that aspect is missing. We need as many jobs as possible, but we also need to ensure there are apprenticeships for those who want to become electricians, builders and plumbers. We have to ensure they are catered for also. This is something the Minister will address and it needs to be addressed. Not to be repetitive, but between 2011 and 2015, 338,000 people emigrated owing to the lack of jobs. SMEs provide great jobs and employment, but they are not getting credit from banks. Credit availability is a massive issue and these enterprises are not getting the support they need. Will the Minister ensure SMEs are looked after and get the credit they need from banks?</p>
          <p eId="para_294"> Another matter that is dear to my heart because I have been dealing with cases in the local authority is local development contributions. I know of a case in which during the boom a building was bought but which is now owned by the banks. There are people who are interested in buying it. They will create jobs, but for them to buy the building they are being asked to make a €70,000 development contribution to the local authority. Will the Minister please do something about development contributions? They need to be taken away. That is what is stopping small SMEs from setting up new businesses. Will the Minister address the issue?</p>
          <p eId="para_295"> We have spoken about rates. We also have what is called the global re-evaluation of rates and businesses. It is a newly introduced system. There is an awful fear because small businesses are being reassessed and for many rates are being increased. Will the Minister examine this global re-evaluation to ensure rates will not go up? I can tell her that I know of three or four people whose businesses are being assessed and for whom rates are being increased. This will result in the loss of jobs. Evaluations are great and all, but at the end of the day it must be ensured the rates paid by businesses will not be increased.</p>
          <p eId="para_296"> I was a little surprised that the issue of online shopping was not addressed. Online shopping is absolutely huge, in particular among younger people who are inclined to spend all the time. What can be done? As the Minister knows, in towns such as Carlow, Bagenalstown and Hacketstown efforts are being made to try to rejuvenate the town centres. This issue needs to be addressed. We need to ensure new shops will open and that footfall will increase in town centres which are affected by online shopping. I do not wish to be repetitive, but the absence of broadband is definitely affecting businesses, as is the lack of mobile phone coverage.</p>
          <p eId="para_297"> All I can tell the Minister is that we have what I believe are called the working poor. They can only afford to have one parent go out to work because they cannot afford to meet the cost of child care. Will the Minister, please, look after the working person, the person who is most affected? Will she ensure the south east will have fair representation by IDA Ireland in the locating of businesses and will she ensure university status will be achieved for Carlow and the south east?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MauraHopkins" eId="spk_94">
          <from>Senator Maura Hopkins<recordedTime time="2016-06-16T14:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_298">I wish the Leas-Chathaoirleach well in his new position. I also congratulate the Minister, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, on her appointment and wish her every success in her new role. </p>
          <p eId="para_299"> This is my first contribution in the Seanad and it is appropriate that I do so on the important issue of delivering sustainable full employment. As a young Senator from Roscommon, I believe the single biggest issue facing the west is the need to create greater job opportunities. North Roscommon is one region in the west which in recent years has suffered hugely from the lack of employment opportunities and outward migration, with many of our young people working in more urban centres.</p>
          <p eId="para_300"> As Senator John O'Mahony pointed out, in its good work in conducting research the Western Development Commission found that between 2012 and 2015 the total number of people at work in the west had grown by almost 3%, whereas the number at work in the rest of the country had grown by 6% or double the amount. The said report also emphasised the real challenges we faced in rural areas. Towns such as Ballaghaderreen, Boyle, Castlerea, Strokestown and Carrick-on-Shannon have great communities. We have huge potential, but we need support and help to breathe life back into towns to make them attractive again for young people to return to work and set up business.</p>
          <p eId="para_301"> As stated by the Minister, A Programme for a Partnership Government has set ambitious targets. It is important that we set ambitious targets. The last Government made huge progress in ensuring the unemployment fell. It is now under 8%. The new commitment is to ensure we will have an extra 200,000 people back at work by 2020, of whom 135,000 will be working outside Dublin. It is absolutely critical that we deliver on this target.</p>
          <p eId="para_302"> Last Monday was a really good day in Ballinasloe, with the creation of 100 new jobs in a medical devices company, with an investment of almost €10 million in research and development. I thank the Minister for attending. The employment of 100 additional people in Ballinasloe will have a hugely positive impact on the town and surrounding areas. It will create an environment in which highly skilled individuals will be attracted back to the region to live, work and raise their families. The Government must continue to create an environment in which we will see more action like this. Many rural areas offer excellent educational, sports and community facilities, as well as a great quality of life.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">Recently, Roscommon County Council introduced a rates incentive scheme for new businesses opening in derelict or vacant premises, which is progressive. However, it needs to be more ambitious in the short term for it to be successful. We cannot do this alone and central government across relevant Departments must take a more active role in assisting with funding of important initiatives such as this. Broadband provision which has been mentioned several times in the context of this debate is the single most important priority in infrastructure provision on which we must deliver. There should be urgent action on broadband delivery in rural areas as we are at a competitive disadvantage. Action must be taken because matters are not moving quickly enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_304"> I ask that every effort be made to assist those areas in the greatest need. It is absolutely critical that every employment agency invest its energy and prioritise support and funding for areas in dire need in order to attract people back to them. From actively seeking the generation of ideas to assistance with funding applications and their being approved to allow for the creation of sustainable jobs, the employment agencies must act. </p>
          <p eId="para_305"> The good work of the Western Development Commission has been mentioned and it has the potential to be expanded. Enterprise Ireland, local enterprise offices and others must be proactive in assisting the process. The regional action plans for jobs seek in some way to achieve this, but we need to have more localised targets, even down to specific towns, in order to ensure progress is measured and delivered. The report of the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas, CEDRA, emphasised the need for the development of rural economic development, RED, zones in towns and their hinterlands.</p>
          <p eId="para_306"> I very much welcome the Minister's focus on the need to place greater emphasis on supporting rural areas and tackling youth and long-term unemployment. Real action is needed, however, if young people are to return to the west where there is much potential for many individuals to enjoy a great place in which to live, work and raise a family.</p>

          <from>Senator Gerard P. Craughwell<recordedTime time="2016-06-16T14:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_307">This is my first time to speak before the Leas-Chathaoirleach and I am delighted to welcome him to his new position. I am also delighted to see the Minister and her being appointed to her portfolio. I would love to have seen her appointed to the education portfolio where her expertise could really be used. On considering the matter, however, I know that she will bring a new perspective to the issue of job creation because of her educational background merging with a desire to drive issues forward. I have known her for many years as a very hard-working politician and I am sure she will put a lot of effort into the role she has been given. I again congratulate her.</p>
          <p eId="para_308"> I stated yesterday that I did not want the Seanad to be laboured with statements during the current session. With respect to colleagues, we are reiterating what members of the public hear every day of the week from the political class. It would be more useful to sit down to consider three or four initiatives that might lead to job creation rather than making rand statements on broadband, roads and various other matters. We should be trying to single out a couple of issues to assist the Minister in driving matters forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_309"> With all due respect to my colleague from the south east, the establishment of 16 university campuses would do nothing for job creation. The likes of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT, one of the most renowned academic institutions in the world, do not need the tag "university" to make them relevant. I was in Carlow recently to attend the military graduation and can state it is the finest third level establishment with the most forward-thinking people with whom one could ever ask to work. It does not need the tag "university" to make it relevant. Carlow Institute of Technology is delivering educational programmes for Aer Lingus in Dublin and the military.</p>
