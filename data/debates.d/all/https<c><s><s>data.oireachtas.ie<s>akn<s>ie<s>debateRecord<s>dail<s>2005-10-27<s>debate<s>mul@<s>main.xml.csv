#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	6	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the necessity for the Government to end its abstentionist policy on GM products and to implement the safeguard clause, as provided for in the EU Directive 2001/18/EC, in line with the unanimous decision in support of Ireland being GM-free by the Oireachtas Joint Committees on European Affairs and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and that this action be taken before time runs out at the end of this month, given that a live and viable seed, GT73, which is genetically modified rapeseed oil, could germinate here, ending our commercially advantageous and ecologically sensitive GM-free status, and be legally imported as of next month.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	12	I would like to raise five matters. First, the register of persons unsafe to work with children Bill was listed at No. 40 in the Government's legislative programme and it was promised in the programme for Government. Will it be fast-tracked?Second, I refer to the health Bill and the establishment of a new inspectorate for nursing homes. There is continuing concern about the nursing home inspectorate regime. What is the position regarding the publication of this Bill?The third matter is the Meath bus crash report. The Director of Public Prosecutions has asked Iarnród Éireann not to publish it and I can understand, as an independent agent of the State, his concern in this regard. While respecting the independence of his office, will the Tánaiste ensure, because of the difficulties this will pose for families, publication should not be delayed indefinitely? In other words, there should be a focus on when it can be published.Fourth, Deputy Enright raised a question yesterday about Marie Therese O'Loughlin who is on hunger strike outside the gates of the House. Her wish is to have the Morning Star Hostel included on the register of institutions under the Residential Institutions Redress Act. A number of Members from different parties spoke to her yesterday.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	15	The register of persons unsafe to work with children Bill is being done on a North-South basis, which is appropriate. It will be done as quickly as possible but I am not in a position to say when we will have the legislation.The inspectorate of nursing homes will be part of the health information and quality authority legislation, which I hope to bring to the Cabinet soon.There are three reports on the Meath crash by the Garda, Bus Éireann and the health authorities regarding health and safety issues. The DPP has intervened regarding one of the reports. We would all like the reports to be available to the families, in particular, and the public as quickly as possible but if a report could compromise a prosecution, everybody would understand the need for it to be kept confidential for the moment.The Deputy referred to a statement from the Government regarding Iran. I will communicate the Deputy's comments to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I am not aware if he intends to make a statement.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	16	The Tánaiste will know from today's newspapers that considerable confusion exists arising from remarks of the Taoiseach on the Government response to the Ferns Report. This is not a party political matter but there is a requirement for clarity from the Government. Neither journalists nor I are sure what a national audit means. After asking the Taoiseach I am still unsure if the commitment by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to an inquiry into the Dublin archdiocese stands and if that inquiry will proceed.On No. 59 on the C list of the Government's legislation programme, have the heads of the Bill on the repayment scheme for charges for publicly funded residential long-stay care been approved by Cabinet?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	17	I refer to an issue raised by Deputy Kenny, which I forgot to address. The institutions covered by the redress board are those where the State had a supervisory role.Regarding Deputy Rabbitte's question, the intention of the Government is to establish a commission of inquiry under new powers granted by recent legislation. The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform are in discussion and the intention is that the first module of the commission of inquiry would be an examination of current practice across all dioceses in the country. This will ensure that measures in operation in Ferns, commended by the Murphy report, are also in operation in every other diocese. In this way we can be assured that the risk of people abusing children, and its not being dealt with satisfactorily, is eliminated. The Minister is working on terms of reference for an inquiry into the Dublin diocese and he intends to bring proposals to Cabinet in two weeks.In response to Deputy Rabbitte's question on the repayment scheme, the heads of the Bill have not been cleared. The entire Bill will go to Cabinet and I hope to bring it before the House soon. Next year's Estimates will make substantial provision for the repayment of these moneys over the course of next year. Some 16,000 to 17,000 cases have been processed by the HSE and as soon as legislation is passed it will be in a position to make the payments quickly.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	18	Do I take it from the Tánaiste's response that the inquiry into the Dublinarchdiocese will be under the Commissions of Investigation Act?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	19	Yes.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	20	On foot of the Ferns report, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform promised amendments to the Criminal Justice Bill to the effect that those who did not act on knowledge of child sexual abuse would be guilty of an offence. Can the Tánaiste state when these amendments will be introduced? Will the Government investigate the fact that the Garda Commissioner knew about the activities of Canon Martin Clancy, as stated on pages 238-39 of the report?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	21	That does not arise on the Order of Business. I suggest the Deputy submit a question to the appropriate Minister.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	23	A Criminal Justice Bill is before the House but has not yet reached Committee Stage. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will bring an amendment, similar to that suggested in the Murphy report, to the Cabinet within weeks. The amendment will then be introduced on Committee Stage so that we can pass the legislation quickly.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19219	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	24	The gaming and lottery Bill has been on the Government's list of proposed legislation for close to ten years. At least a dozen casinos are in operation throughout the country. In every other country, these would be strictly regulated to maintain standards and protect revenue. We seem to be sitting on our hands in respect of this legislation. The Government states it cannot indicate a date when it will be published. Is the Government taking this seriously or is it allowing the matter to drift along unregulated? This is not a sector that should be totally unregulated.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	25	I am not in a position to state when this legislation will be ready. I will discuss the matter with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	26	Six years ago, the Government made a commitment in the Seanad that the medical practitioners Bill would be published by Christmas. As it still has not been published, would the Tánaiste consider publishing the heads of the Bill, as it is legislation of major importance?Is the Minister for Health and Children aware the sole accident and emergency consultant in Kerry General Hospital, Mr. O'Rourke, is threatening to resign because he cannot get a registrar, the space or staff he needs?

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	33	This is secondary legislation. I am entitled to ask the Minister questions on secondary legislation in the Health Act. Section 42 provided for the establishment of regional health forums. Almost a year later they have not been established. When will this happen?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	34	Regarding legislation on medical practitioners, this will occur next year. I am making amendments to the heads of the Bill, which I am prepared to make available publicly to the Deputy and others.I do not know the details of the situation in Kerry but I know that many consultants apply for positions in other parts of country and when they are appointed they have a habit of making statements on why they are leaving when they have been seeking a change for years.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	35	Does the Tánaiste not listen to the reasons?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	36	No, that is a fact. I recently cleared the regulations for the regional forum. These must now be approved by the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	37	The Health Bill was promised for this year but it has been postponed until next year, which is disappointing.When Deputy Micheál Martin was Minister for Health and Children, he considered the matter of clinical drug trials serious enough to refer it to the Commission. The courts found he acted outside his powers, which is not surprising. Will the Government introduce primary legislation to deal with this situation, where children were experimented on by drug companies in the 1960s without the parents' permission? Will the Government brush this matter under the carpet and forget it?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	38	New legislation on clinical trials, applicable throughout the EU, was introduced last year. That applies to all clinical trials where informed consent must be given. The Irish Medicines Board legislation is before the House and changes are being made to regulatory matters in that legislation.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	39	I am raising the matter of legislation that was put to one side and practices in the 1960s.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	40	That is no longer the practice. We have new legislation.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	41	Will the Government introduce legislation to investigate this matter? The action taken was disallowed by courts because the then Minister exceeded his powers.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	42	I suggest the Deputy submit a question to the appropriate Minister.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	43	I have done so. This relates to promised legislation.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	44	The court decided that because of the state of health and the age of witnesses——
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	45	That is a separate issue. The Minister was acting beyond his powers.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	46	——it was not possible to have an inquiry. We cannot make that retrospectively legal.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	47	The Minister for Health and Children did try——

#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	49	This is very serious. This legislation was promised. The Minister for Health and Children exceeded his powers and legislation was promised to deal with the matter. This has not been done. This matter of alleged of abuse of children in orphanages in the 1960s is being brushed under the carpet, the Government wants nothing to do with it.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	50	Last March the House passed Second Stage of a Private Members' Bill, the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill, in my name, addressing the problem of unfinished housing estates. The House decided to refer Committee Stage to the Select Committee on Environment and Local Government. I have been endeavouring to have Committee Stage taken in that committee but I am now informed that the Department will not be ready until some time next year. Will the Tánaiste intervene with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to facilitate the early taking of Committee Stage of that important Bill?On a related matter, when does the Government intend to introduce the legislation that will be required to abolish the charges made for making planning observations on planning applications?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	51	In both cases I will talk to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and revert to the Deputy or have him revert to the Deputy. I am not in a position to answer.

#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	62	On promised legislation, will the Tánaiste use her good offices to consult with the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources with a view to putting on the Order Paper for debate the Postal Services (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill? There is an urgent need for such a debate given the possible loss of postal services in the very near future.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	63	That legislation has been withdrawn.

For legal reasons we were advised by the Attorney General not to put the report on the website. That is the reason, unlike other reports, it has not been possible to do that. My Department sent a large number of copies of the report to the Ferns diocese and if the Deputy is anxious to receive copies for particular victims, I would be delighted to facilitate that.

If there are people who want to know how cases are dealt with by such an inquiry, the best possible way of knowing is by reading the report. Will the Tánaiste agree to reconsider, as soon as possible, the widest possible diffusion and that where Departments are giving the information I have mentioned, that they will be referred to her Department to get a copy?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	72	It is normal, and I believe we have been reasonable in these circumstances, when a public report has been completed to make it available to interested and affected parties as far as possible, free of charge, and thereafter copies can be purchased from the Government Publications Office. If there are victims of sexual abuse who are interested in getting a copy of this report, within reason I would like to facilitate that if the Deputy would like to communicate with me.

Is the Government or the Tánaiste's colleague planning any legislation on fireworks given the annual mayhem many communities must endure at this time of the year? Has the Cabinet made any decision or got a recommendation from the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources on an agreed mediator for the Corrib gas pipeline dispute? Apparently the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, made a speech yesterday on the local loop in telecommunications. Is the Minister and the Cabinet planning any major new Bill on communications in respect of the local broadband network?

In page 3, line 22, after "1997" to insert the following:", the text of which in the English language is set out for convenience of reference in Schedule 1 to this Act”.I welcome the Minister for Education and Science to the House but I am somewhat disappointed that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform appears to find it difficult to find his way to this House. He has no problem finding his way on to "Today with Pat Kenny", as he did yesterday morning, to have a nice smug interview without any opposition and to try to steal the limelight about what he intends to do. However, he finds it difficult to come into the House, where he should be. That is the job he is paid to do. I wanted to put that on the record at the outset.My important amendments Nos. 1, 3, 26 and 27 are related. Similar amendments were tabled in the Seanad and they have now been revamped to take into consideration some of the remarks made by the Minister in the Upper House. Essentially, the principle concerned here is that we need to insert in the legislation the information that is part of the European agreement. If we do not insert the relevant texts to which we are referring, it creates a messy situation for any lawyer or citizen. We should not consider law as simply the preserve of lawyers. It should be regarded as the preserve of citizens because the law is enacted for them. It is normal practice that Schedules are listed as part of the legislation. They are generally inserted at the end of a Bill. In this case, therefore, it would be helpful if the part of the Schengen Convention referred to in the text of the European agreements we are discussing was included in the legislation. I propose that we should insert the relevant parts, but not all of them. I have excised the parts that are not relevant to the Bill. If that facility was provided, anybody accessing the legislation could immediately refer to the precise details, rather than having to consult the convention itself in another document, which might cause greater difficulty.Legislation should be consolidated so that whatever one needs is available in particular legislation. One should not have to refer to other legislative aspects elsewhere. It would be a simple matter to include in the Bill the text which is set out for convenience of reference in Schedule 1. Amendment No. 3 seeks to insert the Preamble, Title 1, etc., in Schedule 2. Amendments Nos. 26 and 27 include the text to which we are referring.I ask the Minister at this late stage to make a final effort to improve the quality of the Bill by providing convenience of reference for legal practitioners and citizens generally who avail of the legislation.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	101	Deputy Costello has made an interesting point. The question is whether legislation as enacted should be just for legislators and lawyers or be specifically couched in language which is intelligible for lay people. Legislators and lawyers have both the support and the opportunity to interpret legislation, whereas lay people generally do not. Deputy Costello has touched on an issue that goes far beyond this Bill. The question is whether, in framing legislation, we should follow the lead given by other countries where a real effort is made on two fronts: first, to make legislation comprehensive so it covers all relevant issues in one reading; and, second, to use simple language. I recently read a paper by someone who is preparing a doctoral thesis on this interesting subject. The issue has not been addressed in Ireland at all, although it has been examined in the United Kingdom where considerable changes have been made in the approach to drafting legislation.The matter to which Deputy Costello referred has not been addressed sufficiently in recent times by any Government or by the Legislature generally. Legislation should be made more comprehensible to the lay person. The question is whether we can make a greater effort to use simpler language in drafting legislation. The issue goes far beyond this Bill, but it is no harm to give it an airing here.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	102	I agree with the Deputies on two points. First, Deputies will be aware that we are working towards the consolidation of legislation, particularly given that much of our legislation dates from approximately a century ago. Second, most people cannot understand the language used in legislation, other than the lawyers who make their living out of interpreting it. That idea should be progressed further. Notwithstanding that, however, I do not propose to accept the amendments for the following reasons. Deputy Costello has asked that the additional protocol and certain parts of the Schengen Convention should be added as Schedules to the Bill. In this legislation, however, we are not giving effect to the full protocol. While the protocol contains articles, only two contain substantive provisions — they are Articles 2 and 3. Of these, Ireland is proposing to operate only Article 2. In those circumstances therefore it would be inappropriate and possibly misleading to schedule the entire protocol when we are giving effect to only a part of it.Deputies will also be aware that the protocol relates to the main convention. Ireland gave effect to that main convention in the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act 1995. Scheduling the protocol in the case of the Bill before the House seems odd when the main convention itself has not been scheduled in the 1995 Act. Scheduling the protocol in these circumstances might lead to confusion as to the exact legal position. Such an outcome would defeat the purpose of the amendment.In the case of the Schengen Convention, the amendment proposes that a number of parts, but not all of it, should be added to the Schedule. Some of the parts that are proposed to be added have little bearing on the matters in this Bill. The Bill gives effects to just three articles — Articles 67 to 69, inclusive — dealing with the transfer of the enforcement of criminal judgments, which is Chapter 5 of Part 3. These are the only articles of the convention that are referred to in the Long Title to the Bill.The proposal may therefore be outside the scope of the Long Title, or at least at variance with the Long Title. That fact, along with the disjointed nature of the material it is proposed should be added, has the potential to create much confusion and uncertainty as to the precise scope of the Bill, which is exactly what I imagine most Deputies do not want to happen in this legislation.As I have already said concerning the proposal to add the protocol to the Schedule, this outcome would defeat the intention behind the amendment. In light of what Deputies have said about clarity of language, I do not think they would want to defeat that purpose. For those reasons, I do not propose to accept the amendments.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	103	I thank the Minister for her reply. Rather than undermining the position we have proposed, I thought the Minister supported it. She said that what is included in the amendments is not precisely what is referred to in the relevant text. I am trying to ensure that the relevant texts from the Schengen agreement are in the text of the Bill. If the Minister disagrees with me as to what should be inserted, the parliamentary draftsman should determine what is precisely relevant. Are Protocols 2 or 3 relevant, or both of them? The Minister said she thought that Protocol 2 alone was relevant. If that is the case, let us insert it in the legislation so that the ordinary person who may wish to access the legislation will be able to do so without having to visit the Law Library or find it on the Internet. It is difficult for a lay person to plough through the entire Schengen agreement. These European treaties are not easy for the lay person to interpret. People make a living from interpreting them and are well paid to do so. Our learned friends do exceptionally well in respect of these treaties but the ordinary citizen does not. What is the sense in us simply passing law for the benefit of a few learned people who can get through the technicalities of complex documentation? Surely we in this House have a duty to put as much facilitating material as possible into legislation. Where we refer to protocols and treaties, we should put those texts into the legislation. In this case, we are not dealing with an enormous amount of text so there is no basis to the Minister's objection. We are only talking about a couple of pages of text. From what the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, said, it is probably less than what I have suggested. If the Minister, Deputy McDowell, is not happy with the text I have presented in these amendments, he should tailor it to the specific needs of the legislation. He should not use an extraneous argument for not making the legislation as accessible as possible to the lay person as well as to professionals.

Much progress has been made on that front in the UK and that is a lead we could usefully follow here.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	105	I apologise that I was not present when the debate started. I was meeting with survivors of child abuse in the Ferns context and the meeting went on slightly longer than I had hoped. The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, has put the point fairly and squarely. To do what Deputy Costello is suggesting would be unnecessary. It was not done in the 1995 legislation. In all of the circumstances it will not have the effects that "Judge Costello" mentions.

#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	109	Apart from agreeing with Deputy Hanafin, the only thing the Minister said is that it was unnecessary. What does "unnecessary" mean? Does it mean it is not necessary for the lay person or not necessary for the legal profession? It is usual to have Schedules and protocols in legislation. We are not departing from the norm. One could say it has not been included in some legislation but the norm is that where there is a text relevant to the legislation, it is included in the legislation. We are not talking about putting a whole treaty in the legislation, we are talking about putting in the relevant section of the text.To the ordinary person looking at what we are doing in the House, it may appear we are working on some secret mantra to conceal the core of what we are doing. It may look like a secret formula that we are not prepared to unlock by giving the keys to it in the form of the text referred to in the Schedule. That is really where we are at. For the Minister to say it is unnecessary begs the question, for who or what purpose. It is necessary for ease of access, to facilitate people, for convenience and to present our legislation in a more attractive and accessible form.We have talked endlessly about the consolidation of legislation. The criminal code needs to be consolidated. I compliment the Minister for beginning that process. We could talk for ever about simplifying legislation and making it accessible to the layman. We do not need to simplify legislation if it is only going to be accessible to the professionals because that is what they are trained and paid to do. If we are going to consolidate and simplify, let us also provide maximum accessibility. That can only be provided if we show people in the Schedules and appendices to the legislation what we are referring to in the provisions. In that way they can understand the sections of the legislation without having to delve into a library of references to find out what we are going on about. Even at this late stage, I urge the Minister to reconsider his position and to make this better legislation.

In page 3, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:"‘relevant authority' means the person designated in the relevant country concerned who performs functions the same as or similar to those performed by the Minister under this Act;".We discussed this matter on Committee Stage. It relates to discussions we have had already about the ease with which a lay person can understand legislation. The concept of relevant authority is central to the Bill and it should be clarified and defined at the outset. I have transposed these words from section 5 as I consider them to be more appropriate to the definition section. In dismissing this amendment on Committee State, the Minister did not satisfactorily explain why this definition does not add to the clarity of the Bill. The Bill should be understandable to lay people from start to finish.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	115	Section 5 provides a definition of the relevant issue by saying, "the Minister may request the person in the designated country concerned who performs functions the same as or similar to those performed by the Minister under this Act to consent to and arrange . . .". It is clear who the person is. The definition section would only repeat that in a different place in the same statute. It is clear from the terms of the statute that the person to whom this request can be made is somebody who performs the same or a similar function to the Minister in the corresponding state. I would run into difficulty if I were to attempt to put a catalogue of possible definitions, sufficiently broad to cover every member state of the convention. What is in section 5 is perfectly adequate.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	116	I move amendment No. 4:
In page 4, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:"2.—Section 11 of the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act 1995 is amended by the deletion of ‘including information in relation to each application made under this Act' and the substitution therefor of ‘and the Transfer of Execution of Sentences Act 2005, including information in relation to each application made under this Act of that Act'.".This amendment requires the making of an annual report of activity under the Act. The Minister said the matter could be included in the report under section 11 of the 1995 Act. However, section 11 appears to require an amendment to deal therewith. Consequently, the amendment we tabled originally on Committee Stage has been altered slightly to facilitate that. I hope the Minister will accept it.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	117	This amendment, in effect, calls for an annual report on cases arising under this legislation. It is expected that, at most, only a small number of cases will arise thereunder. Perhaps no cases will arise in certain years. As a result, the requirement to produce a report would be disproportionate to the need to be addressed or the perceived benefit of such a report.I said on Committee Stage that, in the event of cases arising, the matter could be dealt with administratively by including such cases in the report presented to the Oireachtas under section 11 of the 1995 Act. As the matter can be dealt with in that way, there is no need for a formal amendment.Whenever we include in legislation the need for an annual report, it must be diaried into the relevant Department's internal system. Some official must be told that, on a certain day, he must produce the annual report in accordance with the statute in question. He must then set aside a day or two for research, produce the report and present it to the Houses of the Oireachtas. This takes time and money.While some degree of transparency is desirable, tying down departmental officials to a diary that requires them to report on relatively minor issues, which may not even arise annually, represents an increased imposition on them and is of very doubtful value. If anybody is interested in the information they can elicit it by way of a parliamentary question. However, asking an official to prepare a report when Members will not even bother tabling parliamentary questions thereon is a waste of time.The Deputy referred to section 11 of the 1995 Act, which provides that the Minister shall, within four months of the end of each year, beginning with the year ending 31 December 1995, make a report to each House of the Oireachtas on the operation in the preceding year of matters within the Act, including information on each application made under the Act. On the Bill before the House, it is perfectly possible, without requiring a separate report, to deal with the matter on the basis of an administrative extra paragraph that can be included if people want it in the event of any transactions taking place. The idea of providing for a separate report under this Act is unnecessary and adds to the complexity of trying to administer the law, the responsibility for which will fall on successive Ministers and generations of public servants.

Given that it is a statutory requisite, it should therefore be a requisite to have a report on the operation of the Transfer of Execution of Sentences Bill 2003. The two can be rolled into one. An amendment is necessary because it is not obligatory to make any reference to this legislation.Under the 1995 Act, an annual report is required. A list of the number of times the legislation before the House will have been used in terms of the transfer of the execution of sentences could easily be appended. The Minister says as much. Where is the problem? The information will be provided anyway and therefore it is no big deal to add on another little piece of information that would make the operation of this legislation more transparent.To say the relevant information can be obtained through parliamentary questions does not reflect the way in which we should do our business. If we already require an annual report regarding the 1995 Act, why not require it in respect of this Bill? Will the Minister agree to my amendment?

In page 4, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:"2.—The purpose for which this Act is enacted includes the giving effect to the following:(a) Article 2 of the Additional Protocol to the 1983 Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons; and(b) Articles 67 to 69 of the Schengen Convention.”.It is always useful to find a "purpose" provision in a Bill. It helps us as legislators and is even more helpful to the lay person, who can find out the purpose of the Bill from reading just one section. I disagree with those who say the Long Title of every Bill is necessarily a good thing — this is simply not true. Each Act should have a "purpose" provision. This would be just a small step towards making our legislation more understandable. I ask the Minister to consider such a provision, not only in this Bill but also in all others.This amendment is just another effort to try make the Bill more understandable to the ordinary person. When it was put to the Minister on Committee Stage, his argument against it was based on drafting style. If his only reason for not accepting my proposal is drafting style, and if the proposal makes the legislation more understandable from the lay person's point of view, he should accept it.

His amendment is an extension of what I was seeking to do through amendments Nos. 1 and 3 to make the legislation more understandable and accessible. It is important that the purpose of the legislation be clear and that it state categorically that it gives effect to provisions in Article 2 of the Additional Protocol to the Council of Europe's Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons and also Articles 67 to 69 of the Schengen convention. I was going a step further by seeking to include the relevant sections in the legislation.We should examine our consciences regarding these matters. It is not a question of sticking with tradition but of doing what is most beneficial to the ordinary citizen. We should erase from our minds our ideas on professionals and the norm in the past and think about what is useful and accessible to ordinary people in the legislation we pass in this House.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	123	This was discussed on Committee Stage. It has been the style in this Legislature and its predecessor under the Irish Free State to set out a Long Title to every Bill. The Long Title is generally supposed to be a statement of the overall purpose of the legislation. Deputy Gerard Murphy is arguing for a different approach that gets rid of the Long Title completely and states the substance in a "purpose" section in the legislation. I can see the attraction in that because some people feel Long Titles appear antiquated in that they are presented in the upper case and are hard to read. I, as a member of the Government, am not in a position to tear up the existing practice.The Oireachtas is directed by the Constitution to use a Long Title in respect of amendments to the Constitution. The terms of the Constitution prescribe how a Bill to amend the Constitution should be presented textually. At least in that case, the Long Title is more or less constitutionally required. Whether it is a good idea to have no Long Title and include a purpose section in the case of legislation that is not amending the Constitution is a matter for debate. The Deputy should take the matter up in a more general way with the Taoiseach who is answerable for the Office of the Attorney General in this House. We cannot scrap the Long Title and replace it with a purposes section on a piecemeal basis just because one Minister likes it better than another. It would require a major policy change across all legislation. I am not in a position to agree to it today and I am not sure it would be a good idea to do so.
#GerardMurphy	unknown-#GerardMurphy-party	unknown-#GerardMurphy-dob	unknown-#GerardMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	124	I am disappointed by the Minister's response because the reasons for this amendment are quite clear and it would benefit the lay person. I am also disappointed because the Minister is never shy about taking the lead in many areas and if he took the lead on this issue other Ministers would follow suit.

The amendment is introduced in section 2 as an additional clear explanation of the purpose of the Bill. The Long Title is a general description but this states the precise purpose of the Bill and sharpens its thrust.The Minister would not be departing from tradition in a way he does not feel entitled to do or that might encounter some legal impediment. He would enhance the Long Title with a sharper presentation of the purpose of the Bill in the text.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	126	I am not an expert on procedure in this House and am not clear whether Standing Orders require there should be a Long Title. When one wanted to move a Bill one had to produce only the Long Title to get permission for it to be printed. It was necessary to state the purpose of the Bill in general terms.It is not a good idea to have a Long Title followed by a purposes clause because my colleagues in the legal profession would surely find discrepancies between the two, unless the text of both was the same. They will argue that because of a deviation between them one should be preferred to the other. In those circumstances it is better to stick to the present mode.It used to be that if one wanted to move a Bill and get leave to circulate the text one needed to move only the Long Title on the Order of Business. The Long Title, therefore, has a function under the rules of the House and I do not wish to create a situation in which a purposes clause and the Long Title could be seen to conflict.If we are to switch from one mode to the other I would like to consult the Parliamentary Counsel on the merits of the idea and the Oireachtas Commission on whether it wishes to do business in that way. It is not for me to make a unilateral excursion at the invitation of the Deputies.

In page 4, line 19, after "sentences" to insert the following:", including those imposed outside the State".In our legislation there is a presumption against extra-territorial effect, to rebut which clear words must be used. I propose this amendment to guarantee that this Act applies to sentences imposed outside the State. I presume the Minister will have little difficulty with the substance of the amendment.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	129	This amendment is unnecessary as it is already clear from sections 5 (i) and 6 (i) that the Bill deals with two distinct categories of sentence, namely, those imposed in the State and those imposed in other designated states. Section 5 deals with cases in which a person has been sentenced in this country but has fled and is now in his or her state of nationality. In that case the Minister can request the state of nationality to enforce the Irish sentence.Section 6 deals with cases in which an Irish person has been sentenced abroad and has fled back to Ireland without having served the sentence. In that case the authorities in the sentencing state can request the Minister to arrange to have the sentence enforced here. Section 6 provides for the receipt of such requests.Sections 5 and 6 are clear on this point. The amendment as drafted could lead to some difficulty because it refers to sentences imposed outside the State. That, however, is too wide. The Bill is concerned only with sentences imposed in other designated states and section 4 outlines the process by which states are designated.While I understand the amendment is intended to be helpful, sections 5 and 6 make it redundant and for technical reasons it could disimprove the situation by referring to sentences imposed outside the State in countries other than those designated.

In page 4, line 20, after "passing" to insert the following:", but shall not apply to a sentence imposed before its passing and in circumstances where an application could have been, but prior to such passing was not, made in respect of the person on whom the sentence was imposed pursuant to the Extradition Acts 1965 to 2001 or the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003, or in respect of which such application was made and not granted".The relevant section in the Act states:This Act applies in relation to sentences, whether imposed before or after its passing.I object to the retrospective nature of that blunt, unconditional statement. The Minister might point out that it is not really retrospective in the sense that it will not involve sentencing people retrospectively, which I accept. It will, however render a person liable to being arrested and imprisoned who is now free in the State and might have been for many years, making it potentially unfair. I propose a safeguard, namely that the requesting state which could have sought the extradition of the suspect but failed to do so should not be allowed to reactivate an application if it failed to pursue it prior to the legislation going through. If an application were lying dormant for years, it should not now be activated.In a case where extradition was sought and not granted, that too should be outside the remit of this Bill. In that sense the Bill should not be retrospective to cover a situation where extradition proceedings were entered into, but failed. This could be a means of trawling in an area where the situation had been dealt with, perhaps by extradition legislation, where the opportunity existed to seek someone's return to the country but was not acted on and now it could be activated. That is unfair and some protection is required in the area, particularly since the abolition of the political offence exception. In those circumstances we could create anomalies and difficulties, and the legislation would probably benefit from the type of amendment I propose.

Ba chóir go ndéanfaimis gach aon rud dár féidir linn le déanamh cinnte de go bhfuil an oiread cosanta agus is féidir ó thaobh cearta de acu siúd a bhfuil an Stát chun déileáil leo.The purpose of this amendment is similar to that of Deputy Costello but goes slightly further in proposing an additional safeguard against the State executing judgments from countries with unfair judicial systems. It is important to clearly allot this discretionary role to the High Court from the outset, especially given the absence of human rights criteria with regard to the absolute discretion of the Minister for Foreign Affairs in designating countries for the purposes of this Act. Orders by the Minister designating countries under this Bill as currently drafted are laid before both Houses after they have been made. Accordingly, the High Court should have a role in this respect to ensure that proper account is taken of monitoring regime change and changes in judicial and detention standards in the designated countries. A country may be designated by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the situation in that country might improve or get worse in the intervening time. This Bill does not make provision for a review of the designated country status.Likewise, the criteria governing the decisions by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in these cases on whether to grant consent to a designated country to a request that a sentence be served in this country are gravely lacking from a human rights perspective. Elements of this legislation are not unlike the disgraceful decisions made by the Minister when he introduced immigration legislation in this House last year, whereby a number of countries were deemed to be safe. One of those is Nigeria, where every year, hundreds of people die at the hands of police officers.We need to ensure that the designating of countries can be reviewed. The current list of designated countries includes some which have not come up to the mark in terms of conditions of detention. Georgia has been cited by various groups, in particular by the UN Committee Against Torture, which said the detention conditions in Georgia are akin to torture. Other listed countries have still to rise to the EU mark set under the Copehagen Treaty, though they are making progress, and in the future might reach the standards we expect in our own judicial system. The powers in this regard are given to the Minister, but the onus and power should be shifted to reside with the High Court, so that it would give explicit guidance relating to the quality of the judicial process in those designated countries, the quality of the detention centres or prisons, or whatever places in which sentenced persons are to be held. Considering that Irish citizens could be held in these conditions abroad, and people would be placed in prisons in this State, we must ensure that proper due process and the judicial process in the designated countries are up to the standards set out in legislation in this House.Given that the Bill does not make provision for the sentenced person's right to make representations to the Minister as to why he should not grant consent, there should be the opportunity of recourse to the High Court for a decision on the designated countries, and to ensure that the High Court can make such a determination. There might be a role for the proposed new European human rights agency discussed last week at the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights. That agency might look into human rights conditions in various European countries but could perhaps also be requested by states, or the Minister or the High Courts of those states, to investigate the standards in various countries.The High Court would provide an opportunity to be open and transparent about how such decisions are reached. The person affected would have an opportunity to put his or her case too. This would take pressure off the Minister, whether it be the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in terms of designating a country, or the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, so that he or she would be fully aware of the facts. The High Court is where this decision should rest.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	133	I draw Deputy Ó Snodaigh's attention to the provisions of section 9(2)(f) of the Bill. The High Court is given a very significant role with regard to every application to execute a sentence on foot of the terms of this Bill in this State. The High Court is expressly prohibited from ordering that a sentence be served under the circumstances set out in section 9(2)(f). The legislation provides for extensive grounds for the non-execution of a sentence in this State, including situations pertaining to the European arrest warrant. Fundamental rights are fully protected under the legislation and provide guarantees that the High Court cannot allow a sentence to be served in Ireland if the person concerned can resist on human rights grounds his or her return under a European arrest warrant or an alternative extradition request not covered by the legislation. In situations where, on an individual case basis or due to changing circumstances, designated countries slip below a standard of acceptability, the High Court is obliged not to execute or allow a sentence to be executed if there is justification for the non-extradition or non-rendition on a European arrest warrant.The real question is whether this should be made prospective only. Both Deputies sought safeguards rather than argue for an absolute prospective only rule. These safeguards are contained in section 9 because the High Court has to ask itself the same questions raised by the Deputies, that is, whether extradition should be refused. If it is refused, the court is prohibited from ordering the sentence to be served in Ireland. From a human rights perspective, the situation is covered.Of the countries which have enacted their European arrest warrant obligations pursuant to the framework decision of the European Union, Ireland is among the most protective of human rights. We have no reason to be ashamed because every possible safeguard has been included. While some authorities in Europe believe we have gone too far, I am happy the European arrest warrant legislation provides for the adequate protection of Irish people. The same standard of protection is provided with regard to requests that a sentence imposed abroad be served in Ireland. The court may not allow for the sentence to be served in Ireland if, in respect of the offence, the country making the request could be properly refused extradition or rendition under the European arrest warrant system.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	134	The Minister referred to the safeguards in section 9 which, however, are not of the order we seek and do not correspond to the point I made on situations where extradition could be refused at present. Circumstances have changed since the political offence exception was abolished but, if we are retrospective in terms of what was an offence but was not activated at the time, the provision in section 2 that the legislation would apply to sentences passed before or after its passing leaves me uncertain as to whether a safeguard exists in this regard. Section 9 appears to concern only those cases in which extradition would be refused at this point in time. I ask the Minister to clarify whether protection exists in these circumstances.My previous point concerned circumstances arising from the 1965 extradition legislation. Do anomalies exist in the implementation by various countries of the European arrest warrant in terms of retrospection and prospectivity? Is it possible that, because some countries have not made it retrospective, fugitives fleeing from justice cannot be arrested under the warrant? It is being introduced differently in Ireland.How many countries have ratified and transposed into legislation the European arrest warrant? Are other countries fulfilling their duties by transposing it into legislation or are we ahead of the posse? How many countries have implemented the warrant in their own fashion, which they are entitled to do provided they adhere to its principle? How many anomalies have arisen with regard to this matter?My main concern is that, contrary to the Minister's assertion, section 9 does not provide protection with regard to the refusal of extradition.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	135	Will the Minister clarify the statement issued in August that the Government would consider the application of this Bill with regard to whether the Colombia three could serve their sentences here? Can the Minister provide an outline of the Government's position on that issue and tell me whether the provision under discussion covers such a situation?Last August, when Niall Connolly, James Monaghan and Martin McCauley fled to Ireland from Colombia after being found guilty of serious offences, the Tánaiste said the Government was considering whether the three men could serve their sentences in Ireland if extradition proceedings proved unsuccessful and mentioned this Bill as a possible means to address the issue. In many respects, the Bill is tailor-made to do so because it provides for cases where a person has been sentenced in another country but absconds before completing the sentence and returns to his or her native country. I accept this is a Bill that arises from a Council of Europe convention and a protocol to that convention. Given that the Tánaiste raised this issue on behalf of the Government as a possible way for dealing with those gentlemen, will the Minister indicate what progress has been made from that point of view in the context of this Bill? Have discussions taken place with the parties in Colombia on the possible adoption by Colombia of the provisions arising under this convention? I take it that when the Tánaiste raised this issue she had that in mind. She said at the time that she noted that Colombia was not a party to the relevant Council of Europe convention and, therefore, not a party to the additional protocol. She mentioned that it would be open to Colombia to seek to become a party to them. I am not sure on what basis she made that statement at that time.This Bill will have little enough application in general circumstances and in some respects it is tailor-made for dealing with this situation where people have absconded, having been found guilty of serious crimes in another country, returned here and are sitting here, as it were, waiting for the Government to complete its deliberations and any discussions in which it may be engaged with the Government of Colombia. I and my party want to see this issue resolved. It is an appropriate time to raise it now and it is appropriate that the Minister should advise the House as to whether this Bill might provide an answer to that problem and a means by which the Colombia three could be dealt with here and serve their sentences here under the terms of this Bill.

The purpose of my proposal is to explain at an early stage of the Bill exactly what safeguards are available on recourse to the High Court. I welcome what the Minister said regarding the safeguards contained in the European Union extradition Acts and the European Arrest Warrant Act. Despite our arguing this issue when we debated this matter here previously, I did not believe we had gone far enough in respect of the provision of safeguards. There will always be people who will want to row back from ensuring protections on human rights. That we are ahead of the posse in terms of some of our European neighbours in this context, points to there being different standards not only throughout the European Union but throughout the world in terms of the legal process, due process and the conditions of detentions. That is the reason we have continuously sought here to ensure that we have the highest possible standards in this regard. Even though we might have a high standard in terms of the European Arrest Warrant Act — it is not as high and does not give as much protection as is needed. In this amendment I seek to ensure that additional protections are given to those being considered for serving their sentences here.Regarding the designation of countries, some 22 countries have signed up to the additional protocol. I am not sure if additional countries have signed up to it since the Human Rights Commission made its submission to the Minister. The Minister might confirm that number. I understand that 22 have signed up to the Additional Protocol to the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. The Minister's reply might help in terms of my deliberations on this amendment.

It states, "This Protocol shall be applicable to the enforcement of sentences imposed either before or after its entry into force." If we are talking about the scope of the protocol that shows this section of this Bill is totally in line with the convention and protocol to which we are signing up.Regarding the Colombia three issue, this Bill was prepared long before they came into view and at a time when they were participating in a more active way in the Colombian justice process. Therefore, I would not like it to be thought that — Deputy Jim O'Keeffe used the phrase "tailor-made" and I know he did not mean it in this context — this legislation was dreamt up for that purpose. It was there before they ever came on the radar scene and returned to Ireland.

That is the first absolute prerequisite. As currently advised, I do not believe Colombia has done that and I do not know whether it intends to do that. The Deputies will know there is a pending application to the Irish Government for extradition under the Extradition Act by the Colombian Government in respect of the three people mentioned.In large measure, possibly the same issues would arise under section 9(2)(f) one way or the other. If extradition is not possible on the grounds mentioned in that subsection, this Bill will not circumvent that set of circumstances because the High Court would have to inquire whether it would extradite in order to decide whether it will allow a sentence to be executed in Ireland. What the Tánaiste rightly said was that in regard to the particular three fugitives who came to Ireland, there were three possibilities. One was that they would be extradited, if a request was made, which now has happened. The second possibility is that if no extradition request was made the terms of this legislation might be of relevance in those circumstances. The Deputies will see that is so, but the condition precedent I mentioned is still outstanding in respect of that. The third possibility is that there could be prosecutions in the domestic courts. That remains the situation and it has not changed. We have to leave it at that at this stage. I do not want to or propose to say anything more about the three individuals.Deputy Ó Snodaigh is talking about rights and standards of international justice. I do not want to become overly combative or querulous at this hour of the day in these circumstances, but——

We as a country have a duty to combat international terrorism. This Bill may help us in that cause. It could have or may have a particular application in regard to the Colombia three if the current extradition proceedings, bearing in mind that we do not have an extradition treaty or otherwise, are not successful. In that event I will be asking the Government to consult with the Government of Colombia as to how this Bill, when enacted, can provide the solution to dealing with those particular people. That could involve having Colombia accede to the relevant Council of Europe convention and adopting the process itself. The Bill and the protocol provide that the provisions will apply to sentences imposed either before or after the entry into force of the Act. This may represent the first useful function to which the Bill will be put when it is enacted into law.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	194	The Minister did not refer to the points I made. I stated that section 9 did not cover the political offence exception. Given that the legislation is to be retrospective and the political offence exception abolished, someone who could not have been pursued under the previous legislation could now be pursued even though the offence could have happened 20 years ago and was not an offence at that time. Section 9 does not provide any protection or safeguards in cases where extradition would be refused now.I also asked the Minister to give some indication of the number of countries that have signed up to the European arrest warrant. I have heard that anomalies exist in the manner in which countries have signed. Some of them have made it retrospective and others have not done so. Considerable difficulty is likely to arise and may have already arisen in some cases in trying to execute the European arrest warrant.I refer to the application of this legislation to the Colombia three. At the time the Tánaiste gave the impression that the Government was doing something about the issue. She was the only person available at the time because the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was on holidays. She pulled this rabbit out of a hat even though under the provisions of section 4 regarding the additional protocol and the Schengen Convention, it seems clear that this legislation cannot be used in that respect. It would be difficult to see how Colombia could sign the convention. It would be very difficult for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to agree to have Colombia as a designated country given its appalling track record on human rights. It was a red herring. The Tánaiste gave the impression the Government was doing something when it was doing nothing and had no intention of doing anything.

In page 5, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:"(2) The Minister shall not make a request for execution of a sentence where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the sentenced person will be exposed to conditions constituting torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment.".
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	199	Amendment No. 14, which is related to this amendment, is self-explanatory. If my amendment is accepted the Minister could not make a request under subsection (1) unless "there are reasonable grounds to believe that the terms and conditions of detention in the designated country would be compatible with Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights".Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights places obligations on state parties to protect against foreseeable violations of human rights outside the territory of the state; even beyond Europe it guarantees protection from torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. It imposes an obligation on national authorities, in this case the Minister, to make an assessment of the likely consequences of any transfer to a country of origin.Many of the issues that have been raised under Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, such as the danger of persecution by state authorities or non-state actors, are not engaged. However, the possibility remains that in serving a sentence in a designated country the person concerned faces a real risk of being subjected to torture, inhuman or degrading treatment owing to the conditions of detention in the receiving state. Therefore, obligations are placed on the Irish authorities in particular to prevent foreseeable future torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment that may still arise.The conditions of detention of some of the countries that have signed up to the additional protocol to the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons have been deplored by respected human rights organisations such as Amnesty International. The Committee on the Prevention of Torture has commented for instance on the condition of prisons in Georgia, which is a protocol country in which the Minister could authorise an Irish citizen to be detained and to serve a sentence.The Human Rights Commission made a submission on the Bill in June 2004 in which it stated:The threshold of what constitutes torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment has been developed by the European Court of Human Rights and also by the European Committee on the Prevention of Torture (CPT). The standards set for acceptable conditions of detention by the CPT encompass issues such as overcrowding, sanitation facilities, recreational facilities, visiting regimes, access to medical services and mechanisms for the investigation of complaints within the prison service.It may be argued with regard to a number of designated countries that the conditions of detention under one or more of these headings might be so deficient as to present a real risk that a person imprisoned in that country would be subjected to degrading treatment, in contravention of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights.That is the logic behind the amendment. It does not restrict the Minister or the activities that will occur under the Bill other than to protect Irish citizens or those convicted in Irish courts who have left our shores without serving their sentences here. The amendment aims to protect them against torture within the prison systems of the designated countries.
#CiaranCuffeGP	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-party	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-dob	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	200	This is a good Bill because it allows for persons in Irish prisons to serve out their sentence in their home country and, vice versa, it allows Irish citizens in other countries to return here. That, in itself, is a good thing.One of my party's principal concerns about the Bill is that it comes down to the Minister's oversight as to whether a transfer can or should take place. Over the last year or more we have got to know our current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform better than we did heretofore. There are concerns about his conduct, particularly regarding the transfer of people from this country. I refer in particular to the repatriation agreement with Nigeria, where the Minister is allowing people to be deported to a country where the Government has not even ratified the agreement that was made between the two countries. Nigeria is a country where torture takes place on a daily basis, where people are killed for no reason, where there are enormous concerns about how the Government and its police force operates. Such concerns are highlighted every year in Amnesty International reports. I use that example to show that Deputy McDowell is not showing due consideration of the conditions that a person who has been living in Ireland for many years is subjected to when he or she is sent back to Nigeria.We must have better safeguards stitched into the Bill to ensure that a Minister like Deputy McDowell, or any other Minister, gives adequate consideration to the conditions that a prisoner will be subjected to in the country to which he or she is sent. It is imperative that the Bill takes due cognisance of that fact. To that end, I proposed amendment No. 12. If there are reasonable grounds for believing that the sentenced person may be exposed to conditions constituting torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment, then we must think again about deporting that person.There are many problematic countries in the world that the Irish Government has been cosying up to, whether it be the Chinese regime that has an appalling human rights record, or the United States, where prisoners are being held without due regard to the Geneva Convention. It is important that Ireland holds its head up high, internationally, with regard to human rights. It is also important that when we pass legislation allowing people from Ireland to be sent somewhere else, that we give due concern to that country's human rights record and that the Minister, this House and the Government examines it carefully before whisking somebody onto an aeroplane. That is why I propose this amendment.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	201	I wish to clarify a point before proceeding. We dealt with amendment No. 5 earlier, in the name of Deputies Jim O'Keeffe and Gerard Murphy. The disposing of that amendment was put to the House. The question was declared defeated with the amendment being lost.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	202	I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to speak on this amendment. I also strongly support amendment No. 14 and commend Deputy Cuffe for proposing amendment No. 12.This discussion is about human rights and respect for the human rights of prisoners, citizens and people generally. Nowadays it is not very easy to defend or take a stand on human rights. At times it is unfashionable to do so and there is often a rush to judgement on particular cases. It is important in the course of this debate, while dealing with these amendments, that we understand and take cognisance of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights. We must respect the integrity of human rights issues.We have an obligation, as Members of the Oireachtas, to challenge countries that do not have a good human rights record. It is important that we raise such matters in the House and are not afraid to speak out, even if we are talking about friends or neighbours. If countries have a disastrous record on human rights, it is up to us to defend the interests of our citizens. This point was brought into sharp focus with the recent kidnapping of Mr. Rory Carroll in Iraq. In that situation, the entire country united and the Minister and Government responded, in the strongest possible way, to protect and defend his rights. We also have a duty to defend and protect our citizens in other situations.While speaking about amendment No. 14, I also wish to mention again the case of Mr. Christy McGrath, the Irish jockey who is in jail in England at present. His case is an important one and I wish to commend and thank my colleagues, from various political parties, who are supporting him. It is important that we ensure that Mr. McGrath receives the full support of Members of the Oireachtas to bring this miscarriage of justice to an end. I also encourage people to go to England and support his case.When one is talking about human rights and the rights of prisoners, one must not lose sight of the rights of victims. It is vital that the voices of the victims are heard. The Barron report on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings makes this point. The victims of that atrocity are constantly pleading with the Government and the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, to co-operate with the Barron inquiry. Their rights need to be protected under international law but at the moment they are not receiving such protection. I urge the Taoiseach and all Cabinet members to ensure that the victims of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings are given strong support and to demand co-operation from the British Government.Some countries seem to believe they are above international law and are not required to implement procedures and supports to uphold human rights. Amendment No. 12 asserts that "The Minister shall not make a request for execution of a sentence where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the sentenced person will be exposed to conditions constituting torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment". Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights is referred to in amendment No. 14. The provisions of these amendments are essential if there are any problems for a sentenced person or if there is any question that he or she may be subjected to torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment. It is not acceptable for countries to be involved in such activities and the onus is on us, as Members of the Oireachtas, regardless of what we may think of what the sentenced person is alleged to have done, to defend his or her interests and human rights.I welcome the opportunity to debate these amendments because such debate is very important. I remind Members that respect for human rights must always be at the top of the political agenda, particularly in times of war, crisis or violent international acts. We must constantly be vigilant. I pay tribute to the people around the world, including in this country, who put their necks on the block for human rights. I am thinking of Pat Finucane, Rosemary Nelson and all the lawyers I met when I visited Colombia whose families were shot at and murdered because they were defending the human rights of trade unionists, community groups, prisoners etc. This is why I support amendment No. 14.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	203	I support both amendments. The amendment formulated by Deputy Ó Snodaigh encapsulates the issue more effectively. It reads, "there are reasonable grounds to believe that the terms and conditions of detention in the designated country would be compatible with Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights". This covers all the areas relating to torture, inhumane treatment, degrading treatment or punishment. The problem with the legislation is that there is no section which requires proofing for human rights in regard to designated countries. It is not provided for in section 9, even though safeguards are included. It should be stated that Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights should be incorporated into the legislation.We still do not know if countries have been designated for the purposes of the legislation. Perhaps the Minister will give us an idea whether the Minister for Foreign Affairs has compiled a list of countries that he has already designated or intends to designate, what criteria he uses or if he uses any criteria other than that specified in section 4. It simply states that he may designate a country that has ratified the additional protocol and that has ratified or acceded to the Schengen Agreement. Ireland has not acceded to that agreement, even though we can opt in or out of it.What precisely is the status for designation? Are there criteria in regard to the incorporation of human rights under the European Convention on Human Rights or international conventions on human rights? Before a country is designated for the purpose of someone serving a sentence, the Human Rights Commission should be asked to proof that country in terms of the existence and operation of human rights and no person sentenced should receive treatment that could amount to a breach of the European Convention on Human Rights or international conventions on human rights. This requirement should be incorporated into the legislation. It should not be left in some hazy situation where the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform or the Minister for Foreign Affairs may or may not take on board in a discretionary fashion requirements of this nature. The requirement should be stated in the legislation.There are huge variations in prison conditions. We are talking about Irish citizens being imprisoned and the sentence being executed in a designated country. We do not lead the field in respect of the conditions in some Irish prisons. We have been condemned in a number of international forums, including Amnesty International, for the slopping-out process. While the Minister promised a few super-prisons to deal with the issue in the distant future, nothing is being done about it now and, as a result, 1,200 prisoners are taking a case to the European Court of Human Rights. How do we stand as a receiving country in terms of designated countries? Countries in Europe might well ask is Ireland a place in which they could allow their citizens to be imprisoned. There is gross overcrowding in Cork Prison where the imprisonment ratio is double what it should be.There is no reference to unusual conditions. For example, there was hard labour in this country, which was abolished, but it is part of sentences in many other countries. There is nothing in the legislation that allows the High Court to specify that unusual conditions of this nature could not apply to someone serving a sentence if it is executed under the terms in this legislation for the transfer of execution of a sentence.Many issues need to be examined. No one opposes the principle of the legislation because people cannot be allowed to flee justice. We cannot have fugitives from justice whereby people who have committed a crime are allowed to flee to another country and escape. These people must be either brought back or they must serve their sentence in the other country. The legislation includes a facility to enable the sentence to be served in another country. It behoves us to proof the legislation in terms of human rights, otherwise we will not do our citizens justice. We will do them an injustice instead.I hope the Minister will give a commitment, even if it is not written into the legislation, that in so far as countries are being determined for designation, he will refer them to the Human Rights Commission which has a specific statutory role in proofing for human rights. He should refer any potential designate countries to the commission to determine whether they comply with the principles of amendments Nos. 12 and 14 relating to torture, inhumane or degrading treatment, and whether Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights is respected.While the legislation is desirable, good and well intentioned, it could result in considerable infringement of civil liberties while the only intention is the infringement of one right, namely, the right to liberty. In other words, the individual would be arrested in the designated country and imprisoned. This should be the only infringement and those involved should otherwise serve their sentence in a normal and humane fashion.The legislation does not provide sufficient safeguards or conditions to ensure this will happen unless we provide for human rights proofing either within the legislation directly or by specifying that any designated country would have to pass the test by being presented to the Human Rights Commission. It would then give the nod to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for Foreign Affairs that the country, to the best of its ability, is in accordance with international best practice on human rights and the European Convention on Human Rights. This is something which would be extremely desirable on our part.

When we deal with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, we deal with Ministers who have different opinions and come from different political backgrounds. That said the Bill will still stand which means there will be different interpretations of how justice is administered in different jurisdictions around the world. It was suggested that the Human Rights Commission should advise the Minister and that he, in turn, should take note of what the Human Rights Commission says about whether a country should be a designated one. If the legislation is not transparent, it will undermine the basis for the Bill, which otherwise is welcome and generally acceptable. It is important that a lay person should clearly understand that a mechanism is available to ensure nobody is deprived of his or her human rights at the whim of the Minister of the day.

The additional protocol is a Council of Europe instrument. Support for human rights is a core value which underpins the Council of Europe. The Council is committed to the principles of respect for universal and indivisible human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law. Member states of the Council are obliged to observe the fundamental rights and principles covered by the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms — the European Convention on Human Rights, ECHR.A non-member state of the Council of Europe is first evaluated by the Council before being allowed to accede to its instruments. In addition, Ireland will operate the arrangements under this legislation where the other party is not only a member of the Council's protocol but also has been designated by the Minister for Foreign Affairs following an assessment of the state's suitability.Deputy Costello asked about the number of designations. There have been none so far, they must await ratification of the protocol, but they will be made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The designation can be revoked if conditions deteriorate in the relevant state under section 9(4)(a). The Deputy also referred to hard labour and penal servitude. Under the same subsection, such conditions will not be allowed if the sentence is served in Ireland. That is stated clearly in the legislation.

The section should be brought forward to make it clear at an early stage in the Bill that full protection will be provided and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform must take account of the ECHR to ensure the State is fully compliant with the convention.The State is obliged to consider all likely consequences of a request, including the safeguards I seek to provide in the legislation. The Irish Human Rights Commission suggested an explicit mention should be made of the ECHR in this section to ensure the Minister of the day cannot ignore his or her obligations under the convention and sentenced persons can enjoy full protection. If the conditions of detention in the designated country do not comply with the ECHR and are condemned, an alternative, the European arrest warrant, is open to the Irish authorities if they are seeking to ensure a detainee serves his or her sentence. They can pursue the case in that fashion.We had a spat earlier regarding Colombia. That state would never satisfy the conditions and safeguards provided for in the legislation or the European arrest warrant and, therefore, that matter does not arise. If my amendment were accepted, the detention of the three men in Colombia would be designated torture as they were permanently under threat. Their food had to be brought into the prison because of the danger of poisoning within and weapons were used within the jail by right wing groups. Those men were in grave danger, yet Fine Gael would seek to make them serve an unjust sentence. Fine Gael would probably have extradited Michael Collins for his deeds had the legislation been in place back then.

Extraditions from the European Union to Iran took place earlier this year, even though a teenager was executed there because he was gay. Extraditions are being granted by the EU but I am not convinced there are sufficient controls within the Union in this regard. Perhaps a triple lock is needed because sufficient safeguards should be in place for the transfer of a detainee to another jurisdiction.As Deputy Finian McGrath said, human rights must be safeguarded. There are different ways to do so, whether that is through my amendment, the ECHR or the Irish Human Right Commission. Protections must be copper-fastened in the legislation. The Bill is unusual in so far as it permits the transfer to a detainee overseas. The amendment is needed and I will press it.

That is not expressly stated in the legislation and, therefore, I would like the Minister of State to outline where it is covered. He stated section 9 covers the ECHR in the operation of the High Court. I do not see how it does. Even if did, it would be desirable that this should be expressly stated in the legislation so that the High Court would have cognisance of it when making decisions on the transfer of sentences.The problem centres on designated countries that are suitable and appropriate for Irish citizens to serve their sentences. Providing appropriate conditions in the State is an issue but it is important to ensure countries with which we reciprocate under this legislation have the necessary safeguards in place and provide the appropriate conditions in which people can serve their sentences. It is no skin off the ministerial nose to do so. It would ensure this legislation would be consistent with human rights principles. The fallback position I mentioned, to which the Minister has not referred, is that we should present prospective designated countries to the Irish Human Rights Commission. We should seek its opinion on whether the countries are in accordance with human rights requirements. I ask the Minister to address this point.

#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	238	I do not think I will need all that time. Sadly, there is not enough in the Bill to keep going that long.The Bill updates its 1998 namesake to implement some of the recommendations of the working group on the review and improvement of the Parental Leave Act 1998. Sustaining Progress, the Government's social partnership agreement for the period 2003-05, made a commitment to strengthen parental leave in line with the agreed recommendations of the social partners. A commitment was made subsequently to enact the legislation by the end of the last Dáil session, but we must ask why the Government has failed to act within its own time limits.I realise that the delay is not dramatic but, if the Adoptive Leave Bill is anything to go by, the measure before us will take a year to enact. Legislation which could make a big difference to some people's lives can take a long time to pass through the House because we sit on it. That is a shame. It is a pity that the Government cannot meet its own schedule for passing this measure. These delays put people off politics because legislation moves at such a slow pace. Dáil reform is needed to speed things up and this is another example of that problem. I realise that this matter is not solely the responsibility of the Ceann Comhairle because we all have a role to play, but the Government parties have a greater role than the Opposition.Fine Gael is in favour of new legislation to update the provisions for parental leave. I am glad to see that the Government is finally doing something about it. However, the Bill is still inadequate. It does not provide for paid leave, which means only those who can afford to take time off can avail of it. Once again we have proof that the Government favours those who are already favoured. The Minister has not made any attempt to extend the effect of the legislation. It remains a law that will apply only to the middle classes. By not giving paid parental leave, we are putting at a disadvantage the most vulnerable working people in society — those on low wages.This failure on the part of the Government to examine the issue of paid parental leave is particularly galling in light of the fact that it was one of the recommendations of the working group that led to the genesis of the Bill. Much rhetoric was expounded on the Adoptive Leave Act to the effect that the Minister of State could not make decisions without checking back with the working group and the review group. In spite of that, he is unwilling to take on board the recommendation from the review group in this regard. The Minister of State appears to have had a change of heart.While we welcome the Bill and what it will achieve, I remind the Government not to become too smug. We still have a long way to go. A cursory examination of the European context shows us, for example, that Austria has legislated for paid parental leave for up to two years, that can also be taken on a part-time basis. In theNetherlands and Belgium collective agreements provide for additional payments while employees are on parental leave. In Italy, the employer pays 30% of the parent's salary for up to six months. Denmark, Finland, Germany, Luxembourg and Sweden, to name but a few of our other neighbours, all make payments to parents. Even in the United Kingdom, a country that hardly leads the way in this area, parents are entitled to some paid leave.Are our children less important than the children of these countries? Why do we not strive to come anywhere near what is provided in other countries? It has been said that we have come a long way. Such legislation only dates back to 1998. We are part of the European Union and we should be up to speed with the other member states, regardless of the point from where we started. One cannot say on the one hand that we are a great country that is leading the way in Europe while on the other hand say that when it comes to parental leave, we have only recently got our act together and we need more time. That is not good enough. We should aim high. We can do it. It is affordable. We are investing in our children's future.Given the week that is in it, we should realise how important our children are and how much they have been neglected over the years by successive Governments. We now have a chance to go a step further and it would be a shame if we missed this opportunity. We will be competing with other countries who have better provisions in this area. In future our children will be competing with their European counterparts for education and jobs and ours may be at a disadvantage.We will consider amendments on Committee Stage to provide for parental leave benefit, which will be equivalent to an adoptive leave or maternity leave benefit and will have a social welfare credit equivalent. Income levels must be factored into the equation when we consider who can and will avail of these provisions. In the debate on the Adoptive Leave Bill, one argument centred on which parent could take it. Sadly, the Opposition lost that argument. We are sticking to the traditional Irish way of the mother getting it rather than the father.My reading of the Bill under discussion is that either parent can take the leave and they are both entitled to a 14-week period. I accept they are not entitled to share it and that one parent is not entitled to take both periods of 14 weeks as this could create difficulties for employers. I hope to table an amendment to this Bill to make it clear that both parents are entitled to a 14-week period. It is not stated in the Bill or the 1998 Act that they are not entitled to it nor does it state that they are entitled to it. The Bill should not be open to opposite interpretations. I have not heard that this has happened but we should take the opportunity to make it clear that both parents are entitled to parental leave for a period of 14 weeks each.This Bill also represents a lost opportunity for us to re-examine the period of parental leave which stands at 14 weeks. Perhaps it would have been worth the Department's time to examine the issue more closely and suggest an expanded period of leave or even one that could be taken over a longer period but in smaller increments, such as one or two days a week. Parental leave can be taken for a half day or one day a week if employers agree with employees. It is very much down to employers.The Bill presents us with a chance to include a guarantee of greater flexibility. It states that there should be consultation and everyone should do their best, but I am not sure if that is strong enough to get the point across that we expect employers, where at all possible, to be more flexible. Unless a person wants to take six weeks at one time, it might be easier for employers if the leave were taken incrementally. I am aware of examples of where leave was taken in this way and it appears to have been of benefit to both the employer and the employee. It was less disruptive on the workplace. I accept it is up to employers and employees to work this out but we could be more prescriptive in the Bill.The National Women's Council is calling for the introduction of 18 weeks' paid parental leave benefit for parents of children under the age of five to be paid at the same rate as maternity benefit. This is the view of experts in that area. We should take on board such views and the views of those directly affected. It is their job to call for the optimal arrangement and we should go some way to achieving what they seek. The Bill does not go far enough in terms of meeting this goal.It would be interesting if research were to be conducted, either by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform or one of its agencies, to establish how many people are aware of their rights under the Parental Leave Act 1998 and how many of them have availed of them to date and to what extent. Given that parental leave is a relatively new feature of law, people who have taken such leave would be very valuable in terms of the feedback they could offer to the Department.It is difficult to get information on this area. Does a review group exist which compiles research and information? If so, I would be pleased to read its conclusions. If such a group does not exist, perhaps one should be set up. Undoubtedly, there are people who were not able to avail of their rights under this legislation, for economic reasons, either because they could not afford to take unpaid leave or because there may have been pressure from their employers not to take it. We have no data on this, however, and to my knowledge, no effort has been made to gather any.Some employers may put pressure on employees not to take parental leave which is their due or, worse, may seek to penalise employees who do. For this reason I welcome the provision in section 9 to amend the 1998 Act with a view to strengthening the rights of employees in this regard. It is important that employees are clear on their entitlements and that they do not suffer any consequence in terms of their job security or prospects, although they will suffer financially during that period. I am not convinced that enough people know about their entitlements, especially first-time parents. I accept there is an onus on people to inform themselves about their rights but it is evident from talking to people that they are not always up to date with such information. There is an onus on us to advertise these facts more widely and to make the issue clearer to people. Employers are unlikely to rush to tell people they are entitled to take time off. If it does not suit them, they may well keep quiet about it, which is understandable. Why would they advertise something that could impact negatively on them?I also welcome section 5, in which there is provision for parents who become ill when they are due to take parental leave. It is only common sense that such people should not be forced to take parental and sick leave concurrently and this amendment of section 10 of the 1998 Act will serve parents. It is a pity that a similar provision could not have been incorporated in the Adoptive Leave Bill. My Labour Party colleague will no doubt point that out again.The Bill proposes to increase the age limit under section 2 from five to eight. Many people to whom I have spoken already thought it had been increased to six as there had been some discussion on it back in 2002 and it was among the recommendations of a review group. It appears that some employers had allowed for parental leave for children up to the age of six years. It is great that this was so, although it was not official. Increasing the age from five to eight is not a big jump. Is there any reason we cannot increase the age even further, up to the age of 12 or while the child is in primary school? Perhaps there is some research about which the Minister of State has not informed the House as to why the age should not be increased past eight years.Primary school would be a good cut-off point to give parents more flexibility to be with their children at vital times in their lives. The first five years of a child's life are the most vulnerable. The primary school years are very important. A recent report shows that a child's life is greatly influenced in its first three years, during which time it should receive all the love, tenderness and care he or she needs from his or her parents and as many people in the community as possible. It is not for the sake of it that this House is making it possible for parents to take leave because the results of many studies show that children benefit from spending as much time as possible with their parents and families. We are enacting this legislation for them. The provisions are slightly awkward for employers but we must have a proper balance in life. As I stated last week during the first part of my speech, the balance is often tipped in favour of the employer rather than the family, including the child.I am glad to have been able to say a few words on this Bill. Fine Gael will be tabling amendments on Committee Stage as there is still much to discuss. I ask that the Bill not be shelved for eight months to a year, as was the case with the Adoptive Leave Bill, and that it be passed quickly. We can discuss it properly on Committee Stage and deal with the amendments in a fair manner if leeway is granted on both sides.

The Bills with which we have been dealing in conjunction with the Minister and the Department all concern the balance of work and family life, the economy, society and family.We sometimes forget that clichés emerge from very obvious evidence. The cliché pertaining to the family is that it is the cornerstone of society — it is. I am not certain that the family is as it once was because the nature of family units is changing but recognising change and difference is good for society and broadens our attitudes. Given the publication of the Ferns report this week, a movement away from the type of society it depicted must be welcomed greatly.The first time I was approached as a public representative on parental leave was five years ago. At that stage, I was asked about the exact position thereon, whether progress would be made and who would be entitled to such leave. As one might well imagine, the person who asked me was a very young mother. Since then, we have all been asking how many weeks' leave parents will be allowed, whether they will be paid and if a certain age range will apply.It struck me in the past week or two, while I was awaiting the introduction of this Bill, that the mother in question now has a five-year-old daughter in school. She has manoeuvred her working life around that child and works five mornings per week, sometimes starting exceptionally early to finish before the child comes out of school. She does so without any State support, good, bad or indifferent. Summer time is a nightmare for her in that she must work to keep a roof over her head while her five-year-old is on holidays. During the summer holidays, not only does she juggle work and home life but she also must find some activity for the child. That is really what this legislation is about — it is about how we value society and, in doing so, ensure people can operate within it and be respected for the choices they make.I note what Deputy English said regarding the Adoptive Leave Bill. It was proposed to change the Adoptive Leave Bill to include some of the elements of the Parental Leave (Amendment) Bill 2004 but we were told this could not be done, although the latter Bill contains what we sought in the former. Those who are in the process of adoption or who have a child placed with them can actually avail of this legislation. It seems incredible that the same Department and draftsman could have produced the two Bills and yet not realise they were interconnected. As a result, the Adoptive Leave Bill was defective while the Parental Leave (Amendment) Bill is narrow and restrictive.Ireland is not a poor country but the best performing economy in Europe.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	243	However, on considering any of our public services one would be hard pressed to convince anyone of that fact. There are overcrowded classrooms, schools in which the roofs are falling in, schools with temporary accommodation for the past 21 years and accident and emergency units bursting at the seams. We do not have enough general practitioners, nor do we have a proper primary care system in place, yet we are introducing a parental leave Bill that is so restrictive that it represents the very minimum in terms of what we are allowed to do under the EU directive. We could not have done less. The EU directive gives us considerable scope in that it allows national governments to make decisions on who can avail of parental leave and for how long, time limits on children and the types of families that can benefit. However, this Government chose to do the least possible to ensure it complied with the directive.I know the opposing arguments because I have heard them so often. IBEC will say this legislation will ruin employers and that it uncompetitive — it is all about being competitive. The debate on the price of housing, immigration and the protection of workers is all about being competitive. It is argued that we cannot adopt certain measures because they will make us uncompetitive but, in this regard, one should consider the case of our nearest neighbour and greatest competitor, the United Kingdom. I discovered a Bill, to be enforced in the United Kingdom, to allow for 39 paid weeks' parental leave from 1 April 2007. Either parent can take it but it is very much directed at fathers or, as is stated in the explanatory notes, the father or person the mother wishes to be the carer of the child. It could be the spouse, partner or otherwise, and does not necessarily have to be the natural father. This form of legislation presents no great burden on employers as the employer pays the paternity leave and is allowed to recoup the cost through the tax system from the Exchequer. Eventually, three years after the introduction of the 39 weeks' paid leave, the United Kingdom will allow for 52 weeks' leave.In France and Germany, one can avail of three years' leave, while one can avail of 52 weeks in Denmark. These countries are our competitors. As the Taoiseach tells us regularly, they are our neighbours and partners in a community and single market, yet we are offering the women of Ireland far more limited leave. If one examines the statistics and research carried out on behalf of the Minister's Department, one will note that 84% of the leave taken to care for children is taken by women, irrespective of its being force majeure leave or maternity leave.This is a restricted Bill that ensures women will spend the next eight years of their children's lives juggling as I have outlined. According to research undertaken by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, employers said that giving people extra time to care for their children created a happier, more satisfied workforce. That is very important when it comes to employing someone.I hope employers will be flexible on this issue because the Bill is not. It states that one must take the leave in six-week lots. One must be very careful and people will probably wait until children start school and take the leave over two summer periods. That is not the aim of parental leave. It is intended to ensure that one has rounded, well developed children who can find their way in the world and be an asset to the country as adults.I do not know when becoming a mother became the most stressful time in a woman's life. There are cross children and mothers who are alone, do not have help but do have all sorts of stresses. Normally it should be the happiest time in a woman's life and one of great celebration. Instead, from the time the child is born the mother worries about who will mind the child and how she will manage because she cannot give up work because the mortgage must be paid. It is an extremely stressful time in a woman's life. I am sure it is for men too although I cannot imagine what goes on in the workings of any man's head. Men claim not to understand women. To me, men are a far greater mystery, or maybe they are not. Perhaps nothing at all goes on in their heads.This is a stressful time for families. In his speech in the Seanad the Minister of State referred to work-life balance. The buzz words and sentiment exist but the action is missing. He spoke about an increased number of child care places and ensuring that people have choices. This is the most restrictive and limited choice I have ever seen for women and the care of children. If the Minister of State is serious about ensuring that children are well cared for, he should not start from here. The Bill is restricted and worryingly minimalist.We will have to come back and sort out the legislation, as happened in the case of the Adoptive Leave Bill, because parents will demand it. Society will demand it when we discover the effect of this on our children. We must examine the Bill seriously on Committee Stage. Having seen this Minister of State pilot two previous Bills through the House, I am under no illusion that any of our amendments, except the technical ones, will be considered.It concerns me that because the review group did not reach consensus on certain issues, those issues were not taken on board. Only those issues on which consensus was reached were included in the Bill. The legislation is welcome in many ways, for example, accepting that a parent can fall ill before, during or almost at the end of parental leave and can take that sick leave separately. That provision is not included in the Adoptive Leave Bill. Under that Bill, if one becomes sick, one cannot return to the adoptive leave but must forgo the balance of that leave.The Bill is interesting, if restricted, but many await it, such as the woman whom I described who heard the clock ticking and knew that if we did not pass this Bill, her child would be eight and she would not be entitled to avail of the leave. There will be much work to do on Committee Stage which will provide interesting debate.Once this Bill moves into the public domain various groups will lobby us, such as the National Women's Council which has produced an excellent document on it. Childminders of Ireland met Members. All this legislation is societal. It is not confined to children, mothers or fathers but deals with the society in which the Minister of State and I must live in our old age. When we reach that point, the children of whom we speak will be adults. I wonder how they will reflect on what we have done.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	244	I wish to share time with Deputies Catherine Murphy, Healy and Costello.Why has it taken so long for this legislation, which seeks to implement a commitment made under Sustaining Progress, to come before the Dáil? The term of that agreement is now over. Negotiations on a new agreement were due to start soon. What is the point of commitments and partnership agreements if these commitments are not met within their timeframes? It is no wonder unions are more reluctant than ever to enter partnership when they must wait this long for the implementation of such meagre commitments.This Government lacks an overall vision as to how children should be cared for. Instead, this issue is considered from an impersonal business and economic perspective, namely, what to do with the children while their parents perform their duties as cogs in the economic machine. Progress on the work-life balance occurs at a pace dictated by shadowy figures within IBEC.The problem is that leave entitlements and child care policies are not driven by a vision of the kind of society we want to create. Parental care must be a key element of a child care strategy. We must work to enable parents, where it is their preference, to care for their children in the early years of their lives. This is in the interests of children and parents. Proper parental leave legislation is important to help workers achieve a balance between work and family life. It also plays an important role in an overall child care strategy. This Government has not grasped the extent to which parental leave can be used to alleviate the child care crisis.According to the MORI-MRC survey carried out as part of the review carried out by the maternity leave working group established in 2001, almost 7% of the labour force were eligible for parental leave in 2001 but only 20% of eligible employees were estimated to have taken up the parental leave. This very low take-up rate should be of concern to the Government. If the Government was genuinely committed to parental leave and believed in its benefit for both children and parents it would promote it and seek to encourage maximum take-up.According to the MORI-MRC survey, employees rated spending more quality time with their children as the biggest advantage in taking parental leave, while the biggest disadvantage was the lack of payment. Clearly, the absence of a payment in respect of parental leave is the primary factor in the lack of take-up. Why then is the Government not amending the legislation to introduce payment in respect of parental leave? This is the biggest barrier to take-up of the leave. It is also the case that the current situation favours the better off who can afford to take the leave. I agree with the contributions by the two previous speakers in this regard. It is of no value to low income families for whom it would be unimaginable to forego income for the duration of the leave.The failure to introduce payment in respect of parental leave in this State contrasts with the situation in many other EU member states such as Austria, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy, Luxemburg and Sweden. Why is this State so backward? Is it because of the excessive influence of business on Government policy?The research I referred to also found that employers considered that the biggest advantage of parental leave to them came from happier, more contented employees. The inability of workers to achieve work-life balance and the failure of the State to enable them to achieve this is a growing cause of workplace stress. This is ultimately bad for business, employers and workers.The review group report stated that paternity leave should be dealt with as part of the Parental Leave (Amendment) Act but this Bill does not deal with it. It is quite incredible that in this day and age there is no legal entitlement to paternity leave, paid or unpaid, in this State. A new father cannot take as much as one day off when his child is born. This is truly scandalous and I find it hard to understand how the Government can stand over this situation, though I should not be surprised since it is the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Fahey, who has responsibility for the equality portfolio. Never was a person more unsuited to an equality portfolio.I am not interested in hearing waffle from the Minister of State regarding why we cannot do this because of social partnership. Ireland ranks bottom of the list in terms of paternity leave. Most countries in the EU offer paid paternity leave, from two days in Spain to two weeks in France, while in Norway new fathers are entitled to a full four weeks. Fathers north of the Border are entitled to two weeks' paternity leave yet in this State adjoining the North there is no entitlement.This situation simply cannot be allowed to continue. My party is demanding the immediate introduction of two weeks' paternity leave. This is the minimum to which fathers should be entitled. We are talking about very little time. Given that most families nowadays only have two children, we are talking about ten days twice in a lifetime. These days are nevertheless vital to allow fathers to offer necessary support to mothers in the first days of their children's lives and in giving fathers the time to bond with their children. We should be facilitating fathers playing an active role in their children's lives. Are we to persist in being backward in regard to this because IBEC does not like the idea of paternity leave? This is a scandal.The element of greater flexibility in how parental leave can be taken is to be welcomed, though it does not go far enough. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions is proposing that the legislation be amended to provide employees with a right to request more flexible parental leave arrangements and to oblige employers to seriously consider the request and further provide that refusal of the employee's request should only be permitted where the employer can provide evidence of a compelling business case for refusals. This is an eminently reasonable proposal to which I would expect the Government to accede. Ordinarily I would expect that, but unfortunately, given the two previous Bills handled by the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, I doubt if the proposal will be accepted.With regard to force majeure leave, workers who are in same sex relationships should be entitled to that leave from their employers in the event of serious illness to their partners the same as other couples. Sustaining Progress has committed that “steps necessary to give effect to the issue of force majeure leave for same sex partners will be addressed.” It is unacceptable that this Bill fails to fulfil that commitment. Force majeure also needs to be extended to deal with other situations where parents must leave work where issues arise regarding children and child care. Given the time constraint I will deal with this issue in greater detail on Committee Stage.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	245	The most telling lines in the explanatory memorandum for this legislation read as follows:As parental leave is unpaid, this cost will not be significant. There will be benefits for employers and industry. The legislation will facilitate the increased participation and retention of women in the workforce.That gives us an insight to the basis of the legislation. The provision alone should not be read as a family-friendly initiative. While increasing parental leave is a first step in the right direction, the Parental Leave (Amendment) Bill has quite a negative feel to it. While it purports to protect new parents from being penalised for taking time off to care for their children, it does not provide for adequately flexible child care and parental leave options and does not provide additional financial assistance.If the Parental Leave Bill is truly intended as a family friendly document it should tackle the cause of the increase in the numbers of late pregnancies. Looking at some of the documentation in the British Medical Journal, for example, and the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, there has been a major increase in the number of women delaying their pregnancies beyond the age of 35.It is important to consider such studies when we look at how policy is affecting the longer-term costs. It is easy to calculate what leave of ten or 20 weeks will cost in today's terms but when one looks, for example, at the increase in the incidence of high blood pressure and diabetes in women in the post-35 group, and certainly those over 40, a health care cost is involved, and a cost to the individual. Our lack of understanding of why people are choosing to postpone pregnancies until much later has a long-term consequence with which we are not adequately dealing.We need a strategy for dealing with families. While we have a reputation for being a family friendly country, it is difficult to see where our policies tie in with that reputation. Most families now have only two children — the average being a little above that, so over the employment lifetime of perhaps 40 or 50 years we are talking of quite a small cost for this particular initiative. There is no reason why there should not be a payment in respect of that.One of the most stressful times for people is when a new baby arrives. Due to the costs of accommodation, commuting and furnishing homes, people often postpone having babies until their financial environments are less pressurised. However, late pregnancies can bring risks including Down's syndrome, the incidence of which among children of 30 year-old mothers is one in 1,000 but one in 30 in the case of 45 year-old mothers. Ways should be explored to ensure workers who take time off to care for children are not penalised and the role of families should be re-considered.When I was a member of the Commission on the Family during the mid-1990s, my eyes were damaged from the amount of material I was required to read. The financial pressures on society has changed vastly in the ten years since that commission finished its work. We need to move on by understanding the influence of public policy on the choices people make. Yesterday, during discussions with the Committee on Finance and the Public Service, members of Congress noted the significant increases that will apply to the cost of pensions if the birth rate does not increase. Issues such as these need to be factored into long-term planning. Finances currently dominate the choices that people make because the Government is trying to resolve issues on the cheap.We are out of kilter with most European countries in terms of parental leave payment, which should be a given in any genuinely family friendly society. I hope the Government will take the opportunity on Committee Stage to put forward amendments to that aspect of the Bill because, in the absence of payments, opportunities are limited to the small number of people who can afford to take time off.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	246	Striking a balance between work and family life is an important policy objective at national and European levels and was the intention behind the 1998 Act and this legislation. The impetus for the original legislation came from a 1996 EU directive, while the Bill before us arose from the Sustaining Progress review group on parental leave. I welcome certain provisions in this Bill, such as the increase in the age of eligible children from five to eight years, the extension of parental leave entitlements to persons acting in loco parentis and the opportunity to take parental leave in separate blocks. However, the Bill merits further examination on Committee Stage.Even at this late stage, I make the case for paid parental leave. There is no doubt that our refusal to pay parental leave is out of line with many of our European partners and limits the take up of such leave, particularly among families on low incomes. During discussions on this matter by the review group, a number of parties including the Equality Authority, the National Women's Council of Ireland and the Irish Council of Trade Unions, recommended that the payment of parental leave be similar to maternal leave benefit. However IBEC claimed that the cost to industry of such a payment would be too high and argued that the payment would put pressure on the social insurance fund. It is odd that €635 million was taken from the fund by the then Minister for Finance in the year these discussions were held. Paid parental leave, the annual cost to the Exchequer of which was estimated annually at between €34 million and €78 million, could be easily covered by the social insurance fund. Even given that updated estimates will need to be made, the cost will not be huge. The issue should be re-visited while this Bill passes through the Oireachtas.The issue of paid parental leave should be considered in the context of the general Government balance. I tabled a question to the Minister for Finance ten days ago asking him to indicate the general Government balance, in other words, the Government surplus, on revenue account for the past eight years. The Minister indicated in his reply that, on a cumulative basis, there was €39 billion of a Government surplus over those years. In 2004 alone, there a surplus of €6.7 billion.I made the point previously, and I make it again, that those surpluses should be used to prioritise the provision of human services in the areas of health, education, housing and parental leave. The most important infrastructure a country has is its people. A well educated, well housed and healthy population is vital for future development in society. Those surplus balances are being used to build roads and bridges, in other words, for capital projects.In any other modern western European country, it would be good economics and the norm for capital infrastructural projects to be funded through borrowing. It is in order for us to engage in prudent borrowing, the repayments on which we would be well able to meet and the normal EU rules in this regard with which we would be well able to comply. We could easily fund those capital projects from borrowing rather than from the Government surpluses we have had over recent years and will continue to have into the future. All that is lacking to provide for the payment for parental leave is the political will to do so. I ask the Minister of State to review this area and to deal with it on Committee Stage.A number of areas are covered in the Bill, including the one to which I just referred, that need to be addressed. Echoing what Deputy Lynch said, it appears that none of the issues which were raised but not agreed by the review group has been brought forward in this legislation. The service requirement eligibility for parental leave is a year's service in the same employment. I had hoped that the service requirement would have been removed or that service in a number of employments would have been taken into consideration. That point was made previously by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Equality Authority and the National Women's Council of Ireland.There is provision in the 1998 Act, and that provision remains unchanged under this Bill, whereby an employer can postpone parental leave. That provision should be changed. Most of the authorities, including State agencies, have indicated that they believe that should be the case. There are other anomalies in the legislation, namely, that an employer has the right to terminate parental leave, although the legislation states that it would be done after consultation with the employee. However, effectively, an employer can, on an arbitrary basis, terminate parental leave. That should not be possible. If this is proposed, the decision should be made by some independent agency such as a rights commissioner.While I welcome the Bill it does not go far enough. It does not address the provision of payment for parental leave. I referred to the question of service requirement, an employer's right to terminate parental leave and that an employee cannot avail of parental leave twice in a 12-month period. Those areas need to be examined and dealt with on Committee Stage, and I look forward to that being done.

Child care related matters have always been given high priority. The majority of members of the community have supported any initiatives taken over the years in the area of child care and to improve matters for children and for parents. Given the major changes that have taken place in the make-up of the workforce over the past decade or so, the need for new initiatives has taken on much greater significance and a much higher profile in the hierarchy of priorities for individual politicians and also political parties.In the period from 1975 up to now, the number of women in the workforce has more than doubled and now stands at 480,000. That development has generated a specific need and there is a much greater need for child care assistance and services now than in the past. This need has been generated by social changes which everybody accepts. Changed work patterns and arrangements such as people commuting long distances have led to identifying a need in this area. In addition to that, there are also the needs that existed in this area, such as the need for maternity leave and related matters and the need to provide care for children with special needs. We are trying to deal with some of these.The needs in some of those child related services is obvious but they have not been met, despite efforts through tax benefit inducements to provide crèches and so on. There is great potential for introducing new initiatives and for innovative thinking in the provision of those services. Most of us would argue that there is a need to present a variety of solutions. For example, four or five measures can constitute a package of provisions. The obvious ones, including the provision of additional money to cater for the needs of children under five years of age, were mentioned. Such a scheme may not be easy to administer because of a tradition here that the State does not take back anything it has given. I cannot envisage parents being told that when their child is five, they will no longer be given such money. However, that is a matter for others to work out.There is much legislation relating to child care. I refer to the 1998 Act, which this Bill amends, which specifically implements aspects of the EU directive on parental leave. Deputy Lynch referred to the Adoptive Leave Act 2004 and the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Act was introduced around the same time. There are other legislative measures dealing with child care sponsored by various Departments such as the Department of Finance, the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Education and Science or the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Is it time a consolidation Bill to deal with child care services was introduced? It could deal with the services I mentioned and others that are required. All these matters are on the same topic. Deputy Catherine Murphy referred to the cost of accommodation after the birth of a child and other costs, and there are changes that may have to be made. There is a range of issues involved.Given the various items of legislation affecting more or less the same topic, it is confusing when a constituent comes seeking advice on his or her entitlements. I am aware that there are reams of information sheets available. Without being critical of those supplying the advice, it remains complicated. We need to examine and simplify such advice. Child benefit is under the remit of the Department of Social and Family Affairs, tax incentives are under the remit of the Department of the Finance and health care is under the remit of the Department of Health and Children. Those of us who were members of health boards found that in the case of young people with special needs, the greatest impediment to making progress for the past 20 years or more was the split between the Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children and the reluctance of either to accept full responsibility until ordered to do so by the Supreme Court. We should have grasped that nettle much earlier and allocated the responsibility, under legislation, to a particular Department.In the area of child care, we could do much more. One of the three primary objectives of the Bill, out of the eight listed, is the raising of the maximum age of an eligible child from five to eight years. I expect Opposition members to say the age limit should be higher and will suggest examples such as the cut-off date for primary education or the teens. It is a progressive step. As far as I am aware, it was the level recommended by the working group set up to review the 1998 Act. I stand open to correction but I believe that is correct.The second important objective is that of raising the age of an eligible child with disability to 16 years of age. All of us in the public arena are aware of the extra duties, responsibilities and stresses that usually result from catering for a child with special needs. It is important to give recognition to it. We should factor in means to deal with those extra pressures in all legislation enacted. When people were becoming more aware of the environment in general, it was suggested that the legislation be proof read to see how it affected the environment. The same needs to be done in this area in respect of special needs cases, not in a patronising but rather in a practical way.The third major change, to which previous speakers referred, is the extension of parental leave entitlements to persons acting in loco parentis in respect of an eligible child. It was important that this change took place. None of these changes need to be looked at in the negative. The Bill provides for five other changes but I shall not deal with those at present.I appeal to employers to give cognisance to the thinking behind the Bill and to realise that it need not be a burden but reflects the reality of modern life. They should also realise that it can benefit them in terms of retention of skilled employees, employee goodwill, reduced absenteeism and so on. Many years ago I argued a case for a social and sports committee in a particular industry. An otherwise excellent CEO made the comment, when I raised the issue of funding and mentioned morale, that one cannot bank on morale. I quickly pointed out that he was technically correct but that one can certainly bank the results of good morale. I ask employers to look at the Bill in that regard and they can take initiatives further than the basic requirements.To those who have argued against Europe and Ireland's involvement therewith in recent years, I must point out that a great part of the good social legislation on the Statute Book comes directly from EU directives. Some of the good conditions in society came about as a result of such directives. That aspect should be considered in any discussion on participation within the EU.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	250	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important progressive social legislation. As Deputy Dennehy reminded the House, while the Bill proposes to amend the Parental Leave Act 1998 it proposes also to implement the EU directive on parental leave. I agree with him that were it not for the EU we would be very far behind in the area of social protection legislation. The Bill arises from ongoing agreements between the social partners and the Government and further endorses the ongoing relationship between the two in respect of good governance. The Bill is one of many necessary elements of the renewal and review of certain aspects of employment legislation and aims to further reconcile work and family life and to promote equal opportunities between men and women. It forms an additional part of progressive social legislation which in the current climate is important. While it is a short Bill the implementation and policing particularly of sections 7, 8 and 9 will be critical for its success.The Bill has developed from the efforts of a working group established in 2001 to review the operation of the Parental Leave Act. The group identified 18 issues for consideration in the course of the review. These included paid parental leave, paternity leave, duration and manner in which leave may be taken, age limits, broadening entitlement and several issues around force majeure leave. The group reached consensus on a number of issues and made ten agreed recommendations.The most important of these recommendations are to increase the maximum age limit of an eligible child to eight years or to 16 in the case of a child with a disability; to comply with disability legislation there is probably a good case to be made for increasing the age limit to 18; to introduce a statutory entitlement to take the 14 weeks parental leave in separate blocks; and to allow an employee who is unable to care for a child on becoming ill to suspend the period of parental leave. These are significant areas of agreement and they must be welcomed. There are some particular areas of the legislation on which I wish to comment. Much of the impetus for the legislation is to better improve the work-life balance in Ireland. Research carried out by the working group highlighted that employees rated spending more quality time with their children as the biggest advantage in taking parental leave. At the same time, employers considered that the biggest advantage of parental leave to them came from happier, more contented employees. It follows, therefore, that the reconciliation of the work-life balance is important to workers and employers. In the case of employers, the difference is they will have to pay for it and, in my experience, are reluctant to do so.We are striving to develop measures that reflect the reality of modern life, that reflect the reality of the modern workplace. In these measures, the personal and social responsibilities of employees should be taken into account. Achieving a greater work-life balance involves giving people the autonomy to determine their own working lives and to manage them in a way that is more flexible and more suitable to their needs. In making parental leave more flexible, this legislation certainly improves the position and, therefore, I welcome it. In saying that, however, some areas need to be examined further.I am disappointed the working group as a whole could not agree on the issues of paid parental leave, and I am not alone in this. By not giving paid parental leave we are disadvantaging some of the most vulnerable in society, namely working people and especially working mothers. Deputies English, Penrose and I were members of the child care working group of the National Economic and Social Forum which grappled with the issue and we came across the same reluctance on the part of employers in particular about extending this measure.

#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	260	From experience in dealing with parents in my constituency, I can see that it is mostly mothers who are put at risk of not being able to take advantage of parental leave. As studies carried out in other countries have shown, the availability of parental leave for the first year of a child's life makes economic sense. For example, it has been clearly shown that women who are allowed to spend the first year of a child's life at home are more likely to return full time to the workforce, whereas when women are forced to leave the workforce it results in a major loss to the economy. This is why I look forward to the enlightened measures I have no doubt the Government will introduce in the area of child care, which will make provision for people to stay at home with their children and not be financially disadvantaged.Furthermore, people on low incomes will not be able to take unpaid leave. Who can afford to take time off without pay when they are on a low income? How could a single parent avail of parental leave without pay? We are serious about giving leave, but taking leave at one's own expense may be prohibitive in many instances. There is maternity leave and maternity payment. We introduced carer's benefit to go with carer's leave and it has been successful. On this issue, we have to start somewhere. As a Government, it is time to look at other measures and treat further development seriously.Paternity leave is very much hit or miss. It is widely available within the public service but limited in terms of the number of days for which it can be taken, usually three days. It is good that it exists but we should consider some form of paid paternity leave for all workers. We need to recognise the role played by fathers in parenting. Paternity leave offers crucial recognition of the caring role of fathers. It facilitates the possibility of bonding between fathers and their children, and provides the opportunity for fathers to offer essential support to mothers at a time when they and their babies are at their greatest need. Fathers should be paid to give that type of support. I ask for consideration to be given to five days paid paternity leave. It would be welcomed by all fathers, by all families and by all political parties.Today, one of the most important issues of concern to parents relates to the management of their child care and the working day. The attempt to combine these two responsibilities creates great difficulties for parents. It would therefore be a mistake to consider any work-life balance initiatives without addressing the availability and cost of child care. The difficulties associated with the cost of child care have been pointed out many times in this House. To many families, the cost is like another mortgage. People find themselves going into debt even though it might be a short time before their children start school. It is a significant burden that is making life particularly difficult for many young couples.The Government's policy to increase the supply of quality child care is the way that offers parents the greatest choice. In 1997, there was a serious shortage of such places and shortages still remain. However, the Government has set itself the task of addressing this through the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000 — 2006. This is a substantial programme and its scale demonstrates that it is the first Government to recognise the need for the State to act in this area in a meaningful way. It is time for this discussion to move beyond the narrow concept of child care as a means of facilitating labour force participation by women, to a more inclusive understanding where the central focus is on child development and where care and education are inextricably linked.We must realise that while we have raced ahead and created a working economy, we have failed to ensure that a fundamental part of infrastructure, namely, the care and education of young children, matches our economic progress. This is particularly the case in terms of the infrastructure required to support the many working parents who form a necessary part of the workforce.A few suggestions for improvements in this area would be to better co-ordinate policy for early childhood care, where services are patchy and often delivered in an unco-ordinated fashion. For example, as we point out in our document, seven Ministers or Ministers of State currently share responsibility for child care. It is time to consider appointing a single authority to assume responsibility for this area. There is a need for a wider involvement of parents, families and communities in this area and to acknowledge formally the role of parents in the child care sector. The possibility of establishing partnerships with the business sector needs to be considered. The business sector is aware of the value early childhood education plays in the longer term.Some people find themselves out of the house from early morning to late evening with no time spent with the children. Therefore, anything that can be done through primary or secondary legislation to make it easier for parents to be involved in the upbringing of children must be welcomed, particularly ensuring that children are given the basic skills to go on to live a successful life.Progressing the work-life balance agenda presents a complex set of challenges for policymakers, employers, employees and families alike. These challenges, both social and economic, do not necessarily merge into situations acceptable to all stakeholders, and in this regard I am thinking specifically of paid parental leave. However, it is important that we do everything we can to ensure that working families and children benefit from the great contribution they are making to our economy today and that people will continue to stay in the workplace. For these reasons I commend this Bill to the House.

#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	263	I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill. While I welcome some areas of the Bill, some areas cause concern. Over the years the Government has been reluctant to consider extending parental leave. In its rush to put financial capital before social capital the area of parental leave and parental issues has been neglected in the past eight years. During campaigning for the by-elections earlier this year and the local elections last year members of the Government parties and others discovered that child care represents a major issue. Following the uproar caused by the introduction of tax individualisation, the Government rushed to patch up some of the damage it caused by discriminating against families and homemakers, and creating additional tax credits for home carers. The real problem for homemakers lies in housing policies. The legacy of bad planning and no planning has created a jungle of dispiriting suburbs. Similarly housing inflation has not been tackled condemning many couples to a form of bonded slavery to the banks for decades to come, which further impacts on family life.If the gender equality unit of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform conducted research into the manner in which parental leave has been availed of up to now, taking into account those who are aware of the leave but have not availed of it and those who have done so but feel it could be improved, the Government would gain more insight into real life than just taking the views at the doorsteps every few years. Quality of life issues do not come within the ambit of the Government's mindset except as something that might be bought at a convenience store.The same sad legacy is all too apparent in the case of parental leave. The Government made a commitment in Sustaining Progress to strengthen parental leave in line with the recommendations of the social partners, which was supposed to have been delivered before the end of the last Dáil session. It has now scrambled to pull together some if its caring clothes before the next general election. When the Minister for Finance unveils his budget I am sure parental leave and child care will be very much on his mind. The Government has finally given some acknowledgement that parents exist and are not just cogs in the machine of the economy, and that having more time to spend with their children might be good for society as a whole.However, there is a sting in the tail of the Bill. Other speakers have spoken about the missed opportunity to introduce paid leave, a glaring omission that takes all the good out of the Bill, which contains some good provisions. The usual pandering to money can be recognised in the unpaid leave provision. If one can buy one's own free time, one is welcome to it. If one can afford to suspend one's income flow and rely on savings, one is welcome to take time off. Otherwise, one must forget about quality time with one's children, clock in and put up with it. The rush to a Boston model of economic development will pay dividends in due course. However, this kind of dividend is wrong. It will wreck social partnership, create resentment among the lower paid and foster support for radical parties. We are well on the road to an unequal society and despite the Government's efforts, it has failed to convince anybody that it has discovered its caring side. How could it be caring when it is not in touch and cannot remember what it is like to have a social conscience?Let us look at some European examples of child care and parental leave. Austria has paid parental leave for up to two years. The Netherlands and Belgium provide for additional payments while employees are on leave. Italy, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Luxembourg, Sweden and the United Kingdom all provide for some type of subsidy to parents on leave.Over the weekend, Fianna Fáil had its annual Ard-Fheis in Killarney. On Friday, the Taoiseach said his party intends to commemorate 1916 with a military parade but I remind the Minister of State what the Proclamation of Independence says about children. It states the Irish Republic will cherish "all the children of the nation equally". Does this Bill cherish all the children of our nation equally? It does not. How could it when it does not treat all the parents of the nation equally? It creates division among parents by discriminating against those of limited means and those who are financially stretched because of the Government's incompetent housing policies. For such people, the notion of availing of unpaid leave is totally unimaginable because they must pay so much for their house, in terms of their mortgages, as well as other expenses.My party will propose amendments to this Bill on Committee Stage, particularly with regard to parental leave benefit, which would be the equivalent of maternity leave benefit. We will propose a social welfare credit equivalent, since income levels must be taken into account if parental leave is not to be for the rich only. Our amendments will propose to extend benefits from 18 to 26 weeks, which is very important. We will propose the introduction of 18 weeks paid parental leave for parents of children under the age of five, to be paid at the same rate as maternity benefit. We will also seek to establish part-time parental benefit for parents of children up to the age of 11 and to introduce a means-tested parental allowance payment for parents of children under the age of five and under the age of 11. We should work towards the goal of providing one year's leave for either parent, to allow him or her to stay at home to mind children. Although this may take time to implement, it is something we should examine seriously. We are all aware that many school children go home in the evening to find no parent there for them. That is a major problem which can cause many other problems for our society.I urge the Minister of State to consider the amendments my party will be tabling on Committee Stage. They are child and family friendly and will provide a lesson for this Government in implementing meaningful child care policies that will address the pressures on families.There are some positive aspects to the Bill. I welcome the provisions related to sick time, discrimination, dismissal and promotional opportunities. In addition, giving parents the right to take leave in separate blocks will encourage more of them to avail of leave, while the raising of the maximum age of the child for whom the leave applies from five to eight years is also welcome.The issue of parental leave is very closely related to the issue of child care and has been treated in a similar fashion by the Government. If this Bill is enacted in its current form, there will be a rush to amend it when the message comes through at the doorsteps that voters do not like its contents. Just as child care has been ignored over the lifetime of this Government, so too has parental leave. People at the doorsteps will look at this with disdain when the Bill is enacted.Some aspects of the Bill attempt to bring equality to the issue, but overall it is not family friendly. Society is crying out for family friendly policies that will put Ireland on a par with its EU neighbours. In its current form, the most glaring inadequacy in the Bill is the failure to provide for paid leave. In that regard, I would not like to be knocking on doors during the next general election campaign.We should consider the matter of paid leave. We should try to reward our children, support stable, caring homes and foster the next generation of responsible, law abiding citizens.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	264	This Bill shows clearly how out of touch, uncaring and plain stupid this Government is in its continued desire to serve vested interests rather than the general public interest, for the betterment and development of society. The Government is addressing the issue of parental leave in this Bill in a threadbare, bare minimum, bargain basement manner that reflects its general attitude to how we raise children. It is disgraceful that it is presenting such a limited and narrow Bill.This Bill does not go far enough. It sticks to the bare minimum that we are forced to achieve under European regulations of 14 weeks. The Minister of State should double that figure and then come back to the House to see what type of reception he gets.The Bill divides our society by not allowing for paid parental leave, as exists in so many other European countries which do not seem to have a problem in making such provision. The Government is treating the children of this country differently. It is saying to wealthy parents that by all means they can have parental leave because they can afford it. If parents are poor and cannot afford to take parental leave because of a loss of salary, the Government is saying it is sorry it is not for them. There is a disgraceful gap in this legislation. This is an example of how the Government seems to be run by the needs of IBEC and its short-term view of what is good for the economy, rather than by a proper analysis of what is really needed.The Bill provides no real flexibility but rather introduces minor changes in terms of allowing people to take parental leave in blocks. This is only a fraction of what could and should have been achieved if the Government was to take a genuine approach to provide what parents of young children want, which is flexibility. Parents do not want to be back in work as soon as maternity leave ends. They want choices and flexibility to reflect the realities of life with young children. There are occasions when parents have to be at home, if children are sick or there are other problems. There are occasions when parents want to be at home to enjoy those precious early years when their children are developing.This Bill does not go far enough in terms of what it could introduce. I could not agree more with Deputy Carey, who acted as the Government's opposition from its own benches, and made the case for paternity leave so fathers can get involved from the very earliest stage and get to know what it is like to raise children. Fathers could also return to parenting at a later stage if we had a proper parental leave system. This Bill does not go nearly far enough to introduce the changes that parents in this country want. It is a remarkable mistake on this Government's part, at a time when we are beginning to really debate the issue of how we want to raise children, to produce such a narrow, limited and mean Bill.We must look at the experience of parents with young children, at what we want and what they want. They want choice but the Government has restricted choice. Individualisation means that the parent who stays at home and works is disadvantaged to the tune of €5,000 a year as against the parent who does not choose to do this. This is unequal treatment of people who wish to make different parenting choices. It is a remarkable effort in trying to affect the way people raise their children.It is difficult for parents to make choices. It is up to them to choose what is best for their children. Parents may decide it is right for them to go back to work and that their child care arrangements are satisfactory. My experience is that there should be flexibility for parents to be able to make these choices. They do not want to go back to what they have being doing for the past ten or 15 years, working from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. or 6 p.m. and taking the long commute home. While parents with young children may want to continue working, they want flexible arrangements such as part-time working arrangements, term time working arrangements and extensive parental leave, which will allow them to take lengthy breaks and not just continue working, getting home at 8 p.m. and having a short time before putting the children to bed and starting again the following day.The Minister of State should recognise that this is not the treadmill upon which parents want to be. He should provide for the flexibility that would go some way towards providing what parents want. If he does not do so, parents will choose not to stay in the workforce and not to follow the Government or IBEC's wishes, because it does not work. It does not work if parents must work long hours while trying to raise children. People are missing out on the precious things in life. It should not be about competitiveness and nothing else, which is all the Government considers because it knows the value of nothing.The Minister, Deputy Brennan, said recently that we could engage in a Dutch auction in regard to child care facilities. He is correct that we should be careful in this regard. We should begin from the premise that we treat all parents equally in the choices they make. However, the Minister should not make such a statement because, one week later, when the legislation was introduced, the Taoiseach said he was concerned that we were engaged in a race to the bottom. This form of thinking by the Government drags us down to the bottom. The Government is pulling us down to the bottom. In those circumstances, it cannot but be a political issue whereby other parties will say they are sorry, that this is not the type of Ireland they want. We want to follow a European social model that works, gives parents real flexibility and, in the long-term, will be better for the economy. It is a political issue, which the Government got wrong, and I assure the Minister of State that this side of the House will do things differently if in Government.I do not know whether the Minister of State can wake up to this fact on Committee Stage. Yesterday, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform introduced a new Bill on Committee Stage so there is no reason the Minister of State cannot do so. He should wake up, smell the coffee and realise that this Bill does not reflect the modern Ireland and the changes people want. The hope is that the Government will get rid of some of its arrogance, stop listening to one or two vested interests that dominate it and begin planning society on the basis of what is good for people and good for the economy in the long-term. Until the Government does this, there is no hope for it.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	265	I wish to share time with Deputy Keaveney.I welcome the Bill before us today. We in Dáil Éireann should be more aware than anyone that our society is changing and new issues and values are emerging every day. It is our job as legislators to ensure that we produce the best possible response to these changes and leave behind us a legacy of which we can all be proud. There is no need for me to elaborate on the fact that Ireland has changed immeasurably over the past decade or so. We have had to anticipate these changes and challenges to the best of our ability and proceed accordingly.Parental leave legislation can be viewed within this context of change. The family unit is less strictly defined now than in the past and social patterns have changed so that the husband or father is no longer per se the household breadwinner. An increasing number of women are entering the workforce. Their right to work must be both adequately recognised in law and reconciled with their role as potential mothers. In 1976, there were 266,000 women in the workplace and, last year, there were more than 500,000. Females now out-number males in Ireland, 49% of who work. Figures like this cannot be ignored, especially by a Government committed to equality, as this one is. I am pleased, therefore, that we are taking another step forward in the reconciliation of work and family life and the promotion of equal opportunities between men and women.The original Parental Leave Act 1998 represented a new departure in the recognition of both parents' right to work while simultaneously raising a family. The EU directive of 1996, from which it was conceived, leaves member states a great deal of freedom in how they wish to see it implemented. In 1998, when the original Act was being formulated and debated, the two main issues in Ireland were the age limit of the child set within the Bill and whether parental leave would be paid. Today we find ourselves readdressing one of these issues. If the Bill passes through the House, as I am sure it will, a parent will have the right to take leave at any stage up to their child's eighth birthday. This means Ireland will be able to count itself among the select group of member states to have approved the maximum age limit of an eligible child as set down in the original EU directive.Many might argue, and did so in 1998 when the original Parental Leave Act was being debated, that this maximum limit should have been set from the beginning. At the time, the EU directive on parental leave was adopted, Ireland, along with Luxembourg and the UK, were the only EU member states that did not already have some kind of statutory parental leave. This in many ways puts us in an enviable position. We were starting with a fresh canvass, enabling us to put in place a brand new scheme specifically designed for Ireland's needs heading into the 21st century.Perhaps when embarking on this project in 1998, we should have had the foresight and courage to legislate for the maximum age limit. However, the argument that five years was an appropriate age limit, given the fact that most children have started school by then, seemed entirely appropriate at the time. That we are now set to readjust that age limit should not be berated, but praised. Anyone who has spent time studying the issue will know that no two member states have the same arrangements for parental leave, whether it is Sweden, Germany or Britain. Each has developed a model to suit the needs of its own society.A working group established here in 2001 to review the operation of the 1998 Act found that an extension of the upper age limit would benefit children in the formative years from four to eight, and their parents who find that the greatest difficulties balancing work and child care responsibilities occur when their child is of schoolgoing age. We are addressing this issue now. This process of review and amendment is crucial to our role in catering for the needs of the population.The other question that arose in 1998 that will surely come into contention again during the debate on this Bill is whether parental leave should be paid. The 2001 working group failed to reach a consensus on this, therefore, parental leave will remain unpaid. It is obvious to me why this decision has attracted criticism. At the same time, equally convincing is the argument of those representing employers opposing paid parental leave. Employers cannot be expected to pay for two employees to carry out one job, which is effectively what they would do in drafting in a temporary replacement while funding another person's leave.I spoke earlier about the need for progressive legislation. Scandinavian countries such as Sweden and Denmark are renowned for their liberal social welfare structure. They have put in place parental leave, with some form of payment. However, their governments tax heavily to provide for this and to support their social welfare policy. The issue of paid parental leave is difficult to cut through. While I fully understand why it is not being implemented here, I sincerely hope those who contributed to the 2001 working group, particularly the Departments, will continue to grapple with the problem of how to provide financial assistance for those who wish to take parental leave. We should continue to debate this issue and I look forward to further revisions of the Parental Leave Act 1998. We will only be able to improve our system and provide citizens with the best service through review and readjustment.Child care is inextricably linked to this provision. While parental leave is an excellent scheme, child care has a much larger part to play in a child's upbringing. As with housing, for example, the realisation that the pace needed to be stepped up in the provision of child care options dawned late in the day. In 1997, under Partnership 2000, an expert working group on child care was established because changed economic and social conditions and expectations had resulted in more women opting to combine work and family life at a time when the availability of child minders and places in child care centres was contracting. Our economy requires a labour force and, therefore, women who wish to enter the labour market should be facilitated. Insufficient and expensive child care is detrimental to this aim.The Partnership 2000 working group, in a report published in June 2005, found a significant increase in the provision of early or pre-school child care places in recent years. This should be welcomed and highly commended. However, the same report concluded there had not been a parallel increase in the provision of places to cater for the child care needs of schoolgoing children outside of school hours.The legislation extends the upper age limit of children eligible under the Parental Leave Act 1998 in recognition of the difficulties faced by parents balancing family and work responsibilities once their children have reached schoolgoing age. We are faced with a disparity in our approach to child care. The provision of out of school child care needs to be increased to accommodate parents whose working day does not fit the school timetable.The school age child care recommended by the June 2005 report is what the country is lacking but also what it needs. The legislation will give parents further flexibility in their decisions to take parental leave but a well planned system of school age child care services will give them flexibility when they need it in their day-to-day working lives. School age child care has been widely provided throughout mainland Europe for many years. Our neighbours in the United Kingdom have concentrated their efforts in this field and their provision has expanded considerably over the past few years.While the form of provision varies, Ireland is one of the few member states in which it is a relatively new concept and this can be used to our advantage. It gives us the opportunity to formulate a first class range of facilities to suit the needs of Ireland's working parents. There should be no temptation to adopt stop gap or short-term measures to deal with this challenge. This will not work and will not satisfy parents. We need not only to address the current scenario but also to anticipate the future and act accordingly.I welcome recent statements by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs regarding child benefit. I welcome the legislation but I hope, following this Bill's enactment, further action will be taken in the child care sphere, which, one day, will make us the envy of countries, not only in Europe but throughout the globe.
#CeciliaKeaveney	unknown-#CeciliaKeaveney-party	unknown-#CeciliaKeaveney-dob	unknown-#CeciliaKeaveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	266	This Bill is related to the directive adopted in June 1996, the principal objectives of which were the reconciliation of work and family life and the promotion of equal opportunities and treatment in employment between men and women. The directive provided that a minimum of three months should be available to men and women until the child reached a given age up to eight years as defined by the member state. It provided that the leave should be non-transferable between the parents and that employees who availed of parental leave had to be guaranteed a right to return to work and protected against dismissal.The directive also provided that parental leave is distinct from maternal leave, which was available as a statutory right to mothers consequent on pregnancy and child birth, and paternity leave, which is not a statutory entitlement but which many employers grant to fathers when their children are born. In addition to providing for parental leave, the directive provides that workers must be given the right to force majeure leave.The working group established in 2001 reviewed the operation of the Act and identified 18 issues for consideration. These included paid parental leave, paternity leave, the duration and manner in which parental leave may be taken, age limits, broadening the entitlement and several issues relating to force majeure leave.The group reached consensus on a number of these issues and made ten recommendations. The most important of these were to increase the maximum age limit of an eligible child; broaden the entitlement to include persons acting in loco parentis of an eligible child; introduce a statutory entitlement to take 14 weeks parental leave in separate blocks of a minimum of six continuous weeks each; and allow an employee who is unable to care for the child on becoming ill, while on or about to commence parental leave, to suspend the period of leave.The working group recommended that extension of the maximum age limit of an eligible child to eight years would offer working parents a longer timeframe within which the leave might be taken, which was welcome. It also recommended a new provision to increase the maximum age limit to 16 years in the case of a child with a disability, which is a sensible measure that has been awaited by many people.The extension of the parental leave entitlement to persons in loco parentis of an eligible child is important because many children in our society are cared for by persons who are not their natural parents. There is also provision for the extension of the parental leave entitlement to adopting parents, which is important as society evolves.A new entitlement was proposed where a person could choose to take parental leave in two separate blocks, each consisting of a minimum of six continuous weeks. Such flexibility is essential. The two-block entitlement is important because it will allow parents to use their parental leave to care for children during the long school break over several summers. It will still be possible for an employee to avail of the leave in shorter periods of weeks, days or even hours over an extended period if the employer agrees and, in many instances, particularly in the public sector, such flexibility is on offer from employers. Where a parent on parental leave becomes unable to care for a child on account of illness, it may reasonably be concluded that the parent is unable to avail of the parental leave entitlement and should be able to benefit from sick leave for the duration of the illness.These recommendations will lead to an improvement in conditions, which must be welcomed. However, they can only be considered as one part of a package for child care provision. More capital expenditure on child care facilities is needed and the issue of early education must be addressed. During the Fianna Fáil think-in in County Cavan, the issue of child care was linked to early education and it is one of the most important issues.The concept of child care should not be looked on as finding a place for one's child while one is at work but as the beginning of an important phase in the child's life. I am chairman of the Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and delegations repeatedly tell us that the most important phase of a child's development is not between the ages of four and eight, as has been stated by many Members. By the time a child reaches the age of six, 50% of his or her concept of right and wrong has been established. If his or her parents walk, the child will walk; if they play football, the child will play football; if they play musical instruments, the child will probably do so; and if they sit at the computer drinking coffee from one end of the day to the other, the child will consider that the norm.Parental leave is important in its own right and the issue of who pays for it is also important. The question must be asked if such leave is provided so that parents can enjoy the child's first few years or so that they can do so while giving the child the best opportunity to develop. This is at the heart of the debate.It is important that we should discuss social legislation which is accompanied by a social infrastructure. The Government has performed well in the provision of capital infrastructure. Social capital has not caught up with building capital or infrastructural capital investment. From the perspective of a female Deputy, the idea of parental leave can be amusing. One Saturday night a man phoned for a colleague who had gone to hospital to have a baby. When he was told this he replied he would phone back in the morning. How will we arrive at a situation of equal opportunity where all such issues can be ironed out? I would like to work out how parental leave would work in such situations.A woman and a man should each be able to work or remain at home. My father was a chef, did the washing up and spoiled the girls. People assume a man's place is at work and a woman's place is in the home. There should no longer be an assumption that is normal. Either parent can work or both may work. In new Ireland we must recognise new situations.I take the opportunity to point out that Greencastle community child care, Quigley's Point Community Child Care Limited and St. Mary's kinder care and community nursery in Fahan seek community grants under the crèche scheme. I hope the examination of parental leave will expedite the long list of people making applications to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. As a Deputy, one sometimes sees different sections or Departments not communicating effectively. I urge the Minister of State to communicate with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to expedite some of these cases.The cost of provision for consumer and supplier is an issue and I refer to a case study of a person offering private facilities. A key issue that emerged from the think-tank is that parents want to be at home for the first year. That choice should be available. There is no fortune made by private providers and many are making a loss. This is particularly true of those caring for children under the age of one. If possible, maternity should be increased to six months and a mechanism should be found to support the choice of remaining at home for the first year.Music is a facility to develop language, rhythmic co-ordination and many basic skills a child needs. Beyond those already converted, there is little understanding of the serious role music can play in the pre-natal and post-natal stages and up to the age of six. If we are serious about reducing money spent on intervention in schools in respect of dyslexia, dyspraxia, ADD and ADHD, we should examine the role of music for children under six years. There is much international proof that we are failing in our duty not to put it centre stage in early child care.The Lifestart programme intervenes in families throughout the country. It must be funded more centrally and its funding source must be assured. Interventions where people assist parents in the home to cope with a new child are important. One does not receive a handbook with a new child. Some argue the Lifestart programme works better in some areas. In my area it is working particularly well and I urge the Minister of State to make progress on this.I welcome this Bill and its many positive measures. I agree with the need for an overall package to support and cater for children from birth until the stage where they can better deal with themselves. A work-life balance must be struck and employers' and employees' considerations must be taken into account. A happier employee will be a more effective employee. I wish the Minister well on the passage of this Bill and the introduction of necessary supporting legislation.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	267	I am pleased to speak on this Bill. Can Deputy Keaveney state if her colleague received the phone call in the morning? She has told us half the story.I agree with Deputy Keaveney on the importance of music. I have personal knowledge of this through my family and other children. We are beginning to build social infrastructure after decades of focusing on building our capital infrastructure through employment outside the home. We must also value work in the home and the crucial task parents have of rearing children and preparing the next generation.The early years are very important and events in this period can have a major bearing on the later life of the person as a child, a young adult and an adult. In my previous experience as a counsellor I dealt with children's personal difficulties. One technique used was to examine the earliest memories of the child. Invariably, we found that the behaviour of a problematic, troubled child could be traced to the early years. In one instance, a child of 14 who was constantly in trouble at school recalled being left alone at home at the age of two and a half or three years. He spent the day sitting inside the front door crying. Much of his anger could be traced to these times in his life when he felt neglected by his mother. It is important to expand, examine and debate parenting, the role of families and how we can support parents in that crucial role.The take-up of measures introduced in the Parental Leave Act 1998 is approximately 20%. This was the finding of the review of the Parental Leave Act by the Department in 2001. Perhaps this figure has increased since then and I would be interested in the current figures. The Minister of State can address this in his response to this debate.This raises the question why more people do not avail of measures in this Act. Can people not afford it, are they unaware of it or are they discouraged from availing of it? Is the mechanism for application overly bureaucratic? The Minister can provide us with the benefit of his wisdom on this matter. There is no point in a provision on the Statute Book if people are unable to avail of it. It will be interesting to discover the reason for the low take-up of this beneficial measure.A colleague spent three weeks on holidays with his two children. After three weeks in a caravan park in the west, he wanted to go back to work. Entertaining and minding two toddlers for three weeks was really hard work. That is my first point.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	268	My Department provides child income support in a number of ways. The principal support is child benefit, a universal payment which is neutral vis-à-vis the employment status of the child’s parents and does not contribute to poverty traps. Over the period since 1997, the monthly rates of child benefit have increased by €103.51 at the lower rate and €127.78 at the higher rate, increases of 272% and 258% respectively.Child benefit rates now stand at €141.60 per month for each of the first two children and €177.30 per month for the third and each subsequent child. Child benefit is paid to over 530,000 families is respect of over 1,020,000 children.A second child income support is the child dependant allowance, paid in addition to weekly social welfare payments in respect of over 257,000 children at full rate and over 85,000 at half rate. Since 1994, successive Governments have held the rate of child dependant allowances constant while concentrating resources for child income support on the child benefit scheme. It is important to recognise that over that period, the combined weekly value of child benefit and child dependant allowance has increased by more than double the rate of inflation.In addition, my Department provides cash support by way of weekly payments to families at work on low pay through the family income supplement scheme. A number of improvements have been made to the scheme over the years, including assessment of entitlement on the basis of net rather than gross income and progressive increases in the income thresholds, making it easier for lower income households to qualify for payment. As a result, there are currently over 15,800 families receiving a weekly FIS payment, reaching nearly 31,186 children. This is the highest number of FIS recipients in the history of the scheme.The back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme operates from the beginning of June to the end of September each year and is administered on behalf of my Department by the Health Service Executive. This payment is made in respect of a child if the parent is in receipt of a social welfare or health board payment, is participating in an approved employment scheme or attending a recognised education or training course and has household income at or below certain set levels. Under the scheme an allowance is payable in respect of qualified children aged from two years to 22 years.In 2004, over 70,500 applications were approved under the scheme, benefiting some 153,400 children at a cost of €17 million. This year it is expected that the scheme will cost €18 million and that a similar number of children will benefit.The social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, recognised the importance of targeting child income support at low income families with a commitment to examine the effectiveness of current arrangements. The National Economic and Social Council was asked to undertake an examination of the possible merging of family income supplement and child dependant allowance into a second tier child income support. Such a payment would be aimed specifically at targeting child poverty by channelling resources to low income families without creating significant disincentives to employment. The NESC is currently considering its draft report and I look forward to receiving a finalised report shortly, which will be of significant assistance in informing the future direction of child income support policy.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.I have committed myself to finding solutions by making sensible decisions that have at their core increased support for those who feel most vulnerable, neglected or apprehensive in our society, while at the same time working to bring about reforms that go behind the payments and aggressively strike at the very heart of the social issues that give rise to the need for welfare supports in the first place.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	269	I thank the Minister for his response. Has the Minister received the report on the second tier payment? Will he agree that he will not be in a position now to make the necessary changes for the budget and the forthcoming Social Welfare Bill that any such report might suggest? Given that will probably be the case, what are the Minister's plans to introduce a second tier payment in the medium to short term? If he is not in a position to make changes in the budget and the Social Welfare Bill, does that mean these people will have to wait another year before improvements are made? Is the Minister totally dependent on the report from the NESC or has he made any further progress in his Department with regard to making it easier for people to access the back to school clothing and footwear allowance and FIS in particular, given that the uptake of both appears to be quite low? Does he agree with the Combat Poverty Agency that the uptake of FIS is only about 40% of the eligible applicants? Has he any plans to improve that? Is the Minister satisfied that in all Department offices nationwide there are clearly displayed signs indicating the availability of the FIS payment and, if not, will he ensure such signs are put in place in prominent positions?
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	270	I am not dependent exclusively on the NESC report in this regard but it is an important and valuable piece of work. I do not yet have the report from the NESC. I am aware it has to consider some drafts internally at the next meeting of the National Economic and Social Council. As I said in my reply, the policy in this regard will be very much informed by the proposals from NESC. Having said that, it was specifically asked to examine, and I understand it is very much in favour of, some form of an amalgamation of the child dependant allowance and the family income supplement and to target that at that lower level.The Deputy asked whether the people involved might have to wait another year. It does not rule out the Minister for Finance or myself examining in the budgetary context CDA, FIS and back to school clothing and footwear allowance rates, the three major instruments which attack child poverty, which we will do. It may be that we can make some progress towards a second tier while we await the full report from the NESC.As the Deputy is aware, I have instructed all offices to promote FIS in terms of bringing its availability to the attention of the appropriate people. A total of 15,800 families currently receive a weekly payment, which is to the benefit of 31,186 children. I have asked all our outlets throughout the country to promote FIS to a greater extent, and we had a number of mail-shots on it.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	271	The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are in receipt of long-term social welfare or Health Service Executive payments towards the cost of their additional heating needs during the winter season. Fuel allowances are paid currently for 29 weeks from the end of September to the middle of April each year. Some 274,000 households benefit under the scheme at a cost of €85.4 million in 2005. An allowance of €9 per week is paid to eligible households during this 29-week winter heating period. An additional €3.90 per week is paid to about 123,000 people living in the designated urban smokeless fuel zones, bringing the amount payable in those areas to €12.90 per week.In addition to fuel allowance, over 300,000 pensioner and other households qualify for electricity or gas allowances through the household benefits package, payable towards their heating, light and cooking costs throughout the year, at an overall cost of €108.8 million in 2005. As currently structured, these allowances are linked to unit energy consumption so that these people are protected against unit price increases in electricity or gas.There is also a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs. An application for a heating supplement may be made by contacting a community welfare officer at any local health centre.Fuel allowances are a supplementary entitlement payable for part of the year, over the winter heating season. The Government has concentrated budget resources on providing significant real increases each year in all primary social welfare pension, benefit and assistance rates. This is a more costly approach than increasing fuel allowances but it delivers a better outcome for pensioners and others by substantially increasing their income in real terms over the whole year to better assist them in meeting their normal basic living costs.I am keeping the fuel allowance scheme under close review, particularly in the light of the significant fuel cost increases in recent months, and I will consult as necessary with my Cabinet colleagues in this regard.Increases in the rate or duration of the fuel allowance would have significant cost implications. For example, increasing the duration of the fuel allowance by one week would cost just under €3 million per annum. Increasing the fuel allowance by €1 per week would cost €8 million per annum. Given the significant potential extra scheme costs involved, any increase in fuel allowance rates or scheme duration are matters to be examined in the context of the budget and in the light of my plans for increases in social welfare rates generally.Utilising yields from VAT and excise duties on fuel products is a separate matter for my colleague, the Minister for Finance, and for the Government in the context of the budget.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	272	The Minister met the community and voluntary groups, as did I. One of the main items on their agenda was to seek an increased fuel allowance. Does the Minister not agree that, apart from today which is out of the ordinary in that it is the first time since 1969 that a temperature of 20° Celsius has been recorded in late October, a tough winter is predicted? In that case, pensioners will have to face payments of €21 for a cylinder of gas and €15 or €16 for a bag of coal. Is the Minster aware of the 25% increase in gas charges announced in recent weeks as well as ESB price rises and a 21% rise in other fuel costs? While the €9 extra fuel allowance is welcome, it is virtually useless because it has not kept pace with the rate of inflation.There has been an unanticipated windfall for the Revenue from fuel price increases which at the same time diminish the ability of ordinary people, especially the elderly, to purchase fuel for domestic heating. It would be only right for such gains to be given back to those people. It is no use waiting until the December budget to act because it will be too late by then. It would cost an additional €3 million per week to extend the seasonal fuel allowance. Alternatively, the fuel allowance could be increased to €12 per week. The Minister should take either step to look after the elderly.Can the Minister account for the mean-spirited tactic employed by his Department, which withdrew the €9 per week fuel allowance that was previously paid to pensioners living in sheltered accommodation in Dublin's inner city area? It may well have happened in sheltered accommodation in Cork as well. Why was that decision made and what total savings accrued as a result? What sort of mean, penny-pinching officials are at work in the Department who would leave the most vulnerable people exposed in this way? It appears to signify or perhaps even epitomise a change in Government policy that I thought had finished once the former Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, left office and the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Coughlan, had left this portfolio. Is the Minister, Deputy Brennan, now trying to hit the most vulnerable people for the sake of a few measly euro? Is that what it comes down to?
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	273	The Deputy has made a good argument for re-examining the fuel allowance given that it has not been touched for many years and in light of recent fuel price increases. I will examine that closely in the context of the forthcoming budget and the subsequent social welfare legislation. There has been a windfall to the Exchequer from VAT and excise duty arising from fuel price increases, but the Department of Finance will always say that is revenue accruing to the State which must be argued for by all Ministers. It is not necessarily earmarked for or assigned to any one area. It is additional income for the Exchequer, but the Exchequer always has additional outgoings.Fuel allowances were not increased in recent years, principally because successive Ministers decided it would be better to put the money into the main social welfare rate. The latter is paid over 52 weeks while the fuel allowance is seasonal. By increasing the main rate substantially in recent years, people have been left some control through the overall increase in their general income. That policy was accepted by everybody until the recent large upsurge in fuel prices which has forced us to reconsider the matter.As regards the issue of sheltered accommodation, it was through no act on my part other than that the system itself clicked into place. I have sent for the files on this matter. Some 237 people are affected——
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	274	That is right.

I have discovered that those 237 people were in receipt of a fuel allowance to which they were not legally entitled. It was taken away in the ordinary course of events, but I will examine how best I can deal with the issue. I hope to make an announcement on it shortly.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	276	The requirement to be habitually resident in Ireland was introduced as a qualifying condition for certain social assistance schemes and child benefit with effect from 1 May 2004. It was introduced in the context of the Government's decision to open the Irish labour market to workers from the new EU member states without the limitations being imposed at that time by many other member states. The effect of the condition is that a person whose habitual residence is elsewhere is not paid certain social welfare payments on arrival in Ireland, regardless of citizenship, nationality, immigration status or any other factor.The European Commission wrote to the Government on 22 December 2004 raising a number of issues concerning its compliance with EU law on workers and their families. Officials from my Department and the Attorney General's office met Commission officials on 15 May last to discuss the issues raised and explain that the operation of the new condition was fully in line with the criteria set out in the case law of the European Court of Justice. These criteria are the length and continuity of residence in a particular country, the length and purpose of absence from Ireland, the nature and pattern of the employment, the applicant's main centre of interest and the future intention of the applicant concerned as it appears from all the circumstances.In addition, full consideration is given in the decision-making process to the requirements of EU Regulation 1408/71, which co-ordinates the social security rights of people who move within the EU. Rules which apply to migrant workers, that is, persons who have taken up employment in Ireland following their arrival here, are strictly observed.The habitual residence condition does not apply to social insurance benefits such as unemployment benefit or retirement pension and therefore does not affect an entitlement which is based on the aggregation of the migrant workers' insurance records in Ireland and their country of origin.A formal response by the European Commission to the points made is still awaited. It is expected that the Commission's examination of the matter will be concluded to the satisfaction of both parties by the end of this year.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	277	I am none the wiser as to whether the Minister expects the European Commission's opinion to prevail in this situation. Many of us on this side of the House warned that this is exactly what would happen when the regulations were introduced by his predecessor, Deputy Coughlan. We said that the regulations had too many inconsistencies. One of the groups that found themselves being discriminated against were Irish citizens returning to this country having been outside the State for more than two years. Despite what the Minister has just said about social insurance records, the initial effect of the regulations was to start a clock ticking again once the accession countries had joined the EU. This was despite the fact that many migrant workers had already been in the country with work permits and had built a social insurance record here.I appeared on "Morning Ireland" with the previous Minister, Deputy Coughlan, who giggled her way through the situation with the programme's presenter. She did not outline the true facts about social welfare entitlements for people from many of these countries. In any case, if the system is not insurance-based, people entering our country will, for the first six months, be using their own country's social insurance record at the rates of payment that prevail there. Many such countries have very low social welfare rates. There is not much incentive for people to come here to live on the low social welfare rates that apply in their countries in this very high cost economy. In the event of the European Commission's view prevailing, as is likely, does the Minister anticipate additional costs in terms of departmental expenditure? What would be the extent of those costs?Is the Minister prepared to offer an apology to Irish citizens who found themselves unnecessarily caught up in this net and being discriminated against on their return here, and to the group of workers from valid EU accession countries that found themselves in a social welfare grey area because of the unnecessary and ill-devised introduction of this set of regulations?
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	278	I am sure Deputy Boyle would agree that we want to be as decent and honourable towards people who come to our shores as we possibly can be. Our current regulations are among the most liberal in the world, and certainly in terms of the European Union we have one of the more liberally interpreted regimes of any of our colleague countries. We must strike a balance between being decent, humane and supportive of people from the accession states and other countries who come to us for various reasons while at the same time discouraging any form of international welfare tourism.If Deputy Boyle was on this side of the House he would take the view that we must strike a balance. It is not just a question of two years, four or five other criteria also apply. One is entitled to welfare here if one meets the five conditions that relate to one's centre of interest. If one can demonstrate that one's centre of interest is Ireland then the two-year rule does not necessarily apply. We have been increasingly generous towards people coming from the accession states, especially in regard to child benefit. A total of 150,000 people have come from the accession states in the first 15 months of the operation of that scheme.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	279	Decisions on entitlement to social welfare schemes are made by statutorily appointed deciding officers under the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 1993, as amended. Social welfare appeals are undertaken by duly appointed appeals officers. All persons who apply for carer's allowance, carer's benefit or for any social welfare scheme are informed of the decision on their entitlement and the reasons for the decision. Additionally, where a person is refused or where his or her entitlement is reduced, he or she is also advised of his or her right of appeal to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office.Social welfare regulations provide that decisions on social welfare claims must be set out in writing and, where the decision is unfavourable, the reasons for the decision must also be recorded and included in the notification to the persons concerned. Any person who is dissatisfied with a decision made by a deciding officer of my Department, may, by giving notice of appeal to the chief appeals officer within the statutory time limit of 21 days, have the question referred to an appeals officer for determination. An appeal may be sent either directly to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office or it may be handed in to any office of my Department for transmission to the appeals office.It is the general policy of my Department when disallowing a claim because underlying conditions are not satisfied, to offer a review of the claim in the light of any further information a person may wish to submit in support of his or her claim. This does not take from the right of appeal but affords the claimant the opportunity to have the claim fully examined before involving the formal appeals process.The principal eligibility conditions for receipt of carer's allowance are that full-time care and attention is required and is being provided and that the means test that applies is satisfied. For carer's benefit, the conditions are that full-time care and attention is required and is being provided and that certain PRSI contributions are satisfied. In the case of claim applications or reviews of entitlement and following necessary investigations, decisions are issued in all instances to the person concerned.In the case of carer's allowance and benefit, more than 10,000 claims have been decided thus far this year and formal decisions have issued to the persons concerned. Similarly, in the case of any reviews undertaken, the persons concerned received formal decisions and have been duly notified of their right of appeal.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.If the Deputy has a particular case in mind where he feels a decision relating to carer's allowance or benefit, or any other social welfare payment has not been appropriately applied or where a person's right of appeal has not been adequately notified to the claimant by my Department, he should let me have the relevant details and I will ensure the necessary investigations are carried out and refer back to the Deputy as soon as possible.

The target was 80% in eight weeks in 2001 and 26% was achieved, now the target is 70% in 13 weeks and 50% of that has been achieved. Will the Minister comment on that and tell us why it is taking so long for the Department to reach the target?In cases where carer's allowance is stopped, is it the Department's policy to tell the applicant that he or she has the right to appeal the decision? In the event of applications being turned down, applicants are invited to write to the appeals office for a form on which to make an appeal. Will the Minister make a change to the effect that every time an application is refused or if an entitlement is altered, an appeal form will be automatically sent out with the refusal letter?
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	281	I do not know if the form is sent out. I will check that for Deputy Stanton. If an entitlement is stopped or reduced, the policy is that the claimant is informed of his or her right of appeal. The Deputy may have a particular case in mind. If a person voluntarily gave up his or her right to a particular allowance, he or she may not be notified of the right of appeal, as this would not seem to be appropriate. If an allowance was stopped by virtue of a decision of the Department then a claimant would be entitled to an appeal.Last year the Department carried out 215,000 reviews. We deal with more than 900,000 families on a weekly basis. There is always enormous pressure on the Department and its officials try to meet their obligations and targets as efficiently as they can.

On the one hand it shows people are being strict and on the other hand it shows that the appeal mechanism works. I will examine the matter.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	284	Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on my behalf by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive, a weekly or monthly rent or mortgage interest supplement is available to assist eligible people who are unable to meet their immediate accommodation needs through their own resources.Rent and mortgage interest supplements are subject to a means test. They are normally calculated to ensure that, after payment of rent or mortgage interest, an eligible person has income equal to the rate of basic supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to his or her family circumstances, less a minimum contribution, currently €13, which each recipient is required to pay from his or her own resources.In general, a person does not face any reduction in the amount of his or her rent supplement as a result of budgetary increase in his or her primary social welfare payment. Where the supplementary welfare allowance rate increases by the same amount as other social assistance rates, there would be no resulting reduction in rent supplement rate.This has been the situation in recent budgets, including last year where I increased all short-term social assistance payments, including the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, by €14 per week. Accordingly, people continued to receive their existing rent supplement without any clawback, as well as gaining fully from the significant increases in their primary social assistance payments.In the past, where budget increases in rates of payment were granted to old age pensioners at amounts higher than that which applied to supplementary welfare allowance, a special income disregard was introduced to ensure the people concerned received the full benefit of their budget increase. The amount of income in excess of the basic supplementary welfare allowance rate that can be disregarded in the means test for rent supplement for people aged 65 or over who are in receipt of a social welfare pension or equivalent payment from another country is now €26 per household. The first €60 per week of additional income from other sources is disregarded.I assure the Deputy that I intend to continue the arrangements to ensure customers do not lose any rent supplement entitlement by virtue of increases in their primary social welfare payments in the next budget.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	285	I thank the Minister for his detailed and comprehensive reply. However, no matter how one tries to portray the system, people are still no better off. Is this not one of the poverty traps? We are trying to create an environment in which increases are not clawed back. If one is in receipt of rent supplement, is there not a euro-for-euro clawback? Has the Minister checked this with community welfare officers? I heard from a number of sources that there is such a clawback.To widen the debate, does the Minister intend to focus on poverty traps in the forthcoming budget, such that earnings disregards will be increased substantially to ensure those who would normally be entitled to secondary benefits, such as the back to school clothing and footwear allowance, will not be denied them?Does the Minister not feel it is disgraceful that the carer's allowance is included as income in the assessment of needs pertaining to the back to school clothing and footwear allowance? Every other allowance made available by the Department is disregarded. Will the Minister admit the carer's allowance is the one payment that should be disregarded in respect of applicants for the back to school clothing and footwear allowance? Do the criteria as they stand not convey to people on the very margins that they are always caught and can never gain no matter what they do? Will the Minister increase earnings disregards so secondary benefits can be made available to those whom we all want to see obtaining them?

The disregards are such that if there is an increase in one's welfare income, there is no corresponding euro-for-euro reduction in one's rent allowance.There is a need to update thresholds, disregards and limits regularly because time erodes their value. With the upcoming budget in mind, we are considering very closely the levels of disregards and the various limitations and thresholds. They all must be increased at a pace to keep up with and, I hope, exceed the rate of inflation.On the Deputy's final point, I will have to check the facts. I was surprised to hear him suggest that the only income taken into account in determining eligibility for the back to school clothing and footwear allowance is the carer's allowance.

#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	293	I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 13, 23, 44, 61, 71 and 90 together.It is Government policy to encourage people to participate in occupational and private pension arrangements so they can, when they retire, maintain their pre-retirement standard of living. To this end, a range of measures has been introduced in recent years, including personal retirement savings accounts, PRSAs, mandatory employer PRSA access where occupational schemes are not available and an ongoing national pensions awareness campaign.On overall occupational and private pensions coverage, CSO figures for the first quarter of 2004 show that 52.4% of persons in employment have a supplementary pension. Of a national workforce of some 2 million people, an estimated 900,000 do not have a private or occupational pension to boost their incomes in retirement. The key target group for Government action in the supplementary pensions area is those who are 30 years of age and over. The national pensions policy initiative suggested that up to 70% of this group will need to supplement their social welfare pensions to maintain living standards in retirement. The most recent CSO figures suggest that 59.1% of people in this group have the necessary pensions cover.There is no doubt that progress on pensions coverage is being made given that, in recent years, there has been a steady increase in the number of people taking out PRSAs and in those participating in occupational schemes. The most recent figures from the Pensions Board show that just over 55,000 PRSAs had been taken out up to the end of June 2005. However, overall pension coverage is increasing at a lower rate than is desirable. The reasons for this are many and varied and include, for instance, issues of affordability and the fact that many people feel they are too young to consider pension provision.As the House will be aware, in February of this year I asked the Pensions Board to commence work on a comprehensive review of our overall pensions strategy in advance of the original timeframe of September 2006.The review encompasses an examination of the main strategic recommendations contained in the national pensions policy initiative, including those relating to the adequacy of income in retirement, coverage targets, levels of social welfare pensions, sustainability of State pensions, including public sector pensions, and the tax support for private and occupational pensions.The review is also examining the question of alternative ways of addressing adequacy and coverage issues, including the question of mandatory provision. The role the State might have in future pensions provision is also being examined.Mandatory pensions can take a number of different forms. In many countries, particularly in the EU, the state plays a central role in the provision of compulsory supplementary pensions. In other countries, the requirement can be for a person to participate in an occupational or private sector scheme. A variation of the mandatory system was introduced in New Zealand earlier this year and involves automatic enrolment of a person in a scheme with the option available to withdraw if he or she wishes. I understand this type of initiative, known as a "soft mandatory" option, is also being considered in the United Kingdom. As it is a relatively new concept in pension provision, it is difficult to say how successful it might be in dealing with pensions in an Irish context. However, the Pensions Board is looking at the system as part of its overall review.On incentives generally, I am aware of the potential of maturing SSIAs as a way of increasing pensions coverage and I have also asked the Pensions Board to consider how we might tap into the savings habit that has been created to develop attractive pension-based savings initiatives. I understand it was in this context that IBEC put forward its proposal on incentives for pensions provision. It has suggested that the contribution limits allowed for tax purposes be lifted to facilitate the transfer of SSIAs to pension schemes.Work on the Pensions Board review is nearly complete and I expect to receive the final report within the next couple of weeks. At this stage, I am not proposing any particular measures but I will consider the conclusions of the Pensions Board very carefully and consult my Cabinet colleagues on the way forward.Internationally, governments are trying to deal with the challenge of funding pensions for an older population who are generally living longer and healthier lives. The Irish position is by no means in crisis. The demographic trends are to remain favourable for the next ten years or so and this allows us time to address the issues concerning our pensions system. It is essential, however, that we take action sooner rather than later so we can deliver on our commitment to ensure an adequate retirement pension for everybody.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	294	The Minister did not indicate when he is likely to receive the report of the Pensions Board and, on foot of receiving it, when he anticipates it will be published, assuming he believes it should be published in the interest of the ongoing debate. I encourage him to adopt such a belief. In his public statements on this issue the Minister has indicated at least a preference for mandatory pensions. Maybe I misinterpreted his statements. While that has value, there are also difficulties in regard to how to compel individuals to make specific provision. I am glad to hear the Minister say——
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	295	The Deputy should confine himself to questions because we have moved beyond Priority Questions and other Deputies will wish to submit questions. Question Time is intended for the Deputy to ask a question to elicit information from the Minister. I ask all Deputies, now that we have moved on from Priority Questions, to be more precise in their questioning.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	296	I ask the Ceann Comhairle to pardon my phraseology. I am trying to phrase my questions in such a way as to fit the omnibus reply the Minister put together which moves away slightly from my original question.The report is expected to deal with tax reliefs, which is significant in light of my question about when it will be published because we are approaching the budget and the Finance Bill. There has been much criticism of the inequalities in tax relief for private pensions. Will the Minister indicate when the report will be published and whether he intends to interact with the Minister for Finance to tackle the inequalities in the tax system to encourage private pension schemes?
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	297	I should receive the Pensions Board report in a few weeks. I intend to publish it after the Government has considered it in order to have a debate on the options for the future. I have asked the board to think radically. I do not know what it will propose but I trust that it took on board my request not to dodge the issues.The nation needs to address this serious situation but it is not a political issue. Every country, including the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, is struggling with pensions because people live longer and retire earlier than in the past and the gap between the two is great. The tax relief we give on pensions is almost €2 billion per annum.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	298	That is more than we pay out.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	299	It is exactly the amount I pay out every year in social welfare pensions. A significant amount of State money goes into the system.One figure looming large is that 500,000 women in the workforce have no provision for occupational pensions. The Government cannot allow that to continue indefinitely. That is why I am interested in the concept of mandatory pensions but I will be advised by the Pensions Board's comments on their practicality. The experiment in New Zealand whereby people are in schemes unless they choose to opt out of them might be worth considering here. The United Kingdom is considering it too. If we let the present system tick over, those in the public service and many others are well covered, and if we are elected often enough to this House we are well looked after. However, those 500,000 women are not well looked after and we have a responsibility to deal with that issue.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	300	Has the Minister discussed this matter with IBEC or ICTU because he must be aware those bodies hold differing views? Has he given any consideration to the soft mandatory pensions and how they are being reviewed in England?Can the Minister do anything to make the personal retirement savings account, PRSA, more attractive to people? Why did people not take it up despite the fair wind of publicity it received? What was the trigger that caused it to fail so notably? Had it been taken up, the situation we face 20 or 30 years from now would surely not be the urgent matter the Minister is rightly addressing.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	301	IBEC and ICTU are represented on the Pensions Board so to that extent they are being fully consulted and have a direct input. I will consult them directly after publication of the report to hear their responses to it. I have pressed my colleagues to include pensions on the agenda of national pay talks and partnership agreements and not focus only on workers' current requirements and pressures.A total of 55,000 people have taken out PRSAs. The number is growing steadily but is well below what it should be. The main reason for the slow uptake is that it is voluntary and employers are required to facilitate taking out a PRSA but not to push people to do it. A completely voluntary scheme that involves paying out a weekly or monthly sum is always difficult to sell.There may be a case for being tougher on employers to bring the PRSA more forcefully to the attention of the employee. I do not wish to say too much before the report comes out but this may be a soft mandatory area where employers might be required to ask employees to say "No" rather than help them to say "Yes".
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	302	What was the Government's target for PRSAs? What is the annual tax relief on PRSAs? The Minister said there is no crisis, yet this scheme has existed for ten years. What is his view on allowing people to work longer? What requirements would need to be introduced to allow that happen?If that happened what would be the pension ramifications? If the Pensions Board's report is not to be submitted to the Minister for a few weeks followed by publication and a debate, it will be some time before we see any action on this issue. Does he have any plans to make changes in the meantime?
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	303	A total of 55,000 people hold PRSAs. There was no formal Government target but I would have expected that at least 100,000 might have joined the scheme by now. I do not have a breakdown of tax relief between different schemes because tax breaks on pensions cover a range of schemes. I am sure it is available and broken down by scheme and I will get the figures for the Deputy. PRSAs are only one aspect of this issue because there are other tax efficient pension arrangements. The overall figure is close to €2 billion. I can get the exact figure for the Deputy.It is not as much a crisis here as in other countries because our demographics are still favourable. Within the European Union only 44% of people aged over 50 are in the workforce. In the United Kingdom the figure is 53% and the figure here is probably similar. I need to pin that figure down so the Deputy should not hold me to it. People in their early 50s in the western world are leaving the workforce. Since 1985 life expectancy has increased by five years into the 80s. That period imposes a significant strain on pension systems. It will take the wisdom of Job to consider the situation where a person is retired for longer than he or she worked.

The issues are fundamental and no Government could move far in this area without an intense public debate on what people are prepared to do. Basically, one is asking people to pay now for something which they might not avail of for 30 or 40 years. That is not an easy proposition.

Hopefully there will be some imagination used and a pension incentive provided. Everyone is concerned about how that money will affect the economy.The Minister talked of some people feeling that they are too young to consider pensions. Does the Minister accept that part of the problem is that many young people are living beyond their means? More young Irish people are buying property than young people in other European countries. They are thinking of pensions in terms of property. Does the Minister agree that while people on the Continent go down the pension route, in Ireland we seem to be looking for more adaptable ways of saving for one's pension?We take the attitude that young people party all night and sleep all day but that is not true. Does the Minister agree that young people have mortgages, child care costs, transport costs and so on? It is part of the difficulty that people feel they have not currently got the money for pension saving and are leaving the matter for later. Does the Minister agree that it is a matter of creating a package which will attract young people into pension schemes?

#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	312	I take Deputy Crowe's point. He mentioned the Continent, but the PRSI take on the Continent is substantially greater than it is in Ireland. Taxes and the take from payroll are much higher there than in Ireland. There is greater involvement in pensions on the Continent because much of the saving there is semi-mandatory, while in Ireland, apart from the basic PRSI system which funds our State pensions, we do not have a mandatory element. Society may have to make a decision as to what extent it wants to live for today or invest in pensions for tomorrow, either through the PRSI or PRSA system, or directly through the tax breaks system. This is a societal issue which we must address.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	313	In 2004, the total number of sick days recorded in my Department, in respect of a total workforce of approximately 4,730, was 6.6% of the potential working days in the year. It was also 6.6% in 2003. The average number of sick days per employee was 13.5 working days, down from 13.6 days in 2003. Some 92.4% of the total number of sick days in 2004 were covered by medical certificates while 22.7% of the Department staff took no sick leave during the year and, overall, 38.8% took less than two days.A considerable proportion of the total number of sick days in 2004 was accounted for by a small number of staff who were on long-term sick leave in the year. Some 22% of all the sick days were accounted for by 74 staff who were on sick leave for at least six months in 2004. When the sick leave for these staff members is factored out, the average number of sick days per employee was 10.5 working days, down from 10.7 days in 2003.As a general rule, the cases of employees who have been on sick leave for approximately six to eight weeks are referred to the chief medical officer for the Civil Service for review. The CMO plays a crucial role in advising the Department on employee fitness for work from a medical perspective. In these situations, the employee is required to provide a detailed medical report for the CMO. In certain circumstances, the CMO may request the staff member to attend for medical examination.My Department has identified the issue of addressing and minimising absenteeism as one of the priorities of its human resources strategy. This is of vital importance in ensuring that the Department provides a high quality service to its customers. It is also recognised that absenteeism increases the workloads of staff who have to provide cover for absent colleagues, particularly in areas working under considerable pressure.My Department has developed, through its partnership process and in consultation with unions and staff associations, a comprehensive attendance management policy, aimed at addressing the issues arising in the context of sickness absence in an effective and balanced manner.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.The policy was circulated to all members of staff in June 2005. The production of the policy fulfilled a key commitment in my Department's action plan under the Sustaining Progress national agreement. The policy re-states and clarifies the existing practices but also contains a range of initiatives, based on research and feedback, which, taken together, have the overall objective of managing attendance so as to foster an attendance culture.A key principle of the policy is that everyone in the Department has both rights and responsibilities regarding attendance. It recognises that the vast majority of absences are entirely legitimate and that it is crucial that people who are ill should not feel under pressure to attend work. However, it also emphasises that both managers and staff have a responsibility to discuss attendance issues in a constructive and fair manner. The policy also recognises that good practice with regard to attendance is already in evidence in the organisation and it is important to build on this.In its policy, the Department acknowledges that attendance is a multi-faceted issue and that to maximise attendance it is necessary to promote a positive working environment, to inform and advise staff on health and lifestyle issues and to minimise work-related stress. This is being done by implementing a diverse range of measures in areas such as health and safety, health promotion and stress management, provision of a wide range of work-life balance arrangements and improved communication and consultation methods across the organisation.Progress on the implementation of the policy will be reviewed by the Department's management committee and the partnership steering committee and updates will be communicated to all staff. The management of attendance through the implementation of its attendance management policy will continue to be a key priority of the Department's human resource strategy.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	314	I thank the Minister for his answer. Will he accept that the sick leave rate in his Department is relatively high within the public service outside of the Prison Service? One of the factors to explain this might be the fact that Department staff must deal with the public, who themselves are sometimes in distressed states, which would cause the staff a great deal of stress.What support structures does the Minister feel confident exist already, and what structures is he considering putting in place which would help minimise worker stress levels which result in this level of sick leave in his Department? Is there any general discussion among his officials with regard to tackling the levels of sick leave, which seem to be static over the past few years?
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	315	The sick leave figures in the Department are high when compared across the Civil Service. The best reason I can offer is that of the 4,730 staff, many of them are front-line staff dealing sometimes with very difficult situations in difficult areas geographically. That is one possible explanation though more work is needed to fully ascertain the situation.The Department's management committee, the partnership steering committee and top management in the Department are involved in a range of measures dealing with health and safety, health promotion, stress management, provision of a wide range of work-life balance arrangements, improved communications and consultation methods right across the organisation. Much emphasis is being put on lifestyle issues to minimise work-related stress and there is discussion and communication with and among staff to reduce the sick leave figures.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	316	I welcome this important report produced for the Combat Poverty Agency by the Economic and Social Research Institute. Using data from a number of sources including the 2002 census, the living in Ireland survey 2000 and the national survey of housing quality 2001-02, it identified the varying incidence of poverty risk throughout the country, with the highest incidence being in the Border and west regions.Exploring the reasons for spatial variations in poverty risk, the report found little evidence of a causal relationship between poverty and location  per se but rather found that the main factors determining poverty relate to the socio-economic composition of households. It found poverty to be more influenced by structural factors such as lack of education, low-paid work, unemployment or non-participation in the labour force.A strategic process to combat poverty and social exclusion, with a particular focus on tackling these structural factors in an integrated way, is provided for in the national action plan against poverty and social exclusion. The plan contains a series of commitments across the relevant policy areas accompanied, where appropriate, by targets, including targets to increase participation in quality employment, to improve levels of educational attainment and to improve access to services and good quality housing. A recent review of implementation of the plan has shown that 51 of its 58 targets and commitments had either been met or were in the process of being met.The plan also has a particular focus on groups regarded as being most vulnerable to poverty, including persons living in areas of rural disadvantage and urban poverty. The CLÁR and RAPID programmes operated by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs have a range of actions targeted specifically at these areas.Given the spatial dimension highlighted by this report, it is important to develop focused local level anti-poverty plans to support the national action plan. I welcome the fact that a number of such plans have already been developed in some local authority areas, with more under development. The local development social inclusion programme is another important element of locally based activity to combat poverty and social exclusion.Social welfare spending has more than doubled from €5.7 billion in 1997 to €12.25 billion in the current year and has provided significant real increases in payments during this period. This work must continue.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.For every €3 now spent by the State, €1 goes on social welfare payments, of which we make about 1 million per week. In drawing attention to these increases, I am not complacent about the current situation. Much more remains to be done to tackle the problems of poverty and exclusion experienced by persons in the most vulnerable groups and areas. I am determined, through vigorous implementation and development of the strategic process and in full consultation with all the stakeholders at national, regional and local levels, to continue to build and improve on our achievements so far. Reports such as this help by enabling us to focus programmes and resources to best effect in the preparation of the next national action plan, in which this report will be fully taken into account. I commend the Combat Poverty agency for commissioning the report and the ESRI for producing it to such a high standard.

Is the Minister concerned that poverty is rampant in rural areas, including Counties Donegal, Leitrim and Mayo? Does he agree that these counties have the greatest number of elderly people, small farming activity, low levels of educational attainment and highest levels of economic dependency? Can any action be taken to alleviate these problems?There is a strong correlation between housing tenure and risk of poverty. The report noted that the risk of poverty among local authority tenants is five times greater than for people in other types of housing. Is that not a significant finding? Does the Minister agree that a signal is sent to the market arising from this issue? Further steps must be taken to address geographical variations in poverty distribution.Is it not instructive that lone parenthood, illness and lack of education are the three major parameters? Will the Minister ensure joined-up government in this area by co-operating with the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, to eradicate the distressing levels of poverty described in this worthy report.

Some urban areas experience lower levels of educational attainment, while there is a lower participation in the labour force in other regions. The combination of these factors is more significant than geographical location.I will continue to discuss collective responses with the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, and other colleagues in the Government. The combination of expanding social welfare provisions, the national action plan against poverty, focussing on lone parents and making services more accessible will allow us to address issues of poverty.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	319	Following the social welfare increases awarded in last year's budget, the lowest rate of social welfare payment currently stands at €148.80 per week. Depending on their circumstances, social welfare recipients are also entitled to additions to the personal rate of payment in respect of a spouse or partner and dependent children. In the case of a two-adult household with three children, the weekly social welfare payment including child benefit is in the order of €413.Government policy with regard to social welfare rates is guided by the commitment in the revised national anti-poverty strategy, NAPS, to increase the lowest social welfare personal rates to €150 per week in 2002 terms by 2007 and to set the appropriate equivalence level of child income support, combining child benefit and child dependant allowances, at 33% to 35% of the adult rates. We remain on target to achieve this objective. In budget 2005, the lowest rates of social welfare were increased by €14 per week while the rates of child benefit were increased by €10 to €141.60 per month for the first two children and by €12 to €177.30 per month for the third and subsequent children. The equivalence level of child income support now stands at 33.3% of the lowest social welfare rate for those receiving the lower rate of child benefit and 38.8% for those on the higher rate.The details supplied with the question claim that an income level of €528.49 per week is necessary for a family of two adults and three children to avoid being in consistent poverty. This is not quite correct. The figure has been calculated by the CORI justice commission and refers to the 60% median poverty line for a family of two adults and three children. This is the so-called at risk of poverty indicator, which is one of a range of measures used by the EU to measure poverty and social exclusion. The relative income measure is essentially about inequality of incomes and identifies those with an income below 60% of the median income for society as a whole and who as a result may be at risk of poverty. The poverty measure that underpins the revised NAPS is the consistent poverty measure which identifies those who are at risk of poverty and deprived of certain items considered by Irish people as necessary to ensure a basic standard of living.

However, under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, administered on my behalf by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive, a weekly or monthly rent or mortgage interest supplement is available to assist eligible people who are unable to meet their immediate accommodation needs through their own resources.The rent supplement scheme is geared to meeting more immediate short-term housing needs through the private rent sector. Under the scheme, it is up to the individuals to secure suitable rented accommodation for themselves and their household, and apply for support under the rent supplement scheme if they are unable to meet the cost of this accommodation from their own resources. Statutory rent limits apply to accommodation for rent supplement eligibility purposes, varying according to geographic location and the applicant family size. My Department keeps prevailing market rent levels under close review.I am satisfied that one parent families and other applicant households should be able to rent appropriate and suitable accommodation within the rent supplement scheme limits in all areas of the country. In recent years, a significant number of people have come to rely on rent supplements for extended periods, including one parent families.In response to this situation, the Government introduced a new initiative in July 2004 aimed at meeting the longer-term housing needs of these people. These new rental assistance arrangements give local authorities responsibility for meeting long-term housing assistance needs, including the needs of those people on rent supplements for 18 months or longer. The scheme involves structured arrangements to secure long-term availability of privately rented accommodation, particularly accommodation currently occupied by tenants in receipt of rent supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, and to encourage the supply of additional accommodation.Local authorities will meet the housing needs of these individuals through a range of approaches including the traditional range of social housing options, the voluntary housing sector and, in particular, a new public private partnership type rental accommodation scheme.The aim of the new system is to minimise ongoing dependence on rent supplement by progressing to a position where local authority accommodation is available for all those with a long-term housing need.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.The plan is that this situation will be achieved within a period of three years from commencement of the new arrangements in each local authority, and in any event no later than September 2008. The rent supplement scheme will continue to provide support to those who have a short-term housing need.

The Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, was quoted recently as saying he is still in the process of compiling a list of candidates. Can the Minister update us on where the search for a mediator is at? When will he be in a position to appoint a person to the role? Can he outline the reason the process has taken so long and what is currently delaying the appointment? There are some distinguished people in industrial, economic and academic sectors, who were formerly involved in politics, who might be available to take up this role. Is the Minister aware whether any of them have been approached?The Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, said in the Dáil this morning that a decision has been made by the Cabinet on an agreed mediator. Can the Minister clarify what exactly did she mean by that? Has any decision been made on who to appoint, or was she simply indicating that a process is being pursued by the Government?It is unbelievable that it has taken this long for the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, to seek to appoint a mediator, when it was suggested, as early as June by the Labour Party and by my colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, who is present, following the regrettable imprisonment of the five Rossport citizens, that an agreed mediation was the way to go, and that the Minister should urgently move on that as the first stage of getting the men out of prison and getting a process in train. It seems grotesque that it was only after these five decent men from Rossport had spent 94 days in prison and seemingly also after the determination of the Norwegian oil company Statoil and of the new Norwegian Government to get the men out of prison that the Minister finally decided to act on the suggestion of agreed mediation.The key point is that a window of opportunity was created on the day the Rossport five were released. I and a large number of the membership of the Labour Party and the trade union movement marched around this town with the Rossport five. It was a joyous and hopeful occasion with the people of Dublin saluting them on their stand and hoping that an agreed resolution would be reached. We felt hopeful that Saturday afternoon and the days following. There was great goodwill on all sides to bring about a resolution to the dispute and avoid any repetition of the imprisonment of any more Rossport citizens. The Minister, however, seems to have been unwilling or unable to seize the opportunity to drive forward an agreed process of resolution at that critical juncture. Instead, he seems to have let things slide to the stage where positions on both sides seem again to be hardening.It is possible we will end up in a further serious dispute about this matter. This complacency and lack of urgency in appointing an agreed mediator unfortunately reflects the approach of the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and the Government to the dispute over the Corrib gas pipeline. At a press conference in Castlebar on 24 October the Rossport five said that more than three weeks after their release neither the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, nor any of his officials had contacted them in regard to the mediation process. How does the Minister think a resolution of this problem will work if the Department is not in contact with the Rossport citizens and their representatives?There have been allegations in recent days by the protestors against the pipeline, especially the Shell to Sea group, that the present mediation process is a ploy by the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and that it has a pre-determined outcome which will favour the pipeline development in its present format. I am interested to hear the Minister's views on the matter and if he thinks the scenario which involved a changed route or some relocation of the pipeline will be allowed go ahead.If Advantica, the company carrying out the local consultation, was to find in favour of local residents how would the Department deal with that issue? It appears an important role has been played in this issue so far by Mr. Helgestad of Statoil and by the new Norwegian Government, which involves our colleagues in the Norwegian Labour Party, to bring about the release of the Rossport five. Has the Minister had contact with them in the interval? Given that time is dragging on we want to get this issue resolved. There is good will on all sides. We need a resolution. When will the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, act?
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	351	I wish to assure the Deputy and the House that the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, shares his view that mediation must be the next step forward on the Corrib issue.The Minister is encouraged by the positive response he received from both sides, to his offer to appoint a mediator. At the time of the release of the five men it was conveyed to the Minister on their behalf that they would appreciate some time to return to normality, meet family and friends and re-adjust their lives following their imprisonment. The Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, agreed to this and up to last weekend — by way of a comment in a newspaper — he has received no communication from his contacts with the men that they were unhappy with the fact that a mediator had not been appointed.In the intervening period a number of people were approached to act as mediators. Through various contacts, a consensus emerged that it might be useful to consider the use of a professional mediation service in addition to a mediator. This is now the course of action which the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, proposes to pursue. Earlier this week, the Minister gave an indicative list of persons to lead the mediation process and both sides agreed with that list. The Minister will now select the mediator from the names agreed by both sides.One of the important elements informing the forthcoming mediation discussions will be the report of the safety review. The safety review of the onshore upstream gas pipeline will be thorough and comprehensive and will be carried out by independent, internationally recognised experts. Advantica, the successful bidder, is a world leader in the development and application of advanced hazard and risk assessment technologies for gas pipelines.It has been a priority for the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, that those who have views relating to the safety of the pipeline should have the opportunity to have those views considered by Advantica. Views have been invited from local residents, communities and any interested party. Advantica has visited the Corrib site, as part of its work and, as the Minister has stated, a two-day public hearing was held in County Mayo earlier this month. The hearing was chaired by Mr. John Gallagher SC and provided an opportunity for everyone locally who has concerns to express those concerns. All the safety concerns raised at the hearing are being examined and dealt with by Advantica.By common consent, the hearings were regarded as successful and as affording to all those who wanted an opportunity to express their views. Arising from these hearings, and on the advice of his technical advisory group, the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, requested Advantica to undertake a review of the issues relating to the ground conditions through which the pipe will run and this will form part of the final report. The Minister wishes to thank Mr. John Gallagher, senior counsel, for the excellent manner in which he has conducted the proceedings. The full transcript of the hearing, as well as all the written submissions received to date, is available on the Department's website.While the matter is by no means resolved, it is clear that significant progress is being made. The Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, hopes that the forthcoming mediation process, augmented as needed by the results of the safety review, will allow all those concerned to work together to resolve the difficulties that have arisen.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	352	I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this important issue which I do at the request of Raymond McCord Snr. who has given me detailed information on his son's case.Mr. McCord has suffered a campaign of intimidation and violence from the UDA. He has been beaten up and left for dead. Subsequently, he has campaigned to obtain justice for his son. Gunmen have targeted his family and he has been ordered to leave Northern Ireland. He has refused to do so. I salute both his courage and his integrity.Perhaps it was in order to seek protection from the UDA that his son became involved briefly with the Mount Vernon UVF, under the command of Mark Haddock. In November 1997 he was battered to death and his body was dumped in a quarry. According to his father, the Mount Vernon UVF murdered Raymond McCord because he had been summoned by John "Bunter" Graham, the officer commanding the UVF on the Shankill Road, to account for his role in ferrying drugs for Mark Haddock. He was murdered to prevent Graham finding out about Haddock's unsanctioned drugs operations.At least two members of the gang who carried out the murder were Special Branch informers. They were Mark Haddock, who ordered the murder, and John Bond, who was present when Raymond McCord was murdered. Both these men were also allegedly involved in an attempt to bomb the Sinn Féin offices in Monaghan. Haddock was originally handled by Johnston Brown, a CID officer in the RUC. RUC Special Branch later took over the handling of informers. Haddock is said to have been recruited as an informer after he murdered Sharon McKenna, a Catholic and home help worker, who was shot while visiting a friend in Mount Vernon in January 1993.Since the McKenna murder, and while serving as an RUC informer, Haddock has been associated with the murder of Gary Convie and Éamon Fox, both of whom were Catholics shot on a building site in May 1994; Thomas Sheppard, an alleged informer shot in March 1996; the Reverend David Templeton, a Protestant clergyman who died in March 1997, having been severely beaten; Billy Harbinson, handcuffed, beaten and left to die in May 1997; Tommy English, a former UDP politician beaten and shot in October 2000; and David Greer, shot during a loyalist feud in October 2000.The central allegation is that Haddock was not charged with any crime because he was an informer who had to be protected. He was able to act with impunity while the police effectively colluded in his crimes. Johnston Brown said in a television documentary:If you're asking me are there people who had committed murder but got away with it because of informants, yes they did . . . If you're asking me if, on some occasions, the informants go outside those parameters, yes they did. Including murder? Yes they did. Were they protected by the highest authority? Yes, they were. . . Could we have put the majority of them in jail in 1997, 1998, 1999? Absolutely. Would lives have been saved time and time again? Yes indeed . . . There appeared to be no will to prosecute certain individuals. I couldn't understand it and I spoke of my reservations but you're a voice in the wilderness.I understand we will hear more from Mr. Brown when his book, Into the Dark, is launched in Belfast next week.For almost eight years the investigation into the Raymond McCord murder has gone nowhere. His father is morally certain who killed his son but the perpetrators enjoy immunity for their acts. The police need for intelligence has trumped the state's duty to protect the right of life. Mark Haddock is now awaiting trial for attempted murder. Mr. McCord understands he will plead guilty and may serve less than ten years in prison. There is no progress in any of the outstanding murder investigations. The Police Ombudsman is finalising the most difficult investigation of her career and will report before Christmas.The question for us is what our Government should do about all of this. We are used to debating here the cases of Pat Finucane, Rosemary Nelson and others who come from the Nationalist community. Our commitment to those we claim as fellow nationals requires us to extend a similar degree of concern where victims come from the other side of the divide in Northern Ireland and allegations of police collusion are made.A generation ago a British Prime Minister could summon a lord chief justice and give him the right political steer before a judicial tribunal by saying: "Remember we're fighting a war over there". The IRA throughout its murderous 30-year campaign also insisted it was fighting a war. I never believed there was a war in Northern Ireland or justification for a war. Nor do I believe there was ever justification for emergency wartime departure from adherence to the rule of law. If the statement that the war is over means anything it means that we must reassert our insistence on peacetime standards of justice, on adherence to the rule of law and on fair and impartial policing.The Government has both the entitlement and the obligation to raise the issue of the integrity of policing within the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference. Once the O'Loan report is published, there must be an inquiry. Judge Peter Cory, some law lords in the UK, most independent commentators, the Government and I have all condemned the Inquiries Act, rushed through the British Parliament in the week before the British general election. The Government must insist upon the utter inadequacy of that legislation in delivering a comprehensive and credible inquiry. An international element is required to guarantee independence and impartiality.Mr. Raymond McCord has lost a 22-year-old son to a violent and ruthless organisation that seems to have operated with the surreptitious sanction of the police. We owe it to him and to all others who have lost family, friends and neighbours to ensure, as best we can, that they receive justice.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	353	As the Deputy and the House are aware, the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, Ms Nuala O'Loan, has been engaged in an investigation into the circumstances of the murder of Mr. Raymond McCord and related matters. This investigation has been ongoing for the past two years. It was initiated following a complaint received by that office from Mr. Raymond McCord Snr, which alleged police misconduct, regarding the circumstances of his son's murder, which was believed to have been committed by loyalist paramilitaries.The office of the Police Ombudsman advised us that the investigation is largely complete and that an interim report was sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions in Northern Ireland. A final report will be sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions in Northern Ireland, shortly. The public report on the investigation will be released after the Director of Public Prosecutions in Northern Ireland has deliberated on the issue.As attested by the Oversight Commissioner for Policing in Northern Ireland in his latest report published in September last, the office of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland is operating extremely effectively in its crucial role. This is also the stated opinion of the Northern Ireland Parliamentary Select Committee and the inspectorate of constabulary. Most notably, there has been a steady increase in confidence, on both sides of the community, in the work of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland. The Government has absolute confidence in the ability and independence of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland. We are satisfied that under her guidance, the McCord case is currently subject to a rigorous investigation.In the context of the sensitive stage the investigation has reached any comment on the possible establishment of an independent inquiry into this issue would be premature. The Government will continue to monitor developments in this case very closely and will give its immediate and careful consideration to the ombudsman's report and any recommendations that it makes when it is published. I have listened with great interest to Deputy Rabbitte's very detailed contribution and in particular his reference to policing in Northern Ireland. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is present in the House and he along with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach at bilateral meetings on a North-South basis and at east-west meetings with the British Government have consistently and repeatedly raised the policing issue. The Deputy can be assured that the Government and its representatives along with our excellent senior officials consistently raise the issue.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	354	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter. In my constituency, the regeneration in Ballymun is a massive development that is very much welcomed by the residents. The Ballymun project is the biggest urban regeneration scheme in Europe and it is something of which we should all be proud. When I look at the new facilities for young people and families, the plans for the new shopping centre and hotels in the area, together with the relocation of so many families into new houses, it is clear that real progress is being made in establishing the new town centre in Ballymun.The demolition of the towers has certainly been a huge part of this project for the area particularly in its symbolic importance and, in general, it has been very successful. However, last week I held a meeting with a number of Irish subcontractors who have been involved with the demolition project of the towers. Their experience in this demolition has shown another side to the regeneration.The contract for the demolition of the high-rise blocks was awarded by Ballymun Regeneration Limited to the Controlled Demolition Group, CDG, a UK company specialising in this sort of project. Controlled Demolition has been paid nearly €6 million by Ballymun Regeneration Limited for the demolition work to date. According to the terms of the contract, CDG was then authorised to subcontract as it wished various aspects of the job to subcontractors. In this task, it chose a number of locally based, Irish subcontractors. I have a copy of the contract entered into by BRL and Controlled Demolition Group.During the recent demolition of McDonagh Tower, there were problems on the site from early on, in particular with payments to subcontractors. As in many cases the people who were owed money were given the run around. Each subcontractor was told that someone else was holding up payments, be it BRL or another subcontractor. After a number of delays and problems the implosion finally took place on 5 June 2005. At the time of demolition, subcontractors were still owed a significant amount of money even though BRL had completed the majority of payments to CDG.Following this implosion we received news in September that CDG had gone into administration following the withdrawal of its venture capital investor and Ernst and Young was appointed as administrator. The company was sold but since then it has recommenced trading with the same directors except for finance director. The business and assets were taken over by another company, Linkway Manufacturing Limited, which changed its own name to Controlled Demolition and has continued to perform existing contracts. I am led to believe that it resumed trading within a few hours of the sale. I understand that this practice is known as "phoenixing" in the UK.Phoenixing occurs where the assets of one limited company are moved to another legal entity, without moving the liabilities. In this way it allows directors to declare the company bankrupt and then start up again under a new name and avoid their legal responsibilities. The problem is that we are aware of at least 15 companies that still have not been paid and have not been contacted to agree any payment plan with the new company. Many of these companies are Irish, some from Ballymun or its environs. Seven Irish subcontractors are owed sums ranging from €294,000 down to €40. One company, a security company, employed and still employs 40 local people from Ballymun. An additional six contractors are subcontractors of McDonald Brothers, the main contractor for Controlled Demolition. A further three UK companies are affected. Tom and Steven McDonald are owed €350,000; P. J. Carey — no relation to me — is owed €50,000; and Lancaster Crushing is owed approximately €206,000. The three UK companies are owed €606,000 with more than €1 million owed to Irish companies.Recently, Controlled Demolition's managing director, Mr. Palin, stated that 90% of the company's creditors would be paid. However, the fear is that Irish sub-contractors are most likely to be the ones to lose out. Furthermore, Mr. Palin said the company's ability to pay the Irish sub-contractors will depend on the outcome of the settlement of the final account with Ballymun Regeneration Limited. A retention amount of approximately €60,000 to €65,000 is available from the contract.I am glad of the opportunity to speak on the matter because I cannot allow something like this to happen to what is probably the most prestigious construction project in the country. Small businesses and in some cases sole traders will be badly hit by this. It is unacceptable that companies employed on a prestigious State project should go unpaid for their work. Furthermore, it is unacceptable that a company such as CDG can be allowed to operate in such a manner. I ask that the Minister intervene and assist these companies in recovering some, if not all, of the money owed to them. I also call on the Minister to review the case in terms of both European and Irish law in order that CDG can be made to settle its debts in this country.I thank the Minister, Deputy Martin, the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, and their officials for the efforts they have made on my behalf and that of the companies to date. I also thank the officials of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement for their assistance, the representatives of Ballymun Regeneration Limited and, in particular, the representatives of the sub-contractors for the assistance they have given to me in compiling their case.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	355	We appreciate Deputy Carey's concern in this matter. The recovery of commercial debts is essentially a civil matter between the parties concerned. I do not have detailed information about the particular circumstances of this case, for example, information relating to the terms of the contracts entered into by the parties concerned or the administration procedure in the United Kingdom referred to by Deputy Carey. Furthermore, it is not clear if Irish or British law or both applies.While on the basis of the information available, it appears that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has no function in the matter, nevertheless, we have considerably strengthened Irish company law, in recent years. The Company Law Enforcement Act 2001 introduced significant changes to the business regulatory environment.One of the main initiatives of the Act was to establish the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement with statutory responsibility for encouraging compliance with company law and investigating and enforcing suspected breaches of the legislation. This remit involves communicating publicly the benefits of compliance and the consequences of non-compliance, initiating fact-finding company investigations and prosecuting persons for suspected breaches of the Companies Acts. It also involves evaluating the conduct of persons associated with insolvent companies, applying to the High Court for the restriction or disqualification of company directors and others and undertaking a number of additional initiatives, including remedial measures, as provided for in the Companies Acts.Business failure is an unfortunate fact of life. However, the changes introduced in Irish company law, through Part 5 of the 2001 Act in particular, are intended to address the problem of dishonest business failure, in particular, what has been referred to as the "phoenix syndrome".If the Deputy has any information suggesting that a breach of Irish company law has occurred in the above case, I ask him to bring it to the attention of the Director of Corporate Enforcement who is independent in the performance of his statutory duties and has done an excellent job since his appointment to that office.
#DennisODonovan	unknown-#DennisODonovan-party	unknown-#DennisODonovan-dob	unknown-#DennisODonovan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	356	I moved this matter on the Adjournment having regard to the fact that this small Garda station in my constituency is a very important one. The old station is in a state of disrepair and local gardaí are in temporary accommodation which is inappropriate and unsuitable in this era of modern policing. Will the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform outline the current plans and the proposals of his Department for Dunmanway Garda station? In light of the current temporary accommodation being used by gardaí, is it the Department's intention to provide a new Garda station on a greenfield site or to carry out major refurbishment works on the old station? Will the Minister outline the date on which such works are likely to commence, the nature of the works to be executed and any other relevant details?The position in Dunmanway is untenable and has been so for almost 15 years. Since being elected to Seanad Éireann in August 1997 I have actively pursued this issue. In recent years gardaí were obliged to vacate the old station which is in a state of disrepair. It is unsuitable for human occupation and is particularly inappropriate for occupation by the Garda Síochána. This situation cannot be allowed to pertain. The fact that gardaí had to move to temporary accommodation is not appropriate in the 21st century.The Minister is aware that a local action group has been working on this issue and rightly so. Its members have raised their voices and campaigned strongly for their Garda station. The Garda Representative Association has publicly supported the provision of a new or refurbished station at Dunmanway. Many local politicians and councillors have also campaigned for years on this matter and the people of Dunmanway deserve much better.I am aware of the Minister's attitude to this issue and laud him for it, but the morale of the force in Dunmanway is at a low ebb because of the circumstances and the venue in which they are being forced to uphold law and order in Dunmanway and its environs. If the morale of gardaí is low in a town, it affects the local community very badly.I implore the Minister to take action on this issue. I have been relatively silent on it and had no great desire to stay in the House late on a Thursday to move a motion on the Adjournment having left west Cork last Tuesday at 4.30 a.m. However, this situation needs to be resolved. I am aware there were legal difficulties surrounding the refurbishment of the old Garda station. I am also aware that the Minister's predecessor, Deputy O'Donoghue, announced that funding would be provided to carry out the refurbishment. I am further aware that since then there has been a triangle of passing the ball from one body to the other — from the OPW to the Office of the Attorney General and to the office of a solicitor. The issue to be resolved relates to access to the rear of the old premises. Whatever the issues, something must be done as a matter of urgency for the gardaí in Dunmanway and the people of the town and surrounding areas. The current situation cannot be allowed to continue. We are approaching the end of 2005 and I hope the Minister will have some positive news for me in his reply.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	357	I am grateful to Deputy O'Donovan for raising this matter and I do not say that out of politeness. On a recent visit to his constituency, where I was opening the new Garda station at Bantry, Deputy O'Donovan asked me, before I set out on my journey, if I would be in a position to go to Dunmanway to see what the situation was for myself. On the way to the opening of the Bantry Garda station, I stopped in Dunmanway and made contact with the local gardaí in the temporary station. They showed me the old station, which has been abandoned for some time, and its surroundings. I was dismayed by what I saw. I saw a very derelict building with ivy growing through its roof and a massive nettle garden at the back. Decay was everywhere. I was told that the project for refurbishment had been in a state of paralysis for many years. I was also informed that the alternative of a greenfield site for a new station was being explored.Having viewed the station, gone to Bantry, performed the opening ceremony, met the resident's group referred to by Deputy O'Donovan, met the Deputy himself and discussed the matter, I returned to Dublin and made inquiries as to the situation with Dunmanway Garda station. As the Deputy said, the issue was that the process of refurbishment of the station had become stalled in the triangle that he described. The problem with refurbishing the station on its existing site was that rear access was required and there was a difficulty in establishing title to land at the rear of the station. These are the kinds of problems which frequently produce paralysis in public affairs. The fact there is a problem means that everybody stops progressing the issue. The problem goes on a merry-go-round, so to speak, whereby people stare at it but nothing is done.I am grateful to Deputy O'Donovan for drawing this matter to my attention because, if I had not been in the neck of the woods on the day in question and had not been asked by him to see the station, I would not have been aware of all the facts. I am pleased to tell him now that the question of making good title to the access route to the rear of the station has been resolved to everyone's satisfaction. Therefore, the legal impediment to getting on with the project has been dealt with.The next stage is that the access must be purchased, which will not be a major problem. The refurbishment will commence when this happens. I cannot put an exact date on it but I will make it a priority that the plans for the refurbishment of the Garda station are put in hand and that the present situation, which is unacceptable, will be addressed. I accept the point that gardaí who are asked to operate out of temporary premises are entitled to see some light at the end of the tunnel and, if not, it will affect their morale. It is bound to affect the morale of a station party which is trying to serve its local community. It is all the more reason this matter should be dealt with.The Garda Síochána has 703 stations in Ireland, in addition to other complexes such as Templemore, Garda Headquarters and many other facilities. I want to make it clear, because we sometimes hear about insufficient investment in the Garda Síochána, that the Garda budget has never been larger. A sum of €1.1 billion goes through my Department to it, while the Office of Public Works in a separate Vote has plans to invest more than €112 million in Garda station projects from the beginning of 2005 to the end of 2007, which is a significant sum of money by any standards.I propose to introduce change in the capacity of the State services to deal with these problems in a timely fashion. This triangular relationship between the Office of Public Works, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the housing section of the Garda Síochána, which in some instances becomes a quadrilateral involving the Chief State Solicitor and other agencies, is not working as well as it should. I want to enhance that process to ensure that projects are well managed in an energetic way.I am grateful to the Deputy for raising the issue. I convey to his constituents and the station party in Dunmanway that I regard this a priority and will make early progress in this regard. I regret that the project was stalled for so long.On a brighter note, it was a pleasure to visit Bantry and to open the magnificent new headquarters in the company of Deputy O'Donovan and others. I invite anyone who wants to see good quality Garda accommodation to visit the building which is a model for the rest of the country.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	358	I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 29, 53, 63 and 68 together.Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme administered on my behalf by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive, a weekly or monthly rent or mortgage interest supplement is available to assist eligible people who are unable to meet their immediate accommodation needs through their own resources.In recent years, a significant number of people have come to rely on rent supplements for extended periods. In response to this situation, the Government introduced a new initiative in July 2004 aimed at meeting the longer-term housing needs of these people.These new rental assistance arrangements give local authorities responsibility for meeting long-term housing assistance needs, including the needs of those people on rent supplements for 18 months or longer. Local authorities will meet the housing needs of these individuals through a range of approaches including the traditional range of social housing options, the voluntary housing sector and, in particular, a new public-private partnership type rental accommodation scheme. Some €19 million has been transferred from my Department's Vote to that of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government this year to help finance this initiative and similar arrangements will apply in successive years as the new arrangements develop.The new arrangements are being implemented currently in 11 local authority areas. These are the lead authority areas of Dublin, Galway and Limerick City Councils and South Dublin County Council which encompass the most extensive urban areas in the State. Drogheda Town Council, Donegal County Council and counties Offaly and Westmeath are also participating in the first phase. In addition, Cork City and County Councils and South Tipperary County Council are also now implementing the arrangements. These new arrangements will be initiated in all local authority areas by the end of 2005.The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has appointed programme managers to assist the lead authorities with the implementation of the new arrangements. These managers are also available to support other authorities over the implementation period. Implementation groups are in place in the lead authority areas to ensure effective ongoing liaison and co-operation locally between housing authorities, Health Service Executive area managements and other agencies.The aim of the new system is to minimise ongoing dependence on rent supplement by progressing to a situation where local authority accommodation is available for all of those with a long term housing need. The plan is that this situation will be achieved within a period of three years from commencement of the new arrangements in each local authority, and in any event no later than September 2008. The rent supplement scheme will continue to provide support to those who have a short-term housing need.In October 2005, there are 59,141 households in receipt of assistance under the rent supplement scheme. Over half of these, almost 33,000 tenants, have been on the scheme for 18 months or more. My Department and the Health Service Executive are actively assisting the local authorities and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in implementing the new arrangements.For example, that Department has been supplied with detailed information in relation to the 33,000 people who have been on rent supplement for 18 months or more. My Department has also provided these details to each of the local authority appointed programme managers. The Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government has indicated that 31 tenants had transferred to the rental accommodation scheme by September of this year.The scheme involves structured arrangements to secure long-term availability of privately rented accommodation, particularly accommodation currently occupied by tenants in receipt of rent supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, and to encourage the supply of additional accommodation.Implementation of the new arrangements are being closely monitored by both Departments on an ongoing basis. Progress reports are to be submitted to Government at intervals during the implementation phase. The first such report was made in June 2005. An independent initial evaluation of the implementation process will also be undertaken. This evaluation will consider any further measures required to ensure that local authorities are making sufficient progress on the action plan. A further independent post-implementation review will be carried out in October 2008 to evaluate the effectiveness of the action plan in achieving its objectives and to make recommendations to secure these objectives into the future.When fully operational, the rental accommodation scheme will cater for people with a longer-term accommodation need that they are unable to meet from their own resources. Everyone in this category will be eligible for some form of assistance from their local authority under the scheme, whether that is contracted rental accommodation, voluntary housing or a local authority house. Local authorities are in the process of negotiating with landlords to form a stock of contracted accommodation, as well as negotiating with the existing landlords of tenants on rent supplement.In this interim phase while they are doing so, it is possible that local authorities may not be able to provide a suitable accommodation arrangement in particular cases, either through lack of immediate availability, or due to some problem with the person's existing accommodation. It is expected that local authorities will deal with any such situation, and provide a suitable solution under the scheme. If they cannot do so immediately for some reason, there is no question of the persons concerned being left without housing support, as rent supplement will continued to be provided by my Department in their existing accommodation on a pro tem basis until the situation is resolved.The new rental assistance arrangements represent a major step forward in supporting people with longer-term housing needs. There will undoubtedly be problems in developing a comprehensive range of options under the scheme to match demand. Nonetheless, I am satisfied that all of the relevant agencies are co-operating actively to make the system work successfully.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	359	I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 22, 79 and 86 together.The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are in receipt of long-term social welfare or Health Service Executive payments towards the cost of their additional heating needs during the winter season. Fuel allowances are paid currently for 29 weeks from end-September to mid-April each year. Some 274,000 households benefit under the scheme at a cost of €85.4 million in 2005. An allowance of €9 per week is paid to eligible households during this 29-week winter heating period. An additional €3.90 per week is paid to about 123,000 clients living in the designated urban smokeless fuel zones, bringing the amount payable in those areas to €12.90 per week.In addition to fuel allowance, over 300,000 pensioner and other households qualify for electricity or gas allowances through the household benefits package, payable towards their heating, light and cooking costs throughout the year, at an overall cost of €108.8 million in 2005. As structured, these allowances are linked to unit energy consumption, so that these people are protected against unit price increases in electricity or gas.It is worth noting that according to my Department's computer records, there is a total of 140,000 people in receipt of both the fuel allowance and the household benefits package. There is also a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs. An application for a heating supplement may be made by contacting a community welfare officer at any local health centre.Fuel allowances are a supplementary entitlement payable for part of the year, over the winter heating season. The Government has concentrated budget resources on providing significant real increases each year in all primary social welfare pension, benefit and assistance rates. This is a more costly approach than increasing fuel allowances but it delivers a better outcome for pensioners and others by substantially increasing their income in real terms over the whole year, to better assist them in meeting their normal basic living costs.Increases in the rate or duration of the fuel allowance would have significant cost implications. For example, increasing the duration of the fuel allowance by one week would cost just under €3 million per annum. Increasing the fuel allowance by €1 per week would cost €8 million per annum. Given these significant potential extra scheme costs involved, any increases in fuel allowance rates or scheme duration would be matters to be considered in the context of the budget, and in the light of my plans for increases in social welfare rates generally. I am keeping the fuel allowance scheme under close review and I will consult as necessary with my cabinet colleagues in this regard.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	360	The Construction Federation operatives pensions scheme operates as a registered employment agreement under the Industrial Relations Acts. There is a statutory obligation on employers to register eligible employees in the scheme and to pay the necessary contributions.Compliance with the terms of the scheme is enforced through the Construction Industry Monitoring Agency, the Labour Court and the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment. The Pensions Board also has a role in relation to the scheme in so far as compliance with the various aspects of the Pensions Act are concerned. However, the main difficulties with the scheme relate to failure to register employees and-or to deduct contributions to the scheme and these issues are a matter for the Construction Industry Monitoring Agency, the Labour Court and the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment.The Pensions Board has a very limited role in ensuring compliance with the scheme in question. However, because of ongoing controversy in relation to the scheme and compliance with its terms, the board recently facilitated a report on the scheme in conjunction with the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment.The report was undertaken by Mercer and it found that 80% of the estimated 80,000 eligible employees in the industry are covered by the scheme. However, the report does highlight the fact that an estimated 70,000 operatives are classed as self-employed and are therefore not eligible to join the scheme.Mercer has made a range of recommendations designed to improve compliance with the scheme involving my Department, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners and copies of the report have been provided to the relevant Ministers.In relation to my own Department, Mercer has suggested that the scheme should be operated through the PRSI system. Obviously, such a development could have serious implications for the Department and these are at present being assessed. Apart from the issue of resources, a key question in relation to the recommendation is the extent to which the Department can, or should, involve itself in what is a private pension scheme.In addition, following a meeting I had with trade unions representing construction workers, I wrote to the Minister for Finance requesting that the companies awarded public sector contracts should be fully compliant as regards the requirements under the Construction Federation operatives pensions scheme.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	361	I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 17, 27, 50 and 54 together.My Department provides child income support in a number of ways. The principal support is child benefit, a universal payment which is neutral vis-à-vis the employment status of the child’s parents and does not contribute to poverty traps. Over the period since 1997, the monthly rates of child benefit have increased by €103.51 at the lower rate and €127.78 at the higher rate, increases of 272% and 258%, respectively.Child benefit rates now stand at €141.60 per month for each of the first two children and €177.30 per month for the third and each subsequent child. Child benefit is paid to over 530,000 families is respect of over 1,020,000 children. A second child income support is the child dependant allowance, paid in addition to weekly social welfare payments in respect of over 257,000 children at full rate and over 85,000 at half rate.Since 1994, successive Governments have held the rate of child dependant allowances constant while concentrating resources for child income support on the child benefit scheme. It is important to recognise that over that period, the combined weekly value of child benefit and child dependant allowance has increased by more than double the rate of inflation.In addition, my Department provides cash support by way of weekly payments to families at work on low pay, through the family income supplement scheme. A number of improvements have been made to the scheme over the years, including assessment of entitlement on the basis of net rather than gross income and progressive increases in the income thresholds, making it easier for lower income households to qualify for payment. As a result, there are currently over 15,800 families receiving a weekly FIS payment, reaching nearly 31,186 children. This is the highest number of FIS recipients in the history of the scheme.The back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme operates from the beginning of June to the end of September each year and is administered on behalf of my Department by the Health Service Executive. This payment is made in respect of a child if the parent is in receipt of a social welfare or health board payment, is participating in an approved employment scheme or attending a recognised education or training course and has household income at or below certain set levels. Under the scheme an allowance is payable in respect of qualified children aged from two years to 22 years.In 2004, over 70,500 applications were approved under the scheme, benefiting some 153,400 children at a cost of €17 million. This year it is expected that the scheme will cost €18 million and that a similar number of children will benefit.While this range of income and other supports has made very significant contributions to families with children, a key issue arises as to whether this level of resources is best used to address poverty among those families. While the solutions to this problem cover a wide range of measures including income supports and services, I am committed to reviewing the role of child income supports in this regard. The social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, also recognised the importance of targeting child income support at low-income families with a commitment to examine the effectiveness of current arrangements.The National Economic and Social Council was asked to undertake an examination of the possible merging of family income supplement and child dependant allowance into a second tier child income support. Such a payment would be aimed specifically at targeting child poverty by channelling resources to low-income families without creating significant disincentives to employment. The NESC is currently considering its draft report and I look forward to receiving a finalised report shortly.I have committed myself to finding solutions by making sensible decisions that have at their core increased support for those who feel most vulnerable, neglected or apprehensive in our society, while at the same time working to bring about reforms that go behind the payments and aggressively strike at the very heart of the social issues that give rise to the need for welfare supports in the first place.In this context I look forward to receiving the NESC report, which will be of significant assistance in informing the future direction of child income support policy.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	362	I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 35 together.The homemaker's scheme which was introduced in 1994 is intended to mitigate the effect of periods spent on caring duties when a person's insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes. The scheme allows up to 20 years spent on caring duties to be disregarded when a person's insurance record is being averaged to assess entitlement for contributory pension purposes. For any year to be disregarded a homemaker must be out of the workforce for a complete year — 52 weeks — from 6 April 1994. Provision is also made for the award of credited contributions in the year in which a person commences or ceases to be a homemaker.However, it must be borne in mind that the scheme will not of itself qualify a person for a pension. The standard qualifying conditions for pensions, which require a person to enter insurance ten years before pension age, pay a minimum of 260 contributions at the correct rate and achieve a yearly average of at least ten contributions on their record from the time they enter insurance until they reach pension age must also be satisfied.The proposals to change the operative date of the homemaker's scheme and to replace the disregard system with one based on actual credited contributions are contained in the review of the qualifying conditions for old age contributory and retirement pensions. In relation to the question of changing the disregard system to one based on credits, this is at present under active consideration by my Department.In general, changes to insurability of employment etc. are not backdated and the same principle was applied to the homemaker's scheme in 1994. The question of backdating the homemaker's scheme to 1953 when the unified system of social insurance came into operation gives rise to difficult and complex issues, not least of which is the position of other groups excluded from social insurance cover over the years and who do not qualify for contributory pensions.Apart from that, there would be very practical difficulties in certifying periods of caring and very significant costs involved. In relation to the latter, a significant part of any cost will involve improved payments to those who may already be receiving reduced rate pensions.The Government is anxious to ensure that as many people as possible can qualify for pensions in their own right. A number of measures have been introduced over the years which make it easier for people to qualify for pensions. These include the reduction in the yearly average number of contributions required for pension purposes from 20 to ten and the special half rate pension based on pre-53 insurance contributions.Pro rata pensions are also available to allow people with mixed rate insurance records to receive a payment and this is of benefit to people who may have worked in both the public and private sectors. This set of measures is of particular benefit to women who may have less than complete social insurance records due to working in the home. It is estimated that approximately 87% of women aged 65 years of age are at present receiving social welfare support, either in their own right or as qualified adults on the pension of their spouse or partner.I am examining aspects of the social welfare pension system. This includes the relationship between contributory and non-contributory schemes and the operation of means testing in the context of old age non-contributory pension. The needs of people  who are outside the social welfare pensions system, including those excluded by virtue of time spent on caring duties, may be best addressed in the context of that review.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	363	As the Deputy will be aware, there are three social welfare schemes providing pensions for older people — old age contributory pension, retirement pension and old age non-contributory pension. In the case of the first two, these are contributory schemes payable at 66 and 65, respectively. People who receive old age contributory pension can work without restriction while those applying for retirement pension at age 65 must be retired from employment or self-employment. Retirement is defined as not having earnings from employment of more than €38 per week or earnings from self-employment of more than €3,174 per annum.However, given the improvements in life expectancy which have occurred in recent decades and the demographic changes our society will face in the years ahead, it is important that we should encourage and facilitate people who wish to extend their working lives to remain active. In the circumstances, the Government is committed, as part of the programme for Government, to removing the requirement to retire at 65 in order to receive a retirement pension. The old age non-contributory pension is different in nature to the contributory schemes.In common with other social assistance schemes the old age non-contributory pension features a means test which is intended to ensure that available resources are targeted at those who are most in need. The means test is continually kept under review and in June this year a change in the assessment of capital was introduced which allows for capital of €20,000 to be disregarded when eligibility for old age pensions is being assessed. This figure is doubled in the case of pensioner couples.However, at present people on non-contributory pensions can only earn up to €7.60 per week without payment of their pension being affected. It is important that we also provide incentives and choices within the non-contributory scheme for older people to remain active in the workforce, if that is their wish.The very limited disregard which is available on earnings may act as a disincentive to people to continue working and, accordingly, I am at present examining the situation. Possible changes will be considered in a budgetary context, and in the overall context of social policy reforms.

This can arise as a result of being widowed, or following separation or divorce, or being unmarried.One of the objectives of the one parent family payment is to encourage lone parents to consider employment as an alternative to welfare dependency, while at the same time supporting them where they choose to care for their children in the home.The main element of this policy is an earnings disregard of €146.50 per week. Earnings above this limit are assessed at 50%, up to a maximum of €293 per week. There are also transitional arrangements in place whereby a lone parent who exceeds the earnings threshold may retain 50% of his or her payment for a further six months. Any changes to the disregard or the upper limit would fall to be considered in a budgetary context and also in the context of broader social policy reforms in this area. Lone parents who exceed the upper income limit applying under the one parent family payment may be eligible for the family income supplement. The family income supplement, by providing cash support for employees with families on low earnings, preserves the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if he or she were claiming other social welfare payments.It is generally accepted that for people in working age households, the main route out of poverty is employment. The OECD, in a recent report on an international comparative study on reconciling work and family life, found that employment participation among lone parents in this country is among the lowest in the OECD. This is despite the huge employment growth and increasing female participation in the workforce in recent years and the income disregards afforded to lone parents under the one parent family payment who take up employment.One of the key tasks in the Ending Child Poverty initiative under Sustaining Progress is to address obstacles to employment for lone parents. The senior officials group on social inclusion was mandated late last year to examine this issue and report back to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion with specific proposals.A subgroup of the senior officials group has been examining obstacles to employment for lone parent families, with particular emphasis on income supports, employment, education, child care and support programmes and information.We must also look closely at income supports and at how we can adjust those supports to better address the social problems that can arise for those who receive these payments. In this regard, my Department has established a working group to review the income support arrangements for lone parents. Issues being addressed include the contingency basis of the one parent family payment, cohabitation, maintenance and secondary benefits. A consultation process with social partners and other interested parties was also undertaken to inform the work of the group. The findings of this group are feeding into the work of the senior officials subgroup.The Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion has been updated on the progress of both working groups. I will bring the final reports to Cabinet shortly. It is intended that the outcome of these reviews will contribute to the designs of proposals aimed at better supporting and encouraging lone parents to achieve a better standard of living, employment and education opportunities, and a better future for themselves and their children. These will be the main criteria against which recommendations in the reports will be judged. I am committed to reforms that will improve the quality of life for lone parents and their children by offering them respect and support while avoiding poverty traps.

From 23 September 2005, these certificates must be submitted every three years. The annual report of the Pensions Board shows that of the 596 schemes which submitted funding certificates in 2004, 240 — or 40% — of them failed to meet the funding standard. Where a scheme does not meet the funding standard, a funding proposal, designed to restore the scheme to full funding, must be submitted to the Pensions Board. The annual report also shows that, by the end of 2004, 189 of these schemes had submitted recovery plans to the Pensions Board designed to ensure a structured return to full funding over specific periods.The funding standard, which applies to funded defined benefit, DB, occupational pension schemes, is a wind-up standard. It is designed to ensure that, if a funded DB scheme winds up, there are sufficient assets to meet the liabilities at that point in time. In the event of a scheme being unable to meet this standard it must prepare a recovery plan designed to ensure a return to full funding within three years.This standard has been in place for almost 15 years and, up to about 2000, few schemes had any real difficulty in meeting the standard. However, since then a number of factors, in particular economic and financial developments, have had an adverse impact on scheme funding.In 2003, my predecessor, Deputy Coughlan, introduced short-term measures designed to alleviate the funding crisis in pension schemes caused by the investment losses that many schemes suffered at that time. These measures provided that, where the funding difficulties were due to investment losses, the recovery plan could be effected over a longer period of up to ten years or, in exceptional circumstances, longer. These recovery plans must be agreed by the Pensions Board.In order to develop a longer-term response to these and other issues, the Pensions Board carried out a review of the funding standard, which was submitted to me in December 2004. That review recommended retention of the short term provisions introduced in 2003, which it found were largely successful in assisting schemes to overcome their funding difficulties.The review further found that the liability side of pension funds is also under pressure through, amongst other things, improved longevity and lower interest rates. To deal with this, the review recommended that an extension to the period allowed for recovery plans should also be granted in relation to difficulties on the liability side. Provision for these changes was made in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2004 and the details of the additional reliefs granted were contained in regulations which I signed into law with effect from 23 September this year.In reviewing the funding standard, the Pensions Board was anxious to ensure that a reasonable balance was struck between the protection of the interests of scheme members and the interests of employers who sponsor and contribute to schemes. At the end of the day, our overall objective must be to encourage continued pension provision through defined benefit schemes. The measures which I introduced this year achieve that balance. I will, however, keep this situation under review in consultation with the Pensions Board.

Since 2000 this approach has been augmented by the inclusion of a specific commitment to service in Irish in the existing principles of quality customer service which are in operation Civil Service-wide. To meet these objectives, the Department has implemented a number of initiatives including specialised training of staff, translation of forms and information leaflets on an incremental basis and bilingual signage.The Official Languages Act impacts on my Department in three ways. Some elements of the Act are already in force and have direct application. These include responding to correspondence in the language in which it is written and publishing certain documents in both official languages simultaneously. There will be a range of commitments under the statutory scheme required under section 11 of the Act. At present, my Department's scheme is under consideration by the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. The details of certain other commitments under the Act will be contained in regulations which have not yet been introduced.As my Department has always endeavoured to provide a quality customer service in Irish, it is not possible to separate out the cost of the Act from the cost of providing services generally in Irish. However, the costs of providing some elements of Irish service can be readily identified, as follows: specialised staff training for the years 2003, 2004 and 2005 to date cost €123,345. It is estimated that a further €81,500 will be spent by the end of 2005.In the same period, translation of forms, leaflets and other documents cost €124,247. The forms and leaflets are now available on the website of my Department while many internal documents are available electronically to all staff. It must also be acknowledged that an element of staff costs arises each year when staff who are proficient in Irish translate material as required.The cost of advertising in Irish since 2003 amounts to €35,431. This includes the cost of placing a notice in the press in November 2004 notifying the public of the Department's intention to prepare a draft scheme and invite representations from interested parties, as required under the Act.The provision of bilingual signage in public areas cost €103,932 over this period. In the absence of an agreed scheme and of the regulations to be introduced under the Act, it is not possible to state what the cost of implementing the Act will be. When these two requirements of the Act are introduced, the level of Irish service to customers will accelerate and consequently the costs will increase. This increased cost will be part of the delivery of public service to which all citizens are entitled.The purpose of the Act is to achieve incremental improvements in Irish service provision across Departments and a range of other service providers. We would, therefore, expect that the services provided would grow and evolve over time. Consequently, it is difficult to say what these services would cost.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	367	I welcome the ESRI report, Trends in Welfare for Vulnerable Groups, 1994-2001, which will be a useful addition to the research on poverty levels for vulnerable groups. The report provides an insight into the situation of these groups in terms of their risk of experiencing poverty and social exclusion.Although this report refers to the period from 1994 to 2001, a combination of economic growth and active labour market policies has led to Ireland maintaining its strong employment performance in the years since then. The overall employment rate increased from 65.7% at the end of 2003 to 66.7% at the end of 2004. The overall labour force participation rate was 61% at the end of 2004.It is important to recognise that these polices have seen a significant reduction in the actual number of persons whom the ESRI categorise as being in the economically vulnerable class, that is, persons experiencing relative income poverty, basic deprivation and economic strain. In 1994 about three in ten persons were in this category. By 2001, the ESRI states this had fallen to just one in nine.Since 2001, active labour market policies have continued, as has the policy of increasing social welfare payments well above the rate of inflation. One of the consequences of the rapid economic growth experienced in Ireland has been significant increases in net household incomes from employment and profits. There have also been substantial increases in real terms in social welfare payments, but these have not been at the same pace as the increases in incomes generally. The recent UN Human Development Report showed, however, that when measured using the anchored poverty line approach, which adjusts poverty lines each year according to changes in consumer prices, the level of poverty actually fell in Ireland by 55.9% between 1994 and 2000. The policies that produced this outcome have continued to apply since 2000.The causes of poverty are many. Working to eradicate it requires action across a range of different policy areas. The Government strategy includes actions in relation to employment, social welfare, education, health, housing, equality and so on. The strategic approach in the national action plan against poverty and social exclusion, NAP/inclusion, means that these actions are being co-ordinated in an integrated joined-up way by the office for social inclusion, which is located in my Department. It also means that through this process the experience and best practice of the other 24 EU countries can be readily availed of in developing and implementing effective policies to combat poverty and in evaluating their implementation.The higher than average risk of poverty for certain vulnerable groups, such as those identified in the ESRI report, means that targeted efforts are required for persons in these groups. This is why the NAP/inclusion specifically contains targets and commitment for these, and other, vulnerable groups, designed to alleviate the cumulative factors which result in their higher than average risk of poverty rates. A key set of factors in this regard are the barriers to employment in relation, for example, to lack of education and training, to lack child care and other services that can prevent people getting well paid jobs — the best route out of poverty. The upcoming consultation process for the next NAP/inclusion, to be produced in late 2006, will include a renewed focus on vulnerable groups, with a view to identifying policies, such as those for removing barriers to employment, to improve their situation.

It is also available to carers and to people with disabilities who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments. It applies to travel within the State and cross border journeys between here and Northern Ireland.The scheme provides free travel on the main public and private transport services for those eligible under the scheme. These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann, as well as services provided by over 80 private transport operators. The vast majority of private contractors providing services under the scheme operate in rural areas. The underlying feature of the scheme is the use of spare capacity on these transport services.I am always willing to consider applications from licensed private transport operators who may wish to participate in the free travel scheme. However, while my Department pays transport providers to operate the free travel scheme, it is not in a position to provide transport services where none exist.Various alternatives to the existing system, including the use of vouchers, have been examined. A study published in 2000 under the Department's programme of expenditure reviews concluded that a voucher type system, which would be open to a wide range of transport providers including taxis and hackneys, would be extremely difficult to administer, open to abuse and unlikely to be sufficient to afford an acceptable amount of travel. This position remains unchanged.The issue of access to public transport in rural areas is being addressed at present through the rural transport initiative, which is being managed by Area Development Management on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Transport. My Department contributed €500,000 to the initiative in 2004 and is contributing €575,000 for the initiative for 2005. This will ensure that free travel pass holders continue to have full access to community based transport services.There have been a number of requests and inquiries in relation to the extension of entitlement to free travel to Irish born people living outside Ireland, particularly in the UK. This issue has now been examined in considerate detail. The legal advice available to me is that such a proposal would be contrary to the EC Treaty, which prohibits discrimination on the grounds of nationality. While taking this advice on board, I intend to continue to examine any options that remain available.Significant improvements have been made to the free schemes, including the free travel scheme, in recent budgets both in terms of the qualifying conditions and the coverage of the schemes. I will continue to review the operation of these schemes with a view to identifying the scope for further improvements as resources permit.

Fuel allowances are paid for 29 weeks from end-September to mid-April. Some 274,000 customers — 151,000 with basic fuel allowance and 123,000 with smokeless fuel supplement — benefit under the scheme at a cost of €85.4 million in 2005.Under the scheme a fuel allowance of €9 per week is paid to eligible households during this 29-week winter heating period, with an additional €3.90 per week being paid in the designated urban smokeless fuel zones, bringing the total amount in those areas to €12.90 per week. In the course of a routine review of fuel allowance payments, it came to light that payments had been made in error to certain recipients who were in, or had moved to, local authority accommodation with subsidised or low-cost heating. The allowances in question, which should not have been put in payment in the first place, were withdrawn in these cases with effect from the start of this winter heating season. The allowance was not included in their new pension books or in EFT payments. My Department is not seeking repayment of the overpayment of the allowance which arose as a result of the error.The main purpose of the review was to ensure that the allowance eligibility rules were being applied correctly and consistently. It is estimated that scheme expenditure savings resulting from this review are of the order of €90,000 in a full year.As a long-standing policy within the scheme, fuel allowances are not payable in situations where a person has access to their own fuel supply or is benefiting from a subsidised or low-cost heating service, such as those provided by Dublin City Council at a number of its housing complexes.The basis for this condition of the scheme is that the contribution that local authority tenants in communal heating situations make towards their heating costs is limited to a fixed and relatively small amount, typically around €6 per week, included as part of their overall rent charge. Unlike other tenants and social welfare clients generally, who must buy their own fuel at prevailing retail cost, these tenants are protected from increases in heating costs, the true cost of which is subsidised significantly by Dublin City Council and the other local authorities concerned.It would be inequitable to retain the allowance in the case of the people concerned in this particular review when neighbouring tenants in very similar circumstances are not eligible and are managing their budgets accordingly. The fact is that these people either were awarded in error initially, or retained a previous legitimate allowance entitlement inadvertently when they moved to accommodation subsequently with subsidised heating.More generally, I am keeping fuel allowances under review. However, any change to the scheme would have very significant cost implications and would have to be considered in the context of the budget, and in the light of the resources available to me for improvements in social welfare generally.

Government policy as regards social welfare rates is guided by the commitment in the revised national anti-poverty strategy to increase the lowest social welfare rates to €150 per week — in 2002 terms — by 2007 and to set the appropriate equivalence level of child income support, child benefit and child dependant allowances combined, at 33 to 35% of the adult rates. We remain on target to achieve this objective.The question refers to a poverty line of €199.43 per week for a single person. This figure has been estimated by the CORI justice commission as being the equivalent of the 60% median poverty line for a single person in 2005. It is based on data gathered by the EU SILC survey for 2003 updated to 2005 levels, using estimated increases in average industrial earnings. This is the so-called at risk of poverty indicator which is one of a range of measures used by the EU to measure poverty and social exclusion.The relative income measure is essentially about inequality of incomes. It identifies those with an income below 60% of the median income for society as a whole, who as a result may be at risk of poverty. The poverty measure which underpins the revised NAPS is the consistent poverty measure which identifies those who are both at risk of poverty and who are also deprived of certain items, which Irish people consider are necessary to ensure a basic standard of living. I am committed to reforms that will improve the quality of life for all persons relying on social welfare payments.

It was introduced in the context of the Government's decision to open the Irish labour market to workers from the new EU member states without the limitations being imposed at that time by many of the other member states.The effect of the condition is that a person whose habitual residence is elsewhere is not paid certain social welfare payments on arrival in Ireland, regardless of citizenship, nationality, immigration status or any other factor. The EU Commission wrote to the Government on 22 December 2004 raising a number of issues concerning its compliance with EU law in relation to workers and their families.Officials from this Department and the Attorney General's office met Commission officials on 15 May last to discuss the issues raised and explained that the operation of the new condition was fully in line with the criteria set out in European Court of Justice case law. These are: the length and continuity of residence in a particular country; the length and purpose of absence from Ireland; the nature and pattern of the employment; the applicant's main centre of interest; the future intention of applicant concerned as it appears from all the circumstances.In addition, full consideration is given in the decision making process to the requirements of EU legislation regarding free movement of workers. Rules which apply to migrant workers, that is, persons who have taken up employment in Ireland following their arrival here, are strictly observed.A formal response by the EU Commission to the points made is still awaited. It is expected that the Commission's examination of the matter will be concluded to the satisfaction of both parties by the end of this year.There are no plans to remove the habitual residence condition at this time. The operation of the habitual residence condition has been monitored constantly by my Department since its introduction. A comprehensive review of the operation of the condition is currently being carried out by my officials.Account is being taken of the views received from various groups and organisations who have an interest in the area. If, following the review, I consider that it is necessary to make changes I will bring forward proposals to Cabinet. I expect the review to be completed by the end of the year.

At present, there are 150 money advisers and 78 administrative staff working in the MABS. A total of €13.62 million has been allocated to the service in 2005, which is an increase of €2.2 million over the 2004 allocations.During the 12 month period up to December 2004, the Money Advice and Budgeting Service dealt with approximately 16,000 new clients. It deals with approximately 13,600 clients on an ongoing basis. An average of 1,700 persons per month visit the MABS website at www.mabs.ie.A detailed breakdown of the current amount of debt and average earnings sought by the Deputy is not available. However, these matters were examined in 2000. At that time income levels of MABS clients were generally low. Approximately one third of clients had an income of less than £5,000 and a further 50% had incomes between £5,000 and £12,000. Some 71 % of clients were in receipt of some sort of social welfare.At that time MABS clients owed over £20 million in total debt to various creditors. Approximately £7 million or one third of total debt was in arrears. The main organisations that arrears were owed to were financial institutions — 44% of arrears and 40% of clients — local authorities — 9% of arrears and 31% of clients — utilities — 6% of arrears and up to 41% of clients depending on the utility involved — and moneylenders — 3% of arrears and 10% of clients.The majority of clients had at least two debts in arrears. Nearly one quarter had six or more debts in arrears. One third of clients had total arrears of under £200; one third had arrears ranging between £200 and £999 while the remaining third had arrears in excess of £1,000.The MABS has just developed a new software application Money Advice and Budgeting Service integrated system, MABSIS, which will enable a fully automated payment system to be put in place on a national basis. This software application will have a database that facilitates the entry and management of a range of data relevant to the work of MABS. Reports will be produced to facilitate the efficient management of each MABS office and for policy purposes.

It is neutral vis-à-vis the employment status of the child’s parents and maximises choice for parents. Child benefit is paid monthly in advance to over 530,000 families is respect of over 1,020,000 children.Child benefit rates now stand at €141.60 per month for each of the first two children and to €177.30 per month for the third and each subsequent child. Over the period since 1997, monthly rates of child benefit have increased by €103.51 at the lower rate and €127.78 at the higher rate, increases of 272% and 258%, respectively. In the same period the consumer price index has increased by 31%. Therefore this Government has delivered increases in child benefit well in excess of that which price indexation would provide.At present there are no plans to move child benefit to a weekly payment. It should be noted that child benefit is paid in advance and if payments were made on a weekly basis the recipient would receive most payments at a later date than is now the case. A move to weekly payments would also have significant administrative implications, including additional costs. Any child benefit rate increase would have to be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of competing priorities, and of broader social policy reforms.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	374	I propose to take Questions Nos. 32, 34, 49, 51, 91, 97 and 219 together.According to census 2002, there are 48,500 people providing personal care for over four hours per day. Almost 25,450 of these are in receipt of either carer's allowance or carer's benefit. This means that over 52% of the 48,500 carers, as estimated by the CSO to be caring for more than four hours per day, are in receipt of a specific carer's payment from my Department.Supporting carers in our society has been a priority of the Government since 1997. Over that period, weekly payment rates to carers have been greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer's allowance have been significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer's benefit and the respite care grant have been introduced.The report of the joint Oireachtas committee, which I examined when it was published last year, makes a range of recommendations, many of which relate to my Department and a number of which concern the Department of Health and Children. In response to the committee, which stated that the greatest need identified by family carers is the need for a break from caring, I made provision in budget 2005 to improve and extend the respite care grant in the following ways.From June this year, in accordance with the Government's commitment in our programme for Government to introduce significant increases in the value of the respite care grant, I increased the amount of the grant from €835 to €1,000 annually. Provision was made for the extension of the respite care grant to all carers who are providing full time care to a person who needs such care regardless of their means. This means that the respite care grant is now paid to persons providing full-time care but who are on another social welfare payment, excluding unemployment assistance and benefit. It is also paid to carers who do not currently receive a weekly social welfare payment from my Department. The grant continues to be paid automatically to those who are in receipt of carer's payments. My third improvement to the respite care grant was to pay a grant in respect of each person receiving care. This means that a carer who is providing care for more than two people receives a grant in respect of each person for whom she-he is caring. Previously a maximum of two grants was paid. I have done this to recognise the particular challenges, which are faced by carers who are caring for several people.To date, over 30,000 respite care grants have been paid by my Department and applications for the grant continue to be received in my Department. Another of the committee's recommendations which relates to my Department is to pay 505 of the carer's allowance to recipients of widows and widowers pensions who are providing care for an older person or a person with a disability. The Deputy will be aware that the primary objective of the social welfare system is to provide income support and, as a general rule, only one weekly social welfare payment is payable to an individual so as to ensure that resources are not used to make two income support payments to any one person. However, in light of the representations made to me and my own commitment to the cause of carers I intend to keep this issue under regular review.With regard to the Carer's Association's, Towards a Family Carer's Strategy, I had the pleasure last May of launching this document. The strategy is a focused document with very clear objectives and actions. These objectives and actions cover a range of areas and Departments, including income support and health related issues. I was particularly interested in the views expressed in the strategy in relation to encouraging carers to participate in the labour force. As I have previously mentioned in the House, my officials have been examining proposals regarding care sharing. I am delighted to be in a position to inform the Deputies that care-sharing situations can now be accommodated on the carer's allowance scheme.This measure allows two carers who are providing full-time care on a part-time basis in an established pattern to share the carer's allowance income support payment and the annual respite care grant. Both carers will receive the household benefits package of free schemes.My Department can also accommodate the carer who is providing care on a part-time basis, say on alternate weeks and where the care recipient attends a residential institution every other week. All of the usual qualifying conditions for carer's allowance will apply to carers availing of these arrangements. This increased flexibility in the carer's allowance scheme will allow carers to combine the provision of care to a person who requires full-time care and attention and participation in the labour force.The Carer's Association, in its strategy, also calls for special help, advice and support for young carers who are caring for a parent and in particular, it is seeking essential supports to ensure that young carers remain at school. I was most concerned to learn that some school-going children may be in this position and I accept that this is an issue which needs to be examined. However, as the Deputies are aware, my Department's role in the area of care is the payment of weekly income support payments to full-time carers. My colleagues in the Department of Health and Children may be better placed to address the issues relating to such carers.I have mentioned in the House before that a long-term care working group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach and comprising senior officials from the Departments of Finance, Health and Children and Social and Family Affairs is due to report to the Tánaiste and to me shortly. The objective of this group is to identify the policy options for a financially sustainable system of long-term care, taking account of the Mercer report, the views of the consultation that was undertaken on that report and the review of the nursing home subvention scheme by Eamon O'Shea. The issues raised in the Carer's Association's strategy will also be included in the group's deliberations.I am always prepared to consider changes to existing arrangements where these are for the benefit of recipients and financially sustainable within the resources available to me. Those recommendations involving additional expenditure will be considered in a budgetary context. I will continue to review the issues raised by the Carer's Association, the joint Oireachtas committee and other bodies representing carers.

This survey replaces the living in Ireland survey, LIIS, which was conducted by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, until 2001 and which provided data on consistent and relative poverty up to that year.The consistent poverty measure is used in this country to identify those experiencing basic deprivation. This is calculated by identifying from among those at risk of poverty, that is, with incomes below the 60% median income threshold, EU threshold, those who are also deprived of basic goods and services regarded as essential for living in Ireland today. The number of households experiencing consistent poverty, based on results of the LIIS, fell continuously from 15.1% in 1994 to 5.2% in 2001. The 2003 results from the EU-SILC indicated that the rate of consistent poverty was 10.2%. However, both the CSO and the ESRI have made it clear that methodological differences between the two surveys mean that the figures for 2001 and 2003 are not comparable and that it is therefore not possible to conclude from them whether the level of consistent poverty changed over the period.The Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion, prior to the issue of the EU-SILC results, approved a review of the method of poverty measurement in Ireland. This work is being progressed as part of the NAPS data strategy and co-ordinated by the office for social inclusion located in my Department. A consultative seminar on the issue recently took place involving all the key stakeholders. The aim is to have a revised approach ready for consideration in the context of the preparation of the next national action plan due in September 2006.Despite the latest EU-SILC results, there is certainly no reason to believe that there has been a worsening in poverty levels in recent years. The UN Human Development report for 2005 in a section entitled, Two tales of Irish poverty, applied the anchored poverty line approach to measuring poverty trends in Ireland between 1994 and 2000. This approach involves maintaining the initial year poverty line, in this case for 1994, and adjusting it for each subsequent year according to changes in consumer prices. Using this method, the report showed that the level of poverty in Ireland in 2000 had fallen by 55.9% compared with the actual level in 1994.A similar trend is likely to have continued since 2000. Between 2001 and 2005 spending on social welfare payments has increased from €7.8 billion to €12.25 billion. During the same period the lowest social welfare rates have increased by 40% while the consumer price index has increased by just over 13%. As a result of budget 2005, welfare payments have increased by four times the expected rate of inflation.The relative income poverty indicator measures all those — households or people — whose income fall below the relative income threshold of 60% of median income, EU, and of 50% of median income, UN. The threshold used reflects the growth in overall incomes each year. In the EU, those with incomes below the 60% median income threshold are deemed to be at risk of poverty.The EU-SILC survey found that 22.7% of persons were at risk of poverty in 2003, which represents a slight increase on the 2001 figure of 21.9%. The United Nations Human Development, UNDP, report in applying this indicator, but with the threshold at 50% of median income, found that over the period 1994 to 2000 relative poverty had increased by 11.3%, compared with a reduction of 55.9% using the other anchored poverty line indicator based on price increases.As the UNDP report concludes, there are two tales of Irish poverty in recent years. One tale shows that there has been a steady and substantial improvement in basic living standards across the board. This is clearly evident from the consistent poverty and anchored poverty line indicators which show a substantial reduction in basic deprivation on the one hand, and significant improvements in real basic incomes on the other.The second tale is that the rapid economic growth has resulted in major improvements in incomes generally, particularly from more and better jobs being taken by a more educated and skilled workforce, and from increasing female participation in the workforce, resulting in a significant rise in two income households. This has led to average incomes overall increasing at a much faster rate than the substantial rise in average social welfare payments. Accordingly, for that reason while everyone is substantially better off, the income gap has widened.What is not in question from the various survey results are the groups who are identified as being most at risk. These include families with children, mainly lone parents, or larger families, those who are unemployed or with disabilities, and older people, especially those living alone. EU-SILC confirms the findings of earlier analyses in this regard and provides information on the most vulnerable groups in society towards whom policy should be focused.A core strategic approach to tackling poverty under the national action plans against poverty and social exclusion involves facilitating the ongoing development of integrated, social policies with key active dimensions. This approach is designed to ensure in the first instance that the process of reducing and eventually eliminating basic poverty and deprivation continues. However, the most common risk factor for poverty is joblessness, which makes it very difficult for people and households get an adequate share in our growing prosperity. The strategic approach, therefore, is also designed to further develop and provide active supports such as education, training, employment, child and elder support services, health and housing that will steadily and progressively enable more people to obtain good quality jobs in our growing economy, greater autonomy and self-sufficiency.

The scheme is administered on my behalf by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive. A person may qualify for payment of a back to school clothing and footwear allowance if he or she is in receipt of a social welfare or health service executive scheme payment, is participating in an approved employment scheme or attending a recognised education or training course, and has household income at or below set levels.Under the scheme an allowance of €80 is payable in respect of qualified children aged from two to 11 years and an allowance of €150 is payable in respect of qualified children aged from 12 to 22 years. The upper income limit this year for eligibility for a back to school clothing and footwear allowance, BSCFA, for a couple with one child is €368.10 per week. The upper income limit for a lone parent with one child is €250.90 per week. These limits ensure a household where the total income derives from carer's allowance will qualify for back to school clothing and footwear allowance. The household income limits under the scheme are indexed each year in line with the contributory old age pension rate in the case of couples, or widow's or widower's  contributory pension in the case of lone parent applicants. Applicants are eligible for BSCFA if their household income is not more that €50 above the relevant reference pension rates. Under the scheme, household income is assessed generally in accordance with standard supplementary welfare allowance means test rules. There are a number of special exceptions in place to disregard income from family income supplement, higher education grants, and the first €120 a week of earnings of a rehabilitative nature. There are also special arrangements in place to allow retention of the allowance when people take up back-to-work or back-to-education opportunities.Income from carer's allowance is taken into account as means for clothing and footwear allowance scheme purposes. If the household in question has additional income from other sources, such as employment, then it may not qualify for back to school clothing and footwear allowance on means grounds. However, I am keeping the qualifying conditions for the scheme under review and the particular issue of carer's allowance raised by the Deputy will be considered in that context. Changes in the scheme's eligibility conditions, in addition to the normal indexation of income limits, must be considered in the context of the budget and in the light of increases I intend to provide in social welfare rates generally.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	377	I propose to take Questions Nos. 38, 64, 66, 74, 81 and 83 together.The one-parent family payment is designed to provide income support to parents with insufficient means who are parenting alone. This can arise as a result of being widowed, or following separation or divorce, or being unmarried. The findings of the recent EU survey on income and living conditions, EU SILC, bear out the findings of previous surveys and of experience in other developed countries that poverty rates tend to be higher among larger families and one-parent families. This is mainly due both to the direct costs of rearing children, including child care cost, and the opportunity costs related to the reduced earning capacity of parents, arising from their care responsibilities. This applies particularly to lone parent families, as the lone parent has to be the main breadwinner and carer at the same time.The EU SILC figures show that 42.3% of households made up of one adult with children are at risk of poverty, which can be defined as the proportion of the population below an income threshold of 60% of median income. This compares with 22.7% of the population as a whole and 15.3% of two adults with between one and three children in the household. The percentage of lone parent households in consistent poverty was 32.6% compared to 9.4% of total households and 6.5% of two adults and between one and three children households. It is generally accepted that for people in working age households, the main route out of poverty is employment. The OECD, in a recent report on an international comparative study on reconciling work and family life, found that employment participation among lone parents in this country is among the lowest in the OECD. This is despite huge employment growth and increasing female participation in the workforce in recent years and the income disregards afforded to lone parents under the one parent family payment who take up employment.Entitlement to payments under the current scheme is also contingent on not cohabiting with another adult either in marriage or outside marriage. Reluctance to forego the income security provided by the one-parent family payment may, however, act as a disincentive to a partnership and ultimately marriage for recipients. In addition, recognition of the mother as primary caregiver has meant that where the parents are separated, the mother usually retains custody of the children and, if there is eligibility, full entitlement to the one parent family payment. The scheme, as it operates, therefore, may not sufficiently facilitate or promote joint parenting and to that extent may not be sufficiently father friendly.One of the key tasks in the ending child poverty initiative under Sustaining Progress is to address obstacles to employment for lone parents. The senior officials group on social inclusion was mandated late last year to examine this issue and report back to the Cabinet Sub-committee on Social Inclusion with specific proposals. A subgroup of the senior officials group has been examining obstacles to employment for lone parent families, with particular emphasis on income supports, employment, education, child care and support programmes and information.We must also income supports closely and how we can adjust those supports to better address the social problems that can arise for those who receive these payments. In this regard, my Department has established a working group to review the income support arrangements for lone parents. Issues being addressed include the contingency basis of the one parent family payment, cohabitation, maintenance and secondary benefits. A consultation process with social partners and other interested parties was also undertaken to inform the work of the group. The findings of this group feed into the work of the senior officials subgroup. The Cabinet Sub-committee on Social Inclusion has been updated on the progress of both working groups. I will bring the final reports to Cabinet shortly with a view to publication in the near future. It is intended that the outcome of these reviews will contribute to the development of proposals designed to better support and encourage lone parents in achieving a better standard of living, employment and education opportunities and a better future for themselves and their children. These will be the main criteria against which recommendations in the reports will be judged. I am committed to reforms that will improve the quality of life for lone parents and their children by offering them respect and support while avoiding poverty traps.

As of 30 September 2005, there were 308,923 customers in receipt of the telephone allowance from my Department. The primary objective of the telephone allowance scheme is to ensure access to help in an emergency and to provide an element of security. A secondary objective is to encourage social contact and to assist in the prevention of social isolation for those living alone.I am committed to the development of the telephone allowance scheme to respond to the expanding telecommunications market and to facilitate greater customer choice of telephone services. The administrative and technical arrangements for payment of the household benefits were originally designed for a relationship with a single provider per utility market and are not sustainable in a deregulated energy market environment with multiple service providers. Specifically, with regard to the telephone allowance, an interim process has been employed to allow the participation of other land line telecommunications suppliers but this is only sustainable for the present in view of the small number of customers — approximately 10,000 — availing of the telephone allowance from suppliers other than Eircom. This interim process is administratively complex and is not favoured by the industry or the regulator. When considering the extension of this scheme to cover mobile phones, there are similar administrative and technical issues to be resolved both internally within the department and externally in the market.My Department is examining the position regarding the opening up of the telecommunications market, including mobile phone services and the impact this will have on the telephone allowance. I am keen to ensure our customers will be able to avail of the choices being presented by the opening up of the market. However, my Department must comply with the requirements of the relevant Commissioners for Communications and Energy Regulation with regard to customer choice and market competition. In identifying a solution to the current issues, the Department is carrying out a fundamental review of the operational arrangements with the various service providers. Consultation with the regulators, interest groups and other relevant bodies forms part of the review process. It is expected this process will be completed later this year and I will then make decisions on the most appropriate method of adapting the household benefits package to respond to market changes, including extending the telephone allowance scheme to include an option for mobile telephones.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	379	My Department has a comprehensive information policy which is designed to ensure that all citizens are made aware of their entitlements in a timely fashion. It also ensures customers are kept informed of changes and improvements in schemes and services as they occur. From time to time my Department undertakes specific information campaigns on the introduction of new schemes, changes in entitlements and improvements in services. To date in 2005, three such information campaigns have been undertaken. These were as follows: respite care grant scheme — a national and provincial newspaper campaign to advertise improvements to the scheme so that more carers could qualify for the grant; capital assessments — a national newspaper campaign to advise people about the improvements in the way capital is assessed for means tested payments; and options and opportunities for lone parents — the publication and distribution of a magazine advising lone parents about the supports available to them. The magazine was sent to more than 86,000 customers in receipt of the one-parent family payment. In addition, my Department plans to run an information campaign later this year to promote the role of the social welfare local offices as a key information contact point in disseminating information on social welfare entitlements across all age groups.My Department takes a proactive approach in advertising new schemes and services, together with changes and improvements to existing schemes and services by using an appropriate mix of national and provincial media, and through information leaflets, fact sheets, posters and direct mail shots. In the interests of ensuring the information campaigns run by my Department, and the agencies attached to it, are structured and targeted in a way that reaches the maximum number of customers, I have established a communications liaison group in the Department. I have requested this group to monitor ongoing campaigns and to come forward with proposals and suggestions on how the dissemination of information to customers can be further enhanced. All schemes and services are publicised on the website at www.welfare.ie. Selective use is made of freefone telephone services to provide information on new schemes and services and at particular times of the year, such as budget time.My Department produces a comprehensive range of information booklets explaining entitlements to specific social welfare payments. These are widely available from the network of 130 social welfare local offices and branch offices throughout the country as well as from citizens' information centres and many local organisations. Information is also available from information officers located in social welfare local offices. In addition, information officers give talks to many groups and organisations and participate in exhibitions and seminars about social welfare matters. My Department works closely with voluntary and community organisations involved in an information giving role. A number of such organisations receive funding on an annual basis towards the cost of providing welfare rights and information services for their target groups.Comhairle, the national information agency, comes under the aegis of my Department. It has responsibility for supporting the provision of independent information, advice and other supports to the public, including those with disabilities. Comhairle supports a network of 85 citizens' information centres whose role is to provide information to members of the public on all social services.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	380	The Government is anxious to ensure that as many people as possible can qualify for contributory pensions in their own right and in this regard a number of measures have been introduced over the years which make it easier for people to qualify for pensions. These include the reduction in the yearly average number of contributions required for pension purposes from 20 to ten and the special half rate pension based on pre-53 insurance contributions. Pro rata pensions are also available to allow people with mixed rate insurance records to receive a payment and this is of benefit to people who may have worked in both the public and private sectors. Despite these improvements, some people cannot qualify for a pension in their own right. For this reason, the Government is committed in the programme for Government to increasing the payment for qualified adults aged 66 or over to the same level as the personal rate of the old age non-contributory pension and to facilitate the direct payment of the allowance to spouses and partners. A number of special increases have been given over several budgets in pursuit of this target, totalling €56.47 per week since April 2000. Further increases will be considered in the context of the forthcoming budget. Since October 2002, in accordance with the conclusions of a PPF working group on administrative individualisation, new pension claimants can opt to have the qualified adult allowance paid directly to their spouse or partner. This system has had only limited success in delivering personal payments to qualified adults and I am examining the administrative and legislative implications of making changes to the system to ensure that more qualified adults can receive a direct payment.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	381	The programme for Government contains a commitment to a scheme of all-Ireland free travel for pensioners resident in all parts of the island. The scheme would enable pensioners resident in Ireland to travel free of charge on all bus and rail services in Northern Ireland. Likewise, pensioners in Northern Ireland would travel free of charge on all bus and rail services in this State. In July 1995, my Department introduced the cross-Border free travel scheme. This scheme extended free travel entitlement so that free travel pass holders resident in Ireland could undertake a cross-Border journey from a point of departure in one jurisdiction to a destination in the other jurisdiction free of charge. My Department covers the full cost of cross-Border journeys made by Department of Social and Family Affairs pass holders it also covers the cost of the southern element of cross-Border journeys undertaken by Northern Ireland pass holders.Under its own concessionary fares scheme, the Department for Regional Development for Northern Ireland covers the cost of the northern element of cross-Border bus and rail journeys made by Northern Ireland pass holders. A total of 220,000 free cross-Border journeys are undertaken each year at a total cost of €2.9 million; my Department pays €2.5 million and the remaining €400,000 is covered by the Department for Regional Development for Northern Ireland. The introduction of an all-Ireland free travel scheme would further extend the existing arrangements so that all free travel pass holders resident on the island of Ireland may undertake travel free of charge in all parts of the island. The cost of an all-Ireland free travel scheme will ultimately depend upon the extent to which pass holders avail of the scheme. My predecessor initiated discussions with the then Minister of State at the Department of Regional Development in Northern Ireland in September 2004. Most recently, the proposed scheme was discussed at the British-Irish Inter-governmental Conference on 27 June 2005 and I met Mr. Shaun Woodward, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Northern Ireland Office the following week during which we discussed the introduction of a scheme.Officials from my Department have regular meetings with their counterparts in the Department for Regional Development for Northern Ireland concerning the operation of the existing cross-Border free travel scheme. Discussions on the introduction of the proposed all-Ireland free travel scheme have also taken place. Since I met with Shaun Woodward, discussions between officials from both sides have intensified and two meetings specifically related to the introduction of the proposed scheme have taken place — one in Dublin on 10 August and one in Belfast on 9 September last. Issues to be resolved involve policy, operational, financial and technical matters including the compatibility between the travel passes used in both jurisdictions, resourcing of the scheme and the options for joint funding. My Department will continue to progress these matters with officials from the Department for Regional Development for Northern Ireland, and other relevant parties.

It is now a countrywide service provided by 52 locally based companies limited by guarantee with a budget of €13.62 million. The MABS programme provides money advice, including the publication of information on money management and debt counselling, to individuals and families who have problems with debt, particularly indebtedness to moneylenders, and who are on low incomes or in receipt of social welfare payment. The MABS places an emphasis on practical budget based measures that will succeed in moving people permanently from dependence on moneylenders and other sources of high interest credit. One of the objectives of the MABS is to identify sources of financial services and credit at normal interest rates which can best meet the needs of the target group and facilitate them to access these sources.Earlier this year, I held a series of meetings with the Irish Bankers' Federation, IBF, the Irish League of Credit Unions, ILCU, and the financial services regulator to discuss the issues of access to financial service and access to credit for those who are financially excluded. The meeting with the IBF focused on the following issues: access to mainstream banking facilities including credit options where appropriate for lone parents and others on welfare or low incomes; responsible lending practices to lone parents and others on welfare or low incomes and a commitment to desist from offering unsolicited loans to those groups; immediate operationalisation of Department of Finance money laundering committee guidance notes regarding customer identification at local branch level; and continued co-operation with the MABS service in dealing with over indebtedness issues when appropriate. The banks agreed to communicate with all retail member banks to ensure staff are reminded of account opening procedures and the attendant customer identification requirements, including the range of documentation which will satisfy these requirements. They also agreed to contact the financial services regulator, IFSRA, to discuss how the authority might help promote its publication, A Guide to Opening a Bank Account. I have been informed by the IBF that it has communicated with member banks and building societies. It has also met the financial regulator on the same issue.The credit union movement has played a significant role in the development of the MABS. When I met the Irish League of Credit Unions I was given every assurance that it would continue to play its part in assisting persons on welfare and low incomes to become financially included. I also met the financial services regulator who is undertaking research into issues surrounding access to financial services in conjunction with the Combat Poverty Agency. I look forward to this report, which should be available towards the end of this year, and it will be of assistance in further developing appropriate policy responses in relation to financial inclusion. A good working relationship exists between MABS, the IBF, ILCU and the financial regulator. Regular meetings take place regarding access to financial services and also debt recovery practices of the financial institutions. I am confident these initiatives and contacts are helping to tackle the exclusion from access to financial services of people on low incomes.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	383	With effect from 1 June 2005 a new weekly disability allowance expenses payment of €35 has been made to people resident in institutions who previously did not qualify for a disability allowance payment. This allowance has also replaced pocket money and other allowances that were formerly paid to such residents by the Health Service Executive. The number in receipt of the allowance is 2,737 and expenditure on the scheme in 2005 is estimated to be €3 million. I took this decisive measure to remove the anomaly whereby people with disabilities who were resident in a health board institution prior to August 1999 were not generally entitled to receive disability allowance as long as they continued to reside in an institution. This situation dates back to the variety of arrangements that applied under the old disabled person's maintenance allowance, DPMA, scheme that was administered by the health boards up to October 1996 and continued when that scheme transferred over to the Department of Social Welfare.My Department completed a comprehensive inquiry and information gathering exercise with the Health Service Executive with a view to arranging the payment of this new allowance. My Department is satisfied that this exercise identified all entitled persons with disabilities between 16 and 66 years of age, who were residing in an institution on a permanent basis. The introduction of the allowance was effectively and efficiently managed by the Department and resulted in virtually all eligible persons receiving their allowance with effect from 1 June 2005. Services level agreements have been put in place with the relevant institutions. These agreements explicitly require the service provider to ensure that this payment is exclusively used for the recipient's personal benefit.With regard to consultation and communication, my Department through its disability consultative forum met the representative organisations and disability service providers on 9 December 2004, 10 March 2005 and 28 June 2005, respectively, regarding payment of the allowance. All members of the forum have been fully updated on progress and the detail of how the payment is to be administered. All groups welcomed this measure as a very positive development and one which is a platform for finally providing income support to all persons irrespective of their disability or residential status. The wider issue of payment of full disability allowance to persons irrespective of their residential status is being progressed by this Department and the Department of Health and Children and will also be examined further in a budgetary context.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	384	Diet supplements are provided through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on my behalf by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive. A person in receipt of a social welfare or Health Service Executive payment, who has been prescribed a special diet as a result of a specified medical condition and who is unable to provide for his or her food needs from within his or her own resources, may qualify for a diet supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. Diet supplements are subject to a means test. Under the existing scheme, the amount of supplement payable in individual cases depends on which of two categories of diet — low cost or high cost — has been prescribed by the applicant's medical adviser and the income of the individual and his or her dependants. The basis for calculating the amount of diet supplement remained unchanged between 1996 and 2004. Increases in social welfare rates and in the cost of special diets since 1996 had not been taken into account in assessing entitlement in individual cases.With effect from 1 January 2004 the diet supplement scheme was restructured to take account of increases in both social welfare payment rates and the rate of food inflation since 1996. In the case of new applicants for diet supplement the amount of supplement payable is based on increased up to date diet costs, €44 for lower cost diets or €57 for higher cost diets, less one third of the applicant's income or one sixth of the joint income in the case of a couple. Since increases in the social welfare payment rates were higher than food price inflation since 1996, the shortfall to be met by the diet supplement is less than it was in the past. People in receipt of a diet supplement prior to the introduction of the revised regulations on 1 January 2004 continue to receive their existing rate of supplement until such time as there is a change in their circumstances that would warrant a review of their cases. Pending any changes I make to the scheme, similar arrangements continue to apply this year for existing and new cases, taking account of 2005 rates of social welfare payments.To inform a reappraisal of the scheme, my Department commissioned a study by an expert from the Irish Nutrition and Dietetic Institute. The study examined the special diets prescribed in legislation for which assistance is available through the existing diet supplement scheme. The study also considered the appropriate level of assistance required to cater for additional costs involved in providing for necessary special diets, relative to the cost of a normal healthy eating diet. The findings of this research study have been assessed by my Department to determine how the diet supplement scheme should be developed. Development of a new scheme is complex, as the expert advice is that certain diet conditions covered under the existing scheme should be adjusted to reflect the latest medical and dietary thinking. I expect to introduce revised regulations to update the scheme shortly. My Department is making arrangements also to publish the research study. In finalising the revised scheme and regulations, I want to make sure that the new supplement coverage and payment rates put in place continue to enable people on low incomes to meet the identified extra cost of medically recommended special diets if they need them. In the meantime, diet supplements continue to be provided for existing recipients and new applicants as heretofore.

The basis for the restriction contained in the rules is the applicant's habitual residence. The effect is that a person whose habitual residence is elsewhere is not paid certain social welfare payments on arrival in Ireland. The question of what is a person's habitual residence is decided in accordance with European Court of Justice case law, which sets out the grounds for assessing individual claims. Each case received for a determination on the habitual residence condition is dealt with in its own right and a decision is based on application of the guidelines to the individual circumstances of each case. An applicant who disagrees with the decision of a deciding officer has the right to appeal to the social welfare appeals office.In the vast majority of cases other than supplementary welfare allowance claims, decisions on whether or not applicants satisfy the habitual residence condition are made by deciding officers in local offices and scheme areas, on the basis of responses given to questions in the primary claim forms for the schemes. The remainder are submitted for decision to a central section. Regarding supplementary welfare allowance, all decisions in respect of the habitual residence condition are made by community welfare officers at claim registration.For the period 1 May 2004 to 21 October 2005, the number of habitual residence cases decided in the central section was 22,487. The total number of cases deemed not habitually resident was 5,659 or 25%. The number of applications decided in respect of Irish citizens is 5,574, of which 546 or 10% were disallowed. The habitual residence condition is being operated in a careful manner to ensure that Ireland's social welfare system is protected, while, at the same time, ensuring people whose cases are appropriate to the system have access to it when they need it. The operation of the habitual residence condition has been kept under review by officials of my Department since its introduction. A review the operation of the habitual residence condition is being carried out at present by my officials with a view to assessing its impact on different categories of persons claiming social assistance-child benefit and supplementary welfare allowance payments; assessing the current organisational arrangements in the Department for administering the condition and the service provided to customers; identifying opportunities for improvements to the administration of the scheme, including those aspects involving other Departments; examining all aspects of the decision making process; and identifying emerging policy issues and considering how these should be addressed. Account is being taken of the views received from various groups and organisations who have an interest in the area. I expect to draw conclusions from the review by the end of the year.

Normally, improvements in social welfare schemes and services are introduced by way of the budget. In this regard, I will be developing budget proposals relating to the various issues within my own area of responsibility, having regard to Government commitments relating to weekly rates of payment and monthly child benefit rates; addressing child poverty; improving pensions provision; removing the obstacles to employment, training and education for various vulnerable groups; examining ways of increasing supports for carers; and the views expressed at the recent pre-budget forum at which 31 welfare organisations presented submissions. Immediately following budget day, I will bring forward a Social Welfare Bill to provide for increases in the weekly payment rates and changes to the PRSI provisions or other amendments, which would be scheduled to come into effect from January 2006. Budget 2006 provisions requiring legislative basis and scheduled to take effect after January 2006 and any other non-budget related legislative amendments will be provided for under a second Bill expected to be progressed through the Oireachtas in early 2006.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	387	I propose to take Questions Nos. 55, 88 and 96 together.Weekly payments of FIS are made to families, including one-parent families, with children under 18 years or between 18 and 22 years if in full-time education, where at least one parent is in full-time remunerative employment of not less than 19 hours per week, or 38 hours per fortnight, where the employment is likely to last at least three months and where the income of the family is less than a prescribed weekly amount.The number of FIS claims in payment at end September 2005 was 15,784. This represents an increase of 31% since December 2002 when 12,043 claims were in payment. FIS income limits were increased by €39 per week in budget 2005. This represents a net increase of €23.40 per week for most recipients. Weekly FIS income limits have risen by €84 since 2002, a net increase of €50.40. The guaranteed minimum weekly rate of payment for anyone who qualifies for FIS increased to €20 from January 2004.It is not possible to estimate from administrative sources the number of families who would be eligible but do not apply for their entitlements under the family income supplement scheme. However, research undertaken by the Economic and Social Research Institute in 1997, which was based on the results of the Living in Ireland Survey 1994, suggested that fewer than one in three of potentially eligible claimants were actually in receipt of the payment. Since those with a higher entitlement are more likely to avail of the scheme, the take-up in expenditure terms was estimated to be somewhat higher at between 35% and 38% of potential expenditure. I understand that the ESRI is re-examining this issue given the availability of new data since that time.My Department undertakes a number of pro-active measures to ensure that people are made aware of their possible entitlement to family income supplement. In the past, this has included extensive advertising on local and national press and radio, in poster campaigns and targeted mailshots.Information on FIS is also provided on an ongoing basis in various ways, which include advising all newly awarded one parent family payment recipients, advising all employers annually in PRSI mailshots and examining entitlement for all recipients of the back to work scheme. More generally, information on all social welfare schemes, including FIS, is also available on the department's website and from the Department's local offices.Improvements to the family income supplement scheme, including the progressive increases in the income limits, have made it easier for lower income households to qualify under the scheme. My Department will continue to closely monitor the performance of the scheme in terms of uptake and ensure information on all of its  schemes is disseminated to the widest possible audience so that people may avail of their entitlements.

The report, The Social Inclusion of Older People at Local Level, prepared for the National Council on Ageing and Older People by the Work Research Centre, identifies the policies and measures that are being planned and implemented by the county and city development boards to ensure the inclusion of older people at local level. The report also concludes that the involvement of older people in local level planning and decision making is a key mechanism of the social inclusion process.The office for social inclusion has been working with the National Council on Ageing and Older People to ensure that full account is taken of the position of older people and their needs in the ongoing strategic process to combat poverty and social exclusion. This will intensify over the coming months, as the office co-ordinates preparation of the next action plan to cover the period 2006 to 2008, due for submission to the European Commission by September 2006.Consultation on the plan has commenced and written submissions from the various stakeholders have been requested and received. Invitations are currently being issued to all interested bodies and persons to a series of national and regional consultation seminars. Older persons and their representatives will be especially welcome as they are one of the key groups vulnerable to poverty and social exclusion.Full account will be taken in preparing the plan of this report, The Social Inclusion of Older People at Local Level, and, in particular, how the recommendations in the report can be implemented. The needs of older people, especially as they grow more frail and dependent, have to be met as a priority. But it must also be continually recognised that a majority of older people at any one time have much to contribute to their families, their local community and society generally and that effective mechanisms should exist for their participation in planning and decision making. Their participation must be encouraged and facilitated and I am satisfied that the report will make a real contribution to achieving this objective.The current NAP-inclusion already recognises that access to adequate resources is an important requirement for the participation of older people. In this regard, the Government has, since 1997, increased pensions substantially. During this period, pensions have increased by 81% while the consumer price increase over the same period was 30.7%. This represents a real increase of 38.5%. Old age contributory pensioners are now receiving €157.30 per week compared to the equivalent of €99 in 1997.Furthermore, the Government is committed to increasing the basic social welfare pension to €200 per week by 2007. The Government is now preparing for the challenges ahead as our population ages in the coming years so that we can ensure that retired people have an adequate income, which, as far as possible, maintains their pre-retirement standard of living and that these pensions are sustainable in the long run.This is being achieved through the national pensions policy initiative, which was developed following extensive consultation with the social partners, representative organisations and the pensions industry. In addition to significant increases in basic social welfare pensions, this strategy includes expanding private and occupational pensions coverage from a current level of 50% of the workforce to 70%, with PRSAs being the main policy instrument being used in this latter regard and the national pensions reserve fund, which now stands at €8.4 billion.Regarding the needs of frail and dependent older people, the long-term care working group, which is being chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach and comprises senior officials from the Departments of Finance, Health and Children and Social and Family Affairs, is continuing its work. The objective of this group is to identify the policy options for a financially sustainable system of long term care. The group will report shortly.

This level of increase is over four times the projected level of inflation for 2005; an increase of €9.30, 10.4%, per week in the rate of qualified adult allowance, QAA, payable to those in receipt of the lowest rates of payment; an increase in the child benefit lower rate by €10 per month and an increase of €12 per month on the higher rate; an increase in the rate of maternity benefit from 70% to 75% of reckonable weekly earnings; a record increase of €39 per week in all FIS earnings thresholds; a €10 per week increase on the upper ceiling for entitlement to tapered QAA from €210 to €220 per week; a €50 increase in the income threshold for entitlement to half-rate child dependent allowance, CDA, with certain social insurance benefits, such as unemployment and disability benefit, from €300 to €350 per week; and additional funding of €4.8 million for family resource centres, marriage-family counselling, the family mediation service, the families research programme and the family support agency. I look forward to making further progress for low-income families in the forthcoming budget.

At this forum, each organisation, including One Family, had the opportunity to present its key priorities for consideration in advance of budget 2006. I would like to thank One Family for its contribution to the forum and the valuable work which it and many other organisations do in their communities.I have also received a written pre-budget submission from One Family which includes its proposal to increase the one parent family allowance by €18.50 to €165 per week. This proposal with the other proposals put forward by the organisation will be considered in the context of the forthcoming budget.Government policy is to achieve the income adequacy target set in the national anti-poverty strategy. This commitment is to increase the lowest social welfare rates to €150 per week, in 2002 terms, by 2007. We are on target to achieve this objective. In budget 2005, the lowest rates of social welfare were increased by €14 per week to €148.80. This represented a level of increase more than four times the projected level of inflation for 2005. I look forward to making further progress on this matter in budget 2006.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	391	I propose to take Questions Nos. 59 and 195 together.The reduction and eventual elimination of child poverty are at the core of the strategic process to combat poverty and social exclusion, a priority shared internationally. The OECD in a report to social affairs Ministers in April this year pointed out that "children who grow up in disadvantaged households are more likely to do poorly at school, to struggle to find a job, and to be unemployed, sick or disabled when they become adults, precipitating an inter generational cycle of disadvantage and deprivation."I welcome the Barnardos' Seven Steps to End Child Poverty report, which deals with this reality. The seven steps deal with improving child income supports, educational outcomes, maternity and child care, access to health, housing standards, obstacles to employment, child policy impact analysis and co-ordination of policies relating to children.A strategic process for combating and eventually eliminating child poverty, together with specific measures to meet the objectives of the process, is already in train under the national action plan against poverty and social exclusion and the national children's strategy. Ending child poverty is also one of ten special initiatives in Sustaining Progress. This strategic process substantially incorporates the seven steps highlighted by Barnardos.The most significant measure my Department has taken in recent years to support families with children has been the very substantial real increases in child benefit payment rates. Between 1997 and 2005, the rate of child benefit rose from €38.09 per month for the first two children and €49.52 for each child thereafter to €141.60 per month for each of the first two children and to €177.30 per month for the third and each subsequent child. This equates to real increases over the period in excess of 170%. Child benefit is paid to over 540,000 families in respect of approximately 1 million children, at an estimated cost of €1.9 billion in 2005.Through the family income supplement scheme, my Department provides cash support by way of weekly payments to families at work on low pay. Recent improvements to the scheme, including the assessment of entitlements on the basis of net rather than gross income and progressive increases in the income limits, have made it easier for more lower-income households to qualify under the scheme. Child dependant allowances are also paid to recipients of weekly social welfare payments.Most children at risk of poverty live in jobless households, where there is no full-time or part-time employment. The major increase over the past decade in employment, including the increased participation of women in employment, has made a significant contribution to reducing the risk of poverty for children. Jobless and low-income households remain, however, and these now mainly include households where there is just one parent, or a parent with a disability, as well as a proportion who are unemployed. Households with bigger families may still be at risk of poverty, if only one parent is able to take up employment.A series of policies to address continued joblessness in households with children are currently being prepared under the strategic process. Later this year, I expect shortly to receive proposals from the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, on the structures needed to introduce a second tier of financial supports, in addition to child benefit and other entitlements, aimed specifically at helping those children most in need.A sub-group of the senior officials group on social inclusion has been undertaking a detailed examination of obstacles to employment for lone parents. As part of this work, my Department is nearing the completion of a review of income supports and I expect that to be finalised in the near future.The provision of affordable and flexible child care is a key factor in facilitating employment participation for families with children. My Department is participating in an inter-departmental working group on early child care and education, chaired by the National Children's Office. The work of this committee is at an advanced stage and the outcome will make an important contribution to finding the right mix of services and income support to facilitate employment take up and care for children.Given the central importance of combating child poverty, the extensive range of policies required and the resources involved, we need to monitor and evaluate the outcomes of the these policies on the development of our children and get the necessary evidence on what works and works well. This process is about to commence with a major national longitudinal study on children. My Department and the Department of Health and Children, through the National Children's Office, are jointly funding this study. The study will be the most significant of its kind to be undertaken here, particularly in terms of the cost, scope and length of study period. It is anticipated that 10,000 children from birth and 8,000 children aged nine will be recruited to participate in the study.I am confident that, through the measures already being taken and the initiatives being planned, we will make a decisive impact of combating poverty, especially among children, and in ensuring that all the nation's children have a good quality of life and a fair share of life. These policy areas also form key elements of Government actions relating to children and families chances.

The establishment of a separate agency to administer and deliver social welfare payments is one of a number of options that are under consideration as part of the public service modernisation programme. The concept of a separate agency for the delivery of social welfare services is not new. A number of countries such as New Zealand and Australia have followed the route of setting up separate executive agencies to deliver some of its services.Most Deputies will be aware of the benefits agency which was set up in the UK as an executive agency within the Department of Social Security. The benefits agency was replaced by Jobcentre Plus in April 2002 and it currently operates under the aegis of the Department for Work and Pensions. The administration of state pensions in the UK is the responsibility of The Pension Service which is also an executive agency of the Department for Work and Pensions.My Department has been structured on aireacht-executive lines since the mid-1980s. The aireacht is responsible for researching and formulating social welfare policy. It also provides a range of corporate services including personnel and finance. Social welfare services is the executive arm of the Department and is responsible for the administration and management of social welfare schemes and services through a network of local, regional and decentralised offices.My Department is currently embarking on a significant programme of change under the Government's decentralisation initiative and is extremely conscious of the need to carefully manage change so as to ensure that the service it provides to its customers is not adversely affected. The proposal for a separate social welfare agency is at the embryonic stage and will need to be examined in detail before consideration could be given to its feasibility. Assessments must be made regarding potential improvements in services and the economies or efficiencies that might accrue from such an approach. Issues such as legal, operational, personnel and industrial relations matters will also have to be addressed.My Department will have the opportunity of examining the experiences of countries which have already pursued this approach. It will be in a position to take on board the lessons from those countries and to avoid any pitfalls or difficulties which could arise. Setting up an executive agency to deliver social welfare services would be a major change in the operations of my Department. A comprehensive examination of all the issues involved will have to be carried out before detailed proposals for such a change can be drawn up.

There are two options available under this scheme, namely, the second level option and the third level option. Under these options a person may pursue a full-time second or third level course of study at a recognised second or third level institution.The primary aim of the back to education allowance scheme is to assist people who are unable to access the labour market because of a lack education and who are caught up in a cycle of unemployment and disadvantage. Since its inception many people who left school early have been given a second chance for education and this has improved their prospects of getting employment.At present, to qualify for participation in the back to education allowance scheme an applicant pursuing an approved course of study must be at least 21 years of age and in receipt of a relevant social payment for six months in the case of the second level option and 12 months in the case of the third level option or nine months if participating in the national employment action plan, NEAP, process.The scheme has recently been the subject of a programme expenditure review. The expenditure review working group examined among other issues, the qualifying criteria for the scheme, targeting strategy and the future focus and administration of the scheme. The working group completed the review in September of this year.The working group recommended, among other things that the scheme should be extended to include all those of working age in receipt of a welfare payment. In that context, there are currently a number of people who are in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance for a minimum period of 12 months and who represent a long-term welfare group whose eligibility for the scheme will be considered through the expenditure review implementation process which is due to commence shortly. Other recommendations made by the group will also be considered as part of that process.

A total of €13.6 million in funding has been allocated to MABS in 2005. The service is targeted at those who are on low income or in receipt of social welfare payments. There are 52 MABS companies located in 65 offices throughout the country.The money advice and budgeting service has a close and ongoing involvement with my Department at local level. Representatives of the Department are on the boards of management of MABS companies. Membership is also drawn from statutory and voluntary bodies such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, credit unions, citizens information centres and the community welfare service. These representatives in turn raise awareness of issues around over-indebtedness in their parent bodies.New posters with local contact details have been circulated to all the MABS offices. These posters will also be displayed in all social welfare offices and health centres as well as other appropriate locations. Information on MABS is also contained on its website www.mabs.ie.A new company MABS National Development Limited was established in 2004 to support, promote and develop the MABS service. The company has recruited a national development team comprised of a social policy-communications officer, a community education officer, and three casework technical support officers.The company is currently working on the development of a national strategy in community education which will be implemented by the 52 MABS companies. This strategy will seek to empower individuals and communities in developing the skills necessary to deal with debt situations as they arise.The MABS development company is also devising a strategy to assist the MABS local services to improve further the take up of the money advice and budgeting service by those on low income. Recent initiatives to inform the target group of the MABS include media interviews, co-operation with the one parent exchange network, OPEN, the National Adult Literacy Agency, NALA, the Courts Service information section, Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Age Action and hospital social workers.My Department ensures that MABS information and contact details are included in all relevant social welfare publications and information material produced by the Department. The level of response to MABS indicates there is a high level of awareness of the service. However, I will continue to examine any proposals that would further extend the level of public awareness.

However, Comhairle, the national information agency which operates under the aegis of my Department, has recently funded Age Action Ireland, a voluntary organisation to carry out a research project entitled, Uptake of Social Welfare Benefits by Older People. A draft report on this research has recently been received in my Department and the findings and recommendations will be discussed with Age Action Ireland in due course. The provision of comprehensive information in a clear and simple manner is an essential element in the effective delivery of social welfare services.My Department's information policy is designed to ensure that all citizens, including older persons, are made aware of their entitlements in a timely fashion and that they are kept informed of changes and improvements in schemes and services as they occur. We work closely with NALA to achieve our aims to provide information in a clear and comprehensive way. Difficulties and barriers identified during customer consultation sessions are eliminated as required.Our customer groups have indicated their satisfaction with the level of information available from the Department and with our methods of dissemination. My Department takes a pro-active approach in advertising new schemes, together with changes and improvements to existing schemes and services, by using an appropriate mix of national and provincial media, information leaflets, fact sheets, posters and direct mailshots. We have, in the past, issued direct information booklets to all our pensioners outlining the supports and services available to them from the Department.Staff of my Department promote social welfare entitlement take-up by participating in public events. For example, my Department had a stand at the over-50s exhibition last weekend in the RDS where staff dealt with many queries regarding pensions and issues of interest to older people.Information staff give talks to many organisations, including those offering pre-retirement seminars and courses. They also provide presentations on social welfare entitlements to voluntary and community groups. My Department produces a comprehensive range of information leaflets and booklets covering each social welfare payment or scheme. One such leaflet is Checklist for Pensioners. These information booklets are available in a wide range of outlets country-wide including all social welfare local offices, citizen's information centres, post offices and indeed in a wide range of other organisations such as local community centres.In addition to the above, the central information services unit in my Department operates a telephone information service for the public and an information officer is located in each of the social welfare local offices around the country. Information officers are available to explain all our supports and services to our older citizens and to help and assist them in completing forms and accessing their entitlements.I am satisfied that my Department provides a comprehensive and quality information service to all our customers including services to older people.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	396	The provision of information in a clear and simple manner is an essential element in the effective delivery of social welfare services by my Department. My priority is to ensure that people are fully aware of their entitlements and are advised and assisted when the need arises to avail of the schemes and supports available.My Department funds Comhairle, the statutory agency responsible for ensuring individuals, in particular those with disabilities, have access to accurate, comprehensive and clear information relating to social services. Comhairle supports and funds a network of citizens information services to provide information, advice and advocacy services to the public on a wide range of civil and public services.Since its establishment in June 2000, Comhairle has continually sought ways of developing effective and accessible channels to meet the different information needs of individuals and communities. In 2004, Comhairle developed a customer-centred, integrated approach to citizens information. To this end, citizens information is promoted as a brand name for the public to access information through the three delivery channels of citizens information centres, CICs, the citizens information phone service and the OASIS website.In 2005, approximately €10 million was dedicated to the provision of citizens information. This amount comprises funding to cover the costs of information service promotion, advocacy projects and ICT in individual CICs, the costs of premises, wages and general administration throughout the CIC network and the cost of the citizens information phone service.Citizens information is provided from 247 CICs throughout the country. This reflects an increase in service locations from 196 in 2001. The citizens information centres provide a very valuable service to people. I am satisfied that the information service provided by the CICs is valued by the community. I intend to see that Comhairle will be in a position to continue to support these centres. Ongoing and increased funding for Comhairle is a matter which will be addressed in the context of the upcoming budget. I look forward to Comhairle and my Department working together in partnership to ensure that citizens will have a variety of channels to access information when needed.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	397	Social welfare programmes aim to be responsive to the needs of those who depend on income maintenance support while providing incentives to assist people to become more independent financially, particularly through employment.A number of measures have been introduced in recent years to remove disincentives to taking up employment and to assist in the transition from welfare to work. These measures include special means disregards and tapered withdrawal of benefits as earnings increase, and employment support schemes such as the back to work programme.People, including one parent families, are entitled to retain certain social welfare and other secondary benefits in total or in part for the duration of the employment scheme, subject to certain conditions. For most people the most significant secondary benefit is rent or mortgage interest supplement, which is paid under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. An income limit of €317.43 per week applies to the retention of these supplements. No income limit applies to the back to work allowance itself.While this rent supplement retention income limit has not changed since its introduction, significant other improvements have been made to the means test subsequently. Back to work allowance and family income supplement, in cases where one or both of these are in payment, are disregarded in the assessment of the €317.43 weekly income limit. PRSI and reasonable travelling expenses are also disregarded in the means test.In effect this means that people who commence employment through a back to work scheme, following a period of unemployment, can have a weekly household income significantly in excess of the €317.43 limit and still qualify to retain 75% of their rent or mortgage interest supplement. For example, in the first year of their participation in the back to work allowance scheme, a single person can have combined income from the back to work allowance and wages of €429 while a couple with two children can have a combined income of €528.25. These thresholds increase each year by reference to increases in primary social welfare rates.Rent supplement may be retained for up to four years on a tapered basis, that is, 75% of supplement in year one, 50% in year two and 25% in years three and four. In addition, the maximum payment limit of €317.43 per month on the amount of supplement payable was abolished for people on the approved schemes. As a consequence, many families retain more of their rent supplement than had been the case prior to these changes taking place.People availing of an employment support scheme may opt to be assessed under either standard supplementary welfare allowance rules or under the special retention rules and will be entitled to receive payment under whichever is the more favourable option for them. A person on a community employment scheme or other back to work scheme whose household income is above the €317.43 weekly limit for retention of secondary benefits may still qualify for rent supplement under the standard rules. In that context, I introduced amending regulations in January 2005 to increase the income disregard in the standard rules of the scheme from €50 to €60 per week.Overall, I consider that the current rent supplement eligibility thresholds and disregards, together with improvements in the standard rules of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, ensure that people have a financial incentive to take up back to work opportunities. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of these arrangements is being considered further in the context of a policy review of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which my Department is undertaking at present as part of its ongoing expenditure review programme.

Of this total, 1,504 certificates were granted to the company in question. An annual breakdown of these certificates is outlined in the following table.YearNumber of exemptions issuedNumber issued to Gama20008302001105020022909220031,04878420046033472005 (to 30/09/05)351281Total2,4801,504PRSI exemptions are issued in accordance with Article 97 of SI 312 of 1996. The legislation provides for an exemption from PRSI contributions for up to 52 weeks to be granted to employees not ordinarily resident in the State but who are temporarily employed here. The purpose of the legislation is to avoid a situation whereby workers who are sent by their employer to work here temporarily would be subject to social insurance in two countries at the same time. Similar arrangements apply under EU legislation to workers moving within the EU-EEA and to workers covered by bilateral social security agreements with this country.When a request for an exemption certificate is being processed, a signed declaration is obtained from each employer confirming that the person for whom the exemption certificate is being sought has been retained in the social insurance regime of their home country while working in Ireland. This is intended to confirm that the employee is being posted and is covered for social insurance in his/her home country while covered by an exemption certificate.In randomly selected cases, independent confirmation is sought from the authorities in the employee's home country that social insurance payments have actually been made during the period covered by the exemption certificate. This control complements the employer's declaration that the employee has been retained in insurance cover in his-her own country.In the case of the company in question, a random sample of exempted cases has been referred to the relevant overseas authorities, via the Department of Foreign Affairs, and confirmation has been received that the employees involved remained attached to their home country's social security regime during the period of the exemption. Granting of an exemption certificate is also linked to the existence of a valid work permit which confirms that the employee is not ordinarily resident in this State and is entitled to work here.The needs of the Irish economy have changed significantly since the PRSI exemption legislation was introduced in 1961. There have been changes in working patterns and skill levels and the enlargement of the European Union has also affected the labour market. Against this background, and having regard to the circumstances of the case in question, my Department is undertaking a review of the policy and legislative provisions and the administrative arrangements for the PRSI exemption scheme. It is my intention to consider any necessary measures for change in the light of the review.

Child benefit is the principal means of providing support to families with children in Ireland. It is neutral vis-à-vis the employment status of the child’s parents and maximizes choice for parents. Child benefit is paid monthly in advance to over 530,000 families is respect of over 1,020,000 children.Child benefit rates now stand at €141.60 per month for each of the first two children and to €177.30 per month for the third and each subsequent child. Over the period since 1997, monthly rates of child benefit have increased by €103.51 at the lower rate and €127.78 at the higher rate, increases of 272% and 258% respectively. Any child benefit rate increase would have to be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of competing priorities.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	400	There are currently three different weekly rates of child dependant increases payable to social welfare recipients, €16.80, €19.30 and €21.60, depending on the type of payment. A half rate child dependant increase may also be paid in respect of a child in certain circumstances, for example, where both of the child's parents are receiving a social welfare payment or where one parent has earnings over a prescribed amount.To standardise the three main rates of increases at the highest rate of €21.60 would mean that approximately 244,000 full rate payments and 92,000 half rate payments would be increased at a cost of approximately €52 million annually. Any child dependant rate increase would have to be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of available resources, and also in the context of broader social policy reforms.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	401	My Department is highly dependent on computer systems to deliver its schemes and in particular, its payment services. For example, each week my Department is responsible for some 970,000 payments that, when dependants are included, directly benefit some 1.5 million men, women and children. Each year almost 60 million transactions are processed and issued by my Department. The majority of payments are made through the older systems, the technology on which they are based has been in place for over 20 years and needs to be updated.My Department has developed a strategic programme of continuous development of its information and computer technology, ICT, systems and the related underlying infrastructure to satisfy strategy, policy and legislative requirements of the Department. At any time, there are a number of major new projects under way as well as significant maintenance and enhancement of older systems.The major systems currently being developed include systems that implement direct customer facing services, e-Government related systems and systems primarily aimed at administrative needs.The customer facing systems that are being developed are in line with the Department's service delivery modernisation, SDM, programme, approved by Government in July 2000. The SDM which will ultimately impact on all of the Department's schemes and services is being implemented in a number of self-contained projects spanning several years.Each project generally has two strands, one focused on developing the ICT system components and the other on implementing a parallel programme of organisational change. The aim is to implement modern work practices, supported on a flexible technical architecture, which will allow my Department to respond more rapidly to change and to deliver a high quality, personalised and integrated service to its customers. Each project is the subject of one or more separate fixed-price consultancy contracts negotiated following a public procurement exercise.The first of these projects established the general design principles for subsequent phases and involved the redesign of the child benefit scheme. This system was successfully implemented in November 2002 and gained a number of international awards for its improvements in service delivery. A second major project is under way to extend the programme to retirement pension, old age contributory pension, household benefits and bereavement grants. The project is being developed on an incremental basis; the first phase, the contribution history object, is going live at present. Subsequent phases of this project are planned for end-March of 2006 and mid next year. Consultancy payments to the firms involved are €3,408,550, to end August, for contracts valued at €8,230,205.A related exercise is being carried out to establish requirements and to model the next generation of customer systems. Successful conclusion of this exercise will provide the scoping information for a project commencing in 2006 to develop these systems. No expenditure has been incurred on this exercise in 2005 so far.The main e-Government-related system is the public service broker, PSB, essentially a set of infrastructure and shared services, which is being developed for the Reach agency. This agency does not have its own development staff and the PSB is being developed by external consultants. Reach has provided an inter-agency messaging system that facilitates, for example, the connection of the General Register Office to my Department for the notification of births and the automatic initiation of child benefit claims. This service was extended to deaths and marriages. Some 32 agencies currently receive these services. The system has been developed into a production level broker facility that provides personal account, case management and secure identity services. An external supplier began work on the development and deployment of the basic public services.Regarding broker systems in January 2004 with an estimated cost of €5.31 million, to date, €3.77 million has been paid with the remainder to fall due when phase 1 of the system is completed early in 2006. Additional services and capacity are being developed and added to the core system. To date, some €4.5 million has been spent or committed on these additional services and capacity.Reach's secure identity services invoke public service identity, PSI, services that my Department has built in conjunction with Reach to service internal and external requirements for management of the personal public service, PPS, number. This project commenced in June 2004 and it is expected to conclude in the first quarter of 2006.The estimated development cost of this project was €1.7 million. Payments to date amount to €1.17 million and it is estimated that, due to changes in the scope of the project, the final amount will exceed the original estimate but will remain within currently permitted fixed-price threshold amounts.My Department is also engaged in the development of a number of computerised administrative systems. One such system is the payment and agency reconciliation project which has the objective of fully reconciling the Department's payments and external agency accounts. Phase 1 of the project, a comprehensive analysis of the business, user and ICT requirements, was completed in the second quarter of 2005. A scoping phase to determine the requirements to be included in a request for tenders for procurement of the new system is under way at present. It is hoped to invite tenders for the building of the new system in 2006. The expected date for project completion is end 2007. The estimated consultancy requirement for 2005 was €55,000, just under €30,000 has been spent in the year to date and no further consultancy expenditure is anticipated this year.My Department is engaged in the development of the overpayment and debt management, ODM, system. This will provide a central facility to record overpayments that arise in the operation of the Department's schemes and to manage the recovery of the debt arising from any such overpayments. The system will be integrated with a range of scheme systems operated by my Department and will be built using the same approach adopted for the SDM programme to provide a flexible architecture and to enhance the system for users. Modelling of the business requirements is nearing completion and it is planned to commence building the system in 2006. The estimated total cost of this project is €1 million, of which approximately €11,000 has been spent to date in 2005.A third administrative project is to develop a document, records and information management, DRIM, strategy for subsequent implementation as a set of separate projects. The nature, scope and justification of these further projects will depend on the outcome of the strategy project. The consultancy cost to date is €9,000.One of the key elements of my Department's modernisation plans is the development of a management information framework, MIF, to facilitate effective resource allocation, planning, programme evaluation and decision making through the provision of financial and non-financial management information. The focus of MIF during 2005 has been on the development of a statistical database that delivers management reports. The production of these reports is being piloted in one of my Department's regions and the roll-out of this system to the remaining regions will commence shortly. Consultancy expenditure on the project for 2005 was estimated to be €50,000 but as the work was carried out using internal resources, no consultancy costs were incurred.

The Bill envisages advocacy services as "supporting people with disabilities to identify and understand their needs and options, and to secure their entitlements to social services". Social services are broadly defined. They include health, social welfare, education, family support, housing, taxation, citizenship, consumer matters, employment and training.The proposed service will provide for the assignment of a personal advocate to assist, support and represent a person with a disability in applying for and obtaining social services and in pursuing any right of review or appeal in connection with those services. It is envisaged that the new personal advocacy service will be introduced early in 2008.In preparation for the services contained in the Comhairle (Amendment) Bill 2004, Comhairle launched a new programme of advocacy services for people with disabilities in September 2005. This programme will be delivered by 13 organisations based across the country in the voluntary and community sector and it will be funded by Comhairle. The funding will provide trained advocates within the organisations concerned to assist vulnerable people with a disability in addressing their individual needs and options. I propose to bring the Comhairle (Amendment) Bill 2004 before the Houses of the Oireachtas early in 2006.

These programmes, which were facilitated by my Department, are financed as cross-departmental projects from the information society fund.Prior to the engagement of consultants, my Department undertakes a rigid procurement process in accordance with public sector procurement guidelines and best practice and the achievement of value for money is the central criterion of the process. Once a preferred bidder has been identified, my Department agrees a contract setting out the scope of the services to be provided by the consultants and the deliverables to be achieved. Contracts are drawn up on the basis of ensuring the Department achieves value for money. In line with such contracts, payments are made in respect of the services and deliverables achieved and provided they meet the requirements of the contract and the expectations of my Department in all respects.I am satisfied that this process is fully in accordance with public sector procurement guidelines and best practice and that my Department has achieved value for money from the consultancies undertaken.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	404	From 1 May 2004 the requirement to be habitually resident in Ireland was introduced as a qualifying condition for certain social assistance schemes and child benefit. The effect of the condition is that a person whose habitual residence is elsewhere is not paid certain social welfare payments on arrival in Ireland.The question of what is a person's habitual residence is decided in accordance with European Court of Justice case law, which sets out the grounds for assessing individual claims. Each case received for a determination on the habitual residence condition is dealt with in its own right and a decision is based on the individual circumstances of each case. Any applicant who disagrees with the decision of a deciding officer has the right to appeal to the social welfare appeals office.In accordance with EU regulations, an EEA national who is employed or self-employed in Ireland and subject to the Irish PRSI system, is entitled to child benefit in respect of the members of his or her family, even if the child is residing in another EEA state. I have moved beyond that and extended the payment of child benefit to the spouse of an EEA worker who is employed or self-employed in the State.Persons who come to Ireland from the EEA to look for employment will not satisfy the condition until they obtain employment in the State. Asylum seekers who have been granted refugee status, or leave to remain in the State on the grounds that they are parents of Irish born children, or humanitarian leave to remain, satisfy the habitual residence condition provided they have lived continuously in the State since refugee status or permission to remain was granted. Asylum seekers who are awaiting a decision on their application for refugee status or who have had their application turned down, do not satisfy the habitual residence condition.For the period from 1 May 2004 to 21 October 2005, the number of complex cases decided in respect of child benefit was 7,625. Some 6,378 of these, or 84%, were found to satisfy the condition, as were all of the non-complex child benefit claims made in that period. In total, only 1,247 cases have been rejected over the last 18 months on habitual residence grounds.The operation of the habitual residence condition has been kept under review by officials of my Department since its introduction. The purpose of the review is to assess the impact of the condition on different categories of claimant, the organisational arrangements and the level of service provided to customers, to identify opportunities for improvements in the administration of the scheme, identify emerging policy issues and consider how these should be addressed.Account is being taken of the views received from various groups and organisations who have an interest in the area. I expect to be in a position to draw conclusions from the review by the end of the year.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	405	I was pleased to receive the pre-budget submission recently from the One Family group and to welcome the organisation to my pre-budget forum to hear at first hand the issues raised by its representatives.The recommendations made by One Family in its pre-budget submission, entitled Achieving Equality and Social Inclusion for All One Parent Families in Ireland, include proposals on access for lone parents to education, training and employment, access to quality early childhood development and ongoing education, support for one-parent and low-income families in meeting their accommodation needs, and addressing the issue of poverty among one-parent families.I share many of the group's concerns regarding lone parent families. It is generally accepted that for people in working age households, the main route out of poverty is through employment. One of the prime objectives of the one parent family payment is to encourage lone parents to consider a gradual move away from welfare dependency into education, training and employment.However, I recognise that the issues raised by One Family and the issues concerning lone parents in general are best addressed in an interdepartmental context. It was for this reason that the Government asked the senior officials group on social inclusion late last year to examine the obstacles to employment for lone parents and to report back to the Cabinet committee on social inclusion with specific proposals.A sub-group of the senior officials group has been examining obstacles to employment for lone parent families, with particular emphasis on income supports, employment, education, child care and support programmes and information.We must also look closely at income supports and how we can adjust those supports better to address the social problems that can arise for those who receive such payments. In this regard, my Department has established a working group to review the income support arrangements for lone parents.Issues being addressed include the contingency basis of the one parent family payment, co-habitation, individualisation, maintenance and secondary benefits. A consultation process with social partners and other interested parties, including One Family, was also undertaken to inform the work of the group. The findings of this group are feeding into the work of the senior officials sub-group.The Cabinet committee on social inclusion has been updated on the progress of both working groups. I will be bringing the final reports to Cabinet shortly with a view to publication in the near future. It is intended that the outcome of these reviews will contribute to the design of proposals with the aim of better supporting and encouraging lone parents to achieve an improved standard of living, employment and education opportunities, and a better future for themselves and their children. These will be the main criteria against which recommendations in the reports will be judged.I am committed to reforms that will improve the quality of life for lone parents and their children by offering them respect and support while avoiding poverty traps. In this regard, I agree with many of the objectives of One Family and hope that the work currently under way will lead to a satisfactory outcome for one parent families.

This follows the submission to the Cabinet committee on children of a set of policy options developed by the high level working group on early childhood care and education chaired by the National Children's Office, NCO, which is under my remit.The high level working group on early childhood care and education was established by the Cabinet committee on children in June 2003. The director of the NCO chairs the group. The group's terms of reference are "to recommend an integrated national policy on child care and early education, which will result in improved co-ordination at national and local level and which incorporates a child-centred approach to service delivery".Members of the group initially comprised representatives from the Department of Education and Science, the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of Social and Family Affairs, and the centre for early childhood development and education.In April 2005, the high level working group prepared an interim report for the Cabinet committee. At that stage, it was agreed that the Department of Finance and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment should join the group. The Department of the Taoiseach has also liaised closely with the group.A second interim report was prepared for the Cabinet committee in July 2005. The Cabinet committee on children received the options paper from the group in early October and this is being considered at present.

The application of abatement provisions is set out in section 113 of the Local Government Superannuation (Consolidation) Scheme, Article 19 of the Nominated Health Agencies Superannuation Scheme and Article 30 of the Voluntary Hospitals Superannuation Scheme.Remuneration plus pension for the specified period of employment should not exceed the up-rated remuneration for the post from which the pensioner retired.My Department has recently reviewed the provisions relating to the application of abatement to public health service pensions. Employers have now been advised of alterations to the application of these provisions. I will forward a copy of the relevant circular to the Deputy under separate cover.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	408	The charging for long-stay care under the Health (Amendment) Act 2005 is being implemented by way of the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 2005. These regulations were signed on 14 June 2005 and re-instated charges for inpatient services as well as providing for the levying of a charge in respect of the maintenance of persons in receipt of inpatient services. The regulations were prepared following extensive consultation with the HSE and others.Section 53 of the Health Act 1970, as amended by the Health (Amendment) Act 2005, provides, inter alia, for the levying of a charge where inpatient services have been provided for a period of not less than 30 days or for periods aggregating not less than 30 days within the previous 12 months.In this regard, charging of patients in long-term care commenced on 14 July 2005, which was after the expiration of 30 days after the regulations were signed. Provision will be made this year for the HSE's shortfall in revenue resulting from the absence of charges for long-term care between 9 December 2004 and 14 July 2005 and for any changes in the nature of the charges since that date.In keeping with section 53 of the Health Act 1970, as amended, the regulations have provided for two different classes of persons on whom charges can be levied.Class 1 refers to people in receipt of inpatient services on premises where nursing care is provided on a 24-hour basis on those premises. In this case, a weekly charge can be levied of €120 or the weekly income of that person less €35, whichever is the lesser.Class 2 refers to people in receipt of inpatient services on premises where nursing care is not provided on a 24-hour basis on those premises. In this situation, a weekly charge can be levied of €90 or the weekly income of that person less €55 or 60% of the weekly income of that person, whichever is the lesser.These regulations provide for the maximum charge to be levied on either class of person. The HSE has the power to reduce or waive a charge on the grounds of "undue hardship". Under section 1(b) of the Health (Amendment) Act 2005, the HSE can examine a person’s overall financial situation in view of the person’s reasonable expenditure concerning themselves or their dependants, if any.The management and delivery of health and personal social services are the responsibility of the HSE under the Health Act 2004. It is a matter for the HSE, based on its own legal advice and taking into account the individual circumstances as well as the service being provided, to make a decision on any charges levied.

The process transposing four directives has not yet been completed. In one case the process has been delayed by legal action. In two cases with an end-October deadline the drafting is almost complete. It is complete in the remaining case where the Statutory Instrument is ready for signature.Together with my colleagues in Government, I am conscious of the need to ensure Ireland's treaty commitments are met by transposing EU legislation as required. In this context the Department of Health and Children continues to make every effort, within its available resources, to ensure that relevant EU measures are transposed into Irish law in a timely manner.With regard to the more detailed historical information sought for the period 1997-2005, the available information will be collated and forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.DirectiveTitleNoteDirective 2003/33Directive 2003/33/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 May 2003 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to the advertising and sponsorship of tobacco productsThe Tobacco Advertising Directive (2003/33/EC) was transposed into Irish law by means of the Public Health (Tobacco)(Amendment) Act 2004. This Act, which was enacted in March 2004, is being challenged by the international tobacco industry in the Irish Courts and as a result of this legal challenge Ireland is not in a position to commence all sections of the Act. A comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising and sponsorship has been in place in Ireland since July 2000.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	419	Section 53 of the Health Act 1970, as amended by the Health (Amendment) Act 2005, provides,  inter alia, for the levying of a charge where inpatient services have been provided for a period of not less than 30 days or for periods aggregating not less than 30 days within the previous 12 months.The Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 2005 were signed on 14 June 2005. These regulations re-instate charges for inpatient services. In this regard, charging for patients in long-term care did not commence until the expiration of 30 days after the regulations were signed, which means that charges were levied from 14 July 2005.These regulations provide for the levying of a charge in respect of the maintenance of persons in receipt of inpatient services. Section 51 of the Health Act 1970 defines inpatient services as meaning "institutional services provided for persons while maintained in a hospital, convalescent home or home for persons suffering from physical or mental disability or in accommodation ancillary thereto".In keeping with section 53 of the Health Act 1970, as amended, the regulations have provided for two different classes of persons on whom charges can be levied.Class 1 refers to people in receipt of inpatient services on premises where nursing care is provided on a 24-hour basis on those premises. In this case, a weekly charge can be levied of €120 or the weekly income of that person less €35, whichever is the lesser.Class 2 refers to people in receipt of inpatient services on premises where nursing care is not provided on a 24-hour basis on those premises. In this situation, a weekly charge can be levied of €90 or the weekly income of that person less €55 or 60% of the weekly income of that person, whichever is the lesser.These regulations provide for the maximum charge to be levied on either class of person. The HSE has the power to reduce or waive a charge on the grounds of "undue hardship". Under section 1(b) of the Health (Amendment) Act 2005, the HSE can examine a person’s overall financial situation in view of the person’s reasonable expenditure in relation to themselves or their dependants, if any.It is a matter for the HSE, based on its own legal advice and taking into account the individual circumstances as well as the service being provided, to make a decision on charges.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	421	The Health Act 2004 provided for the Health Service Executive, which was established on 1 January 2005. Under the Act, the executive has the responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. This includes responsibility for the provision of neurology services.The Comhairle report on neurology and neurophysiology, which was published in April 2003, recommended significant enhancement of these services, including the appointment of consultants in Waterford. Following the report's publication, my predecessor endorsed the report's recommendations and wrote to all the health boards urging them to progress the recommendations as available funding permitted.Additional revenue funding was made available in 2005 to support the development of neurology-neurophysiology services in a number of regions, having regard to agreed priorities. The continuing development of the services is a matter for the Health Service Executive, having regard to available funding. Accordingly, my Department will request the parliamentary affairs division of the executive to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	422	On 23 June 2005 I announced a number of improvements to the way in which people's income would be assessed for the purposes of medical card eligibility. I indicated that henceforth assessments would be made on the basis of applicants' disposable income, after deduction of income tax and social insurance contributions, and that reasonable expenses for house mortgage or rental payments, child care and travel to work costs would be allowed. These changes became operative from the date of their announcement.I understand that the HSE's letter to the Deputy dated 14 October 2005 refers to the draft national assessment guidelines for staff. I further understand that this is an operational manual being developed by the HSE under the national schemes modernisation project and that it will formally codify at a national level the system for assessing medical card and GP visit card applications. It will not involve any change to the income guidelines. Applications for medical cards and GP visit cards are being processed in line with the revised assessment arrangements.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	424	I propose to take Questions Nos. 118 and 131 to 133, inclusive, together.The Government is committed to exploring fully the scope for the private sector to provide additional capacity. The health strategy recognises that additional capacity will be provided in the future by a combination of public and private providers.In July this year, my Department issued a policy direction to the Health Service Executive which is aimed at freeing up additional beds for public patients in public hospitals through the development of private hospital facilities on public hospital sites. The initiative will provide up to 1,000 additional beds for public patients over the next five years.No patients will be excluded from public hospitals by virtue of this initiative and the services of private hospitals will have to be available for purchase, if required, on behalf of public patients.Attached to the policy direction was an assessment framework which the HSE has been requested to follow in regard to proposals to locate private hospital facilities on public hospital sites. It requires that the evaluation should have regard to a detailed assessment of need, and existing and planned capacity on a particular site and within the relevant region. It should also provide for a rigorous value for money assessment of any proposal which would take account of the value of the public site and the cost of any tax expenditure. In addition, it will make clear the need for adherence to public procurement law and best practice.The Health Service Executive, HSE, has been asked to begin to develop an implementation plan which will identify where these private facilities might be located and to prioritise proposals with reference to the public hospitals' requirement for additional bed capacity.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	425	I propose to take Questions Nos. 119 to 121, inclusive, 123 and 127 together.The Government is committed to making the full range of cancer services available and accessible to cancer patients throughout Ireland in accordance with best international practice.In 2004, approval was granted for €15 million full-year funding to open the new radiotherapy department in Galway and to expand capacity in Cork. The new radiation oncology department at University College Hospital, Galway, commenced treatments in March 2005. In Cork University Hospital, the third linear accelerator commenced treatments in March 2005 and the fourth linear accelerator commenced treatment on 10 October 2005.The Government agrees that a major programme is now required to rapidly develop clinical radiation oncology treatment services to modern standards. In this regard, last July I announced the Government's plan for a national network of radiation oncology services to be put in place by 2011 and commencing in 2008. The network will consist of four large centres in Dublin, Cork and Galway and two integrated satellite centres at Waterford Regional Hospital and Limerick Regional Hospital. This will mean an investment in additional capacity to the equivalent of 23 additional linear accelerators. The capital investment involved will be approximately €480 million, with most of it funded through PPP over the period to 2011. Indicative revenue costs which will not arise until 2008 are of the order of €72 million.The Government considers that the best option in terms of improving geographic access for patients in the north-western area is to facilitate access for those patients to radiation oncology services as part of North-South co-operation on cancer. I have already met the Minister for Health of Northern Ireland, Mr. Shaun Woodward, MP, to discuss access by patients mainly in the north west to radiation oncology services at Belfast City Hospital. This state-of-the-art facility is scheduled to open in March 2006. I will be meeting again with Minister Woodward to further progress the Government's position on radiation oncology. Officials of my Department will also be meeting shortly with officials from the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, Northern Ireland.As I have previously indicated to the House, I consider that appropriate transport arrangements for patients requiring radiotherapy should be made available, where necessary, by the Health Service Executive, HSE. My Department raised this matter with the HSE last May to ensure that appropriate transport arrangements are put in place on a national basis for patients who are required to travel to obtain radiotherapy. Transport solutions are already a feature of the current provision of radiation oncology services and will form part of the planning and implementation of the new national plan, given the significant increase in capacity involved.The national radiation oncology co-ordinating group, NROCG, provides advice to my Department and the HSE on radiotherapy. In light of the above and the fact that under the Health Act 2004, the HSE has responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services, the NROCG does not intend to prepare a specific report on transport. My Department has asked the HSE to advise the Deputy directly in regard to current and proposed transport arrangements for oncology patients nationally.

A design team has been appointed to work up detailed plans for two new clinical units, one at the South Infirmary-Victoria Hospital, Cork and one at University College Hospital, Galway. It is anticipated that, subject to obtaining satisfactory planning approval, the design process including the preparation of the tender documentation will be completed by mid-2006.I understand that the National Hospital Office-Comhairle board recently approved in principle 12 consultant posts required for the national roll out. The board is seeking clarification from BreastCheck in regard to sessional commitments of a number of posts. Discussions are also taking place, involving my Department, on the revenue consequences of these posts.There are approximately 130,000 women in the target population for screening in the southern and western regions. BreastCheck is confident that the target date of 2007 for commencement of the roll out will be met. This will ensure that all women in the 50 to 64 age group in every county have access to breast screening and follow-up treatment where appropriate.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	428	A pilot cervical screening programme commenced in October 2000 and is available to eligible women resident in counties Limerick, Clare and Tipperary north. Under the programme, cervical screening is being offered, free of charge, to approximately 74,000 women in these three counties in the 25 to 60 age group, at five year intervals. I am committed to the national roll out of the cervical screening programme in line with international best practice.An international expert examined the feasibility and implications of a national roll out of a cervical screening programme. The examination included an evaluation of the current pilot programme, quality assurance, laboratory capacity and organisation and the establishment of national governance arrangements. Following the publication of this report my Department undertook a consultative process with relevant professional and advocacy stakeholders. The consultative process is completed and my Department will now discuss options for the roll out of the programme with the Health Service Executive.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	429	Since 1997 there has been a cumulative additional investment of approximately €720 million in the development of appropriate treatment and care services for people with cancer. This investment has enabled the funding of over 100 additional consultant posts in key areas of cancer care throughout the country. An evaluation of the first national cancer strategy demonstrated that the key goal of the strategy, to achieve a 15% decrease in mortality from cancer in the under-65 age group was achieved in 2001, three years ahead of target.The Government is committed to making the full range of cancer services available and accessible to cancer patients throughout Ireland in accordance with best international standards. It is important to build teams of highly expert clinicians working together to deliver top quality cancer care to patients. To this end, we will provide considerable investment in oncology services in the coming years.The national cancer forum is currently finalising a new national cancer strategy. The strategy has been developed in consultation with major stakeholders, including professional, voluntary groups and the general public, and will have regard to the multifaceted aspects of cancer control. The strategy will set out the key priorities for the development of cancer services over the coming years and will make recommendations in regard to a balanced organisation of cancer services nationally, with defined roles for hospitals in the delivery of cancer care. I expect the forum to submit the new strategy to me by the end of this year.

Following on the publication of this report, a working group chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach and comprising senior officials from the Departments of Finance, Health and Children and Social and Family Affairs has been established.The objective of this group is to identify the policy options for a financially sustainable system of long-term care, including improvements in community care, taking account of the Mercer report, the views of the consultation that was undertaken on that report and the review of the nursing home subvention scheme by Professor Eamon O'Shea. I understand that the group is addressing the issue of residential care for older people. This group will be reporting to the Tánaiste and to the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, shortly.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	434	Table 1 sets out the indicative expenditure profiles and the estimated expenditure incurred under each operational programme in the BMW region. Table 2 sets out the indicative expenditure profiles and estimated expenditure by the Exchequer for the same period in the BMW region for each operational programme. The expenditure data presented in the tables relate to the period January 2000 to the end of June 2005. These are the latest data reported to the operational programme monitoring committees. The 2005 annual expenditure profiles have been reduced by half in calculating the profile but the Deputy will be aware that significant expenditure, particularly Exchequer expenditure, takes place in the latter half of the year. The position will become clearer when data are available for the full calendaryear.Operational ProgrammeProfileExpenditureExpenditure versus Profile€m€m%Economic and Social Infrastructure5,3194,51485Employment & Human Resources Development3,3783,15693Productive Sector2,03069234Border, Midlands & Western Regional Programme3,1681,94661PEACE II & Technical Assistance1458659Total Expenditure14,04010,39074Profiles and Expenditure data include all NDP sources of funding: Exchequer, EU andprivate.The vast bulk of NDP spending is financed by the Exchequer.

Performance on the employment and human resource operational programmes, EHROP, is also on course.The performance of the productive sector and the regional operational programme remains disappointing due a number of factors already outlined in previous replies. These range from poor demand for a number of schemes, particularly in the agricultural sector and research and development, to initial over profiling of expenditure in the region, and poorer than expected private sector involvement. This underspend is also a feature in the southern and eastern region.As regards final outturn, I expect the ESIOP and EHROP to be close to target but the productive sector and regional programme will be below profile for the reasons set out above.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	436	The position is that traders making supplies in the State are obliged to register for VAT where certain turnover thresholds are exceeded or are likely to be exceeded in any continuous period of 12 months. The current VAT registration threshold of €25,500 for suppliers of services, referred to by the Deputy, has been in place since 1994. Businesses with a turnover below this threshold can of course register for VAT and those in the service sector in particular frequently choose to do so for business reasons.On the question of increasing the current thresholds, the position is that, under the EU sixth VAT directive, with which Irish VAT law must comply, member states may only increase thresholds in line with inflation. However, if the services threshold were increased in line with the consumer price index since 1994, the €25,500 threshold would need to be increased to approximately €35,000. The cost involved would be €20 million in a full year.It is not customary for me to comment on any possible changes to thresholds that may, or may not, arise in the context of the forthcoming budget.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	437	A special interdepartmental review group reviewed the operation of the disabled drivers scheme. The terms of reference of the group were to examine the operation of the existing scheme, including the difficulties experienced by the various groups and individuals involved with it, both at administrative and user levels, and to consider the feasibility of alternative schemes, with a view to assisting me in determining the future direction of the scheme.The group's report, published on my Department's website in July 2004, sets out in detail the genesis and development of the scheme. It examines, among other things, the qualifying medical criteria. The report makes a number of recommendations, both immediate and long-term, encompassing the operation of the appeals process and options for the future development of the scheme.In respect of the long-term recommendations, which would involve reforming the medical qualifying criteria, given the scale and scope of the scheme further changes can only be made after careful consideration. For this reason, as agreed by the Government in June 2004, I will consider the recommendations contained in the report of the interdepartmental review group in the context of the annual budgetary process having regard to the existing and prospective cost of the scheme.This Government is committed to supporting and reinforcing equal participation in society by people with disabilities. I remind the Deputy that disability was one of the priority areas where I substantially increased investment in budget 2005.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	438	I welcome the IMF assessment of the Irish economy's performance and prospects. I am pleased that the IMF has commented favourably on the continuing impressive performance of Ireland's economy, which it states is based on maintaining sound economic policies.Our inflation rate is broadly in line with that in the EU, contrary to what the Deputy says. It is 2.8% compared to 2.5% on the harmonised basis for September 2005. The recent increase in inflation is due to the spike in oil prices and has little to do with Government action. Since January 1997, tax-induced inflation has been a relatively small element, amounting to around 5.5 percentage points out of a 33.8% total increase as measured by the CSO constant tax price index.As the Deputy conveniently forgets, I made no changes to indirect taxes in the last budget. This decision played a significant role in keeping consumer price inflation at the low level we had successfully brought it down to in 2004.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	439	In order to prepare a reply to the Deputy's question, it has been necessary to gather material from sections throughout my Department. Unfortunately, it has not been possible to assemble and check all the material adequately in the time available. I will write to the Deputy with the remainder of the information sought at the earliest opportunity. I am, however, able to give the following material at this time.There is no directive for which my Department is responsible where transposition is currently overdue, that is where the relevant deadline has passed without the directive being transposed. There are currently four EU directives for which my Department has responsibility which have to be implemented before their relevant deadlines. In addition, there are a further three EU directives which, despite being fully implemented by Ireland, still appear on the EU Commission's list of outstanding directives. The Commission has been informed of this position. We await notification from the Commission that it has removed these three directives from its list of outstanding directives.The details of each of the four directives still to be implemented are set out as follows: Council Directive 2005/19/EC amending Directive 90/434/EEC 1990 on the common system of taxation applicable to mergers, divisions, transfers of assets and exchange of shares concerning companies of different member states. This directive amends the 1990 mergers directive which provides tax neutrality for cross-border company restructuring. The amending directive extends tax deferral to a larger number of cases and improves the methods to secure tax neutrality while safeguarding the financial interests of member states. The deadline for implementation is 1 January 2006 and this deadline is expected to be met; Council Directive 2004/18/EC — revised public sector procurement directive. This directive co-ordinates the procurement procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts. The deadline for implementation is 30 January 2006; Council Directive 2004/17/EC — revised utilities sector procurement directive. This directive co-ordinates the procurement procedures of entities operating in the water, energy, transport and postal services sector. The deadline for implementation is 30 January 2006; Council Directive 2004/39/EC — markets in financial instruments directive, MIFID. This directive allows investment firms to provide their services across the EU on the basis of their home country authorisation, that is, it will give them an effective single passport. The deadline for implementation is 30 April 2006. However, in view of the complexity of the directive and the changes in IT and other administrative procedures which the financial services sector will have to make, the Commission has proposed that the date for implementation be extended by six months. This would extend the deadline to the end of October 2006, with a further six months for industry to comply. This proposed extension is likely to be approved by Council.Every effort is made by my Department, in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General and Parliamentary Counsel to the Government, to ensure that directives are implemented within their deadlines, and this is expected to be achieved in regard to the four listed directives.

Provision was made for the return of this information in the form P35 for 2004 due for filing by employers in February 2005. It is hoped that these data can be made available in the first quarter of 2006 following enhancements to the Revenue computer system to enable this data capture and reporting. The above figures include income earners whose main source of income is assessable to tax under schedule D — self-employed — but who also have income from an employment subject to PAYE in respect of which a benefit-in-kind arises.It should be noted that as PAYE taxpayers were charged to tax on their earnings in the period 6 April to 31 December 2001 and self-employed taxpayers were assessed to tax for the short year on 74% of the profits earned in a 12-month accounting period, the yield figures will not be directly comparable with those of earlier or later years.

It is not possible at present to provide the information sought for a more recent year if the data are to be reasonably accurate.The sector identifier used on the tax records is based on the four-digit NACE code (Rev. 1), which is an internationally recognised economic activity code system. On this basis, the information requested is as follows:Employees.Sector (economic activity code)Number of income earners with gross income exceeding €200,000Cases where no sector identified (9991)981Letting of own property (70.20)419Medical practice activities (85.12)287Monetary intermediation (65.12)213General construction of buildings and civil engineering works (45.21)207Business and management consultancy activities (74.14)131Architectural and engineering activities and related technical consultancy (74.20)128Other business activities n.e.c.

The economic sector breakdown on Revenue records is based on details recorded using information supplied by income earners or their employers at some point in the past.Some of that information may have been incorrect or misinterpreted in the first instance, or may not have been subsequently updated as necessary. For these reasons, some of the economic sector codes on tax records are likely to be out of date or inaccurate and the reliability of the figures for the sectors currently provided will be limited to that extent.A married couple who has elected or who has been deemed to have elected for joint assessment is counted as one tax unit and their incomes are aggregated in the statistics.

For completeness, the numbers of income earners liable for tax at the top rate of 42% are also included.A married couple who has elected or has been deemed to have elected for joint assessment is counted as one tax unit. Married couples and individuals with income chargeable to tax under both schedules E and D have been classified in the attached tables by reference to the schedule under which the larger amount of income is taxable.The designation of a tax rate to an income earner in the tables is based on identifying the top tax rate applying to the taxable income of each earner. To arrive at the figure for taxable income, the gross income is reduced by various relevant deductions and allowances such as capital allowances, losses, allowable expenses and retirement annuities. In some cases, these will reduce the taxable income to nil.

Gross income is income prior to deductions for capital allowances, interest paid, losses, allowable expenses, retirement annuities, etc. It is income after the deduction of superannuation contributions by employees but not by the self-employed, and it includes income of individuals whose total income falls below the exemption limits. It does not include certain other income which is not income for tax purposes or is exempt from tax, such as profits or gains from stallion fees, profits from commercial forestry and certain income from patent royalties, certain investment income arising from personal injuries, child benefit, maternity benefit and unemployment assistance paid by the Department of Social and Family Affairs, certain earnings of writers, composers and artists, bonuses or interest paid under instalment savings schemes operated by An Post, interest on certain Government securities, certain foreign pensions which are exempt from tax in the foreign paying country, portions of certain lump sums received by employees on cessation of their employment, statutory redundancy payments and certain military pensions.Gross income does not include or does not fully include other income sources such as interest income that does not need to be declared or is not recorded, but from which tax has been deducted; unemployment benefit and disability benefit — non-recording of non-taxable amounts and of amounts taxed by restriction of repayments or indirectly through employers in the PAYE system; and the incomes of certain self-employed persons, including some farmers, as well as some individuals in receipt of pensions, who are not processed annually on tax records because their incomes are below the income tax thresholds.A married couple who has elected or has deemed to have elected for joint assessment is counted as one tax unit. The figures for the years 2002, 2003 and 2004 have been revised from those quoted in the reply to the Deputy's Questions Nos. 164 to 167 of 3 November 2004, to take account of more up-to-date base information and revised macro-economic projections of income levels and number at work which have become available. The figures for 2003 onwards are projected estimates and may be subject to further revision.

The second spouse may avail of the balance of the €58,800 band.A home carer tax credit of €770 can be claimed by married persons who are jointly assessed to tax and where one spouse works at home to care for a dependent person, which includes a dependent child, provided certain conditions are satisfied. A married couple cannot claim both the home carer tax credit and the increased standard rate band. They can, however, claim whichever of the two is the most beneficial.

Information on these in provided in a range of Revenue information leaflets and guides, details of which are set out in table 1.In February 2005, Revenue launched a new self-service option for PAYE taxpayers. This service allows PAYE employees to claim, using the Internet, text messaging or the lo-call 1890 phone number, in respect of age credits for those aged 65 or over, service charges and trade union subscriptions. It also allows them to request a form 12, return of income, med 1, medical expenses claim, P50, unemployment claim, and rent 1 rent relief. These facilities were widely advertised in the media and were included in the information leaflet issued with the tax credit certificates for 2005.I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are not in a position to provide an estimate of the amount of unclaimed tax credits. Any claims made for the past three income tax years have been processed and appropriate repayments made to the taxpayers. In the absence of a claim from a taxpayer, Revenue has no way of knowing that an individual is entitled to an additional tax credit. There is, therefore, no basis on which an estimate of the amount involved could be compiled.As regards procedures for claiming back tax credits, many of the more significant reliefs have been made virtually automatic over recent years either through the introduction of tax relief at source, TRS, or through the automatic carry forward, ACF, of the reliefs. For example, mortgage interest relief and medical insurance relief are provided at source through the taxpayer obtaining a reduction in repayments or premiums equivalent to the tax relief. Recurring reliefs, like those for trade union subscriptions and service charges, once claimed, are allowed on an ongoing basis and re-appear each year in the taxpayer's certificate of tax credits.The other main reliefs relate to medical expenses, certain dental expenses, age credits for people aged over 65, third level tuition fees and rent relief. In the case of these reliefs, and the first claims for trade union subscriptions, it is generally up to each individual taxpayer concerned to claim his or her entitlements, as Revenue has no other way of ascertaining what these are.Claims for claiming back credits may be lodged through any one of the following channels: by contacting any of the four regional lo-call telephone numbers, details in table 2, by accessing the Revenue website; by using the PAYE self-service mobile phone text messaging facility. It enables customers to request PAYE forms and leaflets, and to claim certain PAYE tax credits using their mobile phone. It is fully self-service and can be accessed from anywhere and at any time by contacting the nationwide network of revenue information offices as set out in table 3.From early 2006 the Revenue Commissioners will provide a facility for PAYE customers to access their Revenue records over the Internet to request and complete a 2005 on-line review of their liability and to claim or amend their tax credit details.Publication of Forms, Leaflets and Guides.Revenue publish claim forms, leaflets and guides on all PAYE tax credits and allowances including:IT1Tax Credits, Reliefs and Rates for 2004 and 2005IT2Taxation of Married PersonsIT3What to do about tax when you separateIT6Health-Medical Expenses ReliefMED 1Health Expenses Claim formIT8Tax Exemption and Marginal ReliefIT9One Parent Family Tax CreditIT11Employee’s Guide to PAYEIT18Incapacitated Child AllowanceIT27Tax Relief for Service ChargesIT31Tax Relief for Tuition FeesIT35Blind Persons Allowances and ReliefsIT45Tax Credits and Reliefs for those aged 65 and overIT46Dependent Relative Tax CreditIT47Employed Person taking care of Incapacitated IndividualAll Revenue's PAYE forms and information leaflets can be downloaded and printed from the Revenue website —www.revenue.ie— or ordered on-line.

However, this data are not collected in such a manner that would allow a more detailed break-down of the annual yield to be provided as between second-hand and relevant new residential property.Stamp duty is also chargeable on transfers of sites at the appropriate rates for non-residential property but I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that it is not possible to determine what proportion of the total stamp duty on non-residential property relates to site transfers.

I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated full year cost to the Exchequer, based on projected 2006 incomes, of the changes to the band structure referred to above is about €1.6 billion. This figure is provisional and subject to revision.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	455	The current minimum wage is €7.65 per hour. This figure, indexed in line with an increase in average wages of, say, 4% would be €7.96 per hour which is equivalent to €16,143 on an annualised basis. By reference to the pre-budget 2006 income tax ready reckoner prepared by the Revenue Commissioners, it is estimated that the full year costs to the Exchequer of ensuring that no tax is paid by employees earning such an amount on a 39 hour week basis would be in the region of €500 million in a full year if done through an increase in the employee, PAYE, credit, or if the personal credit were used, about €725 million in a full year. If the personal and employee credits each bore half the required increase, the full year cost would be approximately €615 million. These figures are provisional, are likely to be revised and are rounded to the nearest €5 million.The present entry point to income tax is €14,250 per annum for a single person aged less than 65. The latest estimate from the Revenue Commissioners indicates that, provisionally, there are roughly 33,000 employees earning at or below the current minimum wage annualised — €15,515 per annum — who are likely to be liable for a small amount of income tax in 2005. However, this group will of necessity include part-time workers earning more than the minimum hourly wage, and certain pensioners whose earnings are in the equivalent range. The 33,000 should therefore be seen as the upper band for any estimate of the number who may ultimately come into the tax net. A married couple which has elected or has been deemed to have elected for joint assessment is counted as one tax unit.

Notes on Table
(1)Figures accompanied by an asterisk * are particularly tentative and subject to a considerable margin of error.(2)The cost figures for the exemption limits are based on the excess of the exemption limits over the basic personal tax credits. They include the cost of marginal relief for taxpayers whose incomes are not greatly in excess of the exemption limits.(3)The figures shown for the basic personal tax credits (married, single and widowed) are the costs of these tax credits as if all other tax credits and the exemption limits did not apply. They do not include individuals who are not on Revenue records because their incomes are below the income tax thresholds.(4)Part of the cost of contributions to Permanent Health Benefit Schemes is not identifiable as a result of the move to a "net pay" basis for contributions by PAYE taxpayers from 6 April 2001(5)In the absence of other information, tax has been assumed at the standard rate even though a different rate might be appropriate in many cases.(6)"Other" relates to borrowings for purposes such as acquiring an interest in a company or partnership or to pay death duties.(7)The cost of exempting the income of charities, colleges, hospitals, schools, friendly societies, etc. from income tax includes the sums repaid in respect of tax credits and income tax deducted at source (certain dividends, other investment income and payments received under covenant) It also includes the cost of exempting certain bodies from the deduction on income arising from government securities. Information is not available about other income received gross.(8)Relief for donations to Approved Sports Bodies was introduced in 2002 and the cost is based on self assessment returns for that year.(9)Except where otherwise indicated, the costs included for corporation tax are by reference to accounting periods which ended in the years 2001 and 2002.(10)In the absence of Revenue-sourced data the figures shown are tentative estimates based on basic data supplied by the Department of Environment and Local Government which cannot be linked directly with tax claims. Use of this data has been discontinued because alternative arrangements have been made by the Revenue Commissioners for more suitable tax-based data to be captured. Until recently claims for urban renewal relief were aggregated in tax returns with other claims and were not separately identifiable. However, as part of ongoing commitments to improve the quality of information available on the costs of tax expenditures generally, the Revenue Commissioners have introduced changes to the income tax returns forms which are intended to yield additional information on the take-up of the relief claimed by individuals from the 2004 tax year onwards. Corresponding changes have been made to the Corporation Tax return form which will produce similar information for accounting periods ending in 2005 and subsequent years.(11)Capital Allowances data was not requested on the 2002 CT1 form, therefore the 2002 figures are estimated.The cost shown for capital allowances does not include any cost associated with "unused capital allowances", that is, capital allowances which are not absorbed by a company in the accounting period in which they arise because they exceed the amount of the company's profits of that accounting period which are available for offset. Unused capital allowances can be offset as losses against taxable profits arising in the previous accounting period and against certain profits arising in future accounting periods and can be offset against the profits of another company in the same group of companies. It is estimated that €3,000 million of unused capital allowances were claimed in respect of 2002 accounting periods but as the proportion of this item which is included in previous years losses and in group relief is not separately identifiable a reliable estimate of the cost of the capital allowance element cannot be provided.The 2001 figure for capital allowances has been revised.(12)In the absence of Revenue-sourced data the figures shown are tentative estimates based on basic data supplied by the Department of Environment and Local Government which cannot be linked directly with tax claims. The figures for "section 23/section 27" relief are confined to urban renewal schemes in place up to 1999 and usable data is not compiled for later schemes. Use of this data has, therefore, been discontinued because it is incomplete.Until recently claims for "section 23/section 27" type relief were aggregated in tax returns with other claims and were not separately identifiable. However, as part of ongoing commitments to improve the quality of information available on the costs of tax expenditures generally, the Revenue Commissioners have introduced changes to the  income tax return forms which are intended to yield additional information on the take-up of the relief claimed by individuals from 2003 onwards. Corresponding changes have been made to the Corporation Tax return form which will produce similar information for accounting periods ending in 2005 and subsequent years.(13)The cost does not include any notional cost associated with IFSC companies. The International Financial Services activity in Ireland represents new business which has developed as a result of, among other things, the concessionary tax rate. This means that as the cost of the concessionary rate is not just the difference between the concessionary tax rate and the full tax rate, it is therefore not quantifiable. In regard to the cost shown for the effective rate of 10 per cent for manufacturing and certain other activities, no account is taken of the fact that without these incentives, many enterprises may not have set up here. To the extent that profits earned by such enterprises would not have been available for Irish tax purposes, part of the cost figure shown might be regarded as notional.

The latest figures available are in respect of the income tax year 2002. The total cost of tax relief on pensions contributions is tentatively estimated by the Revenue Commissioners at approximately €2.7 billion. This total figure is broken down in terms of numbers, where available and in terms of costs is in the following table.Type of Pension ContributionsNumbersEstimated Costs 2002€millionEmployees’ Contributions to approved Superannuation Schemes709,300 **560Employers’ Contributions to approved Superannuation SchemesN/A620Exemption of Net Income of approved Superannuation Funds (Contributions plus Investment Income less Outgoings)N/A1,270Retirement Annuity Premiums (RAC’s) ***110,600250Total819,9002,700** Numbers sourced from annual Report of The Pensions Board for 2002*** RACs are used by the self-employed and by employees who are not in pensionable employment.This cost covers tax relief on contributions by employers, employees and self-employed and the exemption from income and gains in the pension fund.With regard to occupational pensions, that is, schemes set up by the employer, the figures in respect of employee and employer contributions are available only in aggregate form on a tentative basis. Information on such contributions is not captured in such a way as to make it possible to provide disaggregated figures distinguishing between the public service and the public sector, whether backed or not by pension funds, and the private sector.Tax relief for pension contributions by employees is normally given by way of a deduction from total income in arriving at income for tax purposes namely, the income for tax purposes of employees is net of their pension contributions, the "net pay" arrangement.The employer's contributions are an allowable deduction from profits and are not specifically recorded in Revenue statistics. However, provisions were included in Finance Act 2004 with a view to improving data quality and transparency without overburdening taxpayers and employers. The Act includes provisions that require employers to provide data on superannuation contributions in the P35 form to be filed by employers in February 2006.

Phases 1 and 2 coast protection works were carried out at Annagassan by Louth County Council in the period 1996 to 2001. Funding of €469,326 was provided by the Department towards the cost of these works.The section of the coastline directly behind the house of the residents referred to by the Deputy and the local credit union were not included in the above mentioned phases. Earlier this year, Louth County Council submitted a proposal to the Department for the area in question, Annagassan Phase 3, at an estimated cost of €100,000. This will be considered in the context of the amount of funding available for coast protection works g generally and overall nationalpriorities.

ComReg's register of authorised undertakings currently lists no less than 196 companies offering Internet access services in Ireland with a wide variety of service levels.According to recent EU Internet statistics there are over two million Internet users in Ireland. This represents user growth of 163% in the last four years and a market penetration per population of 51.2%, which compares favourably with the EU average of 48.9%. The rate of broadband uptake is dependent on a combination of factors. These include access by the private sector service providers to suitable infrastructure, as well as competition between broadband service providers and demand conditions for broadband in the economy. The Government has addressed the infrastructure deficit by building high-speed open access metropolitan area networks, MANs, in over 20 towns and cities nationwide to date, in association with the local and regional authorities. My Department also offers funding assistance to smaller towns and rural communities to support the roll-out of broadband services through the county and group broadband scheme, under which 150 projects have already been approved covering over 450 communities. The broadband for schools initiative, which is currently under way, will ensure the provision of broadband to all primary and post primary schools in the country by early 2006.The number of broadband users continues to grow fast, across a range of technologies and there are now in excess of 175,000 broadband users, an increase of over 75% since the end of 2004. The current take-up rate for broadband is in the region of 10,000 per month.My Department's broadband website  www.broadband.gov.ie gives prices, service levels, locations and contact details of 44 service providers offering a wide range of broadband services in all areas of the country from 0.256 megabits per second to 56 megabits per second, using a range of delivery platforms such as cable, DSL, fixed wireless and satellite. There is a range of broadband technologies that can deliver broadband to any customer in Ireland at the moment. Full details of the regional broadband programme can be found on my Department’s website www.dcmnr.gov.ie. The contract for the provision of fixed line and Internet services to the public sector is handled by the Department of Finance.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	465	Government policy on the regional harbours as recently published in the ports policy statement is that the continued operation of the regional harbours under the outdated provisions of the Harbours Act 1946 is unsustainable on the grounds of good governance. The policy statement states that the regional harbours would best achieve their potential through their transfer to local authority ownership as many of the regional harbours have neither the resources nor the capability to comply with aspects of the code or practice for the governance of State bodies whereas their transfer to local authority control would bring improved corporate governance and allow the harbours to realise their amenity potential.The ports policy statement drew on the review of State regional ports and harbours carried out by KPMG in 1999, which analysed trading, financial and governance issues at the harbours and recommended the transfer of certain regional harbours to local authority control. In accordance with Government policy, Sligo is designated for transfer to Sligo County Council.This Department is working with the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government to facilitate the implementation of the ports policy statement in this regard. It is intended to make arrangements for the transfer of the designated regional harbours to their respective local authorities, where appropriate, and to proceed individually in conjunction with the relevant local authorities and the harbour authorities having regard to local requirements in each case.Sligo harbour commissioners are very active in the number of property transfers they have proposed. The correspondence referred to in the question was received in the Department on 8 September 2005. An acknowledgement letter was issued in reply on 8 September 2005. The matter has been referred to the Valuation Office for a report. A response is awaited. A full reply will be issued to the correspondence in question when the valuation office advice has been received.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	472	I propose to take Questions Nos. 185 and 186 together.Ireland has committed €390,000 over a three-year period to the Organisation of American States, OAS, peace and verification mission in Colombia. Sweden and the Netherlands are also funding the mission, the mandate of which is to provide comprehensive support to the Colombian peace process, with a focus both on demobilisation and on the strengthening of institutions concerned with the rule of law. This is in addition to the support of just under €1 million that we are providing to civil society in Colombia through Christian Aid and Trócaire.The EU has consistently stressed the need for a negotiated peace settlement in Colombia and called for illegal armed groups to demobilise. It has confirmed its readiness and that of its member states to assist the Colombian Government and civil society in the provision of support for communities affected by the internal conflict. It has also called on all parties to the conflict to respect human rights and international humanitarian law and commended the work of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, UNHCHR, in Colombia.Most recently, Ireland was actively involved in the negotiation of the conclusions on Columbia adopted by the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 3 October 2005. The Conclusions principally address the recently passed Justice and Peace Law, which provides an overall legal framework for demobilisation, disarmament and reintegration of illegal armed groups into society. They also welcome the involvement of the OAS in supporting the demobilisation of paramilitary groups.The issues involved in such questions are complex and difficult. I am well aware of the human rights questions which arise in Colombia and of the criticisms of the Justice and Peace Law. In such situations, a balance has to be struck between justice and peace. The law reflects a number of such balances, including giving sufficient incentives to illegal armed groups to disarm and demobilise, while also requiring truth and reparations for the victims as well as the punishment of those who have committed crimes. It should also be borne in mind that the Justice and Peace Law has come about as a result of a lengthy democratic parliamentary process.Within Columbia itself there are undoubtedly varying views on the peace process. Significant domestic supporters of the peace process include the Catholic Church, representatives of which have said that the Justice and Peace Law, despite its imperfections, has many positive points and that the key will lie in proper implementation of its provisions. Foreign Minister Barco welcomed Ireland's support when I met her in New York on 19 September 2005, while being very open about the challenges facing the process in the period ahead.At its 61st session held in April 2005 in Geneva, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights adopted the chair's statement on the situation of human rights in Colombia. This found that, in 2004, illegal armed groups were responsible for the vast majority of criminal acts and breaches of international humanitarian law in Colombia. It is disturbing, despite the peace process which has seen many thousands hand in their weapons, that there continue to be credible allegations that paramilitaries remain involved in this type of action. However I am convinced, and this is also the assessment of our EU partners as reflected in the text of the conclusions that, if implemented effectively and in a transparent manner, the new law will have a positive effect on peace-building in Colombia. At the same time, we are urging the prompt implementation by the Colombian Government of the recommendations of the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	475	Ireland is undergoing a positive transformation in how we earn our living from international trade and investment. This transformation builds on the success of consistent, pro-enterprise policies that have made the economy adaptable to globalisation. These policies have enabled enterprise in Ireland to make the most of new opportunities thrown up by changing trends in the global flows of goods, services and investments. These policies have resulted in an unprecedented expansion in both employment and job opportunities. The transformation in our economy brings change.The National Competitiveness Council's, NCC, reports annually on our competitiveness and this year's annual report noted our competitive position over 170 indicators against 15 important competitor economies. The council's latest annual report highlights a number of areas where our performance could be improved but confirmed that Ireland is experiencing a strong and robust economic performance underpinned by impressive competitive strengths. From 1997 to 2004, Irish GDP grew by an average of over 7.5% compared with an average of just over 2% in the EU15. The indicators reflect that living standards in Ireland both in terms of GDP where we are first out of 15 and GNP where we are sixth out of 16, have grown significantly. GDP is expected to grow by around 5% per cent this year compared with an OECD average of 2.6%.Of the 16 countries benchmarked by the NCC, Ireland is the most attractive for foreign direct investment. US companies, for example, earn the highest rate of return on their investments in Ireland as compared with other investment locations and in 2003 accounted for about 6% of all US foreign direct investment coming into Europe. Uncompromising investment decisions are not made in favour of uncompetitive and lowly rated economies.The economy is also generating a relatively high rate of indigenous entrepreneurial activity. The NCC's analysis shows that Ireland is ranked second in the EU and seventh among the OECD countries on this measure. Pro-enterprise policies and the obvious success and reward from business activity are changing the climate for indigenous investment and entrepreneurship.Our continued international competitiveness underpins the high levels of job creation we are experiencing right across the economy. The latest quarterly national household survey shows the number of persons in employment grew by 93,000 in the year to reach almost 1.93 million in the second quarter of 2005. At 5.1% this is the highest annual growth rate recorded since the second quarter of 2000. Moreover, we have seen employment increase in most sectors of the economy, not just construction, with financial and business services showing strong growth. These facts demonstrate that we remain a competitive economy for both foreign and indigenous enterprise and retain a strong capacity to generate and sustain employment while managing the transition to a more knowledge and services oriented economy. While the export performance of manufacturing is weaker it is significant that services exports continue to grow with Ireland's total share of world services trade growing from 0.5% to 2% since 1998. Furthermore we are winning new important and sophisticated foreign investment to replace employment in older manufacturing sectors.However, despite these successes I am not complacent. To reinforce our competitiveness agenda I have mandated policy changes within enterprise support agencies such as the restructuring of Enterprise Ireland, the launch of its productivity improvement fund and the steady progression in implementing recommendations of the enterprise strategy group. Our investment in the productivity improvement fund is especially important in promoting the importance of productivity for competitiveness. Productivity is a vital area that all enterprises need to act on to embed competitiveness and enhance their ability to grow and invest.Regarding cost competitiveness in general, the NCC has some good news in that Irish prices and costs are no longer increasing at a rate faster than elsewhere in the EU, where we are eighth out of 15 countries on this indicator. This stability will help in maintaining cost competitiveness but it is worthwhile noting that costs are just one aspect of competitiveness. Of more long-term importance is the rate at which we innovate, invest, increase productivity and provide market driven products and services, faster than our competitors.

In addition, a further 15 directives require to be transposed, two by the end of this year and the remainder in subsequent years. In the case of the overdue directives, three are the subject of letters of formal notice by the European Commission and a further directive is the subject of a reasoned opinion. Details of these directives are provided in the following table. It is anticipated that all of the overdue directives will be transposed before the year end.Directive 2001/45/EC, concerning the minimum safety and health requirements for the use of work equipment by workers at work, which was due to be transposed by 19 July 2004, is currently the longest overdue directive. It is due to be transposed by way of regulations, namely the forthcoming Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulations. It is intended that these regulations will be in force before the end of 2005.Two directives which were previously transposed are also the subject of infringements under Article 226. In the case of Directive 92/100/EEC, rental right and lending right and on certain rights related to copyright in the field of intellectual property, the European Commission considered that Ireland had incorrectly transposed certain provisions of the directive. With the intention of resolving the matter, the Government has approved the drafting of legislation which will provide a legislative basis for the introduction of a positive public lending right scheme in Ireland. In respect of Directive 89/391/EEC, framework directive on safety and health of workers at work, the European Commission determined that Ireland had failed to fulfil its obligations in respect of the directive. The difficulties raised by the Commission have now been addressed in the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 and it is anticipated that proceedings will now be dropped.It is not possible to provide definitive information on infringement proceedings prior to 2001. However, with the exception of those directives currently subject to infringement proceedings, as outlined above, all other infringement proceedings have been satisfactorily resolved. At present there are no other infringement cases outstanding. The following table provides details of EU directives for which infringement notices have been issued since January 2001 and where applicable it details the date transposed and the position in relation to those directives which are currently awaiting transposition.Description of DirectiveDeadline for Transposition into Irish LawCurrent positionCouncil Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at workDirective was transposed in 1993.

This scheme, which is run annually, provides awards recognising safety and health performance across a range of categories and is always heavily subscribed. Another good practice award scheme at EU level is run by the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work. Ireland has, in the past, featured strongly in these awards. The seventh European good practice awards in occupational safety, health and welfare are currently being finalised. At this stage, it is envisaged that the 2006 award scheme will recognise companies or organisations, including schools, colleges and training providers that have made outstanding and innovative contributions to ensure that young people make a safe start in their working lives, and that risk awareness and prevention is promoted in enterprises, schools and colleges. I very much welcome such award schemes and I am happy to give my full support to them.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	478	No distinction is made in employment rights legislation between Irish and migrant workers. For the avoidance of doubt, section 20 of the Protection of Employee's (Part-Time) Work Act 2001 provides that all employee protection legislation on the Statute Book in Ireland applies to workers posted to work in Ireland in line with Directive 96/71/EC of the European Parliament and Council of 16 December 1996. This directive relates to the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services and applies also to a person, irrespective of his or her nationality or place of residence, who has entered into a contract of employment that provides for his or her being employed in the State or who works in the State under a contract of employment. Thus all employment rights legislation applies to migrant workers. As is the case in legislation, the labour inspectorate does not differentiate between migrant and Irish workers and accordingly does not have statistical information in relation to the number of breaches in respect of migrant workers alone.The total number of breaches detected by the labour inspectorate in the period April to September 2005 was 1,125. The number of breaches detected in the period April to September 2004 was 1,060. The breaches in these instances relate to a wide remit of legislation. The principal breaches related to non-compliance with employment regulation orders and registered employment agreements.

The number of FIS claims in payment at the end of September 2005 was 15,784. This represents an increase of 31% since December 2002, when 12,043 claims were in payment.FIS income limits were increased by €39 per week in budget 2005. This represents a net increase of €23.40 per week for most recipients. Weekly FIS income limits have risen by €84 since 2002, a net increase of €50.40. The guaranteed minimum weekly rate of payment for anyone who qualifies for FIS increased to €20 from January 2004. The estimated cost of increasing FIS thresholds are contained in the following table. It should be noted that these estimates reflect the cost of these increases to current recipients only.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	481	The one-parent family payment acts as a safety net for people caring for children on their own, who receive inadequate maintenance, where maintenance payments are irregular or where efforts to secure maintenance in the first place fail. Applicants for one-parent family payments must satisfy the Department that they have made reasonable attempts to obtain such maintenance. They are also required to make ongoing efforts to seek adequate maintenance from their former spouses or, in the case of unmarried applicants, the parent of the child.Since the introduction of the one-parent family payment in 1997, there have been substantial improvements in the rates of payment and in the assessment of means for the payment. One-parent family payment claimants are allowed to retain 50% of any maintenance received without reduction in their social welfare payment. They also have a disregard in respect of rent or mortgage payments up to a maximum of €95.23 per week. The number of one-parent family payment recipients being paid by my Department at the end of September 2005 is 79,937. Included in this figure are 906 payments to widowed persons.My Department's records indicate that approximately 9,600 one-parent family payment recipients are in receipt of maintenance from a spouse or other parent, resulting in a payment at a reduced rate to the lone parent. However, many other recipients may be in receipt of maintenance while still qualifying for the maximum rate of one-parent family payment as a result of the provision allowing one-parent family claimants to retain 50% of any maintenance received. There were 2,019 liable relatives contributing directly to my Department at the end of September 2005, the latest date for which figures are available.There is no loss of income incurred by one-parent family payment recipients where the Department has to pursue the issue of maintenance with the non-resident parent. Rather, the provision allowing one-parent family claimants to retain 50% of any direct maintenance received was established as an incentive for lone parents to seek agreement with the other parent on the level of maintenance to be paid. Any change to this approach will be considered in the context of the significant social reforms in the area of lone parents which are currently under consideration.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	482	I propose to take Questions Nos. 197 to 203, inclusive, together.My Department is highly dependent on information and communications technology to support schemes, produce payments and deliver a pro-active service to customers. By the late 1990s, it was clear that our technology and processes were becoming obsolete and that a radical programme of change and development was required to meet new and ongoing needs of the Department.In July 2000, the Government approved proposals by the Department for the service delivery modernisation, SDM, programme. The SDM is a multi-annual programme of work involving the introduction of new technology and the replacement of legacy computer systems. It also involves the redesign of back office systems, business processes, procedures and work practices and the introduction of new organisational structures. The programme, which comprises business, organisation and technical streams, is designed to be implemented in self-contained phases. Each phase delivers key business benefits, extends the business object model chosen by the Department and strengthens and enhances the underlying technical architecture.The first phase of SDM, which focused on the child benefit scheme, commenced in February 2001 and was successfully implemented in November 2002. The current phase commenced on 31 May 2004 and covers the extension of the SDM programme to retirement pension, old age contributory pension, related household benefits and bereavement grants. Each phase of the programme has two main strands: technical, which involves the development and refinement of the information technology infrastructure to provide the foundation for a radically improved and modernised system of service delivery for all social welfare schemes; and business reorganisation, which involves a parallel programme of organisational change to take advantage of the new technology and information and communication technology, ICT, systems and to deliver efficiencies in business processes and maximize customer service.As part of the current phase of the SDM programme, a contribution history object, CHO, is being developed on a phased basis. The first phase of the CHO, which facilitates the electronic consolidation of a customer's full insurance record, was implemented in October 2005. This development provides for a new interface to the post-1979 contributions data, currently stored on the Departments central records system, CRS, and for the capture of pre-1979 insurance histories which were previously only available on microfiche. The next phase of the CHO, which will incorporate EU records and client eligibility services, will be implemented early in November 2005.The contributions history, once collated, will provide a comprehensive and accurate view of the customer's insurance record. This will facilitate quick and easy access for sections across the Department to customers records. The CHO will enhance the role of deciding officers, who are statutorily appointed to make decisions on a person's entitlement to a social welfare payment, by providing them with speedier access to comprehensive more accurate insurance records.The Department has in place well tried procurement structures and procedures which fully comply with EU public procurement regulations. All consultancy contracts for SDM were carried out in strict compliance with these regulations. Consultants for the technical project were appointed following an open procurement competition. The criteria used in evaluating responses to the request for tenders, RFT, were published in the RFT. The appointment was made following a full evaluation of the tenders received having regard to the award criteria. The same consultancy company was also awarded a contract in 2002 to define a software change management, SCM, process for the Department following an open tender competition.In awarding contracts the Department does not take account of contracts previously carried out by the tendering company, whether for this Department or any other body. Contracts are awarded on the merits of the tender and the extent to which they meet the criteria set out in the RFT. The Department establishes a relationship solely with the successful company, which is then responsible for the delivery of all services provided under the terms of the contract. All duties and responsibilities associated with the contract, including the quality and timeliness of the work, lies with the prime contractor. This includes responsibility for the work of sub-contractors brought in by them.The Department has contracted with a company to deliver the technical stream of the current phase of SDM. This company has sub-contracted two other companies to deliver some elements of the contract. All payments due under this contract are made to the prime contractor and the Department is not party to business arrangements or payments made by the prime contractor to the sub-contractors. One of the sub-contracting companies was responsible for developing the underlying architectural approach being adopted by the SDM. For this reason, the Department separately engaged this company to provide direct quality assurance and general business object modelling advice. A total of €6,000 has been paid for these services in 2005. No payments have been made by the Department to the second named sub-contractor.The SDM programme involves the introduction of new systems development approaches, new methodologies and technologies which give rise to a need for new skill sets. A key element of each phase of SDM is a programme of skills transfer from the consultants to our staff so as to lead to a build up of skills over time. The current phase of SDM includes a skills transfer programme encompassing training, education and involvement in critical design aspects of the project leading to the build up of skills and experience of the new approaches and technology. It is expected that all requisite skills will be acquired over the course of the programme. It was never expected that the Department would be self sufficient in terms of its ability to maintain all aspects of the system after implementation of the project. Indeed, given the range of skills required, it would not be practical to try to acquire all these skills and to retain them in-house. Consequently, there will always be a need for some external support.The current phase of the SDM programme encompasses the contributory and retirement pension schemes and is scheduled for implementation at the end of March 2006. The new system will facilitate the proactive initiation of pension claims, make it easier for customers to transact their business with the Department and will provide additional support for staff in carrying out their duties. I am satisfied, however, that Department staff are gaining critical experience, education and learning opportunities in this phase of the project which will contribute to their ability to manage, control and lead future phases of the SDM programme.During 2005 the Department incurred expenditure with regard to software development consultancy, purchase of computer hardware and software, organisational change consultancy and staff salary costs on the SDM programme. To date these costs for 2005 are €3,411,227.54.The service delivery modernisation programme is a major undertaking which aims to introduce modern ICT systems and work practices to allow the Department to respond more rapidly to strategic changes and to deliver a high quality, pro-active personalised and integrated service to its customers. I am satisfied that the new system will deliver tangible benefits for customers and will be more efficient both in terms of accuracy and time taken to deal with the processing of claims.

The scheme is payable, subject to certain conditions, to people who previously had been in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment or who had participated in community employment. The specified qualifying social welfare payment types are farm assistance, unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit, disability allowance and community employment.The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has advised that equivalent payments will be made through the rural social scheme for participants who had an entitlement to fuel allowance previously under their relevant social welfare or community employment scheme.

At that time the disregard was £35.20, equivalent to €44.69 and was increased to £36.30 or €46.09 on 4 June 1997 and to £50 or €63.49 on 3 June 1998. It was then increased to £75 of €95.23 on 5 April 2000 and extended to earnings from self-employment. It reached its current level of €120 in April 2000.The earnings disregard provides an initial incentive for recipients of disability allowance to take up employment opportunities but once in employment, the incentive to increase existing earnings above this limit is affected by the fact that all additional earnings will be assessed on a euro for euro basis. The increase in the minimum wage level has also had an impact on the incentive for people to increase their employment beyond the level of the current disregard.A recent review of the illness and disability schemes carried out by my Department suggested that continually increasing the income disregard level can lead to difficulties for persons who wish to increase their employment level. The review group favoured a mechanism to allow for the more gradual withdrawal of social welfare benefits as earnings increase to ensure that people who increase their earnings or employment potential will also increase their overall income level.My Department is currently examining ways to make it easier for people with disabilities to take up work and to address any disincentives within the schemes to do so. Any changes to the disability allowance scheme in this regard will be considered in a budgetary context.

An appeal on the person's behalf was received on 11 October 2005 in the social welfare appeals office. An appeals officer has considered the case and is of the opinion that an oral hearing is necessary. The person concerned will be notified of the time, date and venue of the hearing when these have been arranged. Under social welfare legislation, decisions concerning claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role with regard to making such decisions.

The onus is on the claimant to show to the satisfaction of a deciding officer that he or she satisfies each of these conditions on an ongoing basis.In accordance with section 42(4)(a)(iii) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 1993, as amended, a deciding officer disallowed the unemployment benefit claim of the claimant concerned from 3 August 2005 on the grounds that the person was not genuinely seeking full-time work. The deciding officer, taking into account all relevant circumstances and based on the evidence provided by the claimant, was not satisfied he had been consistently seeking full-time work. The person concerned appealed this decision and his file has been forwarded to the independent social welfare appeals office for determination. When a decision is made, the person concerned will be notified of the outcome. Under social welfare legislation, decisions concerning claims and the insurability of employment must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.

To qualify for a payment under the national fuel scheme, the total income of a widow, including her widow's contributory pension, must not exceed €236.49 per week. The person concerned is receiving an occupational pension in addition to her widow's contributory pension, bringing her income above the weekly threshold of €236.49. Accordingly, her application for the fuel allowance has been disallowed.

#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	492	Widows and widowers can qualify for one of a number of different schemes depending on their particular circumstances. The contributory widow's or widower's pension is available to those who satisfy the necessary PRSI contribution conditions, either on their own record or that of the deceased spouse. Those qualifying for this benefit are not subject to any means test.Those without the necessary PRSI contributions can, if they have qualifying children, receive the one-parent family payment. This is a means tested payment but it does feature a reasonable earnings disregard which is designed to assist with the extra costs those with children face in trying to access training or employment. Up to €146.50 of earnings per week is completely disregarded, while earnings in excess of that up to €293 per week, are assessed at 50%.Widows and widowers with dependent children can benefit from the widowed parent grant introduced in 2000 for additional assistance following a bereavement. The grant is currently valued at €2,700 and is paid in addition to the usual after death payments. Increases in the rates of child benefit are also of benefit to widows and widowers with children. Since 1997, the monthly rates of child benefit have been increased significantly. The current rates of child benefit are €141.60 per month for each of the first and second children and €177.30 per month for the third and subsequent children.Increases in payment supports for widows and widowers have more than covered increases in living costs in recent years. I am continuing to look for opportunities to improve their position and, in this regard, the various provisions for widows and widowers under the social welfare code are being examined in the context of the forthcoming budget and broader social policy reforms.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	493	Ireland has social security agreements with seven countries — Austria, Australia,Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, the USA and Switzerland. These agreements came into effect between 1989 and 1999, except for that with the UK which came into effect in 1971. Ireland also has a bilateral understanding with Quebec since 1 October 1994.All these agreements are currently in operation and working satisfactorily. The main purpose of these agreements is to protect the social security pension rights of workers who have worked both in Ireland and the other country to which the agreement applies. In the case of Austria,Switzerland and the United Kingdom, they now have limited application as the EU regulations normally apply.The bilateral agreements provide for the adding together of periods of insurance and, where appropriate, periods treated as equivalent to periods of insurance, completed in Ireland and the other country involved, for the purposes of calculating and awarding pensions. They also provide that temporarily posted workers may continue for a specific period under the social insurance system of the country in which they were previously insured instead of transferring for a short period into the other country's system.Liaison procedures have been established with each country and are kept under constant review. Regular contact is made with the appropriate foreign agencies to ensure the smooth transfer of the necessary information required to decide on these types of claims. At present, no significant difficulties are being experienced in relation to any of the agreements.For all schemes, the time taken to process claims that fall to be examined under bilateral agreements is longer than that for standard Irish entitlements, reflecting the added complexity that arises in determining entitlements under these agreements. While every effort is made to minimise processing times, the over-riding objective in dealing with these claims is to ensure that people receive their full entitlements. I am satisfied that overall the procedures are working effectively and efficiently. An updated social security agreement with the UK has been signed and it is hoped to have it ratified before the end of this year.A revised social security agreement with Australia was signed on 9 June 2005. I hope to be in a position to lay the revised agreement before the House for approval in the very near future. In relation to the Irish provisions, there were very few changes required to the existing agreement.Discussions have been held between officials of my Department and their counterparts in New Zealand regarding revision of that agreement. As in the case of Australia, the amendments to the Irish provisions are likely to be few.It is intended, in due course, to consult with the relevant authorities in Canada, Quebec and the United States and to examine the need for updating the provisions of these agreements.

However, my Department undertook a survey, in four of the former health board areas, of all rent supplement cases refused for the period 1 June 2004 to 30 November 2004. These regions account for one third of the rent supplement scheme. Based on this survey, which identified over 400 cases refused, the total number of refusals nationally is estimated to be in the order of 2,600 per annum. This is in the context of some 40,000 claims awarded per year, and of over 59,000 rent supplement claims in payment currently.Given this relatively low rate of claim refusal, and the lack of any particular pattern or causes, I have no plans at present to modify the scheme rules. My Department will continue to monitor rent supplement decision outcomes periodically. More generally, the efficiency and effectiveness of the rent supplement scheme is being considered by my Department in the context of an overall review it is carrying out of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme generally, as part of the ongoing expenditure review programme.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	495	I understand the Deputy is referring to the position of the PRSI contributions payable by couples in relation to farming activities. Under social welfare legislation, the social insurance status of spouses in a family business, including farming, can vary. Broadly speaking there are three different scenarios to be considered.First, where spouses are actively engaged in farming or any other enterprise as a business partnership, as opposed to simply being joint owners of a property, they are treated as individual self-employed contributors and are liable to social insurance contributions. These contributions enable them to build up an insurance record in their own right and receive accruing benefits. A partnership is commonly understood to be an association of two or more persons for the purpose of gain, or sharing in the work and profits of any enterprise. Liability for PRSI contributions is not contingent on the ownership of property but rather the nature of the business arrangements between the couple. Co-ownership of property does not of itself create a partnership.Second, where a family business in incorporated as a limited company, spouses involved in the business can establish a PRSI record either as employees or as self-employed contributors depending on whether a contract of service exists.Third, a person employed under a contract of service, that is, as an employee, by his or her spouse is an "excepted" contributor under social welfare legislation. The exceptions apply to both men and women in family employments and recognise the practical difficulties in establishing the nature of a genuine employment relationship in such circumstances.Where formal employment or partnership relationships are intended between spouses or assisting relatives, the legislation provides the scope necessary, as outlined above, to allow parties enter into arrangements which enable PRSI contributions to be payable.The issue of the insurability of farm spouses for social insurance purposes has been considered on a number of occasions. An interdepartmental group chaired by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, concluded in 2002 that "the formation of business partnerships offers an immediate route of access to social insurance cover as it is based on existing legislation. Such arrangements would not impose any significant additional administration costs on farm businesses; for example, couples who are liable for income tax under joint or separate assessment will continue to make one income tax return each year, the only change being that the income of the farm enterprise will be apportioned in accordance with the partnership arrangements".A social partnership group addressing issues relating to a fully-inclusive social insurance model, FISIM, which included representatives of the farming organisations, considered how the social insurance system should develop to be more inclusive in its approach to this issue. Its report, published in June this year, acknowledged the significance of the partnership option and recommended that more information on the tax and social welfare implications of families working in a partnership or as a limited company should be available. This recommendation is being progressed.

One of these is a commitment to increase the old age pension rate to €200 per week by 2007. Significant progress towards this objective has been made since the Government took office in 1997 with increases of up to €80.26 per week or 81% during this period. The consumer price increase over the same period is 30.7%. The real increase in pensions since 1997 is 38.5%. At present, the maximum rate of the old age contributory pension stands at €179.30.Progress has also been made to increase the level of qualified adult allowance for pensioner spouses to the level of the old age non-contributory pension with a number of special increases granted in recent budgets. Also, new pension claimants can now opt to have the qualified adult allowance, QAA, paid directly to their spouse or partner. The administrative and legislative implications of enhancing these provisions are being examined to ensure that more qualified adults can receive a personal payment.Budget 2005 provided for an increase of €9.30 or 7.2% in the QAA rates of old age contributory pension and retirement pension, ensuring that the levels of these payments were maintained relative to the personal rates of payment. QAA rates for those over 66 years of age now stand at between 66% and 77% of maximum personal rates, up from about 60% and 67% in 2000. Invalidity pension QAA rates for over 66's have been brought up to the level of other contributory pensioner rates.In addition, a significant improvement for old age non-contributory pensioners was made with the increase in the capital disregard from the first €12,697.38 to the first €20,000 of savings or other assessable assets, such as shares or bonds, when means are being assessed.Further improvements in pension rates will be considered in the context of the forthcoming budget and in the context of broader social policy reforms.

The discussions are to review the general regulatory framework under which agricultural tractors and trailers operate and, in particular, the appropriateness of the current definition of an agricultural tractor for road traffic purposes having regard to the various definitions used solely for motor registration and motor tax purposes.The question of the use of agricultural tractors and trailers for the hiring by local authorities of small haulage vehicles on minor road works does not form any part of the group's discussions and deliberations. As regards that latter question, however, I am currently reviewing the situation and will revert to the Deputy in due course.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	499	The Road Traffic Act 2004 establishes the legislative basis for the application of speed limits on all public roads. The Act sets down specific speed limit values that apply on a default basis to different types of road. In addition, section 9 of the Act provides that the elected members of county and city councils may make by-laws for the purpose of effecting the deployment of special speed limits, which are set out in the Act, on specified roads in lieu of the default speed limits. It also provides that county and city managers may by order apply speed limits on roads where road works are being undertaken for a specified period not exceeding 12 months.In January 2005, I made regulations, the Road Traffic (Speed Limit — Traffic Signs) Regulations 2005 (SI No. 10 of 2005), prescribing the regulatory traffic signs displaying metric units of measurement, km/h, that the road authorities must provide on public roads to indicate the speed limit in force. This range of traffic signs can be deployed to indicate that a default speed limit, a special speed limit or a road works speed limit is in force.Section 9 of the 2004 Act also provides that the Minister for Transport may issue guidelines to county and city councils in relation to the making of special speed limit by-laws. I issued such guidelines on 18 April 2005. A copy of the guidelines is available in the Oireachtas Library and may also be viewed on my Department's website www.transport.ie under roads-publications.

A further €1.2 million will be allocated in 2005.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	502	The Road Traffic Act 2002 provides that penalty points are endorsed on a licence record where a person has been convicted of an offence that attracts such points or where the person chooses to pay a fixed charge in respect of such an offence.Where a person is detected exceeding a speed limit, he or she is offered the opportunity to pay a fixed charge. The making of such a payment is in effect a statement by the payee that he or she will not contest the accusation referred to in the notice, thus ensuring that the matter will not proceed to a hearing before a court. Following receipt of the payment of a fixed charge in respect of a speeding offence, the licence record of the person is endorsed with two penalty points.Where a person has been convicted by a court of the commission of a speeding offence, four penalty points will be endorsed on the licence following the expiry of the period established for the making of an appeal against the conviction.The Act provides for the removal of penalty points where a court accepts a late appeal from a person convicted of a penalty point offence and following the hearing of the appeal sets aside the original conviction. Penalty points on a licence record may also be removed on foot of an order of a court requiring the Minister to remove penalty points from a licence record arising other than as a result of a late appeal.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	503	The legal basis for the fees charged by the bus licensing division of my Department for passenger licences issued under the Road Transport Act 1932 is the regulations made under the Act, that is the Road Transport Regulations 1932, No. 26 of 1932, as amended by Regulations in 1955, No. 68 of 1955. My Department is currently reviewing the level of these fees and will be proposing revised charges in the new year. The current level of fees is as follows:Grant of Annual Passenger Licences€A continuous passenger road service7.62A seasonal passenger road service5.08Renewal of a continuous/seasonal passenger road service:2.54Grant of Occasional Passenger Licences:In respect of one occasion0.63In respect of more than one occasion5.08My Department was unable at short notice to collate the information requested by the Deputy estimating the average cost per licence of administering and enforcing the bus licensing system. However, this information will be forwarded directly to the Deputy shortly.Total revenue from fees in 2004 was €5,055. This is inadequate to meet the true cost of administering and enforcing the bus licensing system. This and the other acknowledged limitations of the existing road transport legislation underline the need for modernisation. I am currently considering the views and issues put to me by the various stakeholders in this regard.

Funding under the scheme can be provided for door locks, door chains and window locks; security lighting; smoke alarms and the once-off cost of installing socially monitored personal alarms. The complete guidelines for the scheme are available on my Department's website, www.pobail.ie.Details in respect of the groups and grants approved for security equipment, including socially monitored personal alarms, under the scheme for the year 2002 are available in the Oireachtas Library. The details in respect of grants approved under the 2003 and 2004 schemes are available on my Department's website.I approved the first tranche of funding under this year's scheme earlier this month to some 100 applicant groups, including groups from counties Sligo and Leitrim. Details in respect of those groups are also available on my Department's website. Assessment of the remaining applications is in progress and further approvals and payments will be notified to eligible applicant groups over the coming weeks.Where socially monitored alarms or security equipment previously installed under this scheme are broken or defective and are outside the guarantee period, a limited amount of funding is available towards the cost of replacement. Applicant groups are requested to supply a separate list of all such cases in their application form indicating when the previous alarm was supplied and the reason for its proposed replacement.

A total of 18 submissions were received and I am now considering these submissions. It is my intention that the new board will be established shortly.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	508	Current imports of tropical hardwoods to Ireland are in the region of 50,000 cu. m. of sawn-wood per annum, as compared with a home-production of over 1 million cu. m. of sawn-wood per annum. It constitutes a relatively small proportion, therefore, of our overall production.Most of the imported tropical hardwoods are used in applications where there is no readily available alternative and where natural durability is required. However, I am very conscious of the need to ensure that this timber is sourced from sustainably managed forests and I share the concerns of the Deputy in this regard. I am very pleased to say that Ireland has played a leading role in the negotiation of a new EU regulation designed to control imports of timber from third countries and to foster the principles of sustainable forest management in those countries. This regulation, which provides for forest law enforcement, governance and trade, FLEGT, was agreed at the Agriculture Council of Ministers of 24 to 25 October 2005, which I attended. The FLEGT regulation will introduce a licensing scheme built around voluntary partnership agreements between the EU and wood producing countries. The partnership agreements will be applicable in all EU member states.The voluntary partnerships aim to support and promote governance reform in countries affected by illegal logging and the regulation will set up a legally binding licensing scheme with partner countries to ensure that only legal timber from these countries is imported into the EU. These measures are based on innovative approaches linking efforts to strengthen governance in developing countries with the incentives for good practice offered by the EU market.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	509	The position is that the person named has been registered as herdkeeper for all purposes related to the herd since the end of August 2005, but notification did not issue to him because of a difficulty regarding registration as herdowner for the purposes of all payments.The herdkeeper or keeper is any natural or legal person responsible for animals, whether on a permanent or on a temporary basis, including during transportation. The keeper role is classified as a non-financial role and relates to the ordinary day to day operation of the herd. The"herdowner" is the nominated company or entity or persons associated with the herd number to whom all payments are made. In this particular case three names were listed on the ER1.1 form as having an interest in the herd for payment purposes. They were the person named in the question, his wife and his mother-in-law. There is a need for some clarification as to the entitlements of the person named for future payments. For this purpose, an official from the district veterinary office in Tullamore will visit the person named in the next few days to clarify the position regarding the herd owner registration.

Following computer validation, it was found that one land parcel, which had been claimed by the person named, was also the subject of a claim by another scheme applicant. The person named was, therefore, written to on 6 October 2005 and asked to confirm his right to claim the parcel in question, or otherwise. If claiming the right to these parcels, the person named was requested to provide the relevant supporting documentation to substantiate his right to claim these parcels. A reply has been received from the person named with the appropriate documentation, which confirms entitlement to the land. This issue has now been resolved and the case is being processed for payment.

Following computer validation, it was found that three land parcels, which had been claimed by the person named, were also the subject of a claim by another scheme applicant. The person named was, therefore, written to on 26 September 2005 to provide the relevant supporting documentation to substantiate his right to claim these parcels. A reply has now been received from the person named, which confirms his entitlement to claim the lands. This issue has now been resolved and the case is being processed for payment.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	514	My Department has in recent years made ex gratia payments to a number of appropriate bodies involved in the actual delivery of animal care and welfare services throughout the country. The funding available to any individual organisation is dependent on resources available and the level of demand and is therefore intended only as a contribution to the overall costs of the organisations. The amounts paid by my Department in the last two years are as follows: in 2003, €850,000 was allocated to 80 organisations and in 2004, €1 million was allocated to 83 organisations.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	515	These are commercial matters between a person selling animals for slaughter and the meat factory involved. However, the presence of a person or persons on the factory floor can only occur if it does not compromise the requirements of either health and safety legislation or meat hygiene legislation.The accuracy of weighing scales at meat plants is governed by the Metrology Act 1996. Under section 14 of that Act, plants are obliged to provide evidence of such conformity. Where a meat plant fails so to do, the Minister for Agriculture and Food may suspend weighing operations of a meat plant until such time as conformity is achieved. This last provision is set out in article 5 of the European Communities (Beef Carcase Classification) Regulations 2004 (SI No. 45 of 2004).

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	517	The person named submitted two applications under the 2004 special beef premium scheme, in respect of a total of 27 animals. The first application, in respect of 14 animals for first and second age premium, was received on 6 January 2004 and the second application, in respect of 12 animals for bull premium and one for second age, was received on 29 October 2004.Of the 27 animals in question, all were deemed to represent 0.6 livestock units, equating with a total value of 16.2 livestock units. However, payment of premium was restricted to 9.51 premium rights, the maximum payable based on the forage declared. Therefore, the 60% advance payment of €855.90, which issued on 16 October 2004, was in respect of 9.51 animals.Under the relevant EU regulations governing the 2004 special beef premium scheme, a stocking density limit of 1.8 livestock units per hectare applied, based on the forage area declared on an applicant's area aid application. The 2004 area aid application of the person named declared a forage area of 37.91 hectares, which gave an entitlement to 68.23 livestock units.Where an applicant has a milk quota, account must also be taken of the animals required to fill the quota; in accordance with the provisions of the relevant EU regulations this milk quota is converted to livestock units by dividing the quota by the notional average milk yield, unless the applicant is in milk recording, in which case the higher yield figure is used. In this case, the named person held a milk quota of 248,963 litres, equivalent to 62.52 livestock units, that is, milk quota of 248,963 litres, divided by 3,982 litres, the notional average yield. Therefore, the entitlement of the person named under the 2004 special beef premium scheme was restricted to 5.71 livestock units which, in the case of animals each deemed to represent 0.6 livestock units, equates with 9.51 premium rights.When the position regarding the extent of the breach of the 2004 special beef premium scheme quota became apparent, I raised the difficulty which this created for Ireland with the EU Commissioner. I recognised, however, that negotiations to resolve the matter could be protracted and, therefore, decided that an interim payment should be made to scheme applicants. In the case of the person named, an interim balancing payment of €185.44 issued on 20 April 2005, in respect of the 9.51 animals. Having achieved a positive response from the EU Commissioner, final scheme payments recently began issuing; it is expected that the final payment due to the person named will issue shortly.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	518	The position is that a number of meetings of the single payment advisory committee, comprising representatives from my Department, Teagasc and the farming organisations were held to discuss the rules governing the allocation of the national reserve. The most recent such meeting was held last week and I expect to be in a position to make appropriate decisions shortly.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	519	I have not taken a decision on the future of the early retirement scheme. The EU Council regulation covering the current scheme will expire in December 2006. The Council regulation on rural development for the period from 2007 to 2013 again includes provision for member states to operate early retirement measures. No decisions have yet been taken regarding the schemes to be operated in Ireland under this regulation.The early retirement scheme was introduced as one of a number of instruments to improve the age structure of Irish farming and improve the viability of farm holdings. From that point of view, the first scheme from 1994 to 1999 was not unsuccessful. However take-up of the current scheme has fallen short of expectations, and an expenditure review carried out in my Department in 2004 raised a number of questions about the effectiveness of the scheme in achieving its objectives. Structural reform is still a priority both at home and at European level, and we still need to provide opportunities for young farmers. In framing proposals for the next rural development round we need to consider how best to achieve those results in the light of the funding and the options that are available.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	520	The person named submitted an application for an allocation of entitlements from the single payment scheme national reserve under category B which caters for farmers who, between 1 January 2000 and 19 October 2003, made an investment in production capacity in a farming sector for which a direct payment under livestock premia and-or arable aid schemes would have been payable during the reference period 2000 to 2002.The person named submitted an application for an allocation of entitlements from the national reserve under category A, which caters for farmers who inherited land or received land free of charge or for a nominal sum from a farmer who had retired or died by 16 May 2005 and who had leased out his-her holding to a third party during the reference period 2000 to 2002.It should be noted however that the rules governing the single payment scheme stipulate that an applicant who is found to be eligible under more than one category in the reserve may only receive an allocation of entitlements under whichever category is most beneficial to him.The position is that over 23,000 applications for an allocation of entitlements from the national reserve were received when account is taken of farmers who applied under more than one category. Processing of these applications is continuing and the intention is to make allocations to successful applicants at the earliest opportunity. The Department will be in touch with individual applicants as soon as their applications are fully processed.

His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and on appeal by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.Subsequently, in accordance with section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, he was informed by letter dated 16 February, 2005, that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him. He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State; leaving the State before an order is made or consenting to the making of a deportation order. Representations have been received on behalf of the person concerned.The person's case file, including all representations submitted, will be considered under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, and section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, prohibition of refoulement.

The Minister of State with special responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, is examining the outcome of this review. The intention is to bring proposals arising from this examination to Government in the very near future, including proposals in the area of detention.Since 1 January 2005, 151 children, persons aged under 18 years, have been committed to the custody of the Irish Prison Service on foot of court orders. Of that 151, only 21, 14 males and seven females, were committed to an adult prison. The remaining 130 were all males committed to St. Patrick's Institution which is the designated detention centre for males aged between 16 and 21 years of age. Every effort is made to separate juvenile offenders from the general prison population in each institution and as indicated earlier, the vast majority of juvenile offenders are held in St. Patrick's Institution.

The personnel strength of Letterkenny Garda station as at 31 December, 1997 was 90, all ranks. This represents an increase of seven, or 7.7%, in the number of personnel allocated to Letterkenny Garda station since that date.There is currently one sergeant and one garda allocated to the community policing unit at Letterkenny Garda station. I understand from the Garda authorities that a garda in Letterkenny Garda station who was assigned to community policing duties in the Glencar area has recently been transferred but that two additional gardaí are due to be allocated to the community policing unit at Letterkenny in the coming weeks.In regard to Garda resources generally, the accelerated recruitment campaign to reach a record force strength of 14,000, in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target. This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of 2006.The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources, and in this context the needs of the Letterkenny area will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda areas throughout the country.

Furthermore, as a result of the Government's approval of my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members, the Garda Commissioner will be in a position, as each cycle of recruit training is completed, to assign additional new members to the areas of greatest need with particular regard to certain priorities. These priorities will include the traffic corps, which is in the process of increasing its numbers from 520 members to its planned staffing complement of 1,200 by 2008 on the following phased basis:YearNo.200680520071,03020081,200Also last November, I published the Garda strategic review of traffic policing. The strategic review is the blueprint for a transformation in the enforcement of road traffic law. A key recommendation of the strategic review is that a new position of assistant commissioner in charge of all aspects of road traffic law should be created. The Government subsequently approved the appointment of an additional Garda assistant commissioner, and the Commissioner appointed an assistant commissioner with responsibility for all traffic matters including the traffic corps and implementation of the recommendations contained in the strategic review of traffic policing. The Assistant Commissioner is a member of the top management team in the force and as such is bringing authority and visible leadership to the traffic corps and traffic law enforcement generally from the outset.Never before has road traffic safety been given this level of priority within the Garda Síochána. I believe that the Garda traffic corps, with new visible leadership, increased strength, expanded fleet, dedicated budget, clear strategy and tough targets, will provide an extremely effective traffic management resource which will reduce the number of injuries and fatalities on our roads.

Two of these have deadlines for transposition in 2006 and two have 2007 deadlines. The remaining three directives are Schengen-related measures and as such the deadlines for transposition apply to Schengen member states only. Ireland is not a Schengen member state. However, following the Council decision of 28 February 2002 concerning Ireland's request to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen Acquis, work is underway to transpose the directives into Irish law.We do not have readily accessible figures on Commission correspondence prior to February 2002 regarding directives which had passed the specified deadline for transposition into domestic legislation. However, from February 2002, we received letters of formal notice and-or reasoned opinions from the Commission on eight directives. In the case of one of those eight directives, Directive 2002/90/EC, the Commission has been informed that as the measure relates to an aspect of the Schengen Acquis in which Ireland does not participate the directive does not apply to Ireland.

I am, of course, prepared to expedite the processing of the application for naturalisation of the person concerned in view of the circumstances outlined in the Deputy's question and by the applicant herself in correspondence submitted with her application form. However, the process for naturalisation requires, among other things, the necessity for the person concerned to swear a declaration of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State in open court and the payment of a statutory fee, which would be €126.97 in this particular instance. In addition, it will be necessary to seek a report from the Garda. These are standard procedures applied to all applications for naturalisation and it is likely that the whole process would take a couple of weeks to complete.In view of the particular urgency of her situation, the person concerned may wish to contact the British Embassy in Dublin with a view to obtaining a British passport. This may prove to be more straightforward, more economical and faster than the naturalisation process. In the meantime, I have asked my officials to deal with the naturalisation application as quickly as they can.

The first grants allocated under this programme date from July 2000. The total funding committed under the EOCP to date is more than €458 million, of which more than €402.7 million has been allocated to child care facilities, with more than € 209 million of this having been allocated to community based projects under the capital sub-measure, and a further €164.9 million committed under the staffing sub-measure to community-based projects with a strong focus on disadvantage. Under the quality sub-measure, more than €55.3 million has been allocated to promote quality in the child care sector, largely through funding to the city and county child care committees and the national voluntary child care organisations.In 2004 my Department published a comprehensive review of progress under the EOCP entitled, Developing Childcare in Ireland, which was circulated to all Members of the Oireachtas. This was also posted on the Department's web site at www.justice.ie and more detailed information regarding the programme to the end of 2003 is included in this report. I have arranged for another copy of this report to be sent to the Deputy. An updated version of this review, covering progress to the end of 2004, is expected to be available shortly and will be posted on the Department’s web site as well as being circulated to interested parties, including Members of the Oireachtas.

The applications of all three were refused following consideration of their cases by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Office of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.A notification under section 3(3)(a) of the Immigration Act 1999 issued to the mother and older child on 8 July 2005 and to the father on 21 July 2005 advising them of the decision to refuse them refugee status and setting out the options open to them, which are to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of a deportation order or to make written representations within 15 working days to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform setting out reasons as to why they should not be deported.Their case was examined under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, and section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 regarding the prohibition of refoulement, including consideration of all representations received on her behalf. The existence of another child born in the State on 15 April 2005 was only made known to my Department in representations for leave to remain dated 29 July 2005. Deportation orders were made in respect of the parents and older child on 1 September 2005. Notice of these orders was served on them by registered post. The letters made them aware of the requirement to present themselves to the Garda national immigration bureau, GNIB, on Thursday, 29 September 2005 in order to make arrangements for their deportation from the State. The family failed to present as required and is now classified as evading deportation. Consequently, the adults are now liable to arrest and detention. They should present themselves and their children to the GNIB without delay. The enforcement of these deportation orders remains a matter for the GNIB.

It is currently operational in Dublin, Cork city and parts of Louth and Meath in respect of existing fixed charge and penalty point offences. The extension of the system nationwide is dependent on concluding a contract with an outsourced service provider for the collection of fines. Contract negotiation is in the final stages and a contract is expected to be signed very shortly. This will clear the way for the rollout of the existing system nationwide. In addition, this nationwide rollout will provide the platform for the planned implementation of both additional fixed charge and penalty point offences and I can assure the Deputy there will be no unavoidable delay in this regard. This work is being planned in conjunction with the various agencies involved including the Garda Síochána, the Courts Service, the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Department of Transport.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	546	The Department's second report on school retention, published on 19 October 2005, is based on a detailed analysis of the records held in the post-primary pupils database for the cohort of entrants to the first year of the junior cycle in each of the years 1995 and 1996. The figures refer to retention in State-aided second level schools only and do not include students progressing to further training and education at junior or leaving certificate level, for example Youthreach, FÁS, apprenticeship training as well as students in private, non-aided colleges at second level.The report shows: national retention rate to completion of the junior certificate examination is 94.6%; national adjusted retention rate to completion of the leaving certificate examination is 81.3%; percentage of pupils who sat the junior certificate in counties Leitrim and Sligo at 96.8% and 96.1% respectively; percentage of pupils who sat the leaving certificate in counties Leitrim and Sligo at 87.1% and 82.7% respectively; of the cohort of 1,017 pupils in County Sligo, 458 females and 383 males sat the leaving certificate; and of the cohort of 497 pupils in County Leitrim, 225 females and 208 males sat the leaving certificate.Comparisons between the Retention Rates of Pupils in Second Level schools — Cohort 1994, published by the Department of Education and Science in May 2003, and the most recent retention report show that there has been no increase in dropout rates for completion of the junior certificate, a decrease in dropout at senior cycle of 0.6% in County Leitrim and a decrease in dropout at junior cycle of 0.5% and a decrease in drop-out at senior cycle of 0.2% in County Sligo.There is no up-to-date research on the number of children who do not transfer from primary to post-primary education on an annual basis. The Department of Education and Science is planning the development of a primary pupils database, which will facilitate the collation of much more accurate and comprehensive data on transfer rates in the future. Together with the current post-primary pupil database, this will allow much-improved tracking of where children go after primary school. We are providing increased resources for schools in disadvantaged areas to improve their school completion rates by offering extra supports for their students. These include extra educational supports and services in school, after school and during holiday times. Working with parents to promote school attendance is also an important part of the work of the home school community liaison officers appointed to our disadvantaged schools.Other measures designed to improve school completion include the establishment of the National Educational Welfare Board in 2002. The priority the Government attaches to tackling early school leaving is evident from the fact that the budget for the welfare board has been increased by 20% in 2005. In addition, €24 million is being provided this year for the school completion programme and there is currently one school completion project in County Sligo.The new action plan for educational inclusion, delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, which will be introduced on a phased basis — starting during the current school year — aims to ensure that the educational needs of children and young people, from pre-school to completion of upper second-level education, from three to 18 years, from disadvantaged communities are prioritised and effectively addressed. The new plan will involve an additional annual investment of some €40m on full implementation. It will also involve the creation of approximately 300 additional posts across the education system generally.A key element of this new action plan is the introduction of a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage in our primary and second level schools, which will result in improved targeting of resources at those most in need. As a result of the identification process, approximately 600 primary schools, comprising 300 urban or town and 300 rural, and 150 second-level schools will be included in a new school support programme, SSP. The SSP will bring together, and build upon, a number of existing interventions for schools and school clusters or communities with a concentrated level of educational disadvantage. Under DEIS, additional clusters will be created under the school completion programme which provides a wide range of targeted supports on an individual and group basis to children and young people who may be at risk of early school leaving.We anticipate being in a position to notify participating schools of the outcome of the ongoing identification process by the end of the year.

An approved institution is defined to mean a university, college or other institution of higher education in so far as it provides a course or courses of not less than two years duration at postgraduate level, being a course or courses of which the Minister for Education and Science approves for the time being for the purposes of the Acts.The annual higher education grants scheme sets out a list of approved institutions for the purposes of the scheme. The approved institutions mainly comprise publicly funded third level institutions.Stranmillis College, Belfast is included in the list of approved colleges under the Department of Education and Science's 2005 higher education grants scheme in respect of the following courses: B Ed degree of the Queen's University, Belfast; and postgraduate certificate in education. In addition on 19 October 2005 the awarding bodies were notified that two new courses at Stranmillis College were approved under the terms of 2005 higher education grant scheme. One of the courses was the course referred to by the Deputy and the other was Bachelor of Science — health and leisure studies.

A total of 128 institutions are listed on the original Schedule to the Act. In November 2004 I signed an order for an additional 13 institutions to be placed on the Schedule and I signed a further order in July 2005 to include another three institutions.As the religious ethos of an institution is not part of the criteria prescribed under section 4 of the Act, my Department did not require details of the religious ethos of all the institutions listed. However, records held in my Department indicate that there are seven institutions listed as having had a Protestant ethos.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	549	The most recent data on primary school class sizes available to my Department relate to the 2004-05 school year and is provided in the accompanying table. These figures are provisional and do not include details of pupils in special schools or pupils in special classes in ordinary schools.Significant improvements have been made in the pupil-teacher ratio and in average class size in recent years at primary level. The most recent figure available for average class size at primary level refers to the 2003-2004 school year, when the average class size was 23.9, down from 26.6 in 1996-97. The pupil teacher ratio at primary level, which includes all the teachers including resource teachers, has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996-1997 school year to 17.1:1, projected, in 2004-2005.Over 4,500 additional teachers have been employed in our primary schools since 1997. In allocating teaching posts regard is given to the commitments of the Government to reduce class size, tackle educational disadvantage and provide additional resources for pupils with special educational needs. The additional teaching posts created since 1997 have been deployed to address all of these priorities.There are now over 5,000 teachers in our primary schools working directly with children with special needs, including those requiring learning support. This compares to under 1,500 in 1998. Indeed, one out of every five primary school teachers is now working specifically with children with special needs.I recently launched a new action plan for educational inclusion, delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS. This action plan will result in the reduction in class sizes of 24:1 at senior level and 20:1 at junior level in 150 primary schools serving communities with the highest concentrations of disadvantage.In line with the commitment in the programme for Government, class sizes will be reduced still further. The deployment of additional posts will be decided within the context of the policy that priority will be given to pupils with special needs, those from disadvantaged areas and junior classes.CountyTotal Number of PupilsCarlow5,417Cavan7,389Clare11,641Cork City13,653Cork County36,011Donegal17,126Dublin Belgard26,208Dublin City40,514Dublin Fingal23,251Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown14,554Galway City5,623Galway County17,084Kerry14,340Kildare21,290Kilkenny9,193Laois6,937Leitrim2,982Limerick City6,239Limerick County13,246Longford3,544Louth12,575Mayo13,226Meath17,692Monaghan6,165Offaly8,390Roscommon6,063Sligo6,377Tipperary N.R.7,127Tipperary S.R.9,261Waterford City5,168Waterford County6,550Westmeath9,034Wexford14,871Wicklow13,520Total432,261City Council-County Council25-2930 or greaterCarlow2,0341,596Cavan2,6251,405Clare2,9743,149Cork City4,1293,159Cork County13,23910,451Donegal5,5723,804Dublin Belgard9,7057,344Dublin City13,2958,621Dublin Fingal10,1428,621Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown5,9255,004Galway City1,8681,357Galway County5,1762,863Kerry5,2582,964Kildare9,3787,230Kilkenny2,6652,720Laois2,8011,323Leitrim950356Limerick City2,2051,313Limerick County4,4163,198Longford1,432535Louth4,5683,754Mayo4,1111,634Meath7,1945,619Monaghan1,9801,289Offaly3,6841,480Roscommon1,753809Sligo1,6541,373Tipperary N.R.2,3751,041Tipperary S.R.3,2311,669Waterford City2,1441,092Waterford County2,2291,474Westmeath3,5221,971Wexford5,8123,714Wicklow4,9513,869Total154,997107,801
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	550	The general rule is that schools are staffed on the basis of having a maximum class size across the school of 29. Where some classes in a school have class sizes of greater than 29, it is often because a decision has been taken at local level to use the teaching resources to have smaller numbers in other classes.Major improvements in school staffing have been made in recent years with the hiring of more than 4,500 additional teachers. This represents the largest increase in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. The annual estimated value of the additional expenditure on these posts is over €200 million.In 1996-1997, the average class size in our primary schools was 27. It is now 24. In 1996-97 there was one teacher for every 22 children in our primary schools. Today there is one teacher for every 17 children, the lowest pupil teacher ratio in the history of the State.Aside from decreasing average class size, the unprecedented increase in school staffing in recent years has also greatly improved the services provided for children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas.While there is more to be done to reduce class sizes further, it should be acknowledged that much progress has been made in this area in recent years. Under the new action plan for tackling education disadvantage which I launched last May, more children in disadvantaged schools will be in classes of 20 in the current school year.While the average class size nationally has been brought down to 24, I am committed, in line with Government policy, to delivering further reductions in class sizes for children under nine. In achieving the Government target on smaller class sizes priority must, in the first instance, be given to children with special needs and those in disadvantaged areas.

However if the Deputy requires information on individual schools in counties Sligo and north Leitrim, officials in the school planning and building unit of my Department will be happy to assist.The physical education curriculum has been designed on the basis that facilities in schools may vary. Many primary schools have a general purposes room and practically all schools have outdoor play areas, which are utilised for teaching different aspects of the physical education programme. In addition, many schools use adjacent local facilities, including public parks, playing fields and swimming pools.The provision of multi-purpose space and outdoor play areas for primary schools will continue to be considered within the design brief for new schools and of renovation and extension school building projects. This will be done in the context of available resources and the published criteria for prioritising school building projects.At second level, it is the policy of the Department to provide a physical education hall to a school that does not already have a facility. This is considered as part of the design brief for new schools and of major renovation or extension projects, within available resources and overall published criteria for prioritising projects.The Government is delivering on its commitment to provide modern facilities in school and has progressively increased funding in recent years with an aggregate total of almost €2 billion since 1998, the largest investment programme in the history of the State.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	552	There are currently no Early Start pre-schools operating in counties Sligo and north Leitrim. The new action plan for educational inclusion, delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, which will be introduced on a phased basis, starting during the current school year, aims to ensure that the educational needs of children and young people, from pre-school to completion of upper second level education, that is, three to 18 years, from disadvantaged communities are prioritised and effectively addressed. The new plan is the outcome of the first full review of all programmes for tackling educational disadvantage that have been put in place over the past twenty years and it will involve an additional annual investment of approximately €40 million on full implementation. It will also involve the creation of about 300 additional posts across the education system generally.A key element of this new action plan is the putting in place of a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage in our primary and second level schools, which will result in improved targeting of resources at those most in need. As a result of the identification process, approximately 600 primary schools, comprising 300 urban or town and 300 rural, and 150 second level schools will be included in a new school support programme, SSP. The SSP will bring together, and build upon, a number of existing interventions for schools and school clusters or communities with a concentrated level of educational disadvantage.Early childhood education actions will be concentrated on those children, aged from three up to school enrolment, who will subsequently attend the 150 urban or town primary schools, participating in the new school support programme, and identified as serving the most disadvantaged communities. The early childhood education actions under the new plan will be well targeted and my Department will work in partnership with other Departments and agencies with a view to meeting the overall care and education needs of the children involved in an integrated way. A strong emphasis will be placed on adding value to the work of other providers by embedding quality early learning within child care provision. We anticipate being in a position to notify participating schools on the outcome of the ongoing identification process by the end of the year.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	555	Directive 2005/36/EC on the recognition of professional qualifications is the only outstanding directive which has not been transposed into Irish law. The date for transposition of this directive is 20 October 2007 and preparatory work for the drafting of the regulations to meet this transposition date is ongoing within my Department.Since 1997, my Department has received two warning letters in relation to failure to transpose directives, both of which related to recognition of qualifications, within the prescribed deadline. The first concerned Directive 99/42/EC, the transposition of which was delayed due to the relative complexity of the process involved. It was transposed into Irish law by means of the European Communities (Recognition of Qualifications and Experience) Regulations 2003, SI No. 372 of 2003, which were promulgated on 19 August 2003. The second was Directive 2001/19/EC which was transposed into Irish law by way of the European Communities (General System for the Recognition of Higher Education Diplomas and Professional Education and Training and Second General System for the Recognition of Professional Education and Training) (Amendment) Regulations 2003, SI 36 of 2004.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	556	A new general allocation scheme has been introduced under which schools have been provided with resource teaching hours, based on their enrolment figures, to cater for children with high incidence special needs such as dyslexia and those with learning support needs.My officials have been in contact with the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, which has confirmed that the pupil concerned falls into the high incidence disability category. Therefore, his needs fall to be met from within the school's allocation of 20 part-time hours under the new general allocation system. The school authorities were notified of the outcome.The general allocation scheme is designed to ensure that each school has enough resource teaching hours to meet the needs of children with high incidence special needs, such as dyslexia and children with learning support needs. Resource teaching hours for children with low incidence special needs, will continue to be provided on the basis of an individual application for each child.It is a matter for each school to determine the pupils with high incidence special education and learning support needs that will receive this support. Each school has been allocated enough resource teaching hours to provide its pupils with a level of support appropriate to their needs.The school can use its professional judgement to decide how these hours are divided between different children in the school, to ensure that all their needs are met. Research shows that some children with special needs will respond better with one-to-one tuition. Others, however, do better when taught in small groups. Often it is best for resource teachers to work with children in the classroom rather than taking them away to a separate room, as the children then have to catch up work done by the rest of the class in their absence. The type of response needed depends on the child.My Department has recently issued a comprehensive circular, Sp Ed 02/05, to all primary schools regarding the organisation of teaching resources for pupils who need additional support in mainstream primary schools. The main purpose of this circular is to provide guidance for schools on the deployment and organisation of the teaching resources that were allocated under the general allocation model. Reference is also made in this circular to the deployment of additional teaching resources that are allocated to schools for the support of individual pupils with low incidence disabilities.

The circumstances of each case are examined by the local special education needs organiser employed by the National Council for Special Education and a recommendation made as to the support required.Where supervision is required, grant aid is made available by my Department to school management authorities to employ suitable persons to serve as escorts on transport services, accompanying children with special educational needs, including autism.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	558	My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial services in primary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978 scheme for the employment of full-time clerical officers in primary schools, under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. With effect from 1 January 2004, these clerical officers are paid directly through my Department's central payroll system. The salary cost of temporary clerical officers employed as replacements for full-time clerical officers on maternity leave is also met by my Department and is paid directly to the schools concerned.The 1978 scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created. It has been superseded by a more extensive grant scheme now referred to as the ancillary services grant. The ancillary services grant provides additional funding for primary schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. The scheme is flexible in nature, giving boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are provided. It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the funding to suit the school's particular needs.The standard rate of grant per pupil under the scheme, which was increased from €102 in 2002 to €127 in 2004, is being further increased to €133 this year. The amount of grant paid to an individual school is determined by the enrolment in the school subject to a minimum grant of €7,980 in the case of a school with 60 pupils or less and a maximum grant of €66,500 in the case of a school with 500 or more pupils, provided the school in question does not already have either caretaking or secretarial services under an existing Department scheme. Where a school already has either caretaking or secretarial services under an existing Department scheme, the rate of grant payable is €66.50 per pupil and the minimum and maximum grants payable are €3,990 and €33,250 respectively.The ancillary services grant programme provides grants to schools that are not directly linked to any pay scales. Therefore the level and extent of services provided is a matter for the school authorities who, through the discretion afforded by the scheme, apply diverse arrangements for secretarial services as resources permit. As the secretaries are employees of individual schools, my Department does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are engaged. These are matters to be agreed between the staff concerned and the school authorities.

The institutions concerned controlled all aspects of the children's lives 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with no reasonable capacity for access to or involvement by their parents. Therefore, the children in the institutions relied to a significant degree on the public bodies that had a statutory duty to protect them.This situation does not apply to children attending day schools who were enrolled there by their parents and continued to reside with their families under the guardianship of their parents. Accordingly, there are no plans to extend the remit of the redress board or to establish a similar board for pupils of day schools.

The scheme is not intended to leave schools with significant fund-raising needs but for the school to tailor the scope of capital works commissioned to the available funding. The decision on whether to continue participating in the scheme or to drop out, if the scope of build is more than the funding envelope permits, is a matter for each school authority.An appeal has been received from the school referred to by the Deputy requesting an increased grant. The appeal will be examined and a decision conveyed to the school management as soon as possible.

The Control of Dogs Acts 1986 and 1992 place statutory responsibility for dog control on local authorities. The implementation of the Acts is vested in local authorities who have power to appoint dog wardens, to provide shelters for stray and other dogs, to impose on-the-spot fines for a number of offences and to take prosecutions. Local authorities may also make by-laws in relation to the control of dogs within their functional areas.The number of dogs being destroyed has decreased from 27,848 in 1997 to 16,598 in 2004. The number of stray dogs being re-homed each year has increased from 4,681 in 1998 to 7,939 in 2004.

The 2004 scheme provided up to 50% funding for the development of new, or renovation of existing, playgrounds throughout the country.While the scheme was administered by the National Children's Office, the grants were paid out of my Department's Vote. Over €2 million was allocated to county and city councils in respect of 32 new or refurbished playground projects. Some €54,000 was allocated to Sligo County Council and €41,000 was allocated to Leitrim County Council under that scheme.Earlier this year, I announced funding of a further €2 million for local authorities for the development of playground facilities. In this regard, a fixed grant of €60,000 has been allocated to each county and city council, including Leitrim and Sligo, to meet the cost of purchase and delivery of playground equipment. Installation and all other costs, including ongoing maintenance, are to be funded from local sources.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	573	Section 40 of the Wildlife Act 1976, as amended, provides that it shall be an offence for a person to cut, grub, burn or otherwise destroy, during the period from 1 March to 31 August, any vegetation growing on any land not then cultivated or, during the same period, to cut, grub, burn or otherwise destroy any vegetation growing in any hedge or ditch. There are a number of derogation provisions in the legislation. Those relevant to local authorities cover works being carried out for reasons of public health or safety and the clearance of vegetation in the course of road or other construction works.Section 70 of the Roads Act 1993 obliges landowners and occupiers of land to take all necessary care to ensure that shrubs, hedges or any other vegetation on their land are not or could not become a danger to road users. In this regard it empowers a local authority, where it considers that a hazard exists, to serve a notice on a landowner or occupier of land requiring action to be taken to remove the danger or potential danger. The local authority itself can carry out the works specified in the notice in any case where the person whom the notice was served fails to comply with it. Where there is an immediate and serious risk to road users, the local authority can act at once, without serving notice, to remove or reduce the danger. In either case, the local authority may recover the cost of the works from the landowner or occupier.My Department writes each year to local authority managers reminding them of the need to plan hedge cutting operations to comply with the Wildlife Acts as referred to above, and stressing the importance of hedges as a key element of biodiversity in Ireland.

This element of the fund was geared towards assisting local authorities in initiatives which would improve customer service and customer care in innovative ways, facilitate the convergence of local government and local development, further the integration of public services or support new directions for local government.In January 2001, local authorities were invited to submit proposals for funding on the basis that proposals would have a project focus, defined objectives, finite duration and proper cost-benefit analysis. Local authorities were also advised that it was desirable that initiatives would have portability across a number of, if not all, local authorities.Following consideration by an evaluation committee, 13 projects from separate local authorities were allocated total funding of €2.7 million, of which €2.4 million has been drawn down to date.

These have involved directives in the areas of waste management, air quality, soil protection, water quality, integrated pollution prevention and control, dangerous substances in batteries, keeping of wild animals in zoos and fuel emissions. All of the directives concerned have subsequently been transposed, except for seven which are currently awaiting transposition. Details of the latter are set out as follows.Directive number and titleDate due for transpositionCurrent position on transpositionDirective 2000/53/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 September 2000 on end-of life vehicles21 April 2002It is anticipated that this Directive will be fully transposed by the end of the year.Directive 2002/49/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 June 2002 relating to the assessment and management of environmental noise18 July 2004Drafting of Regulations to transpose this Directive is well advanced and transposition is intended by the end of the year.Directive 2002/88/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 December 2002 amending Directive 97/68/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to measures against the emission of gaseous and particulate pollutants from internal combustion engines to be installed in non-road mobile machinery Directive 2004/26/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 amending Directive 97/68/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to measures against the emission of gaseous and particulate pollutants from internal combustion engines to be installed in non-road mobile machinery11 August 2004 20 May 2005Draft Regulations transposing both Directives are nearing completion with a view to transposition by the end of the year.Directive 2003/4/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2003 on public access to environmental information and repealing Council Directive 90/313/EEC14 February 2005Legislative proposals for the transposition of this Directive are in drafting and it is intended that it will be transposed at the earliest possible date.Directive 2003/35/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 May 2003 providing for public participation in respect of the drawing up of certain plans and programmes relating to the environment and amending with regard to public participation and access to justice Council Directives 85/337/EEC and 96/61/EC25 June 2005Options for transposition of the Directive are being examined with a view to completing transposition at the earliest possible date.Directive 2004/12/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 February 2004 amending Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste18 August 2005The Department is engaged with a stakeholder group on a final phase of consultation prior to finalising Regulations to give effect to this Directive and it is intended that it will be transposed in the first quarter of 2006.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	580	The most recent three yearly assessment of need for social housing was carried out by local authorities in March 2005. Returns were received in my Department over the summer period and the overall data are being finalised and will be published very shortly. Information as to extent of Leitrim's housing waiting list and the length of time households have been on the waiting list along with other details pertaining to the list will be included in this publication. This information will relate to the county as a whole as information is not available in my Department on an electoral area basis.Leitrim County Council has indicated to my Department that it proposes to commence 48 units at various locations throughout the county during the course of 2005. At the end of June, there were 43 houses under construction. Information on the number of these houses to be provided for disabled persons is not available in my Department.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	581	The limited 1996 sampling exercise in Dublin referred to in the reply to Parliamentary Question No. 541 of 11 October 2005 indicated that, depending on the sampling method employed, a range of between 6% and 12% of the properties sampled at that time would not have met the interim EU standard for the end of 2003. This finding is not likely to be more widely representative since lead water pipes only feature in older urban areas and many such pipes would have been replaced in the meantime. The most recent information on the monitoring of heavy metals in drinking water supplies, of which lead is one of a number monitored, is available in the Environmental Protection Agency's publication, The Quality of Drinking Water in Ireland — A Report for the Year 2003, with a review of the period 2001-2003, copy available in the Oireachtas Library. The EPA report indicates that 18,138 samples, were analysed for heavy metals in public water supplies and 2,154 in group water scheme supplies in 2003. The report reveals an almost 100% compliance rate in the case of all water supplies — with only five exceedances of the standard for lead in public water supplies and one exceedance in the group water scheme samples.

A list of the approved bodies is being compiled and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	583	A code of conduct for employees of local authorities was published in June 2004 under Part 15 of the Local Government Act 2001 and it is an integral part of the ethical framework for the local government service. The code includes disclosure requirements concerning employment outside the local government sector and addresses situations concerning a conflict of personal and public interest.The implementation of the code is being kept under review in light of experience since its introduction and as part of an assessment of the effectiveness of the regime; this assessment will also consider the acceptance by local authority employees of outside appointments and of consultancy engagements following resignation or retirement.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-10-27 00:00:00	Prelude	584	The procedures for the appointment of county and city managers and their removal from employment are set out in Part 14 of the Local Government Act 2001. Recruitment to such posts is carried out by open competition conducted by the Public Appointments Service which recommends a person for appointment as manager to the relevant council. The appointment of a manager by a county or city council, following a recommendation by the service, is a reserved function. Where on the expiration of three months after the date of the recommendation, the person recommended is not appointed and is still available for appointment, the appointment becomes automatic.The elected council of a county or a city may by resolution suspend or remove from employment the county or city manager for stated misbehaviour or if his or her suspension or removal appears to them to be necessary for the effective performance of the functions of the council. Where such a resolution is proposed, the procedures to be followed by the relevant council are set out in section 146 of the Act of 2001. However, a county or city manager may not be removed without the sanction of the Minister who may appoint an independent panel of three persons to consider the removal, to recommend whether the Minister should give sanction to such removal and to make any such other recommendations, if any, as the panel may consider appropriate.

Further progress with this project is a matter for Kildare County Council. I understand that the local authority is currently in the process of commissioning the library which involves book stocking and the provision of IT services and other facilities.
