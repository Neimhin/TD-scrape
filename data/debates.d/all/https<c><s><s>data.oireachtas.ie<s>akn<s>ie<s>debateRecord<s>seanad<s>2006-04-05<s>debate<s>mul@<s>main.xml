          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_30">The murder of Mr. Denis Donaldson in Donegal last evening highlights the fact there are still political fanatics who pose as republicans. There are three points I would like to make on that appalling killing. First, I was quite surprised by the Government's initial reaction to the killing because it seemed to take at face value the statement issued by the IRA. We know the form of the IRA and that it has in the past issued statements that have been proven to be untrue. In many respects, the bigger the crime, the bigger the lie on the part of that organisation. I advise the Government to be a little more circumspect about this case before it replies in respect thereof. The killing has all the hallmarks of a similar murder in the late 1990s, that of Mr. Eamon Collins. Mr. Collins had been in Sinn Féin and became an informer.</p>
          <p eId="para_31">Second, this is a particularly dangerous time. The criminal edifice of Sinn Féin-IRA, particularly along the Border, is now being dismantled piece by piece because of excellent work by the Criminal Assets Bureau and the Assets Recovery Agency in Northern Ireland. We should not underestimate the tensions that exist within the republican movement as a result of the fact that dodgy diesel, cheap cigarettes and a substantial portfolio of property in Manchester and elsewhere are now being rightly removed from that criminal organisation. I ask people to be mindful of this fact.</p>
          <p eId="para_32">Third, the gruesome killing of Mr. Donaldson is a chilling reminder that there are people within our society and the republican movement who still believe the way forward is through intimidation and the use and threat of violence. We have a responsibility to hold our nerve at this time. The Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister also have a responsibility to continue their work in Armagh tomorrow when they will attempt to breathe some life into this process. The Government should not take at face value an IRA statement. We know its form; in the past it has lied to us about a range of incidents.

          <p eId="para_33">I wish to be associated with the words of congratulations to Senator Leyden. I also note that our esteemed colleague, Senator Ross, also featured in the frame. The rest of us can only hope to do better and try a little harder next year to emulate what they have done. We will do our best.</p>
          <p eId="para_34">In recognising the points made by Senator Brian Hayes regarding the Government's views on the death in Donegal, I remind the House of a point I made recently that cancer screening could prevent more deaths than occur as a result of gunfire or road accidents. I ask the Leader for a sensible, rational, ordinary person's debate on the extraordinary 31 items which will attract penalty points in the future. They have received wide acclaim in the media and from politicians. I would like to have them explained. Somebody who drives the wrong way down a dual carriageway does not need two points, but rather committal to a mental hospital or a prison. The same is true of somebody driving the wrong way around a roundabout.</p>
          <p eId="para_35">Widening the scope of penalty points avoids the issue. The real issue is revealed by the figure published yesterday. One third of all road fatalities are caused by drink. If we want to do something serious, it is not about the accumulation of points for silly misdemeanours. What needs to be done, as called for by groups such as Alcohol Action Ireland and others, is random breath testing. If such testing were put into operation we would at one blow solve one third of the fatalities as a result of road traffic accidents.</p>
          <p eId="para_36">While it is not politically correct to say so, I believe introducing 31 new offences brings politics into disrepute. I defy anyone to understand all the offences. Some issues are inexplicable. References are made to road markings which do not exist on many roads here. This is a simple media outing. I wish Gay Byrne well with his 31 items. No more than with the rest of what he needs to do, there is a simple thing we could do. We could introduce random breath testing, which would eliminate one third of the fatalities. It would make sense and have an immediate impact. Let us see the political will to do so and disregard the nonsense. People accumulating points for silly misdemeanours will do nothing to save lives on the road.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_40">Contrary to what people might imagine, I do not carry any ideological baggage about State ownership <i>per se</i>, nor about the opposite. We must learn from our experience and should do what we believe will work. Manifestly, the privatisation of Telecom Éireann did not work in terms of providing us with the scale of investment and dynamism that we wanted. Eircom is now being lauded by various international agencies as being a wonderfully managed company because of how it can outsmart the regulator on every occasion. That is not a great advertisement for whatever was supposed to be the advantage of its privatisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_41">I am still not persuaded as to why Aer Lingus should be privatised. I have the feeling that the rancid meat in the middle has infected the whole sandwich and we are talking about ideology taking over. I would like the Minister to come to the House to explain to me the business case for the privatisation of Aer Lingus because I have not heard it made yet. Perhaps there is a good case, but I have not yet been persuaded.</p>
          <p eId="para_42">The point was made to me this morning that when John Gilligan comes out of prison, he will be able to open a pharmacy. Nobody will be in a position to stop him because there are no regulations relating to the sorts of people who are fit to run pharmacies. We have no way of stopping unfit pharmacists from continuing to operate, as no suitable regulations are in place. No new legislation in this regard has been passed since 1875, even though further legislation has been promised for many years.</p>
          <p eId="para_43">We always seem to wait until a tragedy takes place before we discover that we need to update our legislation. We are now talking about changing the legislation relating to the medical profession as a matter of urgency, on foot of the tragic events in Drogheda. Will we wait until a tragedy takes place in the pharmaceutical sector before we amend the legislation that regulates it? Can the Leader ask the Tánaiste to state when legislation to regulate pharmacies and pharmacists will be introduced? Such legislation, which has been promised since early last year and has been needed for the past 30 years, is hopelessly and sadly overdue.</p>
          <p eId="para_44">We should not allow people who have been convicted of drug offences to sell legal drugs legitimately after they leave prison. I am aware of the case of a person who was struck off the register of pharmacists in Britain but then started to do some locum work as a pharmacist in my home city of Cork. He was entitled to work as a pharmacist in Ireland even though he had been disbarred from working as a pharmacist in Britain. This is not a trivial matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_45">Given that pharmacists deal with extremely dangerous materials and help to protect us against misuse, abuse and mistakes, the least we can do is to put in place a modern regulatory environment in which they can operate. The Government and the Department of Health and Children should do some proactive work in this regard by introducing the appropriate legislation instead of waiting to react to crises.</p>

It is logical that we should do so, given that they are trying to restore full and meaningful democratic structures to the North of Ireland and to respond to the wishes of the people who indicated in the referendums on the Good Friday Agreement that they share that goal. I accept the statement of the republican movement that it was not involved in this murder.</p>

          <p eId="para_49">I believe that the Government reacted in a balanced and responsible manner. We must bear in mind that there is a very dangerous vacuum at present. I ask republicans and Unionists to act in a responsible manner. We must remind ourselves that the republicans represented by Sinn Féin are the major Nationalist party in the North of Ireland. I appeal to Dr. Paisley and the DUP to give positive leadership to the people who put him in a position of authority. It is not helpful to sit on the fence.</p>
          <p eId="para_50">Dr. Paisley's negative approach to every effort that is being made is not helpful. There needs to be a response from Unionists as well as republicans. There is no war. There has been full decommissioning, except by loyalist paramilitaries. We should not try to score any political points. We must move the situation forward in a united manner.</p>

          <p eId="para_52">The tragic death of Veronica Guerin ten years ago galvanised the nation. Mrs. Nora Owen, who was Minister for Justice at the time, introduced the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 and established the Criminal Assets Bureau, which is doing excellent work at present. One of the people who was involved in the murder of Veronica Guerin is due to be released this week. It was planned that the person in question would appear on this Friday's "The Late Late Show". I must compliment the senior executives in RTE who have made the correct decision that this person would not appear on "The Late Late Show" this weekend. It would have sent out very wrong signals to the outside community. That person was to be accommodated in a first-class quality hotel in Dublin on the first night of his release prior to this programme.</p>

          <p eId="para_53">I want to ask the Leader if she could find some time to discuss the school transport issue in view of the tragedy in Clara, and indeed, last year's tragedy in County Meath. As far back as 1999 when I chaired the Joint Committee on Education, many members recommended change in the school transport scheme as regards seat belts and on the issue of three persons occupying two seats, the policy that was in place at the time. The Government reviewed the position in 2002 and also came up with recommendations. It would now be timely to have a debate on those proposed changes. Hopefully, they will soon be put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_54">There appear to be two different regimes of school transport, the Department of Education and Science on the one hand and private contractors on the other. It is time to bring all schemes up to the same standard for the transportation of students to school.</p>

          <p eId="para_55">I ask the Leader to consider having a debate on the Forfás report published today on Ireland's oil dependency, which is quite frightening. It points out that in 2004 we used 9 million tonnes of oil, double what was consumed in 1990. Ireland is the third largest user of oil <i>per capita</i> of the older EU states. This is worthy of debate and is a worthwhile subject for this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_56">Will the Leader please draw the attention of the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children to the fact that the chief dental adviser to the Minister, who retired two years ago, has not been replaced? I gather that somebody is on secondment to the Department of Health and Children, but this means, in effect, that dentistry is moving down the line and is not being given the attention it deserves. It amounts almost to a downgrading by stealth of the importance of dentistry to health.</p>

I welcome the unequivocal condemnation by the Sinn Féin leadership, which I believe to be sincere. I hope those agencies that used Mr. Donaldson to make various manoeuvres, feel suitably proud of themselves today, but I suspect they are indifferent. As Senator Ó Murchú has said, it underlines the importance of persevering in trying to establish the primacy of politics. Unfortunately, there are still people who believe not merely that they have the right to take the law into their own hands, but that they are the law. Such people need to become more and more of a minority.</p>
          <p eId="para_58">On a lighter note, I welcome the rude health of the public finances, as shown in yesterday's Exchequer return and the fact that this time a larger party has been converted to the merits of Government taxation policy.</p>

I welcomed his positive comments, indicating support for legislation to provide for civil partnerships in the future. My only reservation is that it rings somewhat hollow in that we have had positive indications previously from the Government to the effect that it wished to bring forward such legislation. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform set up a working group to examine the issues involved. I understood the group was to report in March but the Taoiseach said on Monday that it will not report until September. That means we will not have legislation before us until the autumn at the earliest. Will the Leader establish if the Government is serious about what it is saying? Will we see legislation before the House and passed before the next general election or will we just continue to hear nice comments and general support but nothing to back it up? If it is to be the latter is not good enough as far as I and the gay and lesbian community are concerned.</p>

I understand that in Switzerland if one is caught drunk while driving, one loses one's licence for life. It does not mean that people do not drink or drive there, it just means they do not do the two together. Drunk driving causes a third of all accidents while drunkenness causes most of the accidents in the home, etc. It is time we had a straight debate on driving under the influence of alcohol. We in this House should do what we can on the issue. We should acknowledge the fact that it is not possible for one to drink and drive properly.</p>

          <p eId="para_62">I endorse what Senator Ryan said. It is not the first time I have asked for a debate on Aer Lingus. The Minister was very happy to appear on "Prime Time" last night in order to answer no questions whatsoever. It would be helpful if he were to come into the House to debate this very serious issue. It is one of the most important issues of the day.</p>
          <p eId="para_63">It may surprise the House but I share Senator Ryan's belief that the Government has not yet made the business case for the privatisation of Aer Lingus. While there is a case and I tend to believe in it, we are now in an extraordinary muddle where people do not know where they stand. Last night, when asked, the Minister, Deputy Cullen, indicated he did not know when privatisation will happen nor how many shares the Government would hold. Such an approach is in danger of back-firing quite badly.</p>
          <p eId="para_64">Privatisation is being postponed again. I do not know who is behind it and who is in control but this is an issue which should be debated here in the House, not only outside it. I gather the latest development is that the Minister has told the unions and particularly the management to sort out issues which should have been addressed months ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_65">What is happening behind closed doors is very important in this case. Our role is to express our views and make the Minister accountable to the House for what is going on. At present there is no accountability in this very important area.</p>

          <p eId="para_70">Legislation might come to the House before the debate on pharmacies and pharmacists sought by Senator Ryan. Last Thursday at a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, the Tánaiste stated that legislation was imminent and would be presented to the House before the summer. Senator Ryan is correct in that for the first time legislation on the industry will cover fitness to practise.</p>
          <p eId="para_71">I am aware a loophole exists. One does not need to be a qualified pharmacist to open a pharmacy but the law states that one must employ a qualified person to manage and run the unit. It must be borne in mind that not all pharmacists can afford to open a pharmacy. We must ensure the baby is not thrown out with the bath water and qualified people are left unemployed.</p>

          <p eId="para_73">The House will be aware that Commissioner Dimas has decreed that body embalming fluids be banned, which will make the viewing of bodies a thing of the past. I ask whether he is trying to sound a death knell for a treasured Irish custom which has been so much a part of our culture for so long. There is ample evidence from psychologists to back up the view that it plays an important part in bringing closure to the bereavement process.

It would be entirely irrational for it to have been involved and this is obviously a view shared by Mr. Donaldson. Along with the process it is the big loser. Their difficulty is that it is not this House they have to convince but the DUP. I take some hope from a statement by Sir Reg Empey this morning stating that Northern Ireland politicians would have to find a means of getting over these things so they were not destabilised when such events occur. It gives me some hope that we could look for the primacy of politics as our colleagues have advocated.</p>

I fully agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator Maurice Hayes that the primacy of politics needs to be reinforced, notwithstanding that this House can have very little influence over outside events. I extend my deepest sympathy to the family because yet again this is another family grieving as a result of the shadow of the gunman whom I thought was long gone from our island.</p>
          <p eId="para_81">A report appeared in the national newspapers in the past few days regarding disturbing allegations made about immigration centres. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform seems to have a heavy agenda in other areas of policy but I ask the Leader to consider asking the Minister or somebody from the Department to come to the House to answer those allegations which are being investigated by the Irish Refugee Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_82">I would be a hypocrite if I did not highlight these issues in light of the fact that I and several colleagues from all sides of the House have attempted to alleviate the difficulties affecting Irish nationals in the United States, who are also immigrants. We must look into the motes in our own eyes. If the allegations published in the newspapers stand up, they are indefensible. It is unacceptable that those who have fled their countries for the best of reasons — to find a better life — should be treated with contempt, that their dignity has been compromised and that they are not given basic rights.

          <p eId="para_83">I support Senator Kitt's call for a review of the school transport system. Fewer than 12 months ago, the House asked for a review so that the tragedy in Meath would not be repeated. A terrible tragedy took place in Clara, County Offaly, yesterday. Our sympathy goes out to the family, the students and the community at large in Offaly.</p>
          <p eId="para_84">A hidden factor that contributed to this tragic loss was the fact that all of the children on the bus had been refused school transport by the Department of Education and Science. This is where the real tragedy lies. For almost 15 years we have ignored calls for a review of the catchment areas. Today I received from a parent in County Galway a copy of a letter from Bus Éireann which states: "In keeping with Department of Education and Science directives for school transport, whereby each pupil must have a single seat, I regret to inform you that we are enable to give your child transport after Easter". This is one of 30 letters to one national school in Galway. It is envisaged that a further 20 pupils will lose school transport from September.</p>
          <p eId="para_85">Will the Minister continue with the absolute lack of proper regulation in the area of school transport? Children are being put in danger as a result of the total mess caused by the involvement of the Department of Education and Science, on the one hand, and the Department of Transport on the other, as well as independent carriers, with nobody having control other than through the Department of Education and Science scheme. The matter needs urgent attention.</p>

          <p eId="para_102">On the Order of Business, I support the call for a debate on the transport system and reiterate my request for one, which I made last week. The system is in chaos, of which we have evidence this week. Not alone has Senator Ulick Burke received letters but most Senators and other Oireachtas Members have received similar letters from CIE on the transport issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_103">On another issue, I call for a debate on the underfunding within the BMW region. I understand that only 57% of the funding allocated under the national development plan for the region for the period 2000 to 2006 has been spent. This is due to bureaucracy and red tape introduced by the Government. There is a major underspending of this funding in the BMW region. At the time of the mid-term review I called for a debate on this issue. Such funding was intended to promote growth and infrastructural development in the region in terms of roads, transport, tourism and rural development, but all those projects in the BMW region are lagging behind simliar projects in the rest of the country. I want equality introduced in the development throughout the country.</p>

          <p eId="para_104">I support the call for a debate on the privatisation and sale of Aer Lingus. It is an urgent matter that needs to be debated as soon as possible. I urge the Leader to arrange such a debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_105">On another matter, which relates to Senator Leyden's proposed Bill on the defamation of the dead, will the Leader advise us as to the stage of preparation of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in regard to a panoply of legislation on the press council, privacy and reform of libel and defamation laws? We discussed these issues in this House in the past mainly due to the efforts of the Leader, but we are still awaiting the introduction of this important and significant legislation. It was to be published originally before Christmas and we were told more recently it would be published before Easter, which is fast approaching. Can the Leader indicate when that legislation will be introduced?</p>
          <p eId="para_106">Will the Leader consider arranging a debate on issues related to health, particularly that of the provision of acute services? A useful exchange took place between Professor Drumm, the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, and members of the Joint Committee on Health and Children last Thursday when a number of issues were thrashed out. The outstanding issue is that of bed capacity. I would like the Minister for Health and Children to come to the House to facilitate a discussion on a number of issues, particularly those related to how hospitals are being managed. It is emerging that not all hospitals have problems in that small hospitals in particular work well. It is important that we would be able to tease out the issues emerging around the important matter of health policy.</p>

          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_107">I agree with what Senator O'Toole said about the new penalty point offences introduced. There are two major omissions in the 31 offences listed, one being the use of mobile phones. A Bill covering this issue passed Second Stage in the Dáil but I got the impression that the Minister responsible will drag his heels on progressing it. That Bill should be brought forward to Committee and Remaining Stages and brought to this House. The Leader might indicate if there is a timescale as to when the Bill will be enacted.</p>
          <p eId="para_108">We hear about drink driving all the time and yet we have a massive drug problem. Some motorists drive vehicles having taken class A drugs as well as, in some cases, medication in the form of anti-depressants but nothing is being done to address that problem. It was discovered that a motorcyclist who killed a lady in a recent tragedy was more high on drugs than on alcohol. Motorists who drive having taken drugs are a major problem on our roads. It is time we tackled that problem in the same way as we tackled drink driving in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_109">I am concerned that the penalty points system is turning into a revenue generating exercise rather than a preventative and road safety exercise, which it was originally intended to be.</p>
          <p eId="para_110">I agree with Senator Terry's point in welcoming the Taoiseach's opening of the new offices for the gay and lesbian equality network, GLEN, recently. I call for a debate on housing particularly for single people. The lack of such housing also affects gays and lesbians who are clearly being discriminated against. It is nearly impossible for single or separated people, or gays and lesbians, to get local authority housing. As houses are currently allocated, they tend to go to families or women with children. We must initiate a housing scheme in every county and local authority for single people, be they homosexual or heterosexual.</p>

          <from>Mr. Cummins</from>
          <p eId="para_111">Gun crime, particularly drug-related gun crime, seems to be out of control in the country. Last week we discussed the shootings on the M50, and over the weekend another young man was shot in Clonmel. Nothing seems to get done on the issue. Security vans are rammed and vast amounts of money are taken, and it is estimated that less than 10% of the money taken in all these robberies over the past number of years has been recovered.</p>
          <p eId="para_112">What is the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform doing about this? It would be more appropriate to give extra resources to the Garda Síochána rather than issue press statements or sound bites on the issue. I ask the Minister to come into this House and explain why the Garda Síochána is not being properly resourced.</p>
          <p eId="para_113">On another issue, Members have stated that they accept the statement that the IRA was not involved in the killing of Mr. Denis Donaldson. I remind Members that there were similar denials with regard to the murders of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe and Robert McCartney, and after the Northern Bank robbery. Truth is certainly not the IRA's greatest attribute.</p>

          <p eId="para_115">I support Senators Kitt, Burke and Bannon in calling for a debate on school transport. I extend our sympathies to the White family and all concerned in a very tragic accident yesterday near Clara. We can speak of school transport and an inability to get it, but my information is that there is a secondary school in Clara but it is the choice of parents to hire a private bus to bring their children to Killina. We must have uniform standards for all school buses, irrespective of whether they are hired privately or run by the State. A mechanical failure was the cause of this incident, and these events can happen without notice, unfortunately.</p>
          <p eId="para_116">I wish to make a brief comment on penalty points. I have listened daily to people in this House calling on the relevant Minister to do something about road safety. The Minister for Transport, as part of the Government, introduced 31 new penalty point offences, but what has then happened? The media, and many public representatives, have condemned the Minister for this action taken in the interest of road safety. I am wondering where these people are coming from.</p>

          <from>Mr. McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_117">In welcoming last week's debate on agriculture, it is important we keep it to the front of our agenda. New Teagasc advice will be presented to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Department of Agriculture and Food, and both Ministers should examine it comprehensively and adhere to the advice and guidance therein.</p>
          <p eId="para_118">On another matter raised here today, yesterday was an unfortunate dawn, primarily because of the loss of the life of Mr. Denis Donaldson. It was also an unfortunate dawn with regard to the position in which people from Donegal found themselves. It is important to put into context that although Donegal is a Border county, not all of it is in the Border region. Not all of the county has suffered from the Troubles to the same extent as areas near the Border. Glenties won a Tidy Towns award and is strongly associated with tourism. It is a quiet and peaceful village with peaceful people.</p>

          <p eId="para_120">Yesterday the people of Church Hill witnessed streams of cars coming from Letterkenny Garda station. One commentator pointed out to me that it was like "Hill Street Blues" at one stage. This precedent has been set in Donegal and the people there do not want it and will not stand for it.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. Phelan</from>
          <p eId="para_121">I join with colleagues in expressing disgust at the murder of Mr. Donaldson in County Donegal. Senator Ó Murchú said that republicans had fully decommissioned but I do not see how this is so, in light of yesterday's shooting. Clearly, the guns used in that incident have not been decommissioned and nobody would doubt the involvement of people calling themselves, however loosely, "republicans".</p>
          <p eId="para_122">Other Senators referred to the tragic accident yesterday in County Offaly. It is now time for action and for the installation, without further delay, of seatbelts on every schoolbus in the country, whether privately operated or publicly owned. I extend my sympathy to the family of the young man killed in the accident.</p>
          <p eId="para_123">I agree with the points made by my colleague, Senator Cummins, on the subjects of crime and justice, with particular reference to the murder over the weekend in Clonmel, which was a disturbing development. Attacks on vehicles transporting cash have grown into a serious problem. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform commented flippantly last year on a particular attack in Dublin. The drivers of the van in question were subjected to a harrowing ordeal as the van was robbed. The Minister would be better employed ensuring the safety of people going about their work than engaging in his usual megaphone politics on such issues.</p>

          <from>Ms O’Rourke</from>
          <p eId="para_124">The leader of the Opposition, Senator Brian Hayes, mentioned the sad death, as all are, of Denis Donaldson. He likened his killing to that of Eamon Collins in the late 1990s. He suggested the Government be more circumspect in its comments and pointed to tensions in the republican movement, arising from the uncovering of its criminality and its attempted dissipation. He said there were people who still believed that intimidation and threats worked. We do not yet know who committed the heinous murder of Mr. Donaldson so to ascribe it to any particular group or country would be wrong. One can only imagine what an awful death he suffered.</p>
          <p eId="para_125">Senator O'Toole referred to the 31 offences attracting penalty points and argued they would not decrease road fatalities, because one third of them are caused by drink. We should adopt the Australian or Swiss model where a person found guilty of drinking and driving is banned from driving for life. We need to introduce drastic measures to convince people they cannot drink and drive.</p>
          <p eId="para_126">Senator Ryan called for a debate on the privatisation of Aer Lingus and asked the Minister to come to this House to explain the reasons behind his decision. He also asked about pharmacies and Senator Feeney provided an answer, to the effect that, as the Tánaiste apparently said, a Bill would be published before the summer. There are two pharmacy Bills, and we had thought they would not be published until the autumn. As Senator Ryan said, the last legislation was enacted in 1870 so hopefully there will be progress on that before the summer break.</p>
          <p eId="para_127">Senator Ó Murchú sent best wishes to the Taoiseach and said it was unhelpful for Dr. Paisley and the DUP to sit on the fence.</p>
          <p eId="para_128">I agree with Senator Finucane who praised RTE for cancelling Patrick "Dutchy" Holland's appearance on "The Late Late Show". One can only imagine how the audience would have reacted to his appearance and the very idea was audacious, to say the least.</p>
          <p eId="para_129">I agree with Senator Kitt's call for seatbelts on school transport. Senator Quinn raised the Forfás report regarding our overdependency on oil. We have all received a copy, and I agree that it would make a very useful debate, which we will have after Easter.</p>
          <p eId="para_130">Senator Mansergh spoke on what I agree was the squalid murder in Donegal, welcoming Sinn Féin's disavowal of any involvement and stressing the importance of persevering with the primacy of politics. He also welcomed the good health of the public finances and the conversion of a party to our taxation policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_131">I am pleased Senator Terry expressed her happiness at seeing the Taoiseach at the GLEN function. She wants me to ascertain whether civil partnerships legislation is to be introduced following the report to which she referred, publication of which appears to have moved to the autumn. She has published a very fine paper on the matter, and I will answer her question in due course.</p>
          <p eId="para_132">Senator Lydon requested a debate on driving under the influence of drink. One may drink or drive but not do the two together.</p>
          <p eId="para_133">On the question of the privatisation of Aer Lingus we have seen a <i>volte-face</i> from Senator Ross, from whose eyes the scales appear to have dropped. He is not present, but I would say the same thing if he were.</p>

          <p eId="para_141">Senator Maurice Hayes wished the Taoiseach well and accepted the statement by the Sinn Féin leadership and also welcomed Reg Empey's comments. I am delighted to tell Senator Tuffy about Seanad reform, which I want as much as she. Like her, I feel that I may not be around to see it implemented, but I want it to happen. We had started what I considered a good series of meetings with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche. I believe there had been two such meetings when a debate in the House cut across the next one to be scheduled. It is now a matter of arranging another, but we are moving forward, albeit very slowly. This Chamber would benefit greatly from full and proper reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_142">Senator Mooney also mentioned the primacy of politics and expressed concern at disturbing allegations from the Irish Refugee Council regarding immigration centres. I have been worried about them for some time but could not find an echo, so I am glad to hear the Senator raise the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_143">Senator Ulick Burke suggested a review of school transport, something with which I agree. We will try to have one immediately. Regarding Killina, Senator Moylan was right to point out that parents want children to attend the school of their choice. Sometimes when I hear on RTE the pronunciations of places I know of I have to laugh. Parents wanted their children to attend Killina, despite there being good second level schools nearby. That is their choice.</p>
          <p eId="para_144">Clearly school transport cannot be used if one wishes one's child to attend a school outside the relevant catchment area, but the Senator believes that such areas should be reviewed. They were drawn up in 1967, and no review has been carried out since. There is not a district in Ireland without some sort of dispute regarding catchment areas and where children should go. It was extremely sad that a young lad on his way to school was killed, with many others injured, and I support Senator Moylan's comments. We should have a good debate on school transport.</p>
          <p eId="para_145">Senator Leyden thanked everyone for their good wishes. Committee and Remaining Stages of his Registration of Wills Bill 2005 are scheduled for the first week after we return from the Easter recess. The Senator is to introduce a new Bill to address defamation of the dead. This is the first time I have heard this announcement and I welcome it.</p>
          <p eId="para_146">Senator Bannon called for a debate on school transport last week and today called for a debate on the underfunding of the BMW region. Senator O'Meara asked for a debate on Aer Lingus and inquired what has happened to the defamation legislation. The defamation Bill is expected to go to Cabinet next week, it is on the Government A list for publication. Perhaps Senator Leyden's Bill can be knitted in with it.</p>

          <p eId="para_149">Senator Browne asked about legislation on mobile phone use while driving. Fine Gael introduced a Bill dealing with that issue in the Dáil last week and it was accepted by the Government. Hopefully it will come through quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_150">Senator Browne also mentioned drug driving and the penalty points system. I also agree with him that we often meet elderly people who find it difficult to secure local authority housing. OPDs are a thing of the past. There was a time when every council scheme included a few OPDs but elderly people now find it difficult to get a house. From the council's point of view, a family with children gets first call.</p>
          <p eId="para_151">Senator Cummins said that gun crime is out of control and called for a debate on the matter. Senator Moylan extended his sympathies to the White family and mentioned penalty points. He is right, we asked what the Government was doing about road safety and then we criticise it as soon as it acts. There must be severe penalties for those who drink and drive. There was a terrible accident in Athlone at the weekend as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_152">Senator McHugh mentioned new information from Teagasc and said that we should keep our finger on the pulse of the agriculture debate. He also spoke about Glenties, a lovely place, where we all flock to the Patrick Magill summer school every year. Senator John Paul Phelan also mentioned Denis Donaldson, the tragedy in Offaly and crime in general, calling for a debate on the subject.</p>

          <p eId="para_153">Is onóir dom bheith ar ais arís i Seanad Éireann chun freastal ar an ábhar an-tábhachtach seo faoi eachtraí na tíre seo san Aontas Eorpach. Tá mé buíoch go bhfuil deis agam labhairt faoin Chomhairle Eorpach a bhí againn sechtain ó shin.</p>
          <p eId="para_154">The Taoiseach represented Ireland at the European Council in Brussels on 23 and 24 March 2006. He was accompanied by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Finance, Deputies Dermot Ahern and Cowen. The conclusions of the Council have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_155">The Lisbon strategy, adopted by the European Council in 2000, was reviewed at its mid-term point by the Heads of State and Government last year. Following the work undertaken by Ireland during its Presidency in 2004, the strategy was refocused, with a greater emphasis on growth and jobs. This was the first opportunity since the mid-term review of the strategy for EU leaders to assess progress on the broad economic and social agenda facing the European Union. In addition, the European Council adopted comprehensive conclusions on a planned new energy policy for Europe. The Ministers for Foreign Affairs collectively discussed the future of Europe and enlargement, and I propose to report also on these discussions.</p>
          <p eId="para_156">The meeting took place in an extremely positive atmosphere. It took important decisions, not least as regards energy policy, and provided for a comprehensive review of the state of progress with the Lisbon strategy. Progress has been made on a number of significant issues, including some of particular importance to Ireland. The meeting followed the successful informal meeting of Heads of State and Government at Hampton Court in October last year, and the December European Council at which agreement was reached on the future financial framework for the enlarged European Union for the period from 2007-13.</p>
          <p eId="para_157">The European Council has clearly demonstrated once again the capacity of the European Union to function effectively in a manner that delivers tangible benefits in the interests of our citizens. The new energy policy for Europe was the central issue for this European Council and the Taoiseach has reported in detail on the discussions and on the conclusions to the meeting. The three main objectives underpinning the new policy, namely, security of supply, ensuring the continuing competitiveness of Europe's economies and promoting environmental sustainability, are of central importance to Ireland and the future success of our economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">During the European Council's discussions on energy, the Taoiseach explicitly rejected the nuclear option for Ireland. As the Taoiseach has made clear, the EU's work on energy will not in any way affect our national policy of rejecting nuclear power generation in Ireland. The proposed new energy policy fully recognises that decisions on the primary sources of energy and energy mix remain firmly the responsibility of the member states. The Government is strongly opposed to nuclear power and it is our resolute intention that no facilities for generating nuclear power will be constructed in Ireland. This is already enshrined in our legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_159">A number of EU countries share Ireland's opposition to nuclear power, while others are more favourably disposed towards nuclear generation. Everyone accepts, however, that this choice is one for each Government to make. In the discussions at EU level we will, of course, also continue to push for the highest possible standards for the operation of nuclear plants and the disposal of nuclear waste material.</p>
          <p eId="para_160">Ireland has much to gain from the development of a European energy policy. The conclusions reflect our view that the development of regional energy co-operation in the EU should pay particular attention to countries and regions largely isolated from the EU energy market. Ireland, along with the Baltic states, Cyprus and Malta is very much on the periphery of the EU energy market. Our small markets are not necessarily attractive to major energy companies and we therefore have difficulties in mobilising private sector investment for energy. At the European Council, the Taoiseach addressed the importance Ireland attaches to suitable provision for interconnection, including in the context of the European Union's state aid rules.</p>
          <p eId="para_161">We are, of course, only at the preliminary stage in the evolution of a new energy policy and Ireland has highlighted a number of important questions for consideration as the debate develops, including the role of a possible European energy regulator and the importance of renewable energy. We are pleased that the EU's ambitious new work programme on energy is very much in line with the Government's approach. The revised arrangements for taking forward the Lisbon strategy provide for the preparation of three-year national reform programmes by member states and for their submission to the European Commission. In Ireland's case, our national reform programme, containing our plans for implementing the Lisbon strategy, and prepared in consultation with the social partners, was placed before the Houses of the Oireachtas in October of last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_162">The European Council conclusions deal with the broad range of Lisbon Agenda issues but devote special attention to three particularly important areas, namely, investing in knowledge and innovation; unlocking the business potential of small and medium sized enterprises; and increasing employment opportunities for priority groups such as young people, women, older workers, people with disabilities, legal migrants and minorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_163">The European Council agreed to work towards new targets on reducing early school leaving and boosting youth employment. In particular, the European Council agreed that by 2010, every unemployed young person should be offered a job, apprenticeship, additional training or other measure within no more than four months. A target of 85% was set for the completion of upper secondary education by 22 year olds. In the case of Ireland, the latest data show that with an 86.1% record, we already exceed the European Council's target and are well above the EU average which currently stands at 77.3%.</p>
          <p eId="para_164">The European Council also adopted a target designed to reduce the time for setting up a business. The idea is that by the end of 2007, it should be possible to do so within one week anywhere in the European Union. At present, it takes only three days to set up a business in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_165">In order to contribute to Europe's competitiveness and also to bring Europe closer to our citizens, the Taoiseach suggested that the EU should look at the possibility of reducing or eliminating mobile phone roaming charges for people travelling within the EU. This proposal draws on the progress already made on this issue on a North-South basis and between Ireland and Britain. The Presidency welcomed this suggestion and it is now referred to in the European Council conclusions. Since the European Council, Commissioner Reding, on 28 March last, announced that she planned to introduce a regulation to eliminate all unjustified roaming charges in the EU. We will continue to give priority to the ultimate elimination of these charges.</p>
          <p eId="para_166">The conclusions also addressed two other matters of particular importance to us. They reflect our view that the EU's state aid rules should encourage and facilitate a high level of investment in Europe and make Europe attractive for future inward investment. We must ensure that the desire for a level playing field on state aids within Europe, which we fully endorse, does not undermine Europe's capacity to continue to attract high quality investment projects that will help underpin Europe's future competitiveness. The European Council's conclusions recognise this.</p>
          <p eId="para_167">The European Council recognised that the internal market for services must be made fully operational while preserving Europe's social model. Ireland continues to endorse the need for a balanced services directive which captures the advantages of a more liberalised market in services while protecting the rights and interests of workers. We are studying closely the amended version of the draft directive which the European Commission presented yesterday. This is likely to be the subject of intensive negotiations within the European Council in the months ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_168">The European Council also adopted a pact for gender equality to encourage action on closing gender gaps in the labour market, promoting a better work-life balance and better monitoring of gender equality actions. The European Council deplored the recent presidential election in Belarus as fatally flawed. We welcome the fact the EU has signalled its determination to impose sanctions against those politically and administratively responsible for violations of international electoral standards in Belarus.</p>
          <p eId="para_169">As I mentioned at the outset, Foreign Ministers discussed the future of Europe and enlargement. These are two issues that generate intense political interest and the Presidency's aim was to initiate a broad debate. This discussion marked the beginning of a process that will continue for the remaining months of the Austrian Presidency as EU Foreign Ministers prepare a review of the current period of reflection which is to be put before the Heads of State and Government when they next meet in June.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">Inevitably, member states hold divergent views on these issues. A number, for example, consider that the European constitution cannot be implemented now. Even among this group, however, there are those which want to see some or all of its contents implemented on a piecemeal basis. Others, particularly the 14 countries which have already ratified the European constitution, consider that it represents the optimum framework for creating a more efficient and effective Union. We subscribe strongly to this latter view. We recognise that progress with the ratification of the European constitution is not possible for the time being but we hope that circumstances will change during 2007 and that we may then be able to resume the ratification process in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_171">Our view that more time is required before we can revisit the issues impeding the ratification of the European constitution was reinforced by the Foreign Ministers' discussions at the European Council. We are not saying, however, that nothing can be done before 2007. The period of reflection which has been under way since June 2005 has been a valuable opportunity for Europeans to reflect on the kind of Union they want for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_172">In Ireland, the work of our National Forum on Europe has played a key role in helping refine our thinking on the future of Europe. I pay tribute to Senator Maurice Hayes and his management team for the outstanding work done. I also pay tribute to members of the forum for their individual and collective contributions to its work. On the day when the European Council convened in Brussels, the European forum here was hearing submissions from individuals and organisations throughout Ireland. If we are to succeed in engaging Europeans more actively in EU affairs, this is exactly the type of initiative which needs to be pursued across the European Union on an ongoing basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_173">As we see it, this is a time for Europe to focus on tangible achievements instead of agonising over institutional complexities which are of little interest to most people. In his intervention, the Minister for Foreign Affairs stressed the need to build on the EU's genuine successes. These range from the creation of the euro at one end of the scale to the work now being undertaken on roaming charges or on the development of a harmonised driving licence. These are some of the areas where the EU can prove its worth and win increased levels of public approval.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">As regards enlargement, the accession of Bulgaria and Romania will mark the completion of the fifth round of enlargement, increasing the membership of the European Union from 15 to 27 countries. Negotiations have begun with Croatia and Turkey and the European Union has also renewed its commitment to the Thessalonika Agenda, which foresees a European perspective for the countries of the western Balkans. Ireland has always been supportive of enlargement, not least perhaps because we were among its first beneficiaries when we joined back in 1973. There can be no doubt that the prospect of membership exerts a strong and stabilising force on potential members.</p>
          <p eId="para_175">The recent accession of the countries of central and eastern Europe was a momentous achievement and it would be unfair and unwise to close the door to other European nations which aspire to membership of the EU. It is in all our interests to continue a carefully managed enlargement process that extends peace, prosperity and enhanced human rights across our Continent.</p>
          <p eId="para_176">It is clear the European Union has work to do to prepare itself for any future enlargement. It is also evident that the public has considerable concerns about future enlargement and that these need to be responded to by governments. For now, however, the priority must be to make a success of the enlarged European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_177">At the recent ministerial discussion, the Minister for Foreign Affairs made the point that we need to offer EU citizens a clear strategy for future enlargement which is based on objective conditions and realistic commitments. We will continue to take a constructive and pragmatic approach to enlargement while giving due weight to the need for future candidate countries to be able to meet the obligations of membership. We must also attend to the European Union's absorption capacity.</p>
          <p eId="para_178">This discussion was a useful first step for Foreign Ministers in an area of work which will have a high priority during the next three months. The Presidency has now proposed an additional meeting of Foreign Ministers likely to be held in late May. This will result in a report to the June European Council reviewing the period of reflection and determining what further steps are required to facilitate the completion of the ratification process for the EU constitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_179">During the Foreign Minister's dinner, the Minister for Foreign Affairs also raised the recent ETA ceasefire and complimented the Spanish Government on this breakthrough. He was one of a number of Ministers who exhorted the Presidency to issue a statement expressing the EU's concerns about the continued operation of Guantanamo Bay and urging its closure.</p>
          <p eId="para_180">The spring European Council was a constructive meeting that focused on the real needs of our citizens. As reflected in the meeting's conclusions, Heads of State and Government have advanced the Lisbon Agenda for growth and jobs. New ground has been broken in the critically important area of energy policy. Discussion among Foreign Ministers will help prepare the way for important decisions both on the European constitution and the future of Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_181">Overall, this was a very satisfactory European Council which dealt constructively with a range of key economic issues vital to the future well-being of Ireland and of the European Union as a whole. The Austrian Presidency is to be commended on the success of the spring European Council. I trust that this puts the conclusions of the recent European Council in context for the Members of this House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_84">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_182">I thank the Minister of State for his statement, which sets out the main content of the European Council meeting. As I stated in another forum, it is very important that there be debate in plenary form in both Houses when a Council meeting occurs. It does not always follow that we have an opportunity to contribute to such debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">My abiding memory of the most recent Council meeting was the walk-out by President Chirac when one of the Commissioners decided to speak in English rather than French. I regarded this as a rather petulant response by the leader of one of the biggest and most influential countries in the European Union. I often wonder whether someone such as François Mitterrand would have responded in such a way.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">The Minister of State's assessment was upbeat but I do not share his optimism. I will explain why this is the case. There is currently profound instability in the European Union and it lacks the moral and political leadership to steer us through this very difficult time. That there is a period of reflection, which started in 2005 and will not end until at least 2007, demonstrates the dilemma at the heart of the European project. This emanates from the rejection of the constitution in both France and Holland.</p>
          <p eId="para_185">Europe is being blamed for every ill that befalls nation states. Last weekend, on 1 April, an alleged joke on the part of the national broadcaster indicated that the Minister for Transport had just signed automatically a new law such that all drivers would have to drive on the right hand side of the road. This is an example of the narrow-minded way in which Europe is constantly blamed for all the ills that befall this society. When things go right for the Government, it is regarded as the achievement of the Government and when things go wrong, Brussels is blamed.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">The lack of political and moral leadership in the European project must be addressed. I say this in the knowledge that the Government wants to move forward with the ratification of the constitution. It ensured that a great amount of political capital was invested in the convention and the final text of the constitution, of which we had a part in negotiating so successfully. However, while we must recognise the difficulties that exist at the heart of the European project, we should not over-exaggerate them.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">There is currently a two-speed Europe — a western Europe and an eastern Europe and they are both very different. Last year a constituent of mine employed seven people in the area of web design in his communications business but all these jobs are now outsourced to Latvia and Poland. They were lost in Ireland because the constituent can run his business at a tenth of the cost by employing people from those countries. This is an example of the two-speed Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_188">The Stability and Growth Pact serves as another example in that one law applies to the big countries and another to Ireland and other small countries. We have seen too many examples of the Maastricht guidelines being broken routinely by the Italians, French and Germans while small countries such as Ireland were rapped across the knuckles for adhering to the guidelines and the Stability and Growth Pact. This contradiction must be addressed sooner rather than later. Totally different sets of standards apply in this area of key policy, to which we have all signed up as a result of our support for and implementation of the euro.</p>
          <p eId="para_189">The European Union has particular problems associated with unemployment. The demonstrations in France over the past week or so highlight the great problem of youth unemployment, which also exists in Poland. This must be addressed and this is why I refer to a two-speed Europe. One side is doing very well and ensuring high levels of employment and growth while the other is languishing, thus having an effect on the Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_190">President Barroso, in the course of his contribution at the meeting of the Council, summed up the matter very well by saying we cannot be open for business with the rest of the world and closed to each other. Commissioner McCreevy also struck the right note when he warned about the futility of building political "Maginot lines" around a member state's economy. We have seen examples of this. The current dispute between Italy and France in respect of the purchasing of an international energy company is an example of the new economic nationalism that has taken hold owing to a lack of political leadership on the part of some EU countries. The dispute between the French and Italians demonstrates the existence of a neonationalist economic identity which must be recognised. Unfortunately, nobody at Council level or at the Commission is sounding out the matter or saying we need to do more to ensure harmonisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_191">I very much welcome the fact that, as a result of the Council meeting, we are seeing the start of a new single energy market in the European Union. The countries of the Union, Ireland in particular, are dependent on energy resources from outside the Union. Some 91% of Ireland's energy is imported and it is very dependent on oil and gas. We know these fuels will not be available indefinitely. We recently noted the dispute between the Russian Federation and the Ukraine, as referred to by the Minister of State. It demonstrated our dependence on a supply of oil and gas which, if turned off tomorrow, would greatly dent Irish economic performance. It is therefore right and proper, not just in terms of the North-South interconnector, which we all support, that we have a single energy market in the European Union. I commend the Council on moving in this direction. If we are serious about ensuring future energy supply, we must address the issue of renewable energy and biofuels and move rapidly to become less dependent on oil and gas. I ask the Government to further the agenda of creating a new energy market in the Union because it will be crucial to the continuing growth of our economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">I welcome the announcement on ETA by the Council. The Spanish Government is to be congratulated on its work in this area. The announcement by ETA of an unconditional, permanent ceasefire was considerably more advantageous than the announcement of the initial ceasefire by the IRA over ten years ago, and it is to be congratulated on this. Any measures the European Union can introduce in the Basque region to support and sustain the ceasefire, and the peace process I hope will flow from it, should be supported.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">One of the positive results of the Council meeting concerns roaming charges. I commend the Government on raising this issue. We need to focus on practical measures that the ordinary citizens in Europe can see are being implemented by their politicians. If we can abolish roaming charges, as referred to by the telecommunications Commissioner last week, we will be taking a very practical, consumer-friendly step regarding an issue that many European citizens rightly highlight. I encourage the Government to continue its efforts to achieve this.</p>
          <p eId="para_194">These are the kinds of practical issues on which we must concentrate because we do not have any plan B. According to my humble judgment, we do not have political leadership of sufficient weight in the European Union, nor do we have the Mitterrands or Kohls to bring us out of the morass we are in. I wish we did.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AnnOrmonde" eId="spk_85">
          <from>Ms Ormonde</from>
          <p eId="para_195">l welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Tracey, to the House for this debate. This is exactly the kind of discussion the Seanad should be having and as the Seanad develops in the years to come it is important that we are given further opportunity to engage in debate on EU matters. Since I became spokesperson on European affairs, I have been trying to take the lead on having such debates in this House in order to reach out to the citizens and inform them as to what is going on and the potential of the European institutions. These debates will become more important in the future and while the Dáil may not have adequate time to debate such matters, the Seanad can certainly fill that role.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">While the recent European Council meeting may not have attracted the same level of headlines that some previous meetings have enjoyed, for the long-term future of Europe it was no less significant. By putting the emphasis on energy policy and the further development of the Lisbon Agenda, the European Council emphasised the importance it puts on the mid-term growth of the EU and having a policy vision that is not just concerned with the here and now.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">As we know the Lisbon Agenda was agreed in March 2000, when the EU Heads of State and Government agreed to make the EU "the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-driven economy by 2010". Although some progress was made on innovating Europe's economy, there has been growing concern that the reform process is not going fast enough and that the ambitious targets will not be reached. On 22 and 23 March 2005, the Council discussed the Commission's mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy for economic, social and environmental renewal. More focus on growth and employment, simplification and national ownership via national action plans were the key elements to relaunch the Lisbon reforms agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_198">The most recent meeting has concentrated on addressing the progress made on a broad range of Lisbon Agenda related matters. I welcome that it also agreed to focus on three particular issues, namely, investing in knowledge and innovation, unlocking the business potential of small and medium-sized enterprises and increasing employment opportunities for priority groups. The Taoiseach also referred to three national programmes running in this country, namely, Science Foundation Ireland's centres for science, engineering and technology programme, the Skillnets training networks programme, the one-step-up programme and the wage subsidy scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_199">In particular, the Skillnets programme offers a real template for other EU countries to follow. Skillnets provides knowledge, experience and most importantly funding for organisations and companies to train their staff effectively for the benefit of the staff, the business, the sector and ultimately the domestic economy. Skillnets offers an alternative to off-the-shelf training products by allowing companies to design and implement training programmes that are 100% relevant and match their exact requirements. The approach to training is unique and innovative allowing companies with similar training needs come together to form networks. Obviously, this approach could be repeated throughout the EU and it is to the Government's credit that this programme was developed on our shores.</p>
          <p eId="para_200">We all know why it is important to invest in knowledge and innovation. This country's economy is perhaps the best placed of all EU countries to realise this. In this global economic age, the EU will not be able to compete in wage costs with developing economies in other parts of the world. However, we can offer more developed skills that would not be available elsewhere. To achieve this step we must continue to invest in the knowledge-based economy and to ensure that our skill set is at the upper end of the marketplace.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">It is also important that we offer greater opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises. While big businesses around the globe move to ever-greater levels of consolidation, these businesses are dependent on smaller enterprises to service them. We should also remember that while the larger companies provide significant levels of employment, the cumulative numbers offered by small and medium-sized businesses are even more impressive and arguably more important. The more businesses of this size any economy has, the less fear it has of the potentially disastrous effects of a company shutting down.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">We also need to be able to innovate in our entrepreneurial undertakings. All big businesses originally started off small and grew bigger. If we want such businesses to develop then the climate must encourage them to get started in the first place, create a more favourable environment, simplify administration procedures and have easy to apply EU rules. With these issues in mind I was happy to see the Council agree a target of reducing the time needed to start a business to only one week anywhere in the EU. This target was even more satisfying when one considers that in this country it only takes three days to get a business started.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">In his speech, the Minister of State referred to young people. Increasing employment gives opportunities for priority groups, young people, women, older people, people with disabilities, legal migrants and minority groups. The European Council invites member states to strengthen education and training programmes, our communication and media as well as the creative industry to play an important part in promoting entrepreneurship among young people.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">Increasing investment in human capital through better educational training, better organisation at work, better quality of working life and updating working qualifications will also boost labour productivity. The objective is to reach the employment targets by 2010. The European Council calls on member states to upskill and have life-long programmes to help people to find employment, to help those on low pay and on the labour margins, and to intensify efforts to reduce the early school leaver numbers and bring them back into the workforce. The objective of the Council is that the unemployed will be offered a job, apprenticeship or training within four months rather than six months by 2010. However, Ireland is already on course as it exceeds that target and is already above the EU average. To assist older people, the EU underlines active ageing strategies through longer working life, a gradual retirement approach and part-time work.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">I was pleased to hear the Taoiseach calling on the EU to investigate mobile phone roaming charges for those travelling abroad.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">A theme of the Council was to discuss energy policy for Europe. As was shown during the winter stand-off between Russia and the Ukraine over gas prices and supply, energy will become a bigger issue in the years to come. Obviously, the EU needs to examine the security of supply and the best way to achieve this is through diversification. We need to have multiple sources of supply, both from within the borders of the EU and outside so that if the global political outlook were to change suddenly we would not be danger of losing our energy supply.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">The Council also discussed promoting environmental sustainability, which obviously refers to the issue of renewable energy. I could speak further on this matter. I know the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is preparing a Green Paper on energy policy, which I hope will reflect diversification, interconnection and the markets that are available for us to give security of supply. I welcome the discussion on the future of our energy policy leading to protecting our energy supply so that we are not dictated to by what other EU member states do.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">I congratulate the Taoiseach and the other members of the European Council for addressing the situation in Belarus during last month's meeting. It is clear that the recent presidential election in Belarus was not fair and democratic. We must do all we can to ensure that the values of democracy continue to flourish throughout the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on European Union issues. I compliment the work of the National Forum on Europe in keeping such issues in the minds of Irish citizens. Many submissions are being made at EU level at present, for example in respect of the harmonisation of qualifications and driving licences. The services directive will facilitate the movement of people, provide for liberal markets within member states and assist the establishment of businesses. We should give such issues as much publicity as we can so the citizens of Europe can understand what is happening. It is important that such matters are debated in this House, just as they are in the National Forum on Europe, under the chairmanship of Senator Maurice Hayes, and in the Joint Committee on European Affairs.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">The Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, is able to project such issues further for us. We have to reflect the real needs of the citizens in debates like the great debate we are having today. This is the first time I have learned about the work that was done at the recent meeting of the European Council. I did not know anything about it until this debate started, but now I know a great deal about what is going on in Europe. I would like to be able to speak further about such matters, including the issue of how best we can connect with our citizens.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FergalQuinn" eId="spk_86">
          <from>Mr. Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_211">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, and thank him for expressing in his speech his interest in all the matters which were covered at the recent meeting of the European Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">I am in danger of leading people to believe that I have a thing going for the US Secretary of Labor, Ms Elaine Chao, because I have mentioned her twice in recent weeks. When I met her a couple of weeks ago, I was very impressed to hear her saying that as a member of the US Cabinet, it was her duty, task and objective to establish an environment in which private enterprises can create jobs. I agree entirely with Ms Chao's belief, which is particularly interesting in light of the speech that has just been made by Senator Ormonde and in the context of the Lisbon Agenda, that governments are not responsible for creating jobs but for making sure that private enterprises can do so. There is a danger that Europe does not always recognise those roles and, as a consequence, job creation has not always happened. In that context, the outcome of the recent meeting of the European Council, as reported to the House by the Minister of State, is to be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">I believe that jobs can be created in the competitive marketplace that currently exists, in which other countries are trying to create similar sorts of jobs. If that is to happen, we have to make Ireland more attractive to the relevant companies. As Senator Ormonde has said, small and medium-sized enterprises will create such jobs. I am not sure that I accept Senator Ormonde's assertion that one can open a new company in Ireland in three days. When I spoke recently to a man who employs people throughout the world, he told me there is more red tape involved in starting a company in Ireland than he thought there would be. The authorities in Britain have identified the reduction of red tape as one of their most important tasks.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">I understand that the European Union's energy policy was the central issue to be addressed at last month's meeting of the European Council. I have not seen anything in the statements which emerged from the council that equals, in immediacy or urgency, the report that was published by Forfás yesterday. According to the report, A Baseline Assessment of Ireland's Oil Dependence — Key Policy Considerations:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_215">We in Ireland are more dependent on imported oil for our [transport and] energy requirements than almost every other European country and it will take up to 10 years to significantly reduce this dependence. Therefore, it is essential that we now begin to prepare for such a challenge.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">The Minister of State mentioned that the question of EU energy policy featured prominently in the debate at the Council meeting. This issue is of great importance in Ireland, not only because we are so dependent on oil but also because it will become more risky to depend on oil as time goes by, given the uncertainty about the continued supply of oil. The report mentions that there is "growing evidence to suggest that the era of a plentiful supply of conventional oil is approaching an end". It was interesting to hear a man from the United States, who has written extensively about this matter, being interviewed on this morning's "Today with Pat Kenny". The Forfás report states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_217">Various experts ..... have developed projections for when peak oil will occur. While there is a wide variation of estimates about the likely timing, most expert commentators believe that 10-15 years from now, conventional oil supply will no longer be capable of satisfying world demand at current prices.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">That is probably the most benign scenario that is available to us. Many other scenarios, which are much scarier, are doing the rounds. This is not just an Irish problem — it is found throughout the world — but Ireland is particularly vulnerable to an oil shock, unfortunately. I remember how ill-prepared the western world was for the oil shock of 1973. I cannot say whether a future shock will be caused by high prices or oil shortages, although an oil shortage may lead to high prices. The report states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_219">Taking into account the Irish economy's relative dependence on imported oil and the relative share of oil in total Irish energy consumption, Ireland is among the most sensitive to rising oil prices and therefore among the most vulnerable to a peak oil scenario.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">The vulnerability of Ireland's position is summed up by two key facts. I did not realise I would have an opportunity to speak about this matter today. The Forfás report states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_221">Ireland consumed nine million tonnes of oil in 2004, an amount that has doubled since 1990. In 2002, Ireland ranked 3rd highest among the EU-25 countries in terms of oil consumed per capita. Electricity generation and transportation are the two main factors for Ireland's high oil dependence. Ireland has relied considerably more on oil for electricity generation than most other EU countries and, as of 2002, had the 6th most oil dependent electricity generation system of the EU-25 countries. The amount of oil used for transportation in Ireland tripled between 1972 and 2002, leaving Ireland consuming at least 50 per cent more per capita than the average of the EU-25 by the end of the period.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">I agree with the statement in the report that Ireland urgently needs "a national strategy" to prepare for the challenges which will arise in this regard. I would like to add my voice to that of Forfás in calling for the development of such a strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">The Minister of State has informed the House that the European Council has recognised the importance of energy. We need to identify how urgent a problem it is for Ireland. Any strategy that is developed will have to focus on two key elements, the first of which is the much greater use of renewable sources of energy for electricity generation. Nature has blessed Ireland with ample wind and wave reserves, both of which we seem largely determined to ignore, for some reason. Ireland could become a world leader in the generation of electricity from wind and wave energy, just as it was once a world leader in the generation of electricity from turf and peat. It seems to me that it is utter madness that we are putting ourselves in hock to an expensive and increasingly scarce resource like oil when a cheaper resource is going to waste in the air around us and in the seas around our shores. On a clear day, I can see the seven huge windmills off the coast of County Wicklow from where I live in Howth. I know we have made similar efforts in other parts of the country, but we have a long way to go.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">The second key element of any energy strategy should be the development of fuels other than petrol to run our vehicles. As an agricultural country with an agricultural tradition, nature is working in our favour in this respect. We now have a largely unemployed agricultural community, for one reason or another. As Senator Dardis has mentioned on many occasions, the technology exists to fuel cars from crops grown on an agricultural basis. One such crop is the same sugar beet that we have been wringing our hands about to such a great extent lately. I have spoken previously about the need for us to grow our own petrol. There is no reason in the world why we should not do so as long as we develop the technology, give the commitment and show the determination that is needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">It seems clear to me from the deliberations of the European Council that the EU will not solve this problem for us. It is up to us to come up with the right conclusions and to take the actions which are appropriate for the future of our country. Of the many economic trends which face us in the coming decades, this is definitely one we can do something about with our own efforts. It would be tragic if we were to fail to do so, through a lack of vision or a lack of political will.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">I met a Japanese man a couple of years ago and got to know him quite well. I asked him how he had been so successful when so many others had not. He said: "Whether you believe you can, or whether you believe you cannot, you are right." He said if he went into a tennis game and believed he did not have a chance against his opponent, he was right and did not have a chance. However, if he believed he could win, then he was right as well.</p>

Let us show commitment, get our heads down and believe this is something we can achieve.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnDardis" eId="spk_89">
          <from>Mr. Dardis</from>
          <p eId="para_230">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, to the House. I thank him for the comprehensive synopsis he has given of the EU Council meeting in Brussels. That meeting ranged over quite a number of subjects, and I agree with Senator Ormonde that it is important for the House to debate these matters in plenary session. There is a positive role for the Seanad in that respect; it is good that we review the Council on each occasion it takes place and perhaps even at times anticipate what will take place. I want to acknowledge, too, the occasions when the Minister of State attends meetings of the Joint Committee on European Affairs and gives us the benefit of his wisdom in advance of General Affairs and External Relations Council, GAERC, meetings. I also want to acknowledge the work of the Taoiseach as well as that of Deputy Dermot Ahern, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Deputy Cowen, the Minister for Finance, at the Council meeting. Of course the Austrian Presidency should be congratulated on the success of the event.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">It is not much of a surprise that the bulk of the contribution refers to energy policy. This is a policy area that finds itself in an unusually high position on the political agenda at present. I noticed that Senator Quinn spent much of his time speaking about it. Before turning to energy, however, I intend to focus on the other main topics discussed at the March Council meeting — economic and social outcomes; energy; the EU constitution; and youth employment. I was interested to read of the Council's meeting with the President of the European Central Bank, the European Employers and Trade Union Confederations and the President of the EU Parliament. At a time when social partnership is being scrutinised again at national level in Ireland, it is notable that EU umbrella groups agree that a strong growth and jobs partnership is needed to deal with the many varied economic and social challenges that face the Union. I fear, however, that Mr. Trichet's singling out of Ireland and Denmark, as two countries delivering very similar economic and social success stories, might overshadow his other point that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to Europe's economic challenges.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">His view that different economic and social models can achieve similar success is crucial. The partnership approach has served this country well, as we all know. Much of the basis of this success has been partnership's ability to adapt flexibly to changing conditions. However, in the same way a one-size-fits-all approach is inappropriate for a group of states facing varying challenges, the same partnership approach that served Ireland well in the past might not be the most appropriate model now for other countries. If it were, it would not need to be renegotiated here. We must not pursue social partnership at any cost. For example, the notion of core work, as currently defined, and outsourcing — about which Senator Brian Hayes spoke — could indicate that what went before might not be the right approach in certain sectors now.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">Moving to the issue that dominated the Council proceedings, namely, energy policy, it is no surprise that the challenges identified are those addressed in my party's recent policy discussion document. Agreement may exist on the issues of security of supply, ensuring the continuing competitiveness of Europe's economies and promoting environmental sustainability. However, the question is how best to proceed and that is far from being settled. On a general level I welcome the Council's acceptance that the energy issue is of central importance to Ireland and the future success of our economy. Ireland should participate fully in this debate at EU level, and our contribution on the way forward should reflect not just any national Green Paper, but as much innovative thinking and ideas as emerge.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">Deputy Fiona O'Malley's discussion paper, published last month, deals with the energy issues discussed in terms of an action plan at EU Council level. The Progressive Democrats propose a seven point action plan designed to develop Ireland's renewable energy supplies; protect the environment — thus fulfilling our obligations under the Kyoto Agreement; and secure our fuel supplies and minimise the overall cost of energy to the economy, thus maintaining Ireland's competitiveness. The plan requires that we promote the development of renewable energy for power generation; the use of renewable energy for space and water heating; the production and utilisation of biofuels for transport; energy conservation; fossil fuel exploration, production and supply security; the creation of new market structures and improved regulation; and research and development into energy technologies of particular importance to Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">I urge everyone to read the paper Deputy Fiona O'Malley has produced and engage in this discussion process. Energy policy tops the international agenda for reasons pertinent to all of us. The analogy has been used that Ireland is the last stop on a very long oil pipeline and that our dependency on imported sources cannot continue as it is. That has been underlined in much of the discussion today. I was in Norway last week and it was quite notable that in a country that has its own supply of oil, serious consideration is being given to how it is to move forward in the knowledge that production has peaked. They are looking to the future, already, in a country that has been in a position to export oil.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">On nuclear power generation, I am satisfied that the Council's conclusions make it clear that work on energy at EU level will not affect our national policy to reject this solution in this country. I am encouraged by what the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, had to say about Ireland's position on this matter. Notwithstanding the advice of Forfás yesterday, the Progressive Democrats do not believe that nuclear generation is the correct option for Ireland, and that is the Government's position as well. I am less satisfied with the linking of EU energy policy recognition that decisions on sources of energy remain firmly with the member states and on the required standards for the operation of nuclear plants and the disposal of nuclear waste material. Those two aspects appear to be somewhat in conflict. Some policy decisions should and will remain at national level. However, where the implications of those policies can seriously affect the well-being of another country, exceptions must be made. We have had some concrete examples of that in the recent past, regarding Russia and its neighbours. Sellafield generates waste and radioactive discharges into the Irish Sea. The proposed sale of the British Nuclear Fuels Group, including Sellafield, does not change the fact that the UK Government is both responsible and accountable for the safe operation of that facility. Neither the proposed privatisation nor a new EU energy plan should alter this fact.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">The problematic areas in all of the discussions at the Council focused on the constitution, enlargement and the Lisbon Agenda. I was interested in the Council's view that since the French and Dutch referendums on the European constitution, there has been a particular focus on showing citizens that Europe works on their behalf. We have mentioned the work of the National Forum on Europe under the chairmanship of Senator Maurice Hayes, and that is very valuable. However, we are going to have to be even more proactive. This is essential as regards important issues such as the roaming charges. In other words if citizens can appreciate that the Union is putting money in their pockets rather than taking it out, a different attitude towards Europe will rapidly emerge, and it will also bring the EU much closer to them than anything we might do by way of political campaigning or explanation. Deputy Roche, when he was Minister of State with responsibility for European matters, did a good deal of work in this respect in terms of trying to bring citizens closer to Europe and <i>vice versa</i>. I do not want to denigrate that work. It is important, and I know that the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, is an advocate of it as well. However, there is more to it than that, in terms of trying to convince a sceptical electorate of the need for a constitution and for Europe to go forward as it must.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">In addition to the relaunching of the Lisbon Agenda, and a renewed emphasis on jobs and growth, I wonder what specific moves are under way in Ireland to demonstrate that EU action is indeed rooted in the national, civil and social partnership process. The Lisbon Agenda has been characterised by a great deal of talk both here and at European level. I am not aware of any tangible outcomes to which one can point at this stage to confirm that it has been a success and that the Lisbon Agenda is working.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">Finally, I want to talk about the Council's discussion of youth unemployment. All will, of course, welcome the Council's agreement to work to meet new targets on reducing early school leaving, efforts to ensure that unemployed young people are brought back into the labour force as quickly as possible, and the agreement that by 2010 every unemployed young person should be offered a job within no more than four rather than six months.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">The issue of youth employment brings me back to my first point, that the one-size-fits-all solution does not apply in the context of the Union's social and economic challenges. The House will be aware that in France there have been huge demonstrations — some violent — against a new labour law for the under-26s which will make it easier for businesses to hire and fire young people. The legislation was introduced to get more people in France into work in the face of high unemployment rates and a stagnant labour market. I read an article in the <i>International Herald Tribune</i> last week about a French entrepreneur who had located in Ireland because of the ease of establishing a company where there was far less restrictive regulation and red tape than elsewhere. We talked about the three-day rule which is good to hear about. He is very pleased he came to Ireland, as a result of which people in his home country have lost out in terms of jobs and we have gained.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">The low tax and pro-enterprise model espoused by my party and the Government has helped see employment rise from 1.1 million in 1991 to over 1.9 million in 2005. It is predicted that 2 million people will be employed here by the end of this year. While France faces the challenge of addressing why more than 20% of its 18 to 25 year olds are unemployed, we in Ireland are currently creating more jobs than we can fill. We must ensure that our policy process allows us to stay competitive and foster innovation. As Ireland's economy becomes increasingly knowledge-driven, we must be open to new ideas, new people and new agreements.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">I conclude by congratulating all involved in the March European Council. Citizens in member states need these meetings to exemplify how Europe is working for them. While the Council does seem focused on the issues that are of real concern to people, I would encourage it to work even harder to ensure that all the institutions and facets of the Union that interface with the public are similarly focused.</p>

        <speech by="#PaulBradford" eId="spk_90">
          <from>Mr. Bradford</from>
          <p eId="para_243">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him for his contribution. In the few minutes available to me I wish to make a number of points concerning last week's meeting and refer to some broader issues relating to the European project and how we can ensure the public's full participation in that.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">The Minister of State has come to this House and has attended the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs on many occasions to discuss the central issues of European policy development and its relevance to Ireland and its economy. One of the political difficulties we all face is that of trying to engage the public to the level we would wish. It is disappointing, notwithstanding the important role which the politics of Europe and the European Community plays in our country and its impact on our lives, that we do not have the level of engagement, interest and knowledge we would wish to have.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">The Minister of State may be aware of a proposal, currently being considered, to have a Europe day in the Oireachtas. In the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs we are discussing 10 May as a possible date. I expect the Seanad will play a very full role in it and that we will put a mechanism in place in the Chamber to ensure we will grab the attention of the public. I hope we will use the day well and that it will become an annual event by which we try to impress on the Irish people the importance of the European project to our well-being from a social and economic point of view. I hope the Minister of State's Government colleagues try to ensure that it will be a day where the work of Europe and its impact in Ireland and <i>vice versa</i> will be showcased to the maximum degree. On that day we will focus on the issues which, in effect, stem from the recent Council meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">It is opportune that the energy debate took centre stage at the European Council. All politicians are aware of the importance of energy and the politics of energy supply. Senator Dardis and others have outlined the facts and the figures. It is no exaggeration to state we face an energy crisis in the years to come but solutions are possible if we put on our thinking caps. Obviously the European Union will play an important role. The Government and policymakers must drive the question of energy to a greater degree than at present. We made a small start in the budget by way of minor tax relief but we need to do much more in that regard. Last week the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, announced some new energy grants through Sustainable Energy Ireland. We must look at conservation as well as alternative energy.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">I was interested in what Senator Dardis said about his party's policy document. This is to be welcomed. All parties must play a role in bringing forward new ideas, although the thinking about alternative energy is not new. These technologies are in place. They are not rocket science. We need a combination of grant aid and political encouragement. Europe has a role to play in this regard. It is a frightening thought that from an energy point of view Europe is so dependent on external factors. This is not a new problem. We are now arriving at the same situation in regard to the food supply in Europe because of the policies we have adopted in the past ten or 12 years. We are facing a future in which Europe is not even guaranteed its own food supply within the continent. We will have to reflect on this matter as we debate agriculture and its role, not just in Ireland but in Europe. That is an aside but it is something we should not forget.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">Thinking I had more than six minutes to speak I brought with me a report from the Taoiseach's Department on the national reform programme. It dates from last October, which is the most recent one available. I am disappointed we have not made more progress on the Lisbon Agenda. It is what Europe should be about — improving the economic growth of the Continent as well as the economic and social opportunities of the people of Europe. We should be selling the message that Europe works well, not just politically but economically. The success story of Europe is not just about bringing peace to a previously war-torn Continent, it has been about developing economies and opportunities and opening up the Union to new people and new countries. The Lisbon Agenda is at the very core of that. We must try to keep it very much at the top of our political agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">Most of our constituents have little knowledge of the Lisbon Agenda. I do not think it is a question of them having little interest, it is more a case of little knowledge. We all have a political task in hand to try to sell that message and keep the Lisbon Agenda to the forefront of policy. In the recent Council meeting the Taoiseach and his colleagues discussed the knowledge economy, the development of small and medium-sized businesses and opportunities for young people, which are so important.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">Senator Dardis and others referred to the problems in France last week. The irony is that in other countries where perhaps there has been a greater willingness to be flexible, look at different economic models and put in place greater incentives, jobs have been created to a greater degree. All of that debate must come to the fore.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">I look forward to more of these debates. I hope that our Europe day gives us the opportunity to sell this message and take the debate to the widest possible number of people.</p>

          <from>Mr. Mooney</from>
          <p eId="para_254">I appreciate that and thank the Cathaoirleach. The Taoiseach in reporting on the activities of the European Council, highlighted the Lisbon project and also the energy issue which increasingly is beginning to dominate the lives of European citizens. It is a timely contribution from the Irish Government, especially in light of the recent statistics showing that Ireland is probably the most vulnerable of EU member states regarding security of future fuel and oil supplies. In that context I hope that following on the Taoiseach's statement and on Ireland's commitment to improved energy efficiency, there will be a detailed rolling out over the coming months of alternative fuel sources and the financial support they will require.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">I am sure Members on all sides of the House are impressed by the commitment of the Swedish Government in predicting that it will have an oil-free economy by the year 2020. Some cynics have laughed at this proposal but the Swedes have a very efficient economy. I have no doubt that if they have made that commitment they will strive vary hard to achieve it. Ireland should not lag too far behind in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">It is interesting and instructive to recall that when the then Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, committed Ireland to adhere to the Kyoto Agreement on the reduction of environmental pollution by fuel and industry, it seemed to be a more innocent era. In the past ten years, the car population has almost doubled as has the working population and housing infrastructure has hit the stratosphere. The country's population is estimated to be between 4 million and 4.2 million. The environment is under enormous strain as is the Government's capacity to provide the necessary engine to continue to fuel the economic growth being enjoyed.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">I am a firm supporter of alternative energy sources and this is a time for innovative ideas in this regard. I hope the Government will address the very real challenge facing the country and future generations if economic growth is to be sustained. This is necessary to provide a successful economy but also a society that is acceptable and without doing harm to our quality of life.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">A recent Forfás report suggested that in the long term, we may be forced to consider the nuclear option for providing energy. The Taoiseach ruled this out completely in his report to the Dáil on the European Council. I have always believed that politicians should never say "never" because it usually comes back to bite one in the hand. While I am not suggesting that nuclear power should be introduced into this country, if there was not a problem regarding the disposal of the waste, nuclear power would be the most efficient form of energy. I appreciate that we may not have achieved sufficient critical mass to justify a nuclear power station. I hope the Forfás report would not be buried and that the debate on Ireland's future energy needs and the need to become more self-sufficient will be continued.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">The Taoiseach also referred to other areas of importance such as youth unemployment and state aid. The question of aid to industry is critical to our continuing economic success. I welcome the fact that the Taoiseach deplored the recent presidential election in Belarus. As a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs I regard it as important that Ireland's policy is that President Lukashenko's activities are unacceptable in any civilised society.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">The Taoiseach also referred in his report to the outcome of the referenda in France and Holland. He is of the view that this country should continue to support the European constitution. While it is not for me as a mere Seanad backbencher to question the Government's high policy, as a result of my experiences in Europe, I am aware there is a vibrant, energetic debate about the future of Europe being carried on in Europe. Senator Bradford is a member of the Council of Europe and may concur with me. I do believe that an unequivocal or unambiguous acceptance of the European constitution in its present form, as has been discredited by the electorate in France and Holland, is necessarily in the best interests of this country. There is a need for a debate on how the Europe of the future is to be shaped.</p>

          <from>Dr. M. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_261">I thank the Minister of State for his references to the forum and to me personally, for which I am very grateful.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">The youth forum held in Dublin and Cork was very successful and it will be held shortly in Galway. A very successful schools competition was held for transition year students and it was attended by the Minister for Education and Science last Monday. On the previous Monday the forum heard submissions.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">The forum does not claim any monopoly on this discussion as the more widespread the discussion is and the more bodies involved, the better and this is acknowledged by the Minister of State.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">What I say in the rest of my contribution has nothing to do with the forum and it will not take any responsibility for it. In my opinion we should not be so categorical and dismissive of nuclear energy forever and a day. It could well be less environmentally destructive than the continued use of fossil fuels, particularly with regard to global warming. Countries like France seem to manage quite well by having a sizeable amount of nuclear production. We should be pressing for cleaner nuclear energy. Whether or not we dismiss nuclear energy, but in particular if we do, we need to invest far more effort into the provision of alternatives such as wind and wave energy and biomass. There is now the possibility of producing diesel oil from rapeseed and a whole series of crops. With regard to the potential of producing energy from wind and wave, a good North-South project would be to harness the tidal race in Strangford Lough, near to my home, which produces a tide of four to eight knots, twice a day. This has been crying out for years to be harnessed as an energy source.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">I commend the Taoiseach on raising the matter of roaming charges for cell phones. Senator McHugh and I are the people in this House who are most affected. Every time I leave Newry it costs me a fortune. It is very difficult for people who must cross the Border.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">I look forward to the amended services directorate. It has established the role of the Parliament in a way that was envisaged in the constitution, which is positive. Commissioner McCreevy has told the forum to have an opt-out as a sort of workable document. I hope that can be a template for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">I wish the Minister of State well in his discussions with the states due for accession under the next round of enlargement. I congratulate him, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach on the effort that has been put into this issue and the general competence with which they represent Ireland's interests, and their concern for a wider European vision.</p>

        <speech by="#DonLydon" eId="spk_95">
          <from>Mr. Lydon</from>
          <p eId="para_268">The Council adopted comprehensive conclusions on a new energy policy for Europe. The Taoiseach stated that the president of the European Central Bank, Mr. Jean-Claude Trichet, had pointed out that differing economic and social models are capable of achieving similar results. The Council's conclusions on energy policy focused on three main objectives, namely, security of supply, ensuring continuing competitiveness and promoting economic sustainability. The Government will publish a Green Paper on energy in the coming months and the spring Council next year will prioritise an action plan on the objectives of the energy policy. One of the results of the Council meeting is an improved EU-Russia dialogue to make energy policy more effective in the context of developing an interconnection action plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">The Taoiseach reiterated that Ireland rejects the use of nuclear power, which is in keeping with the wishes of most of our people. He also pointed out that our small market is not necessarily attractive to major energy companies and we have difficulties in mobilising private sector investment for energy. However, we have agreed in principle to build interconnectors between Ireland and Britain, which will open up the route to the European grid, and we have strong support for proposals on renewable energy. Energy policy cuts across environment, climate change, transport, regional, research and development and external relations policies. The relevant Minister has recently promised grants for conservation of energy, particularly with regard to solar power, which is to be commended as a positive step forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">The Taoiseach in his discussions with the Austrian Presidency referred to several national programmes that are in keeping with the Lisbon Agenda, including Science Foundation Ireland's centre for science, engineering and technology and the Skillnets and One Step Up programmes to equip our labour force. One of the major developments which Ireland has managed to latch onto and which has helped our economy to develop so strongly is investment in education and training. If we continue with this policy, we will be in line with the Lisbon Agenda in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">Senators Ormonde and Quinn referred to the issue of jobs and the issue of being able to set up a company in Ireland within a week. I am sure it can be achieved in three days, although this is disputed by Senator Quinn. The Council agreed that by 2010 all unemployed young persons should be offered a job, apprenticeship, additional training or another measure within no more than four months. We are doing well in this regard as the national practice is to do so within six months, and our achievement of many other targets is ahead of other countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">The Joint Committee on European Affairs met this morning with an Icelandic delegation. As many delegations have done, they questioned us on issues such as tax harmonisation, immigration and so on. The committee told the delegation that the Government objective was not to limit migration because immigrants were helping the country. It was accepted that there were problems with this policy but that we were coping with them. We also told the delegation that we would not agree to tax harmonisation because we are doing well out of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">The Council meeting was comprehensive and useful, particularly with regard to energy issues. I wish the Taoiseach and his Ministers well.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Treacy)</from>
          <p eId="para_274">I thank the Senators for their diverse and focused contributions on this important aspect of European affairs, particularly the analysis of the Council of Europe meeting. As I indicated in my opening statement, this European Council demonstrated again that the European Union can respond effectively to the needs and aspirations of our citizens. The Heads of State and Government have advanced the Lisbon Agenda for growth and jobs, adopted comprehensive conclusions on a new energy policy for Europe and respected fully the prerogatives of member states as they seek to achieve closer co-operation on the challenges facing us.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">The Taoiseach noted that discussions on energy were very much a first step in what promises to be a long and complex process, a fact to which a number of Senators alluded. Given its importance for lreland, we will be participating actively in the EU debate and tabling our own contribution on the way forward. The Government will publish a national Green Paper on energy in the coming months.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">At EU level, the future development of the energy policy for Europe will be taken forward through an annual strategic energy review which the Commission will present on an annual basis beginning next year. In addition, the spring European Council next year will aim to adopt a prioritised action plan which will support the achievement of the objectives of the energy policy. In the short term, the EU will pay particular attention to driving forward an action plan on energy efficiency, implementing the biomass action plan, developing an interconnection action plan and making the EU-Russia dialogue more effective. This is important for all of Europe, including Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">The Commission has been asked to submit a priority interconnection plan by the end of 2006. Such a plan is very much in keeping with the importance of interconnection to our national energy supply. There is agreement in principle to the building of a second North-South interconnector and the technical aspects of this are being examined. The Government has agreed in principle to building an interconnector between Ireland and Britain. This would link us to the UK grid and ultimately to the European grid. The Commission on Energy Regulation has submitted its report to the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, who will make a recommendation to Government shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">In the ongoing discussions on a future energy policy for Europe, lreland has raised questions about how the Commission sees the major investment projects in networks and storage facilities being delivered and funded. We have offered strong support for proposals around renewable energy, energy efficiency and increased funding for research and development. On renewable energies, the European Council agreed to consider in the future some new targets on the share of renewable energies of the overall energy mix and a target on biofuels. These would also contribute to the fight against climate change while also reducing the EU's dependence on energy imports.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">Issues such as energy diversification, interconnection, storage, security of supply and greater exploitation of indigenous resources are all of crucial importance to Ireland. Energy policy cuts across environment, climate change, transport, regional, research and development and external relations policies. The future development of our national policy approach will, therefore, be based on strong coherence at the national and EU level between energy and other key policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">I repeat that there is no basis whatsoever for doubting the strong opposition of the Taoiseach and the Government to nuclear energy, although some of the personal contributions by Senators showed a more liberal attitude to consideration of that energy source. The Taoiseach made this clear at the European Council and subsequently. It is also the case that construction of a nuclear generating facility would require a change in primary legislation, the Electricity Regulation Act 1999, which the Oireachtas would have to approve. Section 18(6) of that Act states that "an order under this section shall not provide for the use of nuclear fission for the generation of electricity". The Government's position on nuclear energy should be clear to everyone.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">We are currently considering carefully the Commission's revised text on the services directive. As I indicated, the Government is committed to the need for a balanced services directive which combines the benefits of a more liberalised market in services with respect for the rights and interests of workers. We envisage no race to the bottom.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">As regards research and development, the Presidency conclusions record Ireland's target of 2.5% of GNP by 2013. This is realistic and achievable. Ireland has recorded significant growth in research and development expenditure by the public and private sectors in recent years. However, because of the high level of growth by the economy in overall terms, this large increase in expenditure has been reflected in only a modest statistical increase when expressed as a percentage of GNP.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">It is entirely appropriate for lreland to express our investment in research and development as a percentage of GNP, rather than GDP, in view of the distorting effect of multinational companies here on our economic statistics. This provides a better basis for comparison with investment in other member states and the European Commission has been advised, and has not objected, to our use of GNP for this purpose. Our investment target and date were set out in the Government's national reform programme for implementing the Lisbon strategy which was placed before the Houses of the Oireachtas in October last year. On this matter, it will be noted that Science Foundation Ireland's centres for science, engineering and technology programme is highlighted by the European Commission as an exemplary national project, a fact to which a number of Senators have referred.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">I sincerely thank all the Senators who contributed. It is important to have an opportunity to reflect on the various highest levels of discussions at European level where the Heads of Government and State sit down together and make decisions that will have a major impact on the medium and long-term future of the Union. As Members of Parliament it is important we have an opportunity in this House to discuss those, to ensure our citizens are fully aware of the decisions that have been taken and that we communicate them to the people in a positive manner on a consistent basis. I sincerely thank all the Senators in this respect and look forward to meeting them again soon.</p>

          <p eId="para_289">—deeply concerned at the fact that, in spite of this situation, many of our young people are leaving school without any reasonable command of the Irish language;</p>
          <p eId="para_290">—acknowledging the findings of the 2003 NCCA discussion document, Languages in the Post-Primary Curriculum, which stated that our syllabi and examinations retain an emphasis on reading and writing at the expense of listening and speaking;</p>
          <p eId="para_291">calls on the Government to:</p>
          <p eId="para_292">—reform radically the curriculum for Irish in second-level education, focusing on the teaching of Irish as a living language of modern and useful communication;</p>
          <p eId="para_293">—introduce an oral examination at junior certificate immediately and devise a new subject for the leaving certificate, Communicating in Irish, which would focus to a large extent on spoken Irish;</p>
          <p eId="para_294">—allow all post-junior certificate students a choice as to whether to take Irish to leaving certificate level; and</p>
          <p eId="para_295">—devise a new national strategy for Irish which sets out very clearly what the Government wants to achieve for the Irish language, what will be done to support this goal, and what is expected from agencies and other partners in meeting the challenges that lie ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire, agus molaim an rún atá os comhair an tSeanaid. I Samhain na bliana seo caite  ag cruinniú a bhí eagraithe aige, dúirt ceannaire Fhine Gael, an Teachta Kenny, gur mhaith leis díospóireacht a thosnú ar cheist na Gaeilge, agus sin an fáth go bhfuil an rún seo os ár gcomhair inniu.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">I welcome the Minister of State to the House to take this important motion. It will start the debate on this issue in this House. It is only right that we have an opportunity to contribute to the debate on teaching our native Irish language as a living language. Unfortunately, during the years there has been a decline in its use. Despite the many efforts that have been made by various Governments and Ministers during the years, it is unfortunate that much of what was intended in respect of it was never implemented. At a time when most other countries are conscious of the significance of their native language and heritage, it is important that we would indicate our commitment to our native language.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">The recognition of Irish as an official European language two or three years ago was an important step. When Deputy Kenny made a statement last November on the Irish language and what he had envisaged for it, he did so in the context of being a Gaelic speaker. Furthermore, from the perspective of having being a teacher, he recognised the fact that there was a steady decline in the use of the Irish language and that many people were leaving second level school having received 1,500 hours tuition without any great proficiency in the Irish language or an ability to communicate in Irish. Anybody who fails to accept the fact that there is something wrong in the way we are teaching the Irish language is hiding behind a smokescreen and, unfortunately, that is the position in the case of many people.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">In the context of the Government's amendment, the Minister for Education and Science will recognise exactly what the leader of the Fine Gael Party was trying to achieve in initiating debate on this issue. The Government's amendment states: "further acknowledges that the Minister for Education and Science has made very clear her intention to reform how Irish is taught". The intention to reform the position is the basis of everything that has been said in the debate on this issue. However, how many previous Ministers have made a similar statement and literally not done anything? In this instance, the Fine Gael proposal is to do something that will be acceptable not necessarily as a major sop to Gaeilgeoirí alone but that will give young people an opportunity to learn Irish because they want to do so rather than because they are forced to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">My party leader's proposal is that students would have to take Irish up to junior certificate and thereafter they would have a choice in that respect. The Department has indicated that Irish is compulsory in the same way as, in some instances, are English and mathematics. However, at least in respect of those latter two subjects there is a choice, but in the case of Irish there is none.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">As a teacher I saw at first hand that many students who took Irish went through the process of being physically present in the class and doing what they were asked to do but thousands of them went into the leaving certificate Irish examination and left after the statutory requirement of remaining at the desk for 30 minutes. I have often supervised leaving certificate examinations and observed that in the case of the Irish examination, the minute the clock ticks the half hour after the official starting time students have left one after the other except those who were committed. It was in the spirit of recognising that something must be done that Deputy Kenny initiated the debate on this issue. It does not do the cause of the Irish language any good to misrepresent his statements, as certain people have done.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">I want to put the position on the Irish language into perspective. Students taking Irish who commence at primary level and complete the leaving certificate receive 1,500 hours tuition at a cost to the state of €500 million. Comparing that with the position of students who take another European language such as French, the number of students who take honours French at leaving certificate and achieve at that level is far greater than those who take honours Irish. The most important part of this is that they are achieving a higher standard in French, as a foreign language, as opposed to what is happening with Irish.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">The Minister of State is eager to get up and I ask for the protection of the Cathaoirleach.</p>

          <from>Mr. U. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_306">The statistics are there to prove that the greater number of people achieve higher standards in higher level French or other modern languages than they do in Irish, our own native language. Therefore something is wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">The proposals of Fine Gael are that we would, first, give far greater resources at primary level and improve the facilities for teacher training at that level. Good work has been done by the gaelscoileanna throughout the country and we should acknowledge that fact. On Monday evening I was in a Gaeltacht area and I spoke with a teacher. He stated that he was teaching subjects to honours leaving certificate standard trí Gaeilge, and there are no official textbooks which he can use. Something is wrong in such a case.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">Many people remember just a few years ago a company being established in a Gaeltacht area to provide textbooks as Ghaeilge, perhaps translating books that were being used at secondary and primary level. That company was not supported by Údarás na Gaeltachta by way of any deontas a raibh le fáil. That was wrong, and it was the first indication of the failure of the Government to respond to a need that was there to support the Irish language. We must address the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">The 2002 census demonstrates the decline in the numbers of the people using Irish as their primary language on a daily basis. There was a decline of 4%, even within the Gaeltacht areas. That must be a warning light to all concerned about the Irish language. That is the reality of the census, and the commissioner himself drew attention to it.</p>

          <from>Mr. U. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_312">The Minister of State can contradict the numbers for as long as he wants, but I do not think the census statistics lie.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">It is important to note the three real ideas that Deputy Kenny is looking to have in place, namely, reform, renewal and revival. Anybody misinterpreting them and stating otherwise is wrong. The idea of revival is important. Deputy Kenny proposed that after the junior certificate, people who wished to take Irish as a subject would have a choice. They could take a subject called communicating in Irish, where there would be an emphasis on the spoken language, and 50% of the marks in the subject would be awarded for a comhrá examination. Others, who would really have a love of the language and wished to learn of the heritage and literature of the Irish language, could take a subject tailored to that effect. These people could specialise in such a way.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">It is possible to make Irish a living language if we have people speaking the language. Why can this be done in other areas but it cannot be done with our own language? This debate is worthy of attention. In a recent MRBI poll, 62% of the population agreed with the elimination of the compulsion to do Irish to leaving certificate level. It should be there as a choice, and people should be given the opportunity to learn the language for the love of it rather than being compelled to do so.</p>

          <p eId="para_325">—believes that these measures are important in raising the esteem in which the language is held in society in general, something which naturally has an effect on students' interest in learning Irish;</p>
          <p eId="para_326">—notes that in the 2002 census, 140,000 more people classified themselves as Irish speakers than had been the case in the 1996 census, with significant growth in the number of people outside the Gaeltacht who speak Irish;</p>
          <p eId="para_327">—further notes that this year, for the first time, there is a gaelscoil in every county in the country, a development which is reflective of an increased desire among parents to educate their children through Irish;</p>

          <p eId="para_329">—further acknowledges that the Minister for Education and Science has made very clear her intention to reform how Irish is taught at senior cycle level in particular and has asked the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment to make proposals for curriculum change to her as a matter of priority, and for these proposals to include greater emphasis on the spoken language; and</p>
          <p eId="para_330">—believes that all parties should support reform of how Irish is taught in our schools rather than jeopardising the future of the language by calling for its status in our education system to be downgraded."</p>

I always admire Senators who come into this House and make an effort to speak Irish. While I may not have the blas myself and am not good at speaking Irish, I wish to have my cúpla focail on the record because of my interest in the revival of the Irish language.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">The wording on the proposed amendment is self-explanatory. Irish is recognised in the Constitution as the national language, and the Government is clearly committed to promoting it.

          <p eId="para_337">The Irish language for too long suffered a lack of commitment from successive Governments. Every side of the House has been guilty on that front. Nobody should act like a "Mr. Clean" in discussing how the language was treated in the past. Under this Administration, the language is undergoing a revival, as the facts show.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">This is not to say we cannot do better. Many young people are still leaving school unable to converse through Irish. It is a sad reality that this Government is determined to tackle. Shortly after the Minister for Education and Science took up her post, she highlighted this as an issue for prioritisation. She stated her view that 50% of the marks in leaving certificate Irish should be for the oral examinations. I was interested to see this proposal recycled some time ago by the Opposition.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">The syllabus for Irish at post-primary level is also built on the communicative approach, and it will have an integrated approach to develop the four language skills of speaking, listening, reading and writing. In every aspect of language learning — teacher training, curriculum, textbook, teaching methods and aids, support services and inspection systems for examinations — there should be an urgent and impartial review of the learning and teaching of Irish.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">Irish should be taught in schools in a way that is interesting and relevant, and which will promote a positive attitude among our young people. I am very much against the proposal in front of us to abandon compulsory Irish after the junior certificate examination.</p>

          <from>Ms Ormonde</from>
          <p eId="para_342">I will not under any circumstances agree to the suggestion that Irish not be compulsory at post-junior certificate level. It is important to realise that the promotion of the Irish language cannot be advanced by schools alone, and that societal attitudes to the language also impact on students' desire to learn it. The Opposition stated that there was something wrong when we achieve a higher leaving certificate points total in French and German than we do in Irish. The problem is attitudinal, rather than a lack of commitment. With commitment to the methods of reviving a language there is no question of not being able to raise the standard of Irish at the leaving certificate, higher level paper.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">I hope Senator Ulick Burke's party gives its full support to the reform efforts under way, rather than proposing to abandon compulsory Irish after junior certificate level. Given the centrality of our language to our culture and identity as a nation I hope Senators opposite will put party political difference aside and work with us to ensure the future of the Irish language is a bright one.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">I sincerely hope young people enjoy learning Irish as a result of the reforms to be put in place, which are in line with the Minister's commitment to bring about a continual increase in the number of people speaking Irish on a daily basis.</p>

          <p eId="para_349">Ar an lá deireannach, bhíos ag éisteacht leis an díospóireacht sa Teach eile mar gheall ar ráitis i nGaoluinn, agus ní dóigh liom gur chualas aon ráiteas a bhí chomh holc sin ó aon Aire Gaeltachta le blianta anuas. Ní raibh fiú féin script aige. Ní raibh moltaí aige, agus bhí daoine den scoth from the Opposition os a chomhair amach, daoine ar nós an Teachta O'Dowd, an Teachta Joe Higgins agus an Teachta O'Shea; daoine a bhfuil suim acu sa Ghaoluinn agus a bhí in ann í a phlé. Níor chuala mé díospóireacht ariamh a bhí chomh holc leis an méid a bhíá rá ag an Aire.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">Tá mé ag féachaint anseo ar Department of the Taoiseach: Action Programme for the Millennium. I congratulate Senator Ormonde on a spirited defence of her Government, since that is what she is there to do. Caithfidh mé a rá nach n-aontóinn léi i ngach rud a dúirt sí, áfach. Cuirfear plean náisiúnta don réamhscolaíocht agus don Ghaelscolaíocht le chéile. That has not been done. Cuirfear coiste náisiúnta comhordaithe ar bun. That has been done. The last thing that I wish to talk about is: cuirfear lár-ionad acmhainní ar bun chun áiseanna cearta oideachasúla a chur ar fáil le haghaidh fhoghlaimeoirí na teanga. Níor deineadh é sin. I 1999, nuair a bhí an Teachta Ó Máirtín ina Aire Oideachais agus Eolaíochta, mhol sé don Rialtas go mbeadh lár-ionad oideachas Gaoluinne náisiúnta lonnaithe i mBaile Bhúirne i gContae Chorcaí. That was the proposal, straight and simple. Ghlac an Rialtas lena mholadh, agus chuireadar airgead ar fáil an bhliain sin ó the capital programme. Níor tharla aon rud, agus níl fhios agam cén fáth.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">Ina dhiaidh sin, tháinig an Teachta Woods isteach mar Aire. Chuaigh sé go Baile Bhúirne le chéile le hArd-Rúnaí na Roinne Oideachais agus Eolaíochta, agus chas sé an fód ar an rud seo. Níor tharla aon rud ina dhiaidh sin. The next Minister was Deputy Dempsey. Bhí sé go mór i bhfabhar chomh maith. Nothing happened. Anois, tá an tAire, an Teachta Hanafin, politician of the year, i bhfeighil an ruda seo. Tá an-jab á dhéanamh aici, agus tá mé cinnte go bhfuil sí báúil don teanga, something that I would not take from her, ach níor tharla aon rud.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">The Opposition may have differing opinions on the points made by Senator Burke, but he has pointed out flaws in the system. Dhá scór bliain ó shin, agus mé ag freastal ar scoil na mBráithre Críostaí i nDaingean Uí Chúis, as it is correctly called, An Daingean as the Minister calls it, or Dingle Uí Chúis, as others call it, bhíos ag foghlaim mo chuid Laidine trí Ghaoluinn as téacsleabhar Béarla. It was natural and normal at the time, and we did not pay much attention to it, but it is utterly unacceptable that 40 years later the same thing is still happening. I will say this in English lest there be any doubt among those listening. My colleagues in the Gaeltacht who teach in primary schools — the same happens in post-primary schools — have been crying out for an Irish textbook of the standard that those in the rest of the country would expect of an English textbook. No aspect of the geography curriculum in primary or post-primary schools is available i nGaoluinn.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">There are other examples. The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs is more interested in picking a fight with the people of the Gaeltacht by taking away their right to determine the names of where they live than what children learn in school. He is far more interested in what is written on a signpost or in ensuring that the NRA and other semi-State companies unnecessarily spend huge amounts producing hard copies of glossy, pictorial versions of their annual reports, a total waste of money. In the meantime, what was proposed for Baile Bhúirne would have produced, from day one, téacsanna agus leathanaigh Idirlíne as Gaoluinn and all sorts of information technology material trí Ghaoluinn to be used on the day by schools around the country looking for such texts.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">People correctly stress the importance of gaelscoileanna and have lauded their achievements, but I visited every Gaeltacht school in west Kerry and in south Connemara a couple of years ago and did not find one classroom where every child had Gaoluinn ón chliabhán. In every class, there were a few. I was in foinse na Gaoluinne, i nDún Chaoin, agus bhí leanaí sa scoil sin, naíonáin shóisear a bhí tagtha ó Londain, ón Spáinn agus ón Ghearmáin, but those teachers are still trying to inculcate the Irish language without the support of textbooks, and that is completely and utterly wrong. The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs should be taken to the real world, where such things are necessities.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">The Fine Gael argument is correct, even if it does not mean that the contents of the Fianna Fáil amendment are untrue. The things that it leaves out are the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">Why have we not established the centre in Baile Bhúirne? People are opposed to it, but in the past week I have spoken to Údarás na Gaeltachta, and it is favour. I have spoken to An Roinn Gnóthaí Tuaithe, Pobail agus Gaeltachta, and it is in favour, as is Foras na Gaeilge. All the main players are in favour. The Department of Education and Science is in ainm a bheith i bhfabhar. Cén fáth nach bhfuil sé tarlaithe? It is because somebody is blocking it somewhere, perhaps because it is too far from Dublin.</p>

          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_358">How can people in the Gaeltacht run their own affairs? We have spent 80 years ordering them around from Dublin. This centre must be established in the Gaeltacht ionas go mbeadh beocht ann i measc mhuintir na Gaeltachta, i measc mhuintir na Gaoluinne, agus go mbeadh siad ag cur na dtéacsanna agus gach rud eile ar fáil atá ag teastáil ó na scoileanna tríd an tír.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">Is mise an t-aon duine sa Teach seo ón nGaeltacht. Every time that I go home, people tell me of their problems. I do not know why there is not a Gaeltacht uprising over the way that they have been treated over the years. The smart comments about Gaeltacht grants are not what they need. They need to be able to live their lives trí Ghaoluinn. In terms of education, that means réamhscolaíocht, primary education, an dara léibhéal, an tríú léibhéal, ollscolaíocht and adult education trí Ghaoluinn. That is what this centre can do. There are other groups that can do things. I spoke to An Coiste um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscolaíochta last night, with which I have had some differences of opinion in recent times. However, they are doing a good job, and I will not take that away from them.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">In Baile Bhúirne, we had something that would deal with Gaoluinn across the whole island at every level of education and provide things that would immediately be used for teaching and learning Irish. If we do nothing else, we must railroad whoever is blocking this and deal with the issue. More importantly, the Minister should tell us who is blocking it, why it has not happened hitherto, and where the problem lies. We must show support for schools and education. In that sense, we might differ with aspects of what Fine Gael is doing tonight, but the bunphrionsabal is absolutely fundamental.</p>

          <p eId="para_361">Tá fáilte roimh an Aire chuig an díospóireacht seo. I ndáiríre, is maith an rud é go bhfuil sí ag tarlú, mar cruthaíonn sé sin go bhfuil an Ghaeilge beo agus go bhfuil grá againn uilig don teanga. Táimid ag iarraidh comhoibriú le chéile le cinntiú go mbeidh feabhas ar stádas na Gaeilge, ní amháin sa chóras oideachais ach sa timpeallacht freisin. Caithfidh an trí rud dul le chéile, an córas oideachais, an scolaíocht agus an timpeallacht. Má fhéachtar siar ar stair na Gaeilge, feicfear go bhfuil sárobair déanta le blianta fada ag na scoileanna. Ba é ceann de na deacrachtaí a bhí ann i gcónaí náé seo. Is cuma cén cumas Gaeilge a bhí ag daoine, nuair a chuadar lasmuigh den scoil sa Ghalltacht, ní raibh an Ghaeilge á húsáid. Mar sin, níor fhéach na scoláirí ar an Ghaeilge mar rud a bhí tábhachtach ann féin agus a bhíáúsáid go nua-aimseartha i measc an phobail.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">Tá sé suimiúil i ndáiríre go bhfuil feabhas tagtha ar an timpeallacht anois. Ní dóigh liom go bhféadfadh éinne a rá nach bhfuil sárjab déanta ag TG4. Bím ag caint le daoine.</p>

          <p eId="para_368">Sheasadar an fód, agus chruthaíodar go raibh féin-mhuinín againn agus go raibh sé ar ár gcumas rud a dhéanamh ar cheap an-chuid daoine nach raibh sé indéanta. Tá sé déanta anois, agus níl aon amhras faoi ach go bhfuil sé sin ag cabhrú go mór linn ó thaobh chur chun cinn na Gaeilge de, agus tugann sé sin dóchas dúinn.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">Tá gaelscoil anois i ngach uile chontae sa tír seo. Ní amháin go bhfuil siad ag dul i bhfeabhas, ach tá daoine ag feitheamh le fáil isteach sna gaelscoileanna, mar tá sé faiseanta an Ghaeilge a bheith ag duine. Tá sé soiléir go bhfuil ardchaighdeán oideachais ar fáil, ach tá focal eile thar a bheith tábhachtach ó thaobh na Gaeilge de. Táéiteas sna scoileanna sin atá ag teastáil ó na tuismitheoirí. Sin bua eile, chomh maith le TG4, ach tá bua eile fós ag dul leis na gaelscoileanna. Lasmuigh, tá na tuismitheoirí ceangailte leis an oideachas sin. Bíonn siad ag cabhrú leis na scoileanna. Bíonn siad istigh ansin ag iarraidh coiste a chur le chéile chun feabhas a chur ar na scoileanna. Is rí-annamh anois go mbíonn sé sin le feiscint, agus beidh na gaelscoileanna ag méadú chuile lá.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">Tharla rud stairiúil sa Seomra seo anuraidh nuair a d'éirigh linn rún a chur le chéile ar son na Gaeilge ar ghlac gach páirtí anseo leis. Bhíomar ag troid chun stádas oifigiúil oibre a bhaint amach don Ghaeilge san Eoraip, ach d'aontaíomar le chéile anseo. Nuair a bhí an Bille teanga á phlé, is beag cur ina choinne a bhí anseo. Is é an tAcht teanga an dul chun cinn a chruthaíonn go bhfuilimid dáiríre faoin Ghaeilge agus go bhfuil sé i gceist againn an timpeallacht a ghaelú trí seirbhísí a chur ar fáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">Ar chreid éinne 20 nó deich mbliana ó shin go mbeadh stádas oifigiúil ag an Ghaeilge i gComhphobal na hEorpa? Ní dóigh liom gur chreid. Bhí coiste ann, áfach, agus molaim Conradh na Gaeilge, Foras na Gaeilge, agus Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge, a tháinig le chéile. Cérbh iad na daoine a bhí amuigh ar na sráideanna sa léirsiú? Níor sheandaoine iad ach daoine óga a bhí ag lorg cearta don Ghaeilge. Chuireadar brú iontach ar gach éinne le cinntú go mbeadh stádas oifigiúil oibre ag an Ghaeilge san Eoraip, rud atá againn anois. Más rud é go bhfuilimid ag caint ar dhul chun cinn sa timpeallacht, tá an-dul chun cinn ann.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">Ní hionann é sin agus a rá nach féidir linn feabhas a chur ar stádas na Gaeilge sa chóras oideachais, agus ba chóir dúinn taighde a dhéanamh air sin. Tugaim faoi deara go bhfuil geallúint tugtha ag an Aire go bhfuil sé i gceist aige taighde a dhéanamh agus béim i bhfad níos mó a chur ar chumas cainte. Ba mhaith liom an méid seo a rá, áfach. Ní ghlacaim leis gur easpa chumas cainte an fhadhb is mó ach easpa muiníne. Is minic a bhíonn bunchloch na Gaeilge ag daoine, an foclóir agus an ghramadach, ach tá easpa muiníne acu. Cad ina thaobh go bhfuil easpa muiníne ann? Táimid ag caint anseo faoi fhéinmhuinín mar náisiún, an rud is tábhachtaí. Seo ár dteanga féin, an teanga náisiúnta. Tá litríocht shaibhir sa Ghaeilge sin.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">Ag am a bhfuil gach náisiún ar domhan ag iarraidh cinntiú go mbeidh an fhéiniúlacht náisiúnta chun tosaigh, an Ghearmáin, an Fhrainc agus gach tír eile, tá sé tábhachtach dúinne díreach an rud céanna a dhéanamh agus ár bhféiniúlacht náisiúnta a chosaint. Caithfimid rud amháin a sheachaint, áfach, a bhaineann le cuid de na deacrachtaí a bhí againn go dtí seo, agus is é sin dearcadh diúltach. Caithfimid a bheith cúramach nach dtagann an dearcadh diúltach i bhfeidhm orainn go hiomlán. Nuair a bhíonn an dearcadh sin ann, tá sé cinnte nach féidir rud dearfach a dhéanamh, mar beimid diúltach faoin teanga.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">Is cuma cad a thagann as an díospóireacht seo. Ní dóigh liom go mbaineann tábhacht ró-mhor le haon vóta a bheidh anseo, slí amháin nó slí eile, anocht. Tá rud amháin tábhachtach, áfach, agus is é sin go leanaimid ar aghaidh aontaithe. D'fhéadfaimis treoir a thabhairt don náisiún, agus is féidir linn anois glacadh leis an dearcadh dearfach atá i measc an phobail ó thaobh na Gaeilge de. I ngach uile shuirbhé a rinneadh do dtí seo, bhí sé soiléir go raibh feabhas ag teacht ar an scéal. Tá níos mó daoine ag labhairt na Gaeilge agus ina fabhar. Tá níos mó tuismitheoirí i bhfabhar stádas ceart a thabhairt don Ghaeilge sa chóras oideachais. Tá súil agam, nuair a bheidh an díospóireacht seo thart, is cuma cad a thagann aisti, go mbeidh muidinne in ann leanúint ar aghaidh ag cabhrú agus comhoibriú le chéile agus nach mbeidh aon dearcadh diúltach ag dul amach as an Teach seo.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_130">
          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_375">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire. Tá mé an-drochbhéasach faoi sin, agus is minic a dhéanaim dearmad ar a leithéid a rá.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">Mar a dúirt an cainteoir deiridh, is iontach an rud é go bhfuil a leithéid de dhíospóireacht ar siúl anseo, agus is fiúé. Níl mé cinnte gurbh é an rud ab fhearr go mbeimis go léir ar aon aigne faoin nGaoluinn. Ba cheart dúinn a bheith ar aon fhealsúnacht faoi na rudaí is tábhachtaí, áfach. Tá beagnach gach éinne san dá Thigh den Oireachtas ar an meon céanna faoina dteastaíonn uainn. Is é a theastaíonn uainn ná go mbeadh an teanga dhúchais againn beo, á labhairt go forleathan agus, go speisialta, go leanfadh ar aghaidh mar phobal beo pobal na Gaeltachta ina bhfuil an teanga á labhairt fós.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">Nuair a fhéachtar ar an Ghaeilge, is féidir féachaint ar an ngloine agus a rá go bhfuil sí leath-lán nó leath-fholamh. It is worth quoting some statistics os comhair an Tí. Tá 6,000 teanga sa domhan agus de réir na saineolaithe, half of those are inevitably going to die out. Den 3,000 atá fágtha, tá 90% acu i mbaol. Níl ach 300 teanga nach bhfuil i mbaol agus tá an Ghaeilge i measc leo. It is an interesting fact that with all of our limitations, failings and smart alecry, mar a dúirt Coimisinéir na Teanga, the last native Irish speaker has not been born yet and will not be for another few generations. We have not done as well as I would have wished but we have not done as badly as many would have us believe; that is the present situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">Nuair a fhéachaim ar an rún ag Fine Gael atá os ár gcomhair, tá mórán ann lena n-aontóinn ach tá líne amháin ann nach féidir le Páirtí an Lucht Oibre a thacú— go ligfí do gach mac léinn tar éis an teastas sóisir rogha a bheith aige Gaeilge a thógáil san ardteist — agus mar gheall air sin ní bheimid ag vótáil ar son an rún. Ní aontaím leis sin.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">There is a valid argument about the teaching of Irish in this State and what we want to achieve. We have never clarified our thinking properly about it. To call dramatically now for a sudden and fundamental change in the way Irish is treated in the leaving certificate is not appropriate. There is a case for a review and I am happy to take it away from examination agus gach rud mar sin go mbeadh ach sprioc amháin a bheith againn — go dtí an teastas sóisir ar a laghad — go mbeadh Gaeilge labhartha cumasach ag gach éinne ag fágáil na meánscoile nó ag fágáil na bunscoile. Dá sroichfimis an sprioc sin, d'fhéadfaí tosnú ag caint faoi cad is fiú an Ghaeilge sa chóras meánscolaíochta, go mór-mhór san ard teastas. If we could reach a stage where everyone could speak good Irish comfortably, we could then talk about choices but it is putting the cart before the horse to talk about that before doing the other.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">In case there is an excess of optimism on the other side, I am not suggesting that the Labour Party will vote for the Government amendment either. Tá rudaí ann lena n-aontaím ach sa líne deireanach tá an abairt "believes that all parties should support reform of how Irish is taught in our schools rather than jeopardising the future of the language by calling for its status in our education system to be downgraded". Má tá daoine ar lorg comhaontaithe faoi conas a láimhseálfaimis an Ghaeilge, ní chuirfidís a leithéid ar an chlár. That is confrontational politics and the Labour Party will not vote for the amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">Bheadh Páirtí an Lucht Oibre sásta vótáil ar son na leasaithe ó na Seanadóirí O'Toole agus Quinn because something funny is going on. Dá mbeimis i ndáiríre faoi seo bheadh téacsleabhair den chaighdeán is airde ar fáil do gach éinne a dteastódh uaidh ábhar ag an mbunscoil, meánscoil nó ar an tríú leibhéal a dhéanamh trí Ghaeilge. Tá mé amhrasach faoin phleidhcíocht atá ar siúl faoin ionad náisiúnta a gealladh do Bhaile an Bhúirne. Aontaím leis an Seanadóir O'Toole — someone in Dublin thinks Baile an Bhúirne is too far away, tá sé chomh simplí sin. Ceapann siad go bhfuil na Gaeltachtaí ró-fhada ó Bhaile Átha Cliath. Sin trioblóid atá ag gluaiseacht na Gaeilge le 80 bliain — is mór an trua nach bhfuil an Ghaeltacht in aice le Baile Átha Cliath agus bheadh sé i bhfad níos compordaí le Gaeilgeoirí Bhaile Átha Cliath dá mba rud é nach raibh orthu taisteal agus iad féin a chur faoi míchompord le cuairt a thabhairt ar an Ghaeltacht. Murach sin cén fáth nach bhfuil an institiúid ar siúl?</p>
          <p eId="para_382">Glacaim go bhfuil a lán daoine dáiríre faoin nGaeilge ach tá rudaí atá ag teastáil le blianta. Tá orainn athscrúdú bunúsach a chur ar siúl faoin dóigh a múintear an Ghaeilge sna bunscoileanna. The single most extraordinary assumption that bedevils the whole movement ar son na Gaeilge ná the assumption that the same curriculum can be taught in a Galltacht and a Gaeltacht school. In one case children are being taught — agus tá Gaeilge ag an chuid is mó díofa — about a language atá acu cheana féin. I bhformhór na scoileanna tá muid ag iarraidh teanga nua a chur ar fáil. To use the same curriculum in both cases is ridiculous.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">We must bheith cinnte go bhfuil na daoine atá ag múineadh na Gaeilge compordach agus iad ag labhairt na teanga. That is not an unreasonable demand, it should be true of all languages. We would not ask people to teach French who could not speak it fluently. Caithfidh téacsanna a bheith ar fáil fosta.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">Is fiú go bhfuil an díospóireacht seo ar siúl. Tá difríocht beag idir mo pháirtí féin agus Fine Gael ach níl sé ró-mhór. Ba é Aire de chuid Pháirtí an Lucht Oibre a chuir TG4 ar bun, an cinneadh is dearfaí ar son todhchaí na Gaeilge le 50 bliain anuas. Is é an t-athrú is mó ar dhearcadh an phobail faoin Ghaeilge agus faoi Ghaelachas ná go bhfuil seirbhís teilifíse phroifisiúnta bheo bhríomhar as Gaeilge ar fáil. An t-aon easpa ná nach bhfuil na hacmhainní a ba chóir ag TG4 agus mholfainn don Aire agus don Rialtas acmhainní TG4 a mhéadú go mór.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnMinihan" eId="spk_131">
          <from>Mr. Minihan</from>
          <p eId="para_385">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and the opportunity to speak on the use of the Irish language, how it is taught to children and adults and its promotion and preservation. There will hardly be a Member of this House who is not concerned by the fact many of our young people leave school without a reasonable command of the Irish language as stated in the Opposition motion. I would also presume that no Member or party would have a problem, in principle, with 1,500 hours of Irish language education being delivered to Irish children throughout their school lives nor with the estimated annual cost of €500 million. It is also unclear how many people are truly worried that students are required to take Irish after the junior certificate examination. Few would take specific issue with the findings in the 2003 NCCA document, Languages in the Post-Primary Curriculum, that our syllabi and examinations "retain an emphasis on reading and writing at the expense of listening and speaking".</p>
          <p eId="para_386">Given these points, this debate boils down to how the Irish language becomes, in the Opposition's words, "a living language of modern and useful communication". Our cultural heritage is protected and deepened by continuing to support our understanding, use and development of the Irish language in as many media as possible. Assessment of the Irish language in the curriculum must be part of a broader need to promote a better understanding and valuing of our national heritage and culture in schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">Moving on from a system which has not delivered, necessitates understanding of what has and what has not worked. I welcome the evaluation of teaching and learning in Irish which took place in 40 schools between January and June last year. While the information gleaned from that must be analysed by the evaluation support and research unit, I urge that the final report be published as soon as possible. Similarly, I hope the final report of the evaluation of teaching and learning in the junior cycle, in which 75 schools took part between September 2004 and June last year, will also be published soon.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">I commend the Minister and the Government on working towards the revised literature course for leaving certificate Irish. I understand this will be examined for the first time this year having been introduced in September 2004. It is crucial that modern texts in Irish are part of the curriculum. Language is central to the human experience, whether the communication takes place face to face or across time through literature. Students should experience contemporary Irish language use and culture through modern texts and I welcome the inclusion of contemporary works in the prescribed prose and poetry sections of the leaving certificate.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">No matter what our personal view of the book might be, there is a sense that one has only to mention the name Peig Sayers to a certain age group and one will see a dramatic rolling of the eyes, or worse. If we are to move further towards Irish as a living language of modern and useful communication, we need to learn from this. That the elective material element of the leaving certificate for both prose and poetry provides candidates with opportunities to present alternative texts of their choice is a welcome development.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">I also commend the Government on working to provide a revised literature course that allows the study of a contemporary Irish language film as an alternative to the prescribed play. The Minister has stated her view that the new Irish literature curriculum offers many opportunities to study modern texts and I commend her and her Department on their efforts to date to provide both teachers and students with the ability to choose works that match their interests. That is an important point and not one, I suspect, recognised generally or in the Opposition motion for that matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">I have some concerns about the final point of the Opposition motion on a new national strategy for Irish. I understand Fóram na Gaeilge was to look at the preparation of a 20-year strategic plan with realistic goals for the Irish language in the State. It seems the advisability of a 20-year strategic plan for the Irish language has been among the issues that have been considered in general terms by Fóram na Gaeilge. The question of why it is advisable to have a strategic plan is debateable. Surely agreement exists on the need for the development of a clear statement on the part of the Government on the Irish language.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has stated his hope to be able to advance the matter "in the near future". It would be worthwhile if the House could get some sense of what work has been completed and what issues are holding up a strategic plan with realistic goals for the language.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">I wish to deviate briefly to make a point about the promotion of the Irish language generally. Much has been made of the requirement on public bodies to ensure that certain documents of public interest shall be published in each of the official languages simultaneously — for example, annual reports. Again, I suggest that no one has a particular problem with this in principle, although I understand some members of Fine Gael are now sorry they supported the Official Languages Act. The problem seems to centre on the cost. It is an issue which is talked about with little, if any, reference to the facts.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">In the first instance, the number of documents which must be translated is limited — covering major policy documents only. Second, the cost of compliance to Departments, the Revenue Commissioners and the Office of Public Works was approximately €350,000 in 2005. Compare this with the total expenditure of Departments of approximately €50 billion. The €350,000 cost of compliance with the official languages legislation should be kept in that context. People are often accused of knowing the cost of everything and the value of nothing and I suggest that when it comes to preserving a language not only for us but for people not yet born, we must shed that limited view.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">I welcome this debate and the opportunity to hear the view of all sides, particularly to hear the most up to date view of the Minister and the Department. I have concerns about the strategy, as I have outlined, and urge this be addressed as soon as possible. There is an old Irish saying — Níl neart gan cur le chéile, there is no real strength without co-operating. Are varying political and interest group approaches damaging the preservation and promotion of the language? The spirit of that saying spurs us to ask whether co-operation and consensus rather than divisive motions are the way to best promote and protect our native language. Government, Ministers, Departments, legislators, teachers, students and wider society must work together. It is in that spirit that I support the amendment to the motion.</p>

          <from>Mr. McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_396">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire. Tá lúcháir ormsa go bhfuil deis agam ceist na Gaeilge a phlé anseo anocht. Tá meas mór agam ar an Ghaeilge. Rugadh agus tógadh in aice le Gaeltacht Ros Goill mé, áit a bhfuil éacht mhór déantá ag an phobal an Ghaeilge a choinneáil beo, a fhorbairt agus a chur chun chinn.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">Tá comharthaíocht agus fógraíocht le feiceáil i nGaeilge. Tá an teanga le cloisteáil níos mó inniu ná mar a bhí deich mbliana ó shin. Tá imeachtaí ar siúl go rialta agus tá cúrsaí Gaeilge ar fáil ag gach leibhéal, chomh maith le cúrsaí céime sa Ghaeilge, faoi láthair.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">Chaith mise 16 bliana ag foghlaim na Gaeilge ar scoil. Ní raibh córas mhúineadh na Gaeilge ró-chairdiúil ag an am sin agus níl mise ach óg. Caithfear amharc ar an chóras oideachais ó thaobh na Gaeilge de.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">I am delighted to be able to say a few words as Gaeilge agus as Béarla. I mentioned what is happening at grassroots level. I live in Rosguill on the border of a Gaeltacht area in Donegal. Unfortunately, I was not born in the Gaeltacht. If I had been, I would have more muinín in terms of my ability to express myself through Irish.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">There is a lot going on in my region and a community development group, an Irish language group, runs many courses for the people of the area. Much of its work is voluntary and it receives some Gaeltacht funding, etc. There is a complete revival of the Irish language because people decided to stop talking about its decline and not to focus on the negativity. I cannot remember the beautiful word Senator Ó Murchú used for negativity. The Irish language group decided to get together and run certificate courses at local level. Some years later, people wanted to progress further and began to do diploma courses. Now, in conjunction with Magee College in Derry, they have begun to do degree courses in the Irish language. This is an example of the positive work of the Irish language movement. I assume the same is happening in other rural areas. It is a bottom-up approach and it is important to focus on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">The Minister will be aware that Oideas Gael in Gleann Cholm Cille is very much a private entrepreneurial project. The director, Liam Ó Cuinneagáin, decided on his own that there is money to be made from the Irish language, although that may not have been his primary motivation. From knowing him I believe his primary motivation was to help revive the language and keep it alive in the area. Hundreds of thousands of people have entered the doors of Oideas Gael in Gleann Cholm Cille. It is important to mention that the mother of the leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Kenny, was born in Gleann Cholm Cille. When Deputy Kenny speaks passionately about the Irish language, he is doing so because he has a fondness for it and an appreciation of its importance.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">The Irish language is alive and well in Gleann Cholm Cille because mná tí are making money out of it and communicating through it. The people attending Oideas Gael are primarily not from Donegal and many come from all over the world. I was at the centre three summers ago and met people from Japan, North Korea, China and Europe, including Britain and Northern Ireland. There is a massive influx from Northern Ireland, where, it is important to note, Irish is not a compulsory A level subject.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">This is what is happening at the level of private enterprise. There are other developments at this level, including the setting up of Café Una on Kildare Street by a Donegal woman. The Minister might get a chance to visit it. The proprietor prints her menus in Irish and is trying to facilitate Irish speakers in the restaurant. The staff, not all of whom are from Donegal, communicate through Irish. This is a case of private enterprise helping to keep the language alive. This is good and will continue to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">The Government should be congratulated on the supports it has made available to TG4 and to the Gaelscoil movement. The Acting Chairman has very good friends in Ballyliffin in north Inishowen who are native Irish speakers. The unfortunate point about Inishowen, a landmass the size of County Louth, is that it has no Gaeltacht, yet there are still people who communicate through Irish in Urris, the outskirts of Ballyliffin, Tulla and other northern parts of the peninsula. Perhaps we could re-examine this and determine the level of Irish being used in the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">The Minister may be aware that there is a movement in Buncrana pushing very strongly for a Gaelscoil in the town — the proposal may be on the Minister's desk. It is a voluntary movement involving parents and is in its initial stages. We should acknowledge that there are people on the peninsula who want to send their children to an all-Irish school.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">There should not be a political debate or toing and froing regarding the Irish language. We are all singing from the same hymn sheet and want to preserve the language. I got caught in the middle of a debate over signposts that turned into a liathróid polaitiúla, which is scandalous. A person who wants to contribute to the debate on the Irish language should not be prevented from doing so because he or she cannot speak it. Signposts are very important to some people because they allude to a place's history and connect it to the land and generations past. However, when debating this issue, we must be positive and allow people to contribute.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">Six years ago at a conference in Vienna I met an interpreter from Liverpool who could speak 14 different languages. I never met a man more passionate about the Irish language. He asked why we are not all speaking it and said that, of his 14 languages, it is the most beautiful in which he has communicated. He wondered why we were not developing a grá for it and pushing the agenda in this regard. He referred to the way in which the language was taught by rote learning, whereby students must learn chunks and chunks of depressing poems. Although they may be part of our history, why is there not a choice of more lively material? I learned <i>Caisleáin Óir</i> inside out by rote. It is about a man who left a poor woman waiting for him up in Clochán Liath. She had to spend all her life waiting for him when he went away to earn his money and when he came back and saw her he thought she looked too old and fecked off again — sorry for my language. This is depressing stuff and the kind of stuff we are offering to our students in secondary school. Let us liven it up.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">There are some beautiful words in the language.</p>

We should be focusing on this.</p>

          <from>        Dr. M. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_411">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire anseo. Is mór an trua go bhfuilimid ag déanamh cheist poilitíochta de seo ar chor ar bith mar is dóigh liom go bhfuilimid go léir sa Seanad ar an dtaobh céanna ar son na Gaeilge. Glacaim leis go bhfuil na Seanadóirí a chuir síos an rún agus an Seanadóir de Búrca go macánta ag lorg leasaithe teanga. Tá súil agam, i ndeireadh na dáile, nach ndeanfaí deilt sa Teach agus nach mbeidh vótáil ann. Is iontach go bhfuil an díospóireacht againn. Díospóireacht fhiúntach atá ann. Nach féidir linn ansin glacadh leis an phrionsabal go bhfuilimid go léir ar son na Gaeilge agus go dteastaíonn uainn go léir slí a fháil amach chun an teanga a chur chun tosaigh, agus a iarraidh le chéile ar an Aire pé rud is féidir léi a dhéanamh chun é sin a chur i bhfeidhm?</p>
          <p eId="para_412">Táim cinnte gur maith an rud é tosnú ins na bunscoileanna le comhrá na Gaeilge agus gan trácht ar aon rud eile, agus ba mhór an feabhas más féidir linn daoine le leanaí a mhealladh teacht isteach as an mbunscoil agus cumas caidrimh agus cumarsáide acu i nGaeilge shimplí. Ins na scoileanna idirmheánach freisin, is fearr an bhéim a chur ar chomhrá. Ní chuirim mórán muinín sna staitisticí atá san Daonáireamh mar is féidir le daoine a rá go bhfuil caint na Gaeilge acu nuair nach bhfuil ach cúpla focal, agus chím a leithéid chéanna sa Tuaisceart. Tá gné amháin i gceist, a thaispeánann sé, mar a dúirt an Leas-Chathaoirleach, go bhfuil an Ghaeilge faiseanta i ndeireadh na dáile.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">Is mór an rud é go bhfuil Gaelscoil i ngach chontae anois agus b'fhéidir gurbh fhiú dúinn féachaint ar cad é an recipe atá acu. Cad is féidir leo a dhéanamh nach féidir a dhéanamh sna scoileanna eile? Tá gné amháin i gceist: tá dúthracht ag na tuismitheoirí agus tá ceangailt ag na tuismitheoirí. Tá níos mó aithne agam ar na Gaelscoileanna sa Tuaisceart agus tá eolas acu orm freisin, agus bíonn sin ann i gcónaí.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">Tá easpa téacsleabhar tré Ghaeilge sa Tuaisceart freisin. Níl na téacsleabhair Ghaeilge acu agus tá siad ag brath ar an Roinn sa Deisceart na téacsleabhair a chur ar fáil dóibh. Ba mhór an rud é a leithéid a dhéanamh.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">Caithfidh an t-Aire suim na ndaoine óga sa Ghaeilge a spreagadh agus a chothú sa dtreo is go bhfuil sé saghas "hip", mar a déarfá. B'fhéidir go mbeidh trácht ar Pheig Sayers agus is mór an trua é. Bhí aithne agam ar Pheig agus an-mheas agam uirthi, but it is hard going for the ordinary kid. Years ago I remember thinking that if we could only encourage the Censorship Board to ban a book in Irish the language would be revived in the morning. Nílim á rá gur chóir don Aire leabhair gháirsiúile a chur amach ach b'fhéidir gurbh fhearr go mbéidís níos cóngaraí do na leabhair, na téacseanna agus na núachtáin a léann an t-aos óg i láthair na huaire.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">Bá mhaith liom freisin cabhrú le leas-rún an tSeanadóra Ó Tuathail mar gheall ar Bhaile Bhúirne. Is cuimhin liom dul ar cuairt go Baile Bhúirne 60 bliain ó shin nuair a bhí cairde agam sa choláiste ullmhúcháin ag déanamh an teastais timire Gaeilge, agus ionad iontach atá ann. Tá ionad nó institiúid de shaghas éigin ag teastáil chun na téacsleabhair a dhéanamh.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">Molaim freisin Teilifís na Gaeilge. Tugann sé sásamh mór domsa nuair a chím go gcaithfidh mo chomharsanna Aontachtóirí, más áil leo Ulster a fheiscint ag imirt sa Celtic League, na cluichí a fháil ar TG4, agus tá leanúint maith go leor air sa Tuaisceart. Taispeánann sin freisin gur féidir na huirlisí nua-aoiseacha leictreonacha a chur ar fáil ins na scoileanna agus ins na hinstitiúidí i mBaile Bhúirne.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">I suggest that the schools are equipped for dealing with the matter. It is no longer necessary to think of everything in terms of written texts. CDs and websites exist and if the schools were equipped and if we had a central institute producing them, we could have a very exciting mix. Youngsters now operate through cell phones, iPods, etc., and that is the market we should pursue.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">I hope that at the end of the day we can agree that we had a good debate and that a vote is not needed. Both the motion and the amendment, in a sense, could be withdrawn. in order to dispose of his amendment, it would help if the Minister could give an assurance to Senator O'Toole that she would consider what help could be given to Baile Bhúirne. Is maith an rud go raibh an díospóireacht againn agus molaim an obair.</p>

        <speech by="#FergalQuinn" eId="spk_136">
          <from>Mr. Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_420">Fáiltím roimh an Aire. What an interesting debate we have had so far and I am sure it will get more interesting. What a joy it is to hear Senator Maurice Hayes talking about knowing Peig Sayers. It sounds like somebody who knew Napoleon as it seems so long ago. I also enjoyed listening to Senator McHugh to an extent. He used a term that reminded me of something when he talked about the significance of the Irish language.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">At an early age when I was in my late 20s, I believe I was the only person who won a case at the Supreme Court, which found certain legislation to be unconstitutional as it discriminated on the grounds of religion. I was prosecuted for selling meat and I found that it excluded meat where the animal had been killed under the Jewish ritual method. I relate the story because I remember two things from what I learnt about law at university — that it was not possible to discriminate on the grounds of religion and that the Irish language took precedence over the English language in case of doubt. The argument used against me in the Supreme Court was that one could not discriminate in favour of somebody as one discriminated against somebody. However, as the Irish word used in the Constitution was idirdhealú, to distinguish between not against, I won the case on that basis. I mention this as it shows the significance of the Irish language.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">I welcome the debate and I agree entirely with Senator Maurice Hayes. I do not believe we need votes tonight as everybody is on the one side. The debate echoes what I said some years ago when we debated the Official Languages Bill in this House. I remind Members that I was one of the very few people — perhaps the only one — in this House to speak against that Bill. I opposed the Bill not because I was against the Irish language, but because I am in favour of it. I argued then, and I still believe now, that the Bill diverted money and attention to the wrong place. The attention and the money should be directed to the area addressed by the motion and Senator O'Toole's amendment, which I support, and that is the teaching of the language in our schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">In the debate on the Official Languages Bill, I asked given that our young people learn Irish from their first day at school, why can so few people speak it? Why do so few adults wish to speak Irish in their daily lives? How do we fail our children and the citizens of the nation and what must we do to succeed in engendering in them a love for the language? On that occasion I drew attention to the massive State apparatus devoted to the teaching of Irish, which went back to the 1920s. In spite of that apparatus, the vast majority of young people do not learn the language effectively. A large number of young people leaving school do so not just with a lack of enthusiasm for the language but also with a negative attitude to it. The current system of teaching Irish has failed miserably to engage the majority of the population.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">Why have we failed so badly? It is not that Irish is a particularly difficult language to learn and it is certainly not that we have failed to devote enough time or resources to the teaching of Irish. There must be some other reason for this monumental failure to achieve the objectives we set down for ourselves, but which we have not reached. How can we ensure that we will achieve what we are setting out to do? I argued then many of the same points that are being revisited in this debate. I said that we would be far better off investing in research to find out what we were doing wrong in the teaching of Irish in our schools than spending vast sums of money on translating documents into Irish that nobody would read.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">I got the Competition Authority report — two big, thick and glossy documents — today. I do not know how long it takes to translate such documents into Irish, or the length of the delays which arise for that reason. I suggest that time has proved me right because the costs of implementing the Official Languages Act 2003 have caused a national outcry. That gives me no pleasure because it has helped to bring the Irish language further into disrepute. I welcome one consequence of the passing of the Act, however. The inaugural annual report of the Office of An Coimisinéir Teanga, published on 14 March 2005, states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_426">It is estimated that almost 1,500 hours of tuition in the Irish language is provided to school pupils over a period of 13 years, from their first day at primary school to the end of secondary level. This clearly raises the question: is the State getting value for money from this investment, if it is true that so many are going through the educational system without achieving a reasonable command of the language — even in the case of students who succeed in getting a high grade in Irish in their final examinations? I believe that there is an urgent need for a comprehensive and impartial review of every aspect of the learning and teaching of Irish in the educational system, so as to ensure that the continuous and substantial State investment in Irish will ensure that students, having spent 13 years learning the language, acquire a reasonable fluency or command of the language by the time they complete their schooling. This is essential if we are serious about promoting Irish in every aspect of national life, including public administration.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">What more is there to say? We do not have an infinite amount of time to continue to dither about this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">The case for the language becomes weaker and the voices speaking against it become stronger as further generations of young people emerge from school unable to speak Irish. We are fortunate that enough goodwill towards the language remains to enable us to mount a final rescue operation. That is the purpose of the motion before the House and the two amendments to it. We need to make a final effort to undo the damage we have been making since the foundation of the State. If we do not take this opportunity to face reality, the time may soon have passed when it is possible to do anything about it. That day may be closer than many of us think.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">Senator O'Toole spoke about the proposed facility at Baile Bhúirne. I am not sure he is correct when he suggests it has not been supported because it is regarded as being an awful long way from Baile Átha Cliath. Perhaps there is some truth in the suggestion and perhaps there is not. The Minister for Education and Science can do something about it.</p>

Is trua é sin mar ní dóigh liom go dtuigeann Fine Gael an toradh a bheidh ar a gcuid bpolasaithe. Is dóigh liom go bhfuil easaontas idir an méid a deireann siad, an méid a cheapann siad agus an méid a thuigeann siad ó thaobh na Gaeilge, agus na polasaithe atá acu.

          <p eId="para_437">Deirim "Dúrlas Éile", in ionad "Dúrlas", agus "Aonach Urmhumhan" in ionad "Aonach". Ní maith liom an chaoi ina bhfuil gach éinne ag gearradh na logainmneacha siar. Ba chóir an téarma iomlán a úsáid. Má táimid chun a bheith cinnte go dtuigimid agus go gcreidimid sa Ghaeilge, níor cheart dúinn mar sochaí agus go háirithe mar cheannairí na tíre seo agus mar pholaiteoirí aon pholasaí a chur i bhfeidhm a loitfidh nó a maróidh an Ghaeilge. Ag an am céanna, aithním go bhfuil dúshlán láidir os ár gcomhair. Tá dúshlán láidir os comhair múinteoirí, córas oideachais agus sochaí na tíre seo go ginearálta. It rests on the Government and on all leaders to show leadership in respect of the Irish language. I am always the first to say that the school cannot solve every problem in society, but for the most part the school is the first and only place where children learn Irish. Our schools, particularly our primary schools, have a particular obligation to ensure that the teaching of the language is exciting and interesting for our children.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">Labhraímid i gcónaí faoi na gaelscoileanna. We say how exciting it is that there is now a gaelscoil in every county, which is a very positive development. Bhí tráth ann nuair ba ghaelscoil í gach scoil — the Irish language was a central part of every school. The living instructions and orders in playgrounds and during activities were given through Irish. Ordinary schools were gaelscoileanna as much as the specific gaelscoileanna are now, but that has been lost from our schools. Faraor, the teaching of Irish is being confined to 40 minutes per day. If we can extend it throughout our schools as a living language, our children will realise that it is a teanga bheo. Tá sé deacair é sin a dhéanamh nuair nach bhfuil muintir na tíre seo á labhairt, ní amháin mar chéad theanga ach mar theaga ar bith. It is very difficult for a school to do it on its own. We face a particular challenge in that regard. That is why the measures which have been taken throughout our communities and in society generally are so important.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">Chuala mé Seanadóirí ag caint mar gheall ar an tacaíocht breise atá tugtha do TG4, which is a hugely popular television station that makes programmes in an imaginative manner. I do not just refer to the fact that TG4 broadcasts football matches and old western films. Tá mé ag caint mar gheall ar líon na ndaoine a bhíonn ag féachaint ar "Mo Laethanta Saoire", mar shampla, clár a rinne mé féin. That programme brings people back to the places where they went on their holidays as children, which is something to which the whole country can relate. It took TG4 to come up with and pursue such a simple idea. Tá daoine óga na tíre seo ag féachaint ar dhaoine ar nós Hector Ó hEochagáin agus Síle Seoige. Caithfidh mé a adhmháil that they are making the Irish language i bhfad níos gnéasaí ná mar a bhí. Taitníonn na daoine úd le daoine óga. Long live Hector Ó hEochagáin and Síle Seoige because they are promoting Irish in modern Ireland in a modern and living context.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">The official recognition of the Irish language at EU level was a major achievement for Ireland and for the language, but what good will it do if we do not support the language at home? We will face major challenges in providing interpreters and translators on foot of that decision. Níl aon mhaith ann a bheith ag caint faoi sin muna bhfuil an Ghaeilge ag daoine go láidir nuair a fhágann siad an scoil. It all comes back to the extent to which we can strengthen the Irish language in our schools and support it in society, through the Official Languages Act 2003 and, more particularly, by increasing an meas a bhíonn ag daoine don teanga. The reactions of students to the language are dictated not only by what happens in schools but also by what happens in society generally. That is why all those wider issues are very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">Senator Maurice Hayes said he does not have too much regard for what people say in response to questions asked in the daonáireamh. I presume that people adopted the same attitude in the last census, when answering the question about the amount of Irish they use, as they did when answering the same question in the previous census. The number of people who classified themselves as Irish speakers increased by 140,000 at the last census. It will be interesting to see cad a bheidh daoine á rá mar gheall ar an Ghaeilge in this year's census. Is dóigh liom go bhfuil meath ag teacht ar an nGaeltacht agus go bhfuil borradh agus fás ag teacht ar líon na ndaoine atá ag labhairt na Ghaeilge in áiteanna eile. I am quite satisfied that there is more Irish in my constituency of the former borough of Kingstown than in a great many Gaeltacht areas around the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">With Gaelscoileanna, Coláiste Eoin, Coláiste Íosagáin, Scoil Lorcáin, Gaelscoil Ballybrack, lár-ionad Comhaltas CeolteóiríÉireann, daoine ag labhairt Gaeilge agus ag déanamh ceol, agus spiorad Gaelach timpeall na h-áite. It is to be found in a place where one would not expect, in which I suspect it is a good deal stronger than in traditional areas. Instead of getting depressed about the decline of the Gaeltacht, we should try to determine how strong Irish is in other areas. The growth of the Gaelscoileanna is adding to that, mar tá na tuismitheoirí ag dul amach agus ag foghlaim Gaeilge, freisin, mar tá siad ag iarraidh cabhrú lena bpáistí féin. That is encouraging a whole new generation of people to return to Irish classes to learn.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">I accept, however, it is a disgrace that after learning Irish for 13 or 14 years, children leave school not being able to speak it. Is iar-mbúinteoir Gaeilge mé féin. I spent 17 years teaching Irish up to honours leaving certificate level. Even my best students cannot speak Irish today, largely because they have not the opportunity in society. I spent much of the time doing the spoken language, mar creidim go láidir ins an teanga — leis na díospóireachtaí, drámaíocht agus gach rud a bhaineann leis. Rinne mé m'iarracht agus mo chuid chun Gaeilge thaitneamhach a mhúneadh. Fortunately, the curriculum has changed. The new curriculum is very exciting, particular at primary level. Feicim an dul chun cinn atáá dhéanamh ins na scoileanna nuair a bhím ag dul timpeall. In the last year or so I have visited more than 200 schools in every country in Ireland and I can see the dul chun cinn atáá dhéanamh leis an gcuraclam nua. That places much more emphasis on the spoken language. It is following through to some degree to the junior certificate, with a new syllabus as regards literature, etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">However, I am convinced of the need for greater emphasis in the exams structure on oral Irish, because it is only when more marks are given for the scrúdú béal ag an ard-teist, that teachers will change their methods of teaching and students their attitude to the language. I have asked the NCCA as a matter of priority to revert to me with proposals in this regard. I appreciate it is looking at the whole senior cycle, but for me this is an absolute priority. As Aire Oideachais agus Eolaíochta, I would love to be in a position to be able to progress the situation. I should love to see 50% of the marks in leaving certificate Irish being allocated to oral Irish. Ní shílim go mbeidh na deacrachtaí síos má dhéantar sin, mar ní fhéadfá díreach é sin a thosnú gan scrúdnithe a chur ar siúl ag ranganna nó blianta eile. However, it is the single most positive thing that may be done to improve the spoken language.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">The new syllabus, as has been recognised, is much more exciting. There are lovely novels now, for example Dúnmharú ar an Dart or Murder on the Dart, a great lively book very suitable for using with junior certificate students. Film is being used in the curriculum. All of this has already been incorporated, so we are well on the way towards making those changes and recognising the importance of the language. That is why I am genuinely concerned at the policy of Fine Gael, as outlined in this motion and by the party leader, of removing compulsory Irish in the leaving certificate.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">In a curriculum as broad as ours, students do seven subjects for the leaving certificate and may even be taking eight. There is room for Irish, for the spoken language, literature and for learning. It is completely different for A level students, who may be doing two or even three subjects. The UK is restricting at a much earlier age. They have to, because of the nature of their systems. It is interesting that they are trying to broaden the system now. However, because of the nature of the system, they have to confine matters and they have to choose. We are offering seven subjects. Surely there is room there for Irish. If the compulsory Irish is removed, students will not do it for the leaving certificate or want to do it for the junior certificate and it will be lost, at primary school level. I am as convinced of that as of anything. I am satisfied that there is no tally between what Fine Gael is saying and what is its policy. I do not believe that Deputy Kenny wants to see the end of the Irish language, nor do I believe that Senator Ulick Burke or anybody else wants to see it.</p>

          <from>Ms Hanafin</from>
          <p eId="para_449">I am giving the House my view on what will happen. The policy they are propounding is to remove the compulsory element of Irish for the leaving certificate. It will single-handedly sound the death-knell of the Irish language, and I am not being political, but am speaking from concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">It is interesting that the Labour Party in the Dáil does not support this policy. Neither does the Green Party. I shall be interested to see what attitude is taken in this House today. If implemented, the policy being put forward in this motion will have enormous knock-on effects. I regret it shows such a lack of understanding of the manner in which the education system works and the importance of the language as a core part of the curriculum. I genuinely believe it is not what Fine Gael Members want as regards the language. As long as we offer a broad curriculum, as will always be my intention, then I will insist that the compulsory element continues.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">Recognising that, we must of course ensure that we adapt in the way we do things. Bhí an Seanadóir Maurice Hayes ag caint mar gheall ar technology agus CDs, agus tá an ceart aige. Caithfhimid iad sin a chur ar fáil agus na háiseanna agus na hacmhainní do mbúinteoirí freisin. The second level support service provides a modular course on Irish through education centres, etc., and the NCCA is looking at resource material in that regard. It is crucial, as more and more students become adept at computers, that they should have access to this type of information as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">As regards na téacsleabhair ins na Gaelscoileanna, tá dul chun cinn á dhéanamh le na h-áiseanna a chur ar fáil. Tá méadú tagtha ar an méid airgid a chuirimid ar fáil. With that increase in money we are getting new materials called Séideán Sí, a wonderful series. It is now in place for the infants, the senior infants and the first class and they are preparing currently for the second class as well. It is not just a question of books. There are puppets, posters, picture cards, compact discs and handbooks and the methodology being used is exciting. There are card games so that children may enjoy the teaching of the language. All of that is being incorporated and will be rolled out for the whole eight-year cycle. Obviously, I should like this to happen more speedily. We are only working towards it at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">Tá an Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscolaíochta ag obair air sin, working on the provision of textbooks, aids etc. It has provided various types of resources which are invaluable for both first and second level. Only recently at Colaiste Eoin I launched na háiseanna for the teaching of science to junior certificate students with all the experiments included. It is a very technical language. The particular resources were needed for science with all the experiments and these are now available and will be of great benefit to the teachers. I recognise nach bhfuil siad go léir ar fáil agus nach bhfuil siad ar fáil in am, ach tá dul chun cinn á dhéanamh air sin.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">The question of entry to primary school teacher training college comes up for debate quite often because it is specified that the applicant has to have a minimum of a grade C in higher level in leaving certificate Irish. People say that it is prohibitive and is blocking some people from becoming teachers. It is absolutely essential that primary school teachers have a reasonable standard of Irish. If they do not, they cannot teach it. I know the entry requirement is higher for Irish than for English or mathematics. I would seriously consider increasing the entry requirement for English, rather than downgrading the entry requirement for Irish. One does not have to have honours English in the leaving certificate to get into primary school teaching, but one does have to have honours Irish. Surely that begs the question as to whether honours should be required for English as well, as this is crucially important.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">Maidir le múinteoirí a bhíonn á n-oiliúint i Sasana agus áiteanna eile, they have to do the Scrúdú Cáilíochta sa Gaeilge, SCG. Again, this is a system that has been recently reviewed and contains a much more comprehensive language syllabus. There is a new literature textbook, Leoithne Gaeilge, and courses are being provided for teachers doing this course to ensure they can pass more speedily, so that when they are in the schools they can implement a course they know and understand. This has increased the success rates for the teachers as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">Bhí an Seanadóir McHugh ag caint mar gheall ar third level programmes and Magee. Again, there have been great advances in the number of third level courses being provided, particularly in Acadamh na hOllscolaíochta Gaeilge, NUI Galway, which offers a great number of courses and has three centres in the Gaeltacht, in Carna, Carraroe and Gweedore. There is also Dublin City University, which established Fiontar in 1993 and offers a range of courses.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">It is very encouraging that students are perhaps going to the Gaelscoileanna le gur féidir leo leanúint ar aghaidh agus a gcuid gcúrsaí a dhéanamh trí mheán na Gaeilge freisin. Summer courses are hugely popular. Bhí an Seanadóir Maurice Hayes ag caint mar gheall ar bheith mBaile Bhúirne. Tá fhios agam gur chaith sé am sa Rinn freisin. He and my father spent their childhood in Ring together. I think Senator Hayes's Irish is probably slightly better than my father's. That kind of support and encouragement that being in the Gaeltacht area gives to young people is hugely important. Every year about 25,000 students participate in cursaí samhraidh insan Gaeltacht. Sin an fáth go bhfuil an Gaeltacht an thábhachtach.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">Tá obair idir lámha ach mar a dúirt mé, ní féidir leis na scoileanna gach rud a dhéanamh, ach is féidir leis an scoil feabhas a chur ar an scéal. The teaching of Irish is hugely important. It genuinely is of concern. The Harris report highlights this. The Harris report, which is about the teaching of Irish, is gone for translation agus táimid fós ag feitheamh leis agus sin ceann de na fáthanna nach féidir liom é a fhoilsiú. It is ironic that a report about the Irish language has to be translated into Irish before we can actually publish it. The report is quite critical of the Irish language and the teaching of Irish.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">Senator Quinn has highlighted the importance of the Irish language in the Constitution, its importance for us as a nation in terms of our identity, and its importance for us now in Europe. For all these reasons Irish is important in schools. The policies we adopt in regard to the Irish language in our schools is what will ensure its future.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">Ba mhaith é so liom a rá leis an Seanadóir O'Toole freisin mar gheall ar Bhaile Bhúirne. I am actively working on this matter and I have taken advice from different groups. I accept that a commitment was given to it but I want to make sure that something definite and positive happens in Baile Bhúirne and that it is not just a concept. I am very anxious to progress that as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">I believe everybody in the Seanad is genuinely interested in the Irish language. I do not question it but I would ask that the policies would follow the interest and that the policies of any party in this House in regard to the Irish language would be such as to support and strengthen it, not to weaken it which is the one thing that would happen as a result of the removal of compulsory Irish for the leaving certificate.</p>

          <from>Mr. Cummins</from>
          <p eId="para_468">I found myself agreeing with much of what the Minister said but she totally misrepresented the meaning of the Fine Gael policies. I do not think she can substantiate anything she has said about the removal of compulsion in the teaching of the Irish language leading to the demise of the language. It is nonsense.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">Recently I met a friend of mine who is a fluent Irish speaker. He has a great love of Irish and has been involved in the Irish language movement for as long as I know him. When I saw him coming towards me I expected an ear bashing from him because of our policy on removing compulsion in the teaching of leaving certificate Irish. I was pleasantly surprised to hear him say that it was about time someone generated a decent debate on the Irish language, and that he believed that compulsion as a tool to revive the Irish language had failed miserably. He was also critical of friends of his who wanted to retain the <i>status quo</i>, knowing full well that the current system had failed the young — and not so young — in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">My interest in the subject was awakened by the enthusiasm of this man who relished the prospect of a debate on how to nurture and revive the Irish language. While I am in no way fluent in speaking Irish I understand it and enjoy hearing the language being spoken. I do not believe one is any less Irish by not being able to speak the Irish language but I admire people who can speak it fluently and who do not make people feel inferior or less Irish if they cannot speak it.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">The Gaelscoileanna are doing a wonderful job and I salute them for the work they are doing. However, the facts of the matter are that a large percentage of young people leave school without any real command of the Irish language. The Minister has agreed with this point. Only three out of ten students attempt the higher level paper in the leaving certificate and, worse still, thousands of students do not even turn up for the exam each year. There is no doubt that we need reform in the approach to the teaching of the Irish language. I believe the vast majority of people who are active in the promotion of the language believe this to be the case also.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">We must be willing to embrace change and to utilise the best available modern technology and teaching methods for the Irish language. We must also develop a specialised language support corps to help individual primary schools that have particular difficulty with the teaching of Irish. More importantly, we must concentrate on immersion in the Irish language for new and trainee teachers. Reference has been made to teachers and trainee teachers spending more time in the Gaeltacht refreshing and reviving their grasp of the language.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">Above all, we must have a radical overhaul and change to focus on the teaching of Irish as a living language. A number of speakers have referred to this matter. We need a curriculum that is loaded with topics that are modern, relevant and, above all, useful. How many times do we hear young people say, "What good is Irish? How useful will it be to me when I leave school?" I hear it in my own house. Communicating in Irish must be seen as cool.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">The Minister referred to Hector and Síle and all the rest of them. The teaching of Irish cannot be boring and dull, which it is in many cases at present. That is why I believe there should be a greater emphasis on the spoken language. There should be an oral component at junior certificate level and this must be introduced sooner rather than later.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">Fine Gael believes that after the junior certificate all students should have a choice between two subjects. One subject would be based on communication in Irish and 50% of the marks would be devoted to spoken Irish with the rest of the curriculum focusing on useful and applicable reading and writing tasks in Irish. The second Irish subject on the curriculum would focus on literature and heritage for those with a deeper knowledge of and competence in the language. I have a great deal more to say but I am aware my time has run out.</p>

          <p eId="para_484">Tá suim agamsa sa Ghaeilge labhartha. Nuair a bhí mé mar ábhar muinteora ag freastal ar Choláiste Phádraig, Drumcondra, bhí orm trí seachtaine a chaitheamh sa Ghaeltacht. Tá na habhair muinteoirí le blianta ag dul go dtí an Ghaeltacht agus is maith an rud é sin. Mar a dúirt an t-Aire, tá a lán daoine óga ag dul go dtí an Ghaeltacht.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">The question of the living language is important and integration was always part of the primary school curriculum and continues to be in the new curriculum. Senator Ó Murchú hit the nail on the head when he referred to easpa muinín, a lack of confidence which might be due to bias. I taught the Irish language to children who were born in the United States and neither they nor their parents had any bias against the language. The same is true for non-national people who are living in Ireland. The Minister and I spent a few days in San Francisco some years ago. We were asked by some primary schoolchildren how to say one, two, three, in Irish. We did our bit for the Gaeilge there. Many mistakes were made and many wrong actions were taken in the name of the so-called revival of the Irish language. For example, teachers were paid according to their Irish results and there was resulting pressure from school managers and inspectors which was regrettable.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">Senator Ryan spoke very well. I congratulate him because this is the first occasion he has not referred to Mr. Val Hanly of Údarás na Gaeltachta. He used to talk about Mr. Hanly having no Irish. Mr. Val Hanly has improved his Irish. I have heard him speaking it many times. The same is true of many leaders in this country. When former President Mary Robinson went to the Gaeltacht to learn Irish, the media coverage was not about her learning Irish but that Galway County Council tarred some roads there before she arrived. This is the kind of publicity it receives.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">I will finish with a story which illustrates the perceived snobbishness and elitism that is associated with the Irish language although I do not agree with that perception. Niall Tóibín used to tell a story about the cigire who was always dreaded when he visited the Gaeltacht to examine students. He was staying in a small hotel and while having his lunch one day discovered a fly in his soup. The young serving boy was called over. The cigire said, "Breathnaigh air sin, breathnaigh air sin." The young boy asked, "An chuileog?". The cigire was disgusted and replied, "Ní hea, an chuileog, with a "h". It is feminine." The young boy said, "You have great eyesight, Sir."</p>

          <p eId="para_518">Senator Maurice Hayes made a very important statement. I was considering asking my colleagues not to call for a vote on this motion. However, the Minister has made a wildly political statement with regard to the language and this motion. The Fine Gael proposals were designed to initiate a debate with regard to the Irish language. I recall that a mere three hours after Deputy Kenny made that statement, the Minister came out with a wildly political motion that would encapsulate the thinking of some. I refer the Minister to an MRBI poll on the question of people's vision on that topic. Some 62% of respondents supported the idea.</p>

          <p eId="para_523">The Minister told the House she was a teacher of Irish up to honours leaving certificate standard for 17 years. It was amazing that she should have said that she would not understand or recognise that when the choice was given, those who would take Irish at the highest level at leaving certificate would be those who wanted to learn and be involved in Irish. It is a point the Minister conveniently ignored.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">The Minister should re-examine the NCCA's 2003 report. It clearly indicates that it is important to leave politics aside and provide a living language. We can like the language or love it. However, if Government policy in this area is developed and implemented, we can have a living language. The NCCA report states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_525">We do not have an integrated language curriculum, but a series of language curricula that are largely independent of one another. Arguably this leads to an impoverished educational experience; it certainly means that curriculum planning is haphazard and piecemeal. The same Irish curricula are taken by the minority of students who are native speakers of Irish and/or attending Irish-medium schools and the English-medium majority for whom Irish is a second language. This situation is linguistically and educationally indefensible, and until it is remedied there is little realistic prospect of raising the levels of proficiency achieved by the non-native-speaker majority in Irish.</p>

        <speech by="#SeanPower" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_194">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. S. Power)</from>
          <p eId="para_575">I thank Members for the opportunity to address the House on the important issue of diabetes. It is a chronic, progressive metabolic disease that impacts on almost every aspect of a person's life. Its prevalence is progressively higher in older ages groups, however, it can affect infants, children, young people and adults of all ages. There is a great deal of concern because diabetes is becoming more common throughout the developed world.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">There are two different types of diabetes. Type 1 diabetes affects mainly young people and has a sudden, and sometimes life threatening, onset. It requires lifelong insulin. Type 2 diabetes is much more common and usually has its onset in middle age. It is associated with lifestyle factors and usually treated by a combination of behaviour changes and medication.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">In the course of my presentation I wish to give an outline of the nature, prevalence and impact of diabetes; to describe the initiatives currently under way in regard to prevention; to outline the nature of diabetes care; and to inform Members of the national working group on diabetes and the model of care which will inform future diabetes services. Diabetes is a chronic, progressive metabolic disease. Type 1, or insulin dependent diabetes, accounts for approximately 10% of cases. This affects mainly young people and requires lifelong treatment with insulin.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">Type 2 diabetes accounts for the remaining 90% of all cases and affects mainly middle aged or older people. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is increasing due to a number of factors, including the ageing population and lifestyle issues such as obesity. It is estimated that there are approximately 140,000 people with diabetes in Ireland. Diabetes has a profound impact on lifestyle, work, well-being and life expectancy. Life expectancy is reduced by approximately 20 years in people with type 1 diabetes and up to ten years in people with type 2 diabetes. There are approximately 2,000 deaths annually from diabetes.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">Diabetes also causes significant morbidity. Studies have estimated that type 2 diabetes is present for an average of seven years prior to the diagnosis, and up to half of people at this stage may have evidence of complications of diabetes. These complications include eye, kidney and nerve damage. Diabetes also causes vascular complications resulting in coronary heart disease, stroke and peripheral vascular disease, which are the main causes of premature death for people with diabetes.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">Diabetes is the most common cause of blindness and amputations in the working population. Foot problems are the most common cause of diabetic admissions to hospital. Diabetes also confers additional risks in pregnancy, where there is an increased chance of losing the baby or of having a congenital abnormality. The increase in frequency of diabetes has led to an increase in hospital admissions. In the past three years, hospital admissions have increased by 32%, with almost 40,000 admissions annually.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">There is consensus on the importance of early detection, diagnosis and treatment for people with diabetes. The complications of diabetes are preventable, but to do so diagnosis must be made as early as possible. The provision of services for people with diabetes is complex and care is provided by a wide range of professionals in a wide range of settings. These include general practitioners and their staff, community health staff and hospital specialist diabetes teams, as well as patients themselves and their carers. The achievement of good outcomes for people with diabetes is dependent on the provision of well-organised and integrated diabetes care.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">The majority of patients, particularly those with type 2 diabetes, receive their care in the primary care setting. In this setting, there are obvious benefits of convenience, continuity of care and immediate access. Other patients, particularly type 1 diabetics, receive their care primarily in the hospital setting, usually from a physician with a specialist interest in diabetes or from an endocrinologist specialising in the treatment of diabetes. These consultants form part of a specialist team that includes, among others, the clinical nurse specialist in diabetes. A way of integrating this care is through the provision of shared care between the hospital specialist team and primary care. In shared care, roles and responsibilities are clearly understood, and it is supported by agreed protocols. This type of care has been shown to be particularly effective for the management of type 2 diabetes.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">In late 2003, the Minister for Health and Children asked the chief medical officer of the Department of Health and Children to chair a working group consisting of the Department, service providers and the Diabetes Federation of Ireland. The membership of the group reflected the multidisciplinary nature of diabetes care and included representatives from the Irish College of General Practitioners, diabetes nurse specialists, the Diabetes Federation of Ireland, health boards and the Department of Health and Children.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">As the terms of reference were drafted prior to the establishment of the HSE, the group determined that there should be two phases to the process, namely, a policy aspect which outlines a model of diabetes care and what services diabetes patients should receive, and an implementation phase which would be the responsibility of the Health Service Executive.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">The strategy was intended as a high level policy document to set out a model for diabetes care together with a range of preventive and therapeutic services that diabetes patients should expect to receive. To achieve this, the report recommended the following: the development of population and high-risk approaches to prevent diabetes; the development of podiatry services as a priority issue to prevent foot care complications; the introduction of a diabetic retinopathy screening programme to prevent eye disease; the development of a diabetes register; the setting out of a model of high-quality care which describes what children and adults with diabetes shall expect to receive throughout their lifetime; that diabetes services should be prioritised and reflected in the national service plan of the Health Service Executive; and the development of "shared care" which described a model of care that is developed jointly between primary care and specialist services, and which has been shown to be most effective in diabetes prevention and the management of complications.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">It also called for a planning and service delivery framework, involving diabetes service development groups with management responsibilities for planning and delivering services and clinical activities in service networks and the application of protocols to support better quality care. The policy guidance has been published on the Department of Health and Children website and the report forwarded to the HSE for implementation.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">Diabetes has been acknowledged as a priority issue and the 2006 HSE service plan has identified that current policy guidelines will be translated into specific action plans with the initial focus on the development of a national diabetes service framework. The chief executive of the HSE has identified the establishment of expert advisory groups as a major step in the reform programme. The purpose of these groups is to facilitate key stakeholders, including the clinical and health community, patients, clients and service users in having an influential role in service development. One of the first expert advisory groups to be established will deal with diabetes.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">Following the publication of the report, the recommendations have been considered by the management team of the primary, community and continuing care directorate. The management team has identified the following priorities for primary, community and continuing care services: to audit and assess current provision in the local health areas and the administrative areas; to identify best practice; the development of local registers; the identification of high-risk patients; the development of the working arrangements between the HSE and the voluntary sector; and the further roll-out of the screening programme for diabetic retinopathy.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">Funding has been approved by the strategic planning and implementation unit of the HSE to develop a self-care and management network for patients with diabetes in each of the four administrative areas. This was one of the key recommendations of the report. Work is advanced in conjunction with the Disability Federation of Ireland in agreeing the allocation of the funding and the service level agreements for the development of the networks. Funding has also been prioritised in 2006 for the development of multidisciplinary community intervention teams for diabetes and work on the roll-out of these proposals is in progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">The Department of Health and Children is currently implementing a number of strategies, the health promotion aspect of which is of direct benefit to diabetics. These strategies include the cardiovascular health strategy, the health promotion strategy and more recently the obesity strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">The cardiovascular health strategy makes 211 recommendations, of which approximately 50 relate to prevention of all cardiovascular diseases, including diabetes. The strategy does not deal with the identification or treatment of diabetes. However, the implementation of the health promotion aspect of Building Healthier Hearts is of direct benefit to diabetics. Some €60 million has been allocated to the strategy, employing approximately 800 professionals to date. Of this, €5 million has been allocated to health promotion employing almost 150 additional health promotion officers. Under the cardiovascular health strategy, a number of agencies and initiatives have been funded, and these include the Diabetes Federation of Ireland. Since 2002, the health promotion unit has provided an annual grant of €63,000 to the Diabetes Federation of Ireland to help fund its health promotion activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">The national programme in general practice for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, Heartwatch, commenced on 1 October 2002 and is being implemented by the HSE in partnership with the Irish College of General Practitioners and the Irish Heart Foundation. Heartwatch concentrates on secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. In addition, 1,000 people with diabetes, who are at high risk of developing heart disease, living in the former Midland Health Board area are being included as part of the programme at a cost of approximately €200,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">Building Healthier Hearts, published in July 1999, identified that secondary prevention for most patients with cardiovascular disease should be provided in the general practice setting. This service model is also relevant to patients with diabetes. The future of the programme will be informed by an independent evaluation currently being considered by the Department and the HSE.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">Overweight and obese individuals are at an increased risk of type 2 non-insulin dependent diabetes. As much as 58% of type 2 diabetes is attributable to excess body fat. The report of the national task force on obesity, Obesity: The Policy Challenges, was presented to the Taoiseach in May 2005. The report contains 93 recommendations aimed at tackling overweight and obesity. Revenue funding of €3 million has been allocated to the Health Service Executive to progress the implementation of relevant recommendations of this report.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">Intervention to prevent overweight and obesity improves quality of life and life expectancy and will also lead to a reduction in type 2 diabetes, some cancers, obesity-related psychological problems, hypertension and other cardiovascular risk factors. The following projects have been approved by the Health Service Executive to take place during 2006: the expansion of the healthy food made easy programme; the recruitment of four physical activity officers to target obesity in all settings; the provision of four specialist community dietician posts for obesity and weight management to support all initiatives; the purchasing of equipment for growth monitoring; and further progressing work with the food service sector on healthy food provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">The HSE has allocated €400,000 to develop the service in St. Colmcille's Hospital in 2006. This will allow for the appointment of additional relevant staff and improvements to the physical infrastructure. The HSE also plans to consolidate the one existing obesity service that operates from St. Colmcille's Hospital, Loughlinstown, to support the development of additional centres based in Cork, Galway and north Dublin and to commence the development of a service for children based at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryHenry" eId="spk_195">
          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_597">I thank Senator Browne for allowing me to speak ahead of him. I also thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive statement but I was struck by the absence of certain things in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">Haemochromatosis, as the Minister of State knows, is a genetic condition which is very common in this country. Approximately one in 300 people have it and one in 20 is a carrier. The gene must be present in both the mother and father for a person to develop full blown haemochromatosis. In my innocence, I thought the Vikings had brought it to Ireland but the Celtic curse, as it is sometimes called, is, in fact, a mutation which probably took place in the west of Ireland thousands of years ago. Wherever we have sent people, such as the ladies who went to Scandinavia with the Vikings or the Irish who emigrated to north America, we have spread the disease.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">We have the highest levels of the disease in the world. In the US only 10% are carriers and Scandinavia has levels between the US and Ireland. It is a problem about which we must be vigilant because a number of people with haemochromatosis present first as diabetics. This is because it is a disease where people absorb more iron than they should. The excess iron is laid down in organs like the liver, where it causes cirrhosis, the kidney, which can give rise to serious kidney disease, and the pancreas, which can lead to diabetes. It can affect the joints where it leads to a condition resembling gout. It is important to keep it uppermost in our mind because we are the people most likely to suffer from it.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">Often a person is diagnosed with diabetes and some years later undergoes a test for their level of blood ferritin, an iron-binding protein which reaches 300 in people who have haemochromatosis, and only then somebody decides they should be tested for the disease. At that stage they may have cirrhosis of the liver and cardiac irregularities, which are another common reason for presentation. We have the highest incidence of the disease in the world, a fact I would like to be stressed more in the diabetes strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">It is also important for the families of anyone who is found to have haemochromatosis after diagnosis of diabetes to be screened. Brothers and sisters will have a one in four chance of having it. It is very important to catch them because the treatment is quite easy. It is only necessary to take blood from sufferers every few weeks. The disease does normally not present until the complications arise and a person is in their 40s or 50s. Frequently those with cirrhosis of the liver are told they drank too much and do not get too much sympathy, but if there was a little more investigation and more thoughtful examination of their condition we might diagnose more people with haemochromatosis before they suffer the organ damage which causes diabetes, cirrhosis and cardiac irregularities.</p>
          <p eId="para_602">If the family is checked for the disease or for being carriers insurance companies can become a bit unpleasant. We must be careful to monitor insurance companies in such cases. If it is good to diagnose the condition early, so that people can receive early treatment and avoid later problems such as diabetes, then insurance companies should not be allowed to penalise people. It will only deter them from being tested.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">We also need to monitor food and food supplements for sufferers, particularly those referred to as "natural food products" because their labelling may not be as careful as we would like. It is bad enough for a person to retain iron without taking in even more in this way.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">I am pleased the Minister of State linked the cardiovascular strategy to the diabetes strategy because it is very important. I was very proud this week to be on a radio advertisement, though I did not hear myself, for the Irish Heart Foundation, encouraging people to call a confidential helpline if they have a concern and do not want to visit a doctor. We should encourage people to ask questions early and the cardiovascular strategy has helped with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">We must also be very careful about health promotions. We know from large surveys in the US that low-fat diets have not been very effective. It would have been preferable for people to have reduced their carbohydrate intake. It is important for people to realise that eating low-fat products is not the answer and that by so doing they might be fooling themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">The presentation in men and women with cardiovascular conditions is often different. Women are inclined to present with cardiovascular disease somewhat later than men. I believe it is because women do not complain so much. We in the medical profession do not think of cardiovascular disease affecting women in their 40s and 50s and are too ready to accept the protective effect of oestrogens, but we may have fooled ourselves on that score. It is important that the medical profession raises its sights and is not confined to what it thought in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">Obesity is a significant problem and the Minister of State has given prominence to it, in which everybody will support him. I have been on a diet for 40 years. I have not lost any weight but I try to walk a lot. Though I have a sore ankle at the moment, described as having occurred from too much walking, plenty of walking keeps one's blood sugar down, which is very important with regard to diabetes. If a person is overweight it is even more important to walk regularly because doing so has a protective effect. I hope the strategy promotes that as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">I will return to podiatry. Has the Department managed to settle this ongoing row?</p>

          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_610">The Minister of State should put his best foot forward to settle it.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">I was recently told by a diabetologist that virtually the only reason apart from serious accident or malignancy that a person in this country has a leg amputated is diabetes, and that is really dreadful. We have managed to cut down on smoking and other causes, and we must now get at this problem and make people realise how important it is that they look after their feet. They will have to be spared top-up fees and be able to see podiatrists more than twice a year. Once someone gets an ulcer on his or her foot, that person ends up in serious bother, being sent to hospital, which costs a fortune. I have been told that it takes at least six weeks in an acute bed before the person can be discharged. The Minister of State should imagine how many people he could have got off the trolleys in that time if he had managed to keep that person out of hospital. He can now make his name by doing so.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CamillusGlynn" eId="spk_198">
          <from>Mr. Glynn</from>
          <p eId="para_612">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire. I very much welcome this debate, which I have requested for the past two years.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">I am exercised about this situation for several reasons. I come from a health background, and the number of acquaintances who have developed diabetes in recent years is astounding. Views differ regarding the figures, but those that I have been given by the Diabetes Federation of Ireland suggest that approximately 250,000 diabetics have been diagnosed in Ireland, 90% of them type 2. By 2020, that figure will rise to 350,000. The Minister of State's speech has been most informative, and he has certainly hit many of the right buttons, stating that the incidence of diabetes is on the increase.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">Diabetes has been described by at least one media outlet as the silent epidemic, but it has great implications for the health services. I regret that to date much of what has been done has been reactive rather than proactive. I was glad to hear the Minister of State speak, and many of the measures that he outlined will improve the situation. The establishment of an expert advisory group is extremely welcome, and I strongly endorse the input of the Diabetes Federation of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">This condition has several factors, some of which the Minister of State has brought up. The old saying is that we are what we eat, and the food industry has a pivotal role. Kelloggs has certainly reduced the number of components in its food products that would allow this condition to develop. If we are to win this great battle, it cannot be a matter for the medical or nursing professions or the health services alone. This battle is faced by society as a whole, and it will be won only if everyone pulls his or her weight.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">Reference has been made, perhaps not today but in the past, to people commenting that they have never been to a doctor in their lives and feel great. It is important to remember that many of them are of my gender, and while they will regularly bring their car for a service, they will not visit their GP for a check-up. That is regrettable, as proactive measures are the only way in which we will address this growing epidemic.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">In my early days as a member of the Midland Health Board, a young member of my family aged perhaps ten was diagnosed as a diabetic, one of ten new diabetics in Mullingar General Hospital at the time. I asked the director of community care whether diabetes was on the increase or whether the diagnostic procedures were better. I was informed that the latter was true, but that while the incidence was increasing it had not been detected. GPs can do a great deal, and they are doing their best. They cannot send out well-trained collies or other teams to bring people to them. However, people should go to their GPs to get themselves screened. Schools can also play a very important role in the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">The former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, in 2004 established a working group to examine the issue and make recommendations for further action. The group's work has been informed by a wide range of available evidence nationally and internationally, including a major document produced by the Diabetes Federation of Ireland entitled Securing the Future. The national diabetes working group submitted its report to the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, last summer. It was forwarded to the chief executive of the Health Service Executive in October 2005, and the HSE is giving this matter priority. This topic arose last Thursday as my colleague across the floor and others, including Senators Kate Walsh and O'Meara, were present. The situation received a certain acknowledgement.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">We must also take on board the fact that not all parts of the country have the services of a consultant endocrinologist. The midland region, where I happen to reside, is among those without one. As chairman of the Midland Health Board, I remember receiving a deputation with the then deputy CEO with responsibility for community services. The point was made that there was an urgent need for a consultant endocrinologist in the midland region. There are now dialysis services there, but we still require an endocrinologist.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">Type 1 diabetes, formerly known as insulin-dependent diabetes, develops where there is a lack of insulin in the body because the cells that made it have been destroyed. That type of diabetes usually appears before the age of 40 and is treated by insulin injections and diet. The causes of type 1 diabetes are complex and still not clearly understood. People with type 1 diabetes are thought to have an inherited or genetic predisposition to the condition that may remain dormant until activated by an environmental trigger such as a virus or chemical. That starts an attack on the immune system that results in the eventual destruction of the beta cells in the pancreas and subsequent loss of insulin production.</p>
          <p eId="para_621">Type 2 diabetes, formerly known as non-insulin-dependent, develops when the body can still make some insulin, although not enough for its needs, or when the insulin that the body makes is not used properly. We must examine exactly what people do to help themselves. As Senator Henry has said, we must also consider all the services, such as those that deal with problems with the eyes and feet. Statistics have proven that the most common reason for amputation of the lower limbs is type 1 diabetes. Blindness is also a major side-effect of diabetes. There are cardiology and kidney problems and a plethora of others driven by this condition.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">The cost implications of this condition to the economy regarding what it will draw down from health services are mind-boggling, and I do not believe that anyone has realised that. This can only be resolved by all sections of society working together. This crisis rivals that of tuberculosis in the early part of the last century.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FeargalBrowne" eId="spk_199">
          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_623">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and compliment Senator Glynn for his persistence in this matter. Every week he has sought a debate on this topic and tonight he has been accommodated. I also compliment Senator Henry for her well chosen words. She might follow Deputy Twomey's example, leave the Independent benches and join Fine Gael now that we are on our way up and heading for Government. That, however, is an issue for another day.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">Diabetes should make us ask if the Department of Health and Children should deal with health or with disease. I have asked that question many times. Are we the fire brigade extinguishing the blaze or are we preventing the fire in the first place? I hope we are the latter, that we are pro-active.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">The Minister of State and I are taking part in the BUPA Ireland run on Sunday. We must put in place proper facilities for people to encourage them to exercise. The State cannot be held liable for every aspect of the individual's health but it has a responsibility to put proper sporting facilities in place. A school in Carlow applied for a prefabricated classroom but it was turned down and the Department of Education and Science advised the school to divide the school gym into two halves. How are the children supposed to exercise?</p>
          <p eId="para_626">Co-ordinated thinking is required across all Departments, with proper sports facilities at primary and secondary level and on into adult life. We cannot criticise people for not taking exercise when the State does not provide enough facilities. We have a great network of GAA, rugby and soccer clubs but we must keep pushing the sports facilities to allow people to use them. I go running and every time I go out on the roads, I am taking my life in my hands. It is getting more dangerous. All urban areas should have proper running tracks. We must look at the bigger picture instead of spending millions of euro putting the fire out when lesser expenditure would help to prevent the fire in the first place.</p>
          <p eId="para_627">It is estimated that 300,000 people have diabetes and around a third of those are undiagnosed. Fine Gael proposes a national screening programme which would ascertain the extent of the problem and make people aware of it so they can solve it. We recommend periodic health screening for specific age groups. There should be routine health checks and age and gender specific screening for each adult with urine analysis, blood pressure, cholestrol levels, body mass index and blood sugar levels tested.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">These tests are simple and inexpensive but can be effective in detecting illnesses such as diabetes and heart disease. They can also be carried out in the local GP surgery. This national screening programme should begin at 20 years of age for women and 30 for men, with tests to be undertaken at five yearly intervals until age 50 for women, every three years after that until 70 and then every two years after that. For men the tests would be done every five years until age 60 and then every three years until 70, with biannual checks thereafter. We will also push a strong health promotion initiative aimed at reducing obesity and its associated problems such as heart disease and diabetes.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">Senator Glynn's analogy about getting the car checked every year is perfect. People have no difficulty going to a mechanic for their cars but they do not do it for themselves, particularly men. We must get into the habit of going to the doctor on a regular basis and getting tested for diabetes and heart disease. That would help prevent many of the problems later in life.</p>
          <p eId="para_630">Along with Senator Glynn, I met the delegation from the Diabetes Federation of Ireland and was impressed by the great work it does. I was surprised that it only received €63,000 for the year. That should be increased because its work is so worthwhile. A friend of mine with diabetes gets a magazine from the federation every month which contains very useful information. The organisation would certainly benefit from more money.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">I did not understand the references the delegation made to podiatrists but there is a link between undiagnosed diabetes and amputation. That involves very significant costs and people do not want to lose a limb. The federation has recommended 70 podiatrists for the State and we should ensure that figure is met. Some people wait for two years between diagnosis and seeing a consultant. The ideal scenario would be one consultant for every 50,000 but at present we only have one for every 150,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">Unfortunately we also need more paediatric consultants. I attended a talk in Trinity College Dublin by a consultant in St. James's Hospital. He pointed out that diabetes is common in older people but the very worrying trend is that type 2 diabetes, commonly found in people aged 50 and over, is now turning up in teenagers.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">Senator Glynn was correct in his comments on food labelling and food types. In our busy lives we are bombarded with low fat diets and convenience foods but the labelling is not clear. Kellogg's was mentioned and while it has done some good work, I have seen different reports stating that the company's products are not as good as it claims. We no longer have time to analyse this information, we all know we should be cooking fresh vegetables and eating fruit but we do not do it. We should work at EU level to push for clear labelling of food produce and foods that claim to be low in fat should be genuinely tested.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">I phoned a friend of mine who was diagnosed with diabetes at 50 years of age when I saw this debate was coming up and he sang the praises of the service locally. We must push health promotion advertising to explain the symptoms of diabetes because people are not aware they might have it. It is a major difficulty in every health area. My friend had to give up smoking, which he was not too happy about, but he is doing it. We must publicise the symptoms of diabetes and explain the link with blindness and amputation. There is a also need for dieticians.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">I congratulate the Diabetes Federation of Ireland on the great work it is doing; it is holding a conference in Kilkenny on Sunday. I urge the Government to be pro-active because prevention is always better than the cure.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#KateWalsh" eId="spk_200">
          <from>Ms K. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_636">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to these statements. Members of the House know that I use statements on various issues to discuss diabetes. I regard it as an important subject. Therefore, I am delighted we are having this dedicated debate. I wish to pay tribute to my colleague, Senator Glynn. Since he discovered I was a diabetic he has been persistent in having diabetes spoken about in the House and, to a great extent, he has encouraged me to do the same. I do not wish to sound as if I am contradicting anyone but I have been a diabetic for 30 years and neither of my parents were diabetic.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">Diabetes is an illness I have managed for 30 years and I wish to make four specific points. First, it has been noted that there are 250,000 diabetics in Ireland. Nine of out ten have type 2 diabetes. If the trend continues in this way, one third of men in Ireland will face increased risk of diabetes in the next ten years. I continue to stress the point that diabetes must not be thought of as a problem we face in the future. It is a real and current problem in Ireland. That we are having these statements is at least some recognition of that fact. I noted in this House in February that the Diabetes Federation of Ireland told the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children about the need for a national diabetes strategy. I am interested in hearing all views on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">My second point relates to diagnosis. While 250,000 people in Ireland are diabetic, the further 100,000, who are currently undiagnosed, pose a specific challenge. Men, in particular, although not exclusively, are poor when it comes to regular check ups. Would this be as much of a problem if it were more widely known that undiagnosed type 2 diabetes is the primary cause of heart disease, kidney disease, lower limb amputation and blindness in those under 65? People must go for a check up. Diabetes is detected by a simple blood test which is quick and relatively painless, but so important. Until we begin to tire of stating this message, we have not said it often enough. People should check their family history of diabetes, look at their levels of physical activity and realise that the likelihood of developing diabetes goes up with age. I would have thought I did enough running around here to have fulfilled my exercise quota for the day but, according to Senators Glynn and Browne, and possibly Senator O'Meara, I have not done enough. I will not, however, walk to Celbridge.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">My third point relates to the less well-known effects of diabetes. In 2003, it is estimated that there were 900 inpatient discharges for diabetes. This treatment cost over €3.5 million. That is a cost of over €4,500 for each diabetic. We cannot ignore the implications. Financial cost is not the most important issue but it cannot be ignored. My fourth point is that early diagnosis of diabetes will have profound consequences for our wider health service in that there will be fewer eye problems, lower levels of cardiovascular disease, fewer amputations and fewer cases of renal failure.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">The Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children has worked hard on this issue for all the right reasons. She has expressed her concern and, more importantly, her commitment to dealing with diabetes. We know that chronic illness must be managed in our communities. Admission to hospital for diabetes has increased by one third annually while we know the most appropriate way to deal with the illness is at community level.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">As I stated in this House two months ago, I understand a major element of the negotiations held with doctors was on how chronic illness can be managed at primary care level. I commend the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, the Ministers of State and the Department on their work and initiatives in dealing with diabetes. I also wish to repeat the most important messages. Diabetes is detected by a simple blood test, people should check their family history and levels of physical activity, and the likelihood of developing diabetes increases with age.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#KathleenOMeara" eId="spk_201">
          <from>Ms O’Meara</from>
          <p eId="para_642">I welcome the Minister of State and the opportunity to speak in this important debate. Like other Senators, I commend Senator Glynn on his perseverance in regard to this issue, his insistence on constantly raising it, bringing to public attention and having it considered. I was not aware of the figures until I read the Minister of State's speech and listened to other Senators. There is no question but that this is a serious public health issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">I wish to limit my remarks to the growth of type 2 diabetes, because there is a major distinction between the two types. We need to consider the reasons for the growth of type 2 diabetes and the implications for the health service and, as other Senators said, the economic implications. The Minister of State did not mention the cost in his speech. How much does it cost to treat people with type 2 diabetes? While most are treated at primary care level, it must be possible to calculate the cost. The cost of cigarette smoking has been calculated, so I hope every effort is being made by the Department to calculate the cost to the taxpayer and the Exchequer of the growth of type 2 diabetes.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">We need to consider the growth of childhood diabetes. As Senator Browne said, people who we would not have expected to develop diabetes until possibly their 60s are now developing it at a much younger age. There is a very worrying trend in regard to the growth of childhood diabetes which is linked to diet and exercise and which is preventable. In other words, we can do something about it, but clearly we are not doing so.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">I am a parent and I know of the pressures on the modern family, which Senator Browne mentioned. There is often a tendency to buy fast food and put it in the microwave. When one eats such food one is unaware of the amount of added sugar and salt in it. Given our increased affluence and prosperity, more people go out to dinner and our diet has probably become less healthy. Growing up, we had a very plain eating regime but children nowadays would not put up with it. Fizzy drinks should be banned in schools and fizzy drinks machines should be removed from them. A clear message should be sent to children about healthy eating yet we are not doing enough in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">I am very concerned about the growth of childhood diabetes. A task force on obesity has been established and, clearly, there is an issue in terms of weight, exercise and unhealthy lifestyle. We must look at how we will transform the situation because we are not doing enough in that regard. Every now and then, there is a spate of advertising, talk about the healthy eating pyramid, the fact we need to eat more of this and that, and about using the stairs instead of the lift. RTE also broadcasts good programmes on healthy living. However, we are only skimming the surface. We must recognise we have a major problem on our hands. Unless we treat it as a major problem, it will not be responded to as such. It will be regarded as a problem for somebody else to worry about.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">Given that type 2 diabetes is preventable, it is inexcusable that we are not dealing with the issue. When we look at the issue of lifestyle, we probably need to look at the broader issue of the pressure families are under. It is possible families do not have enough time to cook a healthy meal — hence the increase in the consumption of fast food, the number of people going out to eat and the number of fast food outlets. While there is nothing wrong with having a burger and chips occasionally, we all know that in some cases it becomes the regular diet, which is not acceptable. Let us consider how we can make our schools and workplaces healthy. We are doing our children a disservice by not taking this matter seriously because they will be left with a lifetime of illness and possibly a reduced life expectancy.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">I thank all those involved in bringing about this debate. I hope it will generate the kind of action that needs to be taken.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#DrMauriceHayes" eId="spk_204">
          <from>Dr. M. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_651">I commend to the Minister of State an interview with Jack Gilroy in last weekend's <i>Sunday Independent</i>. Mr. Gilroy is a former Dublin footballer who lost both legs as a result of diabetes. His story is quite harrowing and his problem stems from a sweet tooth.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">Diabetes is an epidemic. Obesity is creeping up on us and if we do not get a grip on it, it will overwhelm the acute services. It will affect almost every field, including the renal, cardiovascular and ocular services. Money invested to address the problem now will save enormous sums in the future. Any analysis of health economics would lead one to this conclusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">One worries when one sees the level of obesity among children, even those of ten years. It is caused by a combination of what they eat and a lack of exercise. Children are being driven to school whereas they walked in the old days. I can understand why parents drive their children to school but if they were encouraged to walk safely it would get rid of a lot of environmental pollution in addition to fat.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">My wife was a supply teacher some years ago and introduced a rule that her pupils could drink nothing but water. The consequent lowering in the rate of hyperactivity among the children was amazing. When my own grandchildren are given sweets, they jump up and down for an hour thereafter.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">It is important to encourage people to take the test for diabetes. If general practitioners were given a quota of patients to test for diabetes, collie dogs would not be needed. The general practitioners would bring the patients in themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">I did a study of acute hospital services in the North some years ago and also spent considerable time studying private practice. I noted a model example of the handling of diabetes at primary care level in a practice in Crossmaglen in south Armagh, the name of which I could circulate. There was an absolutely wonderful diabetes nurse and she was able to manage a high number of diabetics, even advanced diabetics, in the community, thereby keeping them out of hospital. The key was that she had a close relationship with an endocrinologist in a hospital, who was able to respond. The two must work together. I would commend this model to anyone looking for a model of good practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">I congratulate the Minister of State on what has been done. The subject needs to be treated tremendously seriously. As Senator O'Meara stated, it is a question of lifestyle. As well as looking after diabetics, one must try to change people's lifestyles and encourage them to eat and live more healthily.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">I support Senator Henry's plea for foot care services. Foot problems are the primary cause of immobility and there is more need for foot care services among diabetics than among any other group. Eye services are ancillary but both types of services are very important. I ask the Minister of State to tackle the problem of diabetes at school level and through primary care.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanPower" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_205">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. S. Power)</from>
          <p eId="para_659">I thank Senator Glynn for arranging this debate and thank the other Senators for their very constructive and extremely helpful contributions. Diabetes is a very serious issue and one would like to think this debate will generate debate outside the House. The more exposure the subject gets, the better.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">Senator Henry made a number of points and one would always have to respect her opinion on matters medical. She stressed the need for greater emphasis on haemochromatosis in the diabetes strategy. She and others referred to obesity and the need for increased physical activity. Physical activity can involve a practice as simple as walking. Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons, people are not walking nearly as much as they used to. We will have to change this situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">Senator Glynn mentioned the expert advisory group. Its existence is an indication of the seriousness with which we are treating diabetes. He also mentioned the need for an extra endocrinologist in the Mullingar area. We appreciate the benefits this would afford and we will certainly consider it.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">Senator Browne mentioned the necessity to increase the number of podiatrists and the issue of food labelling. He also mentioned the need for an information campaign on this matter. He referred to the experience of a friend who discovered he was a diabetic but who was very appreciative of the type of service available to him. It is heartening to know this type of service is available.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">Senator Browne asked whether we are putting out the fire or preventing it. Unfortunately both approaches are required. Diabetics cannot be ignored and we do not want to ignore them, and it is therefore important to provide them with the service they need while encouraging others to take steps to prevent themselves from needing it. Their current lifestyle will determine how healthy they will be in later life.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">Senator Kate Walsh, a diabetic, gave us some idea of the difficulties diabetics experience and also stressed the importance and value of early diagnosis. We all agree with her in this respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">Senator O'Meara asked about costs. While I do not have the relevant figures to hand, I acknowledge that her question is important. Unfortunately when considering the provision of service, the cost always comes into the equation somewhere along the line. It can often determine the type or level of service provided. We should forget about the cost for a moment and consider the effect on the life of a person who develops diabetes, which is impossible to quantify. The Senator asked the question and we will try to get some more information. In 2003 it was estimated that we had 900 inpatient discharges for diabetics, for which the cost worked out at approximately €3.5 million, which represents a cost of slightly more than €4,500 per patient. I will try to get more specific and accurate figures. The Senator also mentioned the need to expand health promotion.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">Senator Maurice Hayes spoke about his wife who banned fizzy drinks in the classroom and the obvious benefit in a short period. A number of schools have been very proactive in dealing with the matter. They have encouraged children with initiatives such as having a particular day when only healthy foods are allowed. Many parents have learnt from their children rather than the reverse. They are much more educated and aware than pupils would have been in previous years.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">I thank the Members for their contributions. Diabetes is a lifelong condition that impacts on almost every aspect of life. It can affect all ages and cases have been diagnosed in babies as young as 12 months. Type 2 diabetes accounts for 90% of all cases and it is widely acknowledged that the increase in this disease can be attributed to our aging population and the rise in the incidence of obesity. The effect of the disease on the individual has been well documented. However, the impact on the health service is also substantial with, for example, an increase of 32% in hospital admissions in the past three years.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">GPs and primary care services have an essential role in diagnosing and treating patients with diabetes. Early interventions can minimise many of the effects of the disease. An integrated service involving hospital and primary care will ensure the best outcome for patients and this in addition to other recommendations has been documented in the strategy produced by the Department of Health and Children. The response of the HSE to the strategy has been swift with the imminent establishment of an expert advisory group.</p>
          <p eId="para_669">The HSE has identified priorities, including the development of a mechanism for the identification of high-risk patients and the expansion of the screening programme for diabetic retinopathy. Funding has been secured to develop a self-care and management network for patients with diabetes in each of the four administrative areas for the development of multidisciplinary community intervention teams for diabetes.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">On the question of personal health, many things happen to people who become ill. This is one area in which people have certain control and their lifestyle choices will influence their health. We must encourage people to balance their lives in every respect and particularly in diet and physical activity. Both Government and local authorities must make it an easy option for people. With the long evenings it is much easier for people to take exercise. However, to cater for the winter nights, we need to ensure that we build housing estates with walkways that are well lit so that people can feel secure when taking exercise. Facilities such as walkways and playing pitches must be made more plentiful and accessible. It is our duty to encourage people to live healthier lifestyles, which is what we are trying to do. While we have had some success, it is important that we build on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">The HSE has prioritised diabetes and the effects of this will become apparent as services become integrated and more accessible. I am optimistic that the rise in the incidence of diabetes can be halted and reversed and that the effects can be minimised and maintained at levels that enable people to go about their everyday lives.</p>

          <p eId="para_674">I am glad we are discussing this issue in the Seanad this evening and I am delighted the Minister of State at the Department of Transport is here to outline the details of his discussions with the Dublin Airport Authority. However, it saddens me that we need to have this discussion at all. It would have been much better if we could have considered the sale of Great Southern Hotels not as a disposal, but in the context of moving forward. We should be discussing making a decision as to what we could do to support the hotel group, which has been central to the development of tourism and industry here.</p>
          <p eId="para_675">The Minister of State knows I have a deep interest in the success of the hotels run by Great Southern Hotels on the outskirts of Galway city and in Eyre Square. Both hotels have played an enormous role in the development of the city. It is insane that the Dublin Airport Authority can now suddenly decide to asset-strip all such assets by selling them to the highest bidder. Are we becoming a country of developers or will we focus on sustainable development? We should ensure that we sustain development in that area for our children and our tourism industry. We should value the work and effort put in by more than 660 employees in the group in the country. While in the past the group made considerable profits, it is true that it is going through a difficult period. No Government or authority can sustain losses of €6 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">I appeal to the Minister of State to tell the Dublin Airport Authority a number of things. Why do we need to sell the assets? I remind the Minister of State that the railway line from Galway city to Clifden was torn up. We got rid of that asset yet people in Galway are now asking why we did not keep it. The same issues will arise when we sell the Great Southern Hotels. People will ask why we did not keep the Corrib Great Southern Hotel. We could have developed its tourism and conference business. It is on seven or eight acres of land in State ownership. We could have done something with it and instead we are letting it go to the highest bidder, which could result in British chain stores coming into the Great Southern Hotel in Eyre Square.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">What kind of image of Ireland is that to sell to the world? We will become like any high street in the UK. Where is our uniqueness? Where is our tourism going?</p>
          <p eId="para_678">Why are we selling these assets? Next, the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children will decide we no longer need Merlin Park Hospital and it will be sold to get money. We do not need the money. We do not need to get rid of the assets. We do not need to sell Great Southern Hotels in a willy-nilly way that solves problems for Dublin Airport Authority and does nothing for the rest of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_679">There has been no talk of what the authority will do with the money. If we decide to sell the hotels where will the money go? It certainly will not come to Galway. Who created the asset? It was in State ownership. While it might be acceptable for the authority to take back the money invested by it and by CIE, the profits and the additional value accruing due to property valuations need to stay in Galway city.</p>
          <p eId="para_680">If we must sell the Great Southern Hotels we must look after the staff, people who have given their entire lives to the group. They are entitled to be cared for, as they are employees of the State. If we are to sell the hotels, I demand that the money stay in Galway. I also demand that the hotels be sold as a going concern and that some of the hotels are kept so that we can continue to build and sustain the tourism industry in the west. We are losing bed nights to Dublin and the east of this country on a nightly and weekly basis. We need to stop this division between east and west and stand on our own two feet. We need to demand the things to which we are entitled. We are entitled to retain the Great Southern Hotels group in State ownership. We are entitled to ensure that the group's assets are not stripped and sold to the highest bidder. If that happens, however — I accept with a certain sense of inevitability that it will happen, through no choice of mine — the staff must be looked after and the money that is received on foot of those assets should not be sold to fund the Dublin Airport Authority's pension fund. Such money should not be invested in the development of Dublin Airport — it should return to County Galway and the city of Galway.</p>
          <p eId="para_681">This is not just a Galway issue. My colleague, Senator Coghlan, who is not present this evening, has supported me consistently on this issue. We have supported each other — it is not as if I am leading the way in this regard. He has fought the fight for County Kerry and the Great Southern Hotel in Killarney. We are on the same page. We agree completely about this situation. We cannot let it go. These are State assets. The Government should tell Dublin Airport Authority that it cannot proceed in the manner that has been suggested. I look forward to hearing the response of the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher.</p>

        <speech by="#PatTheCope" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Transport" eId="spk_209">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Mr. Gallagher)</from>
          <p eId="para_682">I thank Senator Cox for raising this issue and giving me an opportunity to respond to her comments. As the House is aware, the Great Southern Hotels group is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Dublin Airport Authority. The chairman of the authority informed the Taoiseach and the Minister for Transport last February that the board of the GSH group had decided that it had no option, in the best interest of all its stakeholders, other than to sell the hotel chain as a going concern. The board took that decision with regard to the company's poor financial performance, the negative outlook for the business and the inability of the board of the authority to continue to support Great Southern Hotels financially. The chairman of the authority informed the Minister at that time that his board had endorsed the decision of the board of the GSH group and concluded that it should facilitate the orderly disposal of the hotels as a going concern. The authority has informed the Minister that it has decided to continue to provide financial support to the GSH group this year, to facilitate the continuation of normal operations and an orderly process of disposal of the hotels. The group has assured all its staff, customers and business partners that it intends to operate normally during the disposal process.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">The Minister, Deputy Cullen, has been informed by the Dublin Airport Authority that a process of full engagement with staff and unions on the implications of the board's decision is under way. The Government and the Minister have been aware for some time of the difficulties and challenges facing the GSH group in a competitive and changing hotel market, in which holidaymakers and business travellers are offered a great range and choice of hotel and other accommodation at home and abroad. The Government took note of the authority's assessment that the orderly disposal of the hotels, as a going concern, offers the best opportunity for the hotels to reach their full potential in the niche markets to which they are best suited. The disposal will also enable the hotels to contribute to the development of tourism in their localities and to their communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">The Great Southern Hotel group has retained advisers to examine all aspects of the proposed disposal of the hotels. The Minister understands that the executive chairman of the group and the advisers, together with the senior management of the group, have visited all the hotels and met the staff to discuss the difficulties being faced by the GSH group and the implications of the decision to dispose of the hotels. A programme will be put in place to minimise the impact of the decision on the day-to-day business of the hotels. The Minister recently met trade union representatives from the GSH group to discuss their concerns about the future of the hotels. He understands that meetings have also taken place between the unions and the Dublin Airport Authority and that further discussions are planned. That the authority has given an assurance that it will continue to support the hotels financially during the rest of this year is a clear indication that the hotels are unable to support themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">I accept the points made by Senator Cox, who has a deep interest in the Great Southern Hotels group. I am quite familiar with the Eyre Square and Corrib hotels and I appreciate that they have played a great part in the development of the city of Galway. I assure the Senator that I will convey her concerns about the staff and the future of the hotels to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Cullen, who will convey them in turn to the Dublin Airport Authority. I reiterate that the decision that was taken by the GSH group was endorsed by the authority and noted by the Government. I assure Senator Cox that the Minister and I will monitor the situation closely.</p>

        <speech by="#UlickBurke" eId="spk_210">
          <from>Mr. U. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_686">I thank the Cathaoirleach for selecting this matter for debate on the Adjournment. I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, to the House to discuss a project in County Galway that has been promised for a long time. The circumstances in Kinvara Bay are unique. The continued discharge of raw sewage into the bay must be an embarrassment to Galway County Council and to the Government. This matter was brought to the attention of the European Commission, which warned the council that it would take action against it if something was not done within a particular period of time. That period of time has elapsed, however, without any indication from the council or the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government that anything is about to happen. Kinvara Bay is unique because it has inner and outer sections, with protective currents which ensure that the sewage that is pumped into the bay is retained. The levels of pollution in the bay are greater than those in normal bays, in which the water is kept clean to some degree by the regular removal of sewage by the tides. That process does not happen in Kinvara Bay. The visual impact of the retention of sewage is as severe as its impact on water quality. Many studies have been done at Kinvara Bay. The quality of its water has been tested on numerous occasions by the former health board and more recently by the Health Service Executive. All such tests have found that the quality of water at Kinvara Bay is far below the levels required by the EU. The bay is highly polluted.</p>
          <p eId="para_687">We have been waiting for a long time for the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to release the preliminary report that was submitted by Galway County Council. The Department has given permission to local authorities to pursue projects costing less than €5 million. The Kinvara Bay project would cost approximately €3 million. I have raised this issue to allow the Minister of State to indicate that the council may proceed with the planned works at Kinvara Bay, thereby alleviating a serious problem. The fishing grounds at the bay are already gone. Kinvara Bay used to be a renowned area for shellfish, including oysters and shrimps, but nobody eats shellfish from the bay now because it is so polluted. There was a time when one could swim in Kinvara Bay, right into the quays, but that is no longer possible because of the health risks involved. The waters of the bay have traditionally been quite important for recreational activities such as boating, but such activities have ceased because people have been warned of the potential health risks associated with the poor quality of the waters. I am sure Senator Kitt is very familiar with the problem there as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_688">I ask the Minister of State to release the project and indicate to Galway County Council that it should progress matters. Galway County Council, in a recent statement from one of its officials, has stated that the wheels are turning. However, they have been turning in Kinvara for so long that it must be a very large wheel that has allowed matters to continue as they have over the years. Many people have made representations to the Department on the issue. I hope the Minister of State can indicate that work on this project may commence immediately.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. B. O’Keeffe)</from>
          <p eId="para_689">I thank Senator Burke for raising what is obviously a very important issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_690">My Department's Water Services Investment Programme 2005-07, published last December, includes some 60 major water and sewerage schemes, with a value of over €451 million for Galway. Over the years the Department has delegated more and more responsibilities to local authorities to speed up the procurement of new water services infrastructure. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, and I have recently greatly extended this devolution of functions when we announced that for every project in the water services investment programme valued under €5 million, local authorities will henceforth be entitled, after they receive preliminary approval, to proceed right through to construction without further reference to the Department. This gives local authorities the power to advance individual schemes with considerably reduced involvement by the Department. The result should be a significant speeding up of the process for hundreds of individual smaller schemes — from drawing board through to completion. More importantly, it will mean that the Department's expertise can be concentrated on advancing the bigger and more costly projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">The Kinvara sewerage scheme is included, at an estimated cost of €2.8 million, to start construction in 2007 in the Department's current water services investment programme. It might be worth having a word with the officials in Galway because additional information has been requested from Galway County Council in order to allow a decision to be made on the revised preliminary report for the scheme received from the council. Perhaps the Senator might talk to the county manager, because the sooner the council gets the information to the Department, matters can be advanced to the construction stage in line with the revised procedures we have put in place. I hope this clarifies the position for the Senator and I assure him that a decision will be made on the preliminary report and a response issued to the council as quickly as possible after receipt of the necessary information.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kitt</from>
          <p eId="para_692">I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this issue and I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, for coming into the House to reply. I am talking about the village of Creggs on the border of Galway and Roscommon. It is well known, <i>inter alia</i>, for being the place where Charles Stewart Parnell made his last public speech before he died. I commend the historical society in Creggs for establishing a heritage centre in memory of Parnell.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">This village is unique in catering for a wide variety of sporting bodies. As well as GAA and other sports, it is well known for its rugby teams. The Cathaoirleach will be interested to know that the principal of the school in Creggs was the late Mattie McDonagh. The school won the <i>Irish Independent</i> Building for the Future competition.</p>
          <p eId="para_694">I want to point out that this is a CLÁR area where there is priority for certain developments in towns covered by the programme where the population has fallen over the years. For that reason it is a village that needs a sewerage scheme in order to develop. I am making a strong case this evening to have it included. The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, has visited the town of Creggs with me on a number of occasions. He announced that Creggs was in the CLÁR programme and has helped out in many ways, particularly as regards grants given to some of the sporting bodies in the town. I ask the Minister of State to progress the scheme, if he can, particularly as regards the CLÁR priorities and also regarding the necessary developments that the people of Creggs wish to undertake.</p>

        <speech by="#BattOKeeffe" eId="spk_213" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government">
          <from>Mr. B. O’Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_695">I want to thank Senator Kitt for raising this issue and for his ongoing interest in matters such as these in his Galway constituency. My Department continues to invest heavily in modern water services infrastructure to support social and economic development. The Water Services Investment Programme 2005-07 includes some 60 major water and sewerage schemes with a value of over €451 million for Galway. Many areas of the county, such as Carna-Kilkieran, Tuam and Headford will now benefit from improved water supplies. Also included are new regional water supply schemes for Costelloe, Gort, Ballinasloe, Clifden, Loughrea, Dunmore-Glenamaddy and Portumna.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">In addition, towns and village such as Athenry, Ballinasloe, Barna, Carraroe, Clifden, Glenamaddy, Headford, Kinvara, Milltown, Oughterard and Tuam can also look forward to new or upgraded sewerage schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">When selecting individual projects for approval as part of the water services investment programme, the Department takes into account the priorities identified by the local authorities concerned. In this case, Creggs sewerage scheme was fourth on the list of schemes submitted by Galway County Council in response to the Department's request in 2003 to local authorities to produce updated and prioritised assessments of new infrastructural needs in their areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_698">The local authorities' assessments of needs are the main input to the ranking of individual schemes by the Department. This process has resulted in Galway County Council currently having an extensive package of works for which formal departmental approval has been given and for which the necessary Exchequer funding is in place. The €451 million worth of projects to be completed over the next few years will transform the quality and coverage of the county's water and waste water infrastructure and will comprehensively deal with the essential infrastructural requirements the council has prioritised. Given the level of competing demand for the available funding, however, and the relating low priority afforded to the Creggs scheme by the council, it was not possible to include it in the water services investment programme at that time.</p>
          <p eId="para_699">On the positive side, I must emphasise that the current Water Services Investment Programme 2005-07 is part of an ongoing three-year strategy that is rolled forward at regular intervals. New schemes continue to be added to future phases of the programme in line with prevailing priorities identified by local authorities and national requirements. In this context, local authorities have recently been requested to undertake new assessments of their needs and priorities which will be taken into account when framing the next phase of the water services investment programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_700">It is important for the Senator to have a dialogue with Galway County Council to ensure it gives the Creggs the priority he is saying it deserves. If the Senator does that, I can assure him that I have listened carefully to what he has said as regards the Creggs sewerage scheme, and that it will be borne in mind when the next roll-out of the investment programme is being prepared.</p>

          <p eId="para_701">I thank the Minister of State and ask him to bear in mind what I have said as regards Creggs being a CLÁR area. I believe there should be some priority and if the council makes that case. I trust that he and the Department's officials will take on board the fact that Creggs is a CLÁR area.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. O’Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_702">Obviously, it is of extreme importance that Galway County Council prioritises this scheme and makes its case on the basis of the importance of the CLÁR scheme. If that is done, the Department will look very favourably on it in terms of including the scheme in the next programme.</p>
