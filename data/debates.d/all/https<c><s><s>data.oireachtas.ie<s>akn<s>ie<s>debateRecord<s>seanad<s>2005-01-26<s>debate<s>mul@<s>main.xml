          <p eId="para_1">I have received notice from Senator Wilson that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2">The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to outline the steps that will be taken to secure replacement jobs in view of the closure of Ezy Koter Limited, Virginia, County Cavan.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">I have also received notice from Senator Henry of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline the reasons for the inadequate funding and staffing of the Jonathan Swift centre for psychiatric patients attached to St. James's Hospital, Dublin 8.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">I have also received notice from Senator Ulick Burke of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to provide funding to the Health Service Executive for the provision of a health and day care centre on the site owned by County Galway Vocational Education Committee at Gort, County Galway, and to indicate if funding was sought for this project by the former Western Health Board.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">I have also received notice from Senator MacSharry of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_8">The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to establish an employment task force for Sligo, given that 80 jobs have been lost in Saehan Media over the past eight months with a further 70 redundancies announced yesterday.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">I have also received notice from Senator Cummins of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_10">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to assess the provision of resources for Waterford County Council to comply with EPA guidelines for the remediation of landfill sites in Dungarvan and Tramore.</p>
          <p eId="para_11">I regard the matters raised by Senators Wilson, Henry, Burke and MacSharry as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected the matters raised by Senators Wilson, Henry and Burke and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator MacSharry may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise. I regret I must rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Cummins as the Minister has no official responsibility in the matter.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_5">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_16">I welcome the decision of the President to refer the Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2004 to the Supreme Court to test its constitutionality. Calls were made in this House before the Christmas recess requesting the President to do so. She has shown excellent judgment in asking the court to look at this Bill and test its constitutionality.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">I am aware a debate has been organised in the Dáil today on the appalling tragedy of the tsunami in south-east Asia which we all saw on our television screens since the House last met before Christmas. Will the Leader provide an opportunity in this House, either tomorrow or early next week, for us to hear the response of the Government? There has been a tremendous outpouring of goodwill and funds by ordinary people and the Government to the victims of that natural disaster. However, it is important for the people to hear of Parliament's solidarity with the international community, the people of the region and the NGOs that work there. Our solidarity must comprise more than just an immediate response. We must think and plan long term for the recovery of the region and the entire developed community. I ask the Leader to consider a debate on the issue either tomorrow or next week.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">Much has happened with regard to Northern Ireland since we last met. While we had an excellent debate before Christmas, I wonder if it would be useful for the Government to have a debate on the issue in the House to see how best we can move forward. Matters have moved on and there is now absolute clarity and political consensus that Sinn Féin-IRA must decide for themselves what they want to do as a political paramilitary organisation and how best they want to use their talents. The crystallising moment for me over the Christmas period was the emergence of the broad national consensus that Sinn Féin-IRA must decide their true path.</p>
          <p eId="para_19">I urge the Government to continue to take a tough line on Sinn Féin-IRA in terms of talks and to remove concessions granted to them before Christmas, notably the concession relating to the early release of the killers of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe. I also urge it to examine alternatives that will best allow the Northern Ireland Assembly to meet, although it is impossible that a joint government could be established at this time. The SDLP has produced an interesting alternative which would allow the Assembly to get back up and running under a committee system where the Governments would appoint various heads of departments. The vacuum must be filled. There are moderate voices in Northern Ireland that have put forward moderate proposals for this vacuum. I ask the Government to consider the matter and to organise a debate through which we can contribute.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">Last week the Fine Gael Party produced figures from Revenue — Senator O'Toole produced another angle on the story — whereby approximately €1.3 billion is owed to PAYE taxpayers who have made overpayments to Revenue. Will the Government initiate a campaign through Revenue to ensure the office has the same enthusiasm in terms of returning to PAYE taxpayers the significant amounts owed to them as it has in pursuing those who have underpaid over a period of time? We must have an active campaign in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">We must also amend last year's Finance Act which now makes it impossible for a PAYE taxpayer to seek a rebate more than four years after the time at which he or she makes his or her application. The Minister for Finance must focus on this issue through Revenue. It is appalling that such significant sums of money can be taken by Revenue from the PAYE sector without recourse or redress. That is wrong and we must stand up and say so.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_6">
          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_22">I welcome the support from Fine Gael on this issue. I have been dealing with Revenue on the matter for the past number of months and have had great difficulty establishing the actual position. We are going to invite the Revenue before the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service to answer some of the questions raised by Senator Brian Hayes and which were also raised by me last week with Revenue and publicly. It is disgraceful that the people whom we entrust to look after our interests in terms of taxation are not balanced in their approach. There will be time for another discussion on the matter. We will return to that matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">We have talked twice in the past two years about the need to deal with the libel laws. I speak from a disinterested position on the matter. For the past number of months a tabloid Sunday newspaper has been conducting an extraordinary witch-hunt against a member of Government. I do not know the rights or wrongs of the matter but I have a simple view that if a member of Government is found through due process and proper investigation to have breached the required standards of ethics, probity or accountability, and if that is proven to be the case, that person should resign.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">Opposition parties who have spoken on this matter have shown extraordinary responsibility and have helped the image of politics during a bad week. Representatives of the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party refused to jump on a bandwagon which attempted to cast a slur on aspects of a Minister's life which had no bearing whatsoever on his job. If he is found to have acted wrongly or to be in breach of ethics or probity, then he will have to go, but that decision is to be made in another place. We should never be seen to run in front of the media and we should remind ourselves of this the next time we deal with reform of the libel laws. I am completely disinterested in this matter but the things that have been done to this person do not serve journalism or the public interest in any way. I cannot understand how this can be done within the current libel laws without any redress being available to the person in the middle. Many articles were not even connected to the story in the vaguest of ways. I would like to return to this issue again and it is important that we do so.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_7">
          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_25">It is some 12 or 15 years since I was suspended from the House for describing a particular individual as a disgrace. Now that he is locked up in Arbour Hill, I presume I can safely say he is a disgrace without the threat of sanction. I am happy to be able to say it.</p>
          <p eId="para_26">I hope the appalling tragedy in the Indian Ocean and south-east Asia has opened our eyes to the question of interdependency in the world and the need for us to realise that poverty anywhere impoverishes and threatens the stability of the whole planet. The sense of solidarity we have witnessed is perhaps the best positive sign of globalisation that we have seen since the term was coined and it has been turned into institutions and arrangements. I would welcome a reasonably long debate on what this response says about public opinion and about us. The money the Government has pledged is very welcome and I compliment it on its response. However, I appeal to the Leader to clarify the point, which is a difficult one, that this is extra money rather than funding which will go missing from other projects some time during 2005. That is not what the people did because charities can confirm that donations to them at Christmas were as generous as ever. People just gave more money because they felt more was needed. They are entitled to a similar response from Government, which I hope will be the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_27">I want to be restrained on Northern Ireland but I am being pushed to the limits of my patience from a position of considerable sympathy. I cannot understand how any organisation can expect to be accepted into the democratic community when it is not prepared to say that all of its components agree to do nothing which would threaten the personal safety and property rights of citizens. It is extraordinary that anybody could believe there was room for his or her organisation in the normal democratic process when one of its components was unwilling to commit itself to that position. The reason we need such a debate is that a view seems to prevail that, whenever there is a crisis in Northern Ireland, the worst thing Members of the Oireachtas can do is talk about it. However, every experience we have had in this House indicates that the opposite is the case. Every Member of this House speaks with considerable restraint and seriousness about such serious issues. I appeal to the Leader to provide the House with an opportunity to hear the Government's detailed views about the process by which a significant player in Northern Ireland has run away from what seems to the rest of us to be self-evident, namely, a commitment not to do harm to other people's lives, safety or property.</p>
          <p eId="para_28">Will the Leader ask the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to intervene in the dispute at An Post to ensure that whomever in senior management seems to be intent on manufacturing confrontation after confrontation is invited to go elsewhere? This would ensure that sensible discussions could take place between trade unions which I know want to be reasonable and people in management who can satisfy the rest of us that they want to be reasonable. I am no longer satisfied that senior management at An Post want to be reasonable.</p>

        <speech by="#PaschalMooney" eId="spk_8">
          <from>Mr. Mooney</from>
          <p eId="para_29">I support Senator Brian Hayes's request for a debate on the tsunami disaster. I also hope that the spirit of solidarity he asked be extended to the debate would equally include support for the newly promoted Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Conor Lenihan, whose actions have been exemplary. This is an opportunity to avoid scoring more cheap shots about his taking a couple of days off for a family holiday.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_9">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_30">I hope the Senator is not suggesting I did so.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaschalMooney" eId="spk_10">
          <from>Mr. Mooney</from>
          <p eId="para_31">No, I am not. However, this is an opportunity to respond because such comments were cheap shots in the circumstances because, although I know the nature of politics, the Minister of State is very committed to his work.</p>
          <p eId="para_32">I also support the requests for a debate on Northern Ireland in light of all that has happened in the past three to four weeks. This House has always treated debates on Northern Ireland with great sensitivity. I appreciate that the Government and the Taoiseach have been responsible for Northern Ireland policy and take initiatives. However, the events of recent weeks represent a crisis in the peace process and raise questions for the first time among this generation of Irish people about the true nature of that with which we have been living since the foundation of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_33">We have been somewhat inured and protected from the reality of what is the IRA and its political wing, Sinn Féin, as a result of the ceasefires, the Good Friday Agreement and all that has followed — all of which we all welcome and enthusiastically embrace. This is not to take a cheap shot at Sinn Féin but, as a representative of a Border county, I was not at all surprised that the party makes a distinction between what is wrong and what is a crime. As many of my colleagues from the Border counties will affirm, I am not surprised at Sinn Féin's and the IRA's attitude that the latter is the legitimate army and the former is the legitimate Government of this country. They have always believed that to be the case. This attitude has never changed — it has just been kept quiet — and has been accepted after a fashion in order to get the political wing of the IRA into the political process.</p>
          <p eId="para_34">Now we are faced with a crisis and this House should take the initiative because we are elected politicians. We represent democratic values, which values it seems are now questionable within the republican movement until it clarifies its position further. It would be a useful and important exercise to send a message to all those outside this House. If we were to have a measured, ordered debate to discuss the alternatives and the way forward in the peace process, which would be helpful to the Government, we would be representing the overwhelming view of the Irish people on the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_35">In a week in which the rest of Europe is commemorating the 60th anniversary of the Holocaust and the liberation of Auschwitz, this House should also take note of it and I hope the Leader will acknowledge it. Although Ireland was neutral during the Second World War, it was proactively neutral. Thousands of brave Irish people contributed to the downfall of fascism. Although more emphasis is placed on those who were gassed at Auschwitz as coming from central Europe, one Irish citizen was gassed there. She was a lady, born and reared in the Jewish community in Dublin's South Circular Road, who married a Dutch man. It hit this country too. It is vitally important, particularly with the threats to the democratic values we all espouse and value, that we continue to recognise, acknowledge and remember what happened at Auschwitz and the other concentration camps across Europe.</p>

        <speech by="#PaddyBurke" as="#Leas-Chathaoirleach" eId="spk_11">
          <from>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</from>
          <p eId="para_36">As a number of Senators have indicated they wish to raise matters, I ask Members to be as brief as possible.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelFinucane" eId="spk_12">
          <from>Mr. Finucane</from>
          <p eId="para_37">The jailing of Ray Burke for tax evasion has already been raised. However, I wish to raise the matter of the debate that took place in 1997 when Ray Burke was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs. I believed then that the Taoiseach made a serious error of judgment. While the Taoiseach now claims the benefit of hindsight, in 1997 he had the benefit of Mr. Albert Reynolds's experience as Taoiseach. Former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, decided for various reasons not to appoint Ray Burke to a ministerial position. It is interesting that in the past few days Mr. Reynolds has expressed those reservations again. At the time, the Taoiseach was critical of Deputy John Bruton and the other Opposition leaders who questioned this appointment. They have now being proved right. The Taoiseach claimed people were hounding Ray Burke out of a ministerial position. The Taoiseach made a serious error of judgment. He should accept this, instead of now trying to muddy the waters about what actually happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_38">Many Members will recently have received their ESB bills, which they should question seriously. Several years ago, a regulator was appointed to decide on various electricity price increases and to determine the factors behind them. Over the past four years, the energy regulator has allowed the ESB to increase its charges by 45%. This is a phenomenal amount of money. Every time the ESB requests a price increase, which it has done every year in the past four, the regulator puts up his hands and grants the increases. We speak of the liberalisation of the electricity market. As it has not happened, it is a farce. Full liberalisation of the market is to take place in February. Members should not hold their breath for any significant decrease in electricity costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_39">Rather than commissioning another report, of which there are already many, it is incumbent on the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, to inform the House as to how he intends to tackle this situation. We are losing competitiveness in the marketplace. Not only are business consumers concerned, so too are domestic consumers, hammered by these charges. The Minister must not put up his hands and surrender to the energy regulator. He must inform the House as to how he intends to reduce electricity prices.</p>

          <p eId="para_40">I request the Leader to ask the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to attend the House to discuss matters at An Post. There are obvious industrial relations difficulties at An Post that are patently unnecessary and could be properly dealt with by management. I have also brought the House's attention to the EU directive to ComReg on the mobile telephony industry. A duopoly operates in this sector, resulting in us paying high charges. This is unnecessary and we need more and real competition in this sector.</p>

          <p eId="para_41">I agree that a debate on Northern Ireland should be initiated in the House. A vacuum has been created by the extraordinary events of recent weeks. It is incumbent on all Members to look at how a new context and process can be created, which would support everyone's desire and concern for democratic progress in Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_42">Will the Leader of the House comment on whether it is necessary to introduce new legislation in light of the court decision on the role of solicitors with the Personal Injuries Assessment Board? Does the structure put in place mean anything in practice? Were the long hours in both Houses, putting in place a system designed to bring down insurance costs, wasted? We need to urgently examine the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_43">I ask the Leader of the House — I raised the matter before Christmas — to include in her list of debates the care and education of young children. A debate on the issue should be scheduled as soon as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_45">Like Senator O'Meara, I am a little disconcerted that legislation that was thoroughly debated in this House effectively has been overturned by the courts. While an appeal may take place, it is important that the strictest objectivity is maintained when dealing with the affairs of the legal profession.</p>
          <p eId="para_46">I support the call for a debate on Northern Ireland. Although the situation has radically altered in some respects, I welcome Mr. Jeffrey Donaldson's statement last night that the DUP is sticking to the comprehensive agreement reached in December.</p>

          <p eId="para_48">I ask the Leader of the House to invite the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to the House to debate the Sellafield report and the impact of a terrorist attack on Sellafield on our land. There is widespread concern among the people in regard to that report which needs to be debated. It is important that the Government negotiates with the British Government regarding the carrying out of an evaluation of the necessary precautions that should be undertaken at Sellafield. We have been told that the next evaluation report on safety precautions and so on is not due until 2006. This is not good enough for our citizens or citizens of any part of Europe because the storage tanks at Sellafield are not constructed to a standard  which would withstand a terrorist attack. This is alarming for us all. Now that the report is in the public domain, people are aware that it poses a very serious threat on which there needs to be an urgent debate.</p>

          <from>Dr. M. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_49">I would not get apocalyptic about the court decision on the insurance issue. It appears that it was not saying that the board must pay legal costs. It was simply referring to whether a person wanted to have a solicitor and if he or she was prepared to pay for that service himself or herself. That does not appear to subvert the original intention of the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_50">I support the request for a debate on Northern Ireland. I am prepared to reserve what I have to say until then. However, I would generally support the tenor of Senator O'Meara's remarks about the need for such a debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_51">I also support the request for a debate on the tsunami appeal, particularly the way in which the funds from Ireland are expended and focused to help people get up and running again. We should also have a wider debate on poverty.</p>
          <p eId="para_52">In passing, I pay tribute to the work of the civil servants in the Department of Foreign Affairs, by whom I was greatly impressed. They did the country proud. I met people in Northern Ireland who spoke with feeling of the support, help, compassion and efficiency they witnessed and of the courage of the people involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_53">Regarding Senator Hanafin's request for a debate on mobile phone charges, Senator McHugh and myself have raised at different times in the past the particular problem of cross-Border phone charges. That involves more than roaming charges, which are penal. An effort should be made to introduce a single charge regime for the whole island.</p>

        <speech by="#UlickBurke" eId="spk_18">
          <from>Mr. U. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_54">The EU yesterday published a report on poverty which showed the living standards and incomes of people in Ireland. It noted that 23% of the population of Ireland are at risk of poverty and that 9% are consistently poor. Among the latter are listed single parents and their families as well as children, and the frightening statistic revealed is that health, food, clothing and heating were the four items in particular of which those categories of people in poverty were short. These are the items we have listed during the past year as having increased alarmingly in price as part of the rip-off culture we have endured in Ireland for some time.</p>
          <p eId="para_55">Will the Leader ask the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to attend the House and assess the national anti-poverty strategy in place since 1997 to see how effective or otherwise it has been? If such a high percentage of people are at risk of poverty it is surely time that this supposedly caring and sharing Government shared the wealth we now have in this country with those who can least afford the necessities. It is important that we look after the children in poverty in particular and acknowledge the consequences of such poverty over their lifetimes in the areas of health, education and future prospects. I ask the Leader to arrange an urgent debate on the issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_56">Will the Leader arrange a debate on the Mental Health Commission report for 2003, published before Christmas? Could she also find out about an extraordinary omission from the legislative programme which the Chief Whip, Deputy Tom Kitt, sent to Senators? There is an EU directive on the safety of blood from the transmission of disease to donors and recipients. This directive was issued three years ago and should be enshrined in domestic law by 8 February next. It is not mentioned even under the heads of legislation in the legislative programme and all I can find out from the Department of Health and Children is that it is awaiting reports. In view of all the trouble we have had with blood in this country, the lack of urgency in this area shows a serious deficiency in the Department. I would like the Leader to find out why this situation has arisen.</p>

          <p eId="para_57">Fine Gael's leader in the Seanad, Senator Brian Hayes, raised some important issues and we look forward to hearing the Leader's response. I am sure we all believe the President acted wisely in referring the Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill to the Supreme Court in order to test its constitutionality. Senators O'Meara, Mansergh and Maurice Hayes have already referred to the court decision regarding solicitors and the PIAB. Will the Leader ask the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to attend this House to explain the consequences of yesterday's High Court decision in that case? I had predicted this outcome both on Second Stage and on Committee Stage when we debated that Bill in this House. I felt that the client-solicitor relationship is a <i>sine qua non</i>, so to speak, within our democracy, as regards the common good. I look forward to hearing the Leader on that subject, and hopefully she can arrange for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, to come before the House.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. Phelan</from>
          <p eId="para_58">I agree with the Senators who have raised the issue of mobile phone charges. I heard the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in a radio interview over the weekend when he expressed his belief that a virtual cartel was in operation between the two leading operators in the mobile phone sector. I agree with him but I want him, as the person ultimately responsible for the communications sector, to tell this House how he will ensure mobile phone users will not be ripped off to the extent they currently are. I do not want to rehash what other Members have said on the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_59">My second point is concerned with the PIAB and yesterday's findings by the High Court. Senator Coghlan is correct in saying the outcome was predicted by many. I disagree with what Senator Maurice Hayes said about the judgment. I believe it goes right to the heart of what the PIAB was set up to achieve. The two main issues as regards insurance costs were the size of awards and legal fees. I debated the Bill with the Tánaiste on Report Stage when she was the Minister responsible for this area. What the judge said yesterday is a direct contradiction of what the Tánaiste led us to believe. I ask that the new Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment clarify the situation in this House as soon as possible.</p>

I was shocked to learn that GOAL, Trócaire, Concern and the Irish Red Cross were all involved. Indeed, we tog out tonight for a match for GOAL. Perhaps with so many charities involved somebody could investigate how the money is being spent. The public and the Government always want value for money. Perhaps we should examine the question of value for money as regards contributions to these agencies. Some agencies are much better on the ground than others and perhaps that could be examined from a global viewpoint.</p>
          <p eId="para_61">I welcome the latest statistics on car registrations which show they are now at an all-time high, apart from 2000. I am somewhat worried, however, from an environmental viewpoint at the proliferation of SUVs or sports utility vehicles.</p>

          <p eId="para_67">The Leader of the Opposition, Senator Brian Hayes, welcomed the President's recent decision. He raised the matter of the tsunami disaster and the House could benefit from a thorough debate on that subject. It is less a question of who gave what so much as what is going to happen to the relief funds raised. I will seek to put this in train.</p>
          <p eId="para_68">The Leader of the Opposition also raised the issue of Northern Ireland. It is good that the scales have fallen from everyone's eyes regarding this issue. Future events will take place in a much more realistic manner. The challenge remains to keep the peace process intact and to have a movement towards final peace. The Taoiseach has recommitted himself and the Government to that challenge.</p>
          <p eId="para_69">Senator Brian Hayes spoke about the interesting solutions suggested by the SDLP and wanted to debate them in this House. He also spoke about the €1.3 billion which is allegedly owed by the Revenue to taxpayers. An attempt is now being made to issue the money without taxpayers even requesting it. Every taxpayer should request the money if he or she has to do so, but I noted that Senator O'Toole was very vociferous on that matter on television and that Senator Brian Hayes's own party had raised the issue as well. Senator Brian Hayes said the same enthusiasm should be shown in the repayment as is showed in the collection.</p>
          <p eId="para_70">Senator O'Toole spoke about the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service. He also raised the issue surrounding the extraordinary witch-hunt against a particular member of the Government about aspects of his life which have nothing to do with legislation. I do not think journalism was well served by that particular issue. Are all our lives to be made public? It was quite extraordinary that both legally single people were to have their lives examined in that fashion. It had nothing to do with the issue and the Senator did well to raise the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_71">Senator Ryan called for a debate on the tsunami and sought a reassurance that any money pledged is not from an existing budget but constitutes additional money. That was the general impression but we need clarification of the matter. He also asked about Northern Ireland and my position remains the same. We will ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to come in and talk about the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_72">Senator Ryan also asked for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to come before the House to speak about An Post. Senator Mooney also spoke about the tsunami and on Northern Ireland. He also made an interesting point about Auschwitz and what happened 60 years ago. What we see on television and read in the newspapers brings the horrific nature of what happened before us. There was a co-ordinated campaign to get rid of people.</p>
          <p eId="para_73">Senator Finucane talked about the Taoiseach. It is easy in hindsight to have all the knowledge but it is not so easy at the time. That is the point the Taoiseach made yesterday. Hindsight is a great giver of knowledge.</p>

Senator Mansergh said he would congratulate the Revenue if it could find a way of paying back people. Senator Bannon spoke about the generosity of the people following the tsunami and asked that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government debate the issue of Sellafield. The last report on that issue contained some aspects that were quite frightening. We will try to arrange such a debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_78">Senator Maurice Hayes referred to Northern Ireland and the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB. I understand from what has been written about the PIAB that, if one wishes, one can still have a solicitor with one to make one's case. If one does not, one goes along with the PIAB. What has been put forward probably will be challenged. I always believed this issue would be difficult because if it was challenged, as it has been now, it would be the people in the legal system making the challenge. The Senator praised civil servants and I agree with his sentiments. He also supported Senator Hanafin's request.</p>
          <p eId="para_79">Senator Ulick Burke asked for a debate on the EU report on poverty in Ireland. Senator Henry raised the Mental Health Commission report for 2003 which has just been published.

Senator Coghlan asked that the Minister, Deputy Martin, be invited to the Seanad to discuss the PIAB. Senator John Paul Phelan raised mobile phone charges as well as the amount of awards.</p>
          <p eId="para_80">Senator Feighan referred to the tsunami disaster, car registrations and the number of SUVs. He said the SUVs have become an urban phenomenon rather than the agricultural tool they were intended to be. However, a person can buy whatever vehicle he or she wishes. Senator Kate Walsh mentioned the professionalism of the Garda authorities in Cork. We all admired it. The public was kept informed as much as it should have been informed. Obviously, when gardaí are pursuing a case, much must be kept quiet. However, all members of the Garda who appeared on the television or radio performed professionally and well. I agree with the Senator and I will write to the Garda Commissioner to convey that point.</p>

          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. M. McDowell)</from>
          <p eId="para_84">There is a worldwide recognition that the response to the challenge of international terrorism requires concerted action and co-operation by the international community in addition to action on the part of individual states. International terrorism strikes at universal values such as the sanctity of human life, tolerance of differing views, the freedom to advocate those views and a commitment to change by democratic means alone. Our response must be to uphold and protect such values and to deny international terrorists the means and opportunities to launch attacks which aim to destroy these values.</p>
          <p eId="para_85">Moreover, the terrible images and heartbreaking stories that are born of terrorist atrocities serve as a constant reminder that we, as legislators, have a duty to ensure that terrorists will find no comfort in this jurisdiction. Such a solemn duty merits decisive action and not merely fine words or rhetoric. The horrific terrorist attack in Madrid on 11 March last year reminded us, as if we needed it, that terrorism has not gone away and that Europe is equally vulnerable to the threat of terrorism.</p>
          <p eId="para_86">The United Nations has been the focal point in framing the response at the level of the world community, while the European Union has played the key role at regional level. That response has provided the central part of the context in which this Bill has been framed. Security Council Resolution 1373, adopted in 2001, specifies a range of measures on which states are required to take action. In particular, it calls upon states to combat the financing of terrorism and to become parties to the relevant international conventions. At European Union level, political agreement was achieved at the meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council in December 2001 on a framework decision on combating terrorism. The framework decision provides for a common definition of terrorist offences, including offences relating to terrorist groups, and was formally adopted by the Council on 13 June 2002. The Oireachtas had earlier approved Ireland's agreement to its adoption.</p>
          <p eId="para_87">We are obliged, as a member state of both the United Nations and the European Union, to enact legislation, which will enable us to give effect to these commitments. We on this island have, unfortunately, had a great deal of experience in facing the challenge of terrorism. As a result, our existing legislation has traditionally been more comprehensive than that in many other countries. However, it should be remembered that our existing legislation has been primarily framed with reference to the threat posed by groups indigenous to the island of Ireland. It is clear that we need additional legislative provisions to counter the international terrorist threat. I will now outline the key elements of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_88">The Bill will give effect to a number of international instruments directed against terrorism and will enable us to meet commitments which the State has undertaken as part of the European Union and the broader international community, including commitments arising from UN Security Council Resolution 1373. It will also amend our law more generally to enhance the capacity of the State and its police force to address the problem of international terrorism. It will make further provision for a number of additional measures directed, in particular, against the financing of terrorism.</p>
          <p eId="para_89">More specifically, the Bill serves three essential purposes: first, it will give effect in our law to the EU framework decision on combating terrorism; second, it will give effect to the United Nations Conventions Against the Taking of Hostages, on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons and for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings; and, third, it will give effect to the United Nations Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. I will outline the main provisions in the Bill by reference to these three essential purposes.</p>
          <p eId="para_90">Part 1 defines certain terms used in the Bill and provides for the bringing into force of the Bill when enacted.</p>
          <p eId="para_91">Part 2 will give effect to the framework decision on combating terrorism adopted by the Council of the European Union on 13 June 2002, which, for convenience, is set out at Schedule 1. This framework decision is directed to the approximation of the laws of the member states of the European Union in respect of a common definition of terrorist offences, including those relating to terrorist groups. This new common understanding of what terrorism means will be important not only in providing a co-ordinated EU-wide response to terrorism but also in facilitating cross-border co-operation in tackling it. Framework decisions are binding on member states as to the results to be achieved but leave to national authorities the choice of form and methods and do not entail direct effect. The Bill, therefore, proposes to make the necessary provision in our law to give effect to the framework decision and accordingly provides for terrorist offences to form a separate and distinct category in our law. It also makes provision for terrorist groups by way of the application of the relevant provisions of the Offences against the State Acts to such groups and for enhanced penalties to attach to terrorist offences in certain circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_92">The definitions are contained in section 4. For example, "terrorist activity" is defined by reference to offences under our law which are committed in or outside the State with the intent of seriously intimidating a population, unduly compelling a Government or international organisation to perform or abstain from performing any act or seriously destabilising or destroying the fundamental political, economic or social structures of a state or an international organisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_93">The specified offences for the purpose of the definition of "terrorist activity" are set out in Part 1 of the Second Schedule and comprise those offences under Irish law which correspond to the specified categories of intentional acts set out in Article 1 of the framework decision. These are serious offences, for which persons are liable to be tried on indictment, involving violence against persons or property and related firearms and explosives offences or offences involving chemical or nuclear weapons. Likewise, the required intent for the purpose of the definition follows closely the wording of the framework decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_94">Section 6 makes provision for terrorist offences by reference to the definitions in section 4 and in keeping with the requirements of the framework decision. Thus, section 4(1) provides that a person who engages in terrorist activity or terrorist-linked activity in, or in certain circumstances, outside the State, is guilty of an offence. It also makes attempting to engage in terrorist activity or in terrorist-linked activity and threatening to do so in or outside the State an offence. The circumstances in which terrorist offences committed outside the State will be offences in our law are governed by section 6(2) and 6(3) and correspond to those circumstances in which Article 9 of the framework decision requires us to take extraterritorial jurisdiction.</p>
          <p eId="para_95">Section 6(4) provides that subsection (1) will not apply in respect of the activities of armed forces during an armed conflict in so far as those activities are governed by international humanitarian law or the activities of military forces of a state in the exercise of their official duties in so far as those activities are governed by other rules of international law. Similar provisions are made in regard to the UN convention offences in Part 3, in keeping with the relevant requirements of those conventions. This does not mean the activities of armed forces are not subject to any law but that they are subject to other existing rules of international law and not to the framework decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_96">Section 6(5) was inserted by way of an official Report Stage amendment in the Dáil. It arises from concerns expressed regarding the breadth of the definition of "terrorist activity" in the Bill. The effect of the subsection is to provide, for the avoidance of doubt, that engagement in an act of protest or industrial action does not constitute an act of terrorism without the necessary intention defined earlier.</p>
          <p eId="para_97">Concerns were also expressed about the possibility that a person engaged in activity against an oppressive or tyrannical regime could be convicted under the legislation. After much consideration of this complex issue, I tabled an amendment on Report Stage in the Dáil to insert a new subsection (6). Thus, section 6(6) provides that the consent of the Attorney General is required in cases where a person is charged with an offence, in or outside the State, with the intention of unduly compelling a government of a state, other than a member state of the European Union, to perform or to abstain from performing an act or of seriously destabilising or destroying the political, constitutional, economic or social structures of such a state.</p>
          <p eId="para_98">It is difficult to distinguish between what in colloquial terms could be described as terrorists and what in the past have been described as freedom fighters and it is almost impossible to devise a legislative distinction between what is a tyranny and what is not. In these circumstances, the only practical way to give effect and be faithful to the framework decision while, at the same time, avoiding the possibility that persons acting legitimately against a tyranny, for example, would be prosecuted in the courts in a manner repugnant to our values was to vest in the Attorney General the same function he or she exercises under the Official Secrets Act and in regard to fisheries prosecutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_99">Sections 6(7) and 6(8), recognising the special difficulties that can attach to proving offences of specific intent, also make provision for certain circumstances in which the existence of the intent required for the purposes of committing the offence of engaging in or attempting to engage in terrorist activity may be presumed to exist, subject to the right of the accused to rebut that presumption. The penalties that will apply to persons convicted of terrorist offences are set out in section 7. This provides, in keeping with Article 5 of the framework decision, for enhanced penalties in certain circumstances by reference to the penalties imposable for the same offence when committed without the special intent required for terrorist offences. The penalty imposable will be the same where it is a sentence of imprisonment fixed by law or imprisonment for life but enhanced maximum penalties will be available in all other circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_100">Section 5 makes provision for terrorist groups, as defined in section 4, by way of the application of the relevant provisions of the Offences against the State Acts to such groups whether based in or outside the State. This will allow the requirements imposed by Articles 2 and 9 of the framework decision to be met in keeping with our existing law directed to unlawful organisations. It is also in keeping with a recommendation of the committee to review the Offences against the State Acts that the Government should have power to make a suppression order in respect of foreign terrorist organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_101">The section provides that terrorist groups will be unlawful organisations for the purposes of the Offences against the State Acts and that the relevant provisions, including, for example, provision for the offences of membership and directing an unlawful organisation, will equally attach to terrorist groups, as will the power of the Government to make suppression orders in regard to them. Provision is made under section 6(1)(<i>b</i>) for certain specified offences relating to unlawful organisations also to be offences when committed outside the jurisdiction. The offences specified for this purpose comprise the existing offences of directing and membership of, as well as the proposed new offence of providing assistance to, an unlawful organisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_102">Part 6 makes provision for certain amendments to the Offences against the State Acts which are directed principally to the requirements of the framework decision. These include the provision for a new offence of providing assistance to an unlawful organisation under section 49. This provision flows in part from a recommendation in the report of the committee to review the Offences against the State Acts, which recognised there could be cases where persons are closely associated with unlawful organisations and actively further their ends but are not, or cannot be proven to be, members of the organisation. It is also in keeping with the concept of participation in a terrorist group used in Article 4 of the framework decision, which would not necessarily be fully met by the existing offence of membership.</p>
          <p eId="para_103">I hope the provision being made in the Bill for the purposes of giving effect to the framework decision on combating terrorism does not give rise to concern on the part of those who seek change in our society or who engage in legitimate protest. I have included specific provisions in sections 6(5) and 6(6) to ensure these rights are protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_104">The Bill does not make it an offence to seek change nor does it make it an offence to have a cause. The right to seek and work for change is fundamental in our society and under our Constitution and the Government will continue to defend that right, including the right of persons to espouse causes and views with which the Government itself may disagree. The Bill will, in its own way, protect such persons from those who would threaten that right. The Bill draws the line where persons or organisations engage in concerted campaigns of violence in support of such causes, which is not legitimate.</p>
          <p eId="para_105">The purpose of Part 3 is to enable Ireland to become party to three UN conventions, which are relevant in the context of the international effort against terrorism. These are the Convention Against the Taking of Hostages, the Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings and the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons. Ireland signed the terrorist bombing convention on 29 May 1998 and will ratify that convention and accede to the remaining two conventions following the enactment of this Bill. Both the UN and the EU have called on states to ratify all relevant terrorism conventions as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_106">Convention-specific offences are being created in the Bill for the purpose of each of the three conventions to ensure full compliance with the requirements under each convention, including the requirement to take extraterritorial jurisdiction. These offences will in certain cases supplement existing offences under our law directed to the same or similar conduct. They will, at the same time, ensure that gaps between existing offences and the offences as defined in the convention are bridged. This arises, for example, in the case of the Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombing where the convention offence extends to the use of devices which release biological agents and toxins. These are covered by existing offences under the Explosive Substances Act 1883, the Chemical Weapons Act 1997 and the Radiological Protection Act 1997. Sections 9 to 11 provide for the new offences. Section 9 provides for the new offence of hostage-taking, section 10 provides for the offence of terrorist bombing while section 11 makes provision in regard to internationally protected persons.</p>
          <p eId="para_107">The third key element of the Bill is the measures contained in Parts 4 and 6 intended to give effect to the United Nations Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism and aimed at combating terrorist financing more generally in keeping with our obligations under UN Security Council Resolution 1373 and the financial action task force recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_108">Even before September 11, it was clear the international community was concerned about the impact of the movement of funds intended for terrorist purposes on the worldwide escalation of acts of terrorism. This concern was partly reflected in the drawing up of the United Nations Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, which was opened for signature on 10 January 2000. Ireland signed the convention on 15 October 2001. A primary purpose of Part 4 of the Bill is to provide the statutory framework for ratification by Ireland of the convention. The measures provided for in that convention have in turn been supplemented by UN Security Council Resolution 1373 which, in addition to calling on states to ratify the convention itself, also requires them to freeze, without delay, funds and other financial assets or economic resources of persons who commit, or attempt to commit, terrorist acts.</p>
          <p eId="para_109">The key provision in the Bill for the purpose of giving effect to the convention is section 13 which makes provision for the new offence of financing terrorism and which gives effect to the definition of that offence in Article 2 of the convention. It also goes beyond the requirements of the convention to include the financing of terrorist groups as defined in section 4 of the Bill and terrorist offences within the meaning of section 6 of the Bill to the extent that these are not covered by the convention. The jurisdiction provisions in section 13 correspond to both the mandatory and discretionary jurisdiction requirements in Article 7 of the convention. The one exception is that they do not apply to the framework decision element of the offence as this is covered by the jurisdiction provisions of section 6(2) and 6(3). The definition of "funds" in Article 1 of the convention is reflected in section 12 of the Bill. It is a comprehensive definition covering assets of every kind with the emphasis very much on financial transactions.</p>
          <p eId="para_110">Part 4 of the Bill also provides for two distinct and dedicated procedures for the purpose of giving effect to Article 8 of the convention. Both procedures are court-based and build on existing provisions of our law. The key difference between them is that the first will enable an application to be made to freeze funds intended for use in committing terrorist offences independently of criminal proceedings, whereas the second will be available for use in conjunction with such proceedings in respect of the new offence of financing terrorism. The two procedures, therefore, will complement each other.</p>
          <p eId="para_111">Provision for the first of these procedures is made in sections 14 to 20, inclusive, of the Bill and will enable funds which are being used, or which may be intended to be used, for the purpose of committing terrorist offences, including the offence of financing terrorism, to be frozen and ultimately made subject to a disposal order in favour of the State. The procedure closely mirrors the existing provisions of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996.</p>
          <p eId="para_112">Section 14 accordingly will enable the High Court to make an interim order prohibiting a person from disposing of funds for a period of up to 40 days where it is satisfied, on foot of an <i>ex parte</i> application by a chief superintendent of the Garda Síochána, that a person possesses funds that are being used, or may be intended for use, in the commission of a terrorist offence or a terrorist financing offence. Section 15 will enable the High Court to make an interlocutory order extending the period during which the funds are frozen unless satisfied by any person claiming an interest in those funds that they are not intended for such use or that there would be a serious risk of injustice.</p>
          <p eId="para_113">Section 16 will in similar circumstances enable the High Court to make a disposal order in favour of the State where an interlocutory order has been in force for a period of not less than seven years. The Criminal Assets Bureau is concerned with the proceeds of crime. One makes an <i>ex parte </i>application to freeze suspect funds. Anybody claiming a bona fide interest in the funds has the right to come to court and establish the funds are not intended for terrorist purposes. If that does not happen within a period of six years, it is possible for the funds to be forfeited to the State in the seventh year.</p>
          <p eId="para_114">The Bill also makes provision for a statement by a chief superintendent that he or she believes funds are being used or are intended for use in committing or facilitating the commission of a terrorist offence to be evidence, provided that the High Court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for that belief. In addition, it provides for the payment of compensation to a person in respect of any loss incurred by a person in respect of orders made in accordance with the procedure.</p>
          <p eId="para_115">The second procedure in Part 4 of the Bill is contained in sections 21 to 41, inclusive. These provide a statutory framework which will enable the confiscation, restraint and forfeiture provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1994 to be applied for the purpose of the new offence of terrorist financing. It is necessary to legislate in this way as the existing relevant provisions of the 1994 Act only allow for the confiscation and restraint of the benefits derived from drug trafficking and the benefits from an offence other than drug trafficking. The Bill amends the 1994 Act to provide a dedicated procedure for the purpose of the offence of financing terrorism.</p>
          <p eId="para_116">The effect of those amendments will be that where a person has been convicted of, and sentenced for, an offence of financing terrorism, the Director of Public Prosecutions can apply to the court to determine whether the person holds funds subject to confiscation. That is dealt with at length in the ensuing sections.</p>
          <p eId="para_117">Similarly, it is proposed to amend section 23 of the 1994 Act in section 30 of the Bill by empowering the High Court to make a restraint order in circumstances where proceedings have been instituted against a defendant for an offence of financing terrorism, where the proceedings have not been concluded or where a confiscation order has been made or it appears to the court that there are reasonable grounds for thinking that a confiscation order may be made. This mirrors the existing provisions of the 1994 Act relating to the making of restraint orders for a drug trafficking offence or another indictable offence for the proceeds of crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_118">In addition, the High Court will be able to order compensation to be paid to any person whose property has been affected by an order of restraint and the proceedings do not result in conviction for an offence of financing terrorism, or the conviction is quashed.</p>
          <p eId="para_119">The 1994 Act also contains important provisions directed at the prevention and detection of money laundering. Section 32 of the Bill amends the relevant provisions of the 1994 Act to extend the obligation on financial institutions to adopt measures for the purpose of preventing and detecting money laundering to also cover the prevention and detection of the offence of financing terrorism. Likewise, under section 36, the obligation on financial institutions to report to the Garda Síochána any suspicion of money laundering is being extended to include an obligation to report any suspicion of an offence of financing terrorism which is being committed in connection with their business. These provisions will provide an important means by which the existence of terrorist funds may come to light and provide a basis for recourse to the procedures for the freezing of those funds, which I have just outlined.</p>
          <p eId="para_120">Section 42 empowers the Minister for Finance to make regulations directed at freezing terrorist funds so that enabling acts adopted by the institutions of the European Communities for this purpose can be given full effect. The real significance of section 42 is that it provides for an indictable offence for breach of the regulations. At present, breach of the regulations can only be tried summarily. This provision will have particular application to measures adopted within the EU for the purpose of giving effect to UN Security Council Resolution 1373.</p>
          <p eId="para_121">Part 6 of the Bill will also make provision for another important element of the package directed at combating the financing of terrorism by way of an amendment to the Offences against the State Acts. The Bill will allow existing provisions of those Acts which have application to the property of unlawful organisations to be applied to terrorist groups. Certain additional measures are also provided for in the Bill including, in section 51, provision for a procedure directed at the recovery of the property of unlawful organisations in respect of which a suppression order has been made which stands forfeited to the Minister. This procedure, which will be court-based, draws on the provisions of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1985 and the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 for inspiration and is intended to complement the procedure under the 1985 Act which applies to the moneys of unlawful organisations held in a bank. Therefore, items into which money has been converted will now be vulnerable to pursuit in this manner. It includes provision allowing any interim order made by the court to be challenged by any person claiming ownership of the property and for the payment of compensation in appropriate circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_122">Sections 50 and 52 of the Bill make certain other amendments to the Offences against the State Acts also for the purpose of combating the financing of terrorism. These include updating the definition of property in line with other provisions of the Bill and amendments to the 1985 Act to ensure that it will be available for use as circumstances require.</p>
          <p eId="para_123">Part 7 of the Bill deals with amendments to the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003. As Senators will be aware, that Act implemented the EU framework decision on the European arrest warrant. The amendments contained in Part 7 of this Bill arise out of experience gained in the administration and implementation of the 2003 Act. They are also designed to ensure we have effective extradition and surrender arrangements. It is essential that we have sound arrangements in this area, especially in the context of the threat from terrorism.</p>
          <p eId="para_124">The amendments are, in the main, of a technical and procedural nature and seek in many instances to clarify, in the light of experience, some provisions in the Act. The more significant of the amendments relate to the revised sections 22 to 24, inclusive, of the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003. The Act currently requires that the surrender of the wanted person to the issuing state under a European arrest warrant must be refused unless certain undertakings are given by that issuing state in relation to the issues I have mentioned or unless it can be established that the law of the issuing state makes adequate provision with regard to those issues. We have experienced some difficulty and delay in obtaining the undertakings as several member states feel the terms of the framework decision as it operates between member states that have implemented it provide sufficient assurance on the issues, without the need for such undertakings.</p>
          <p eId="para_125">I have reconsidered our position in conjunction with the Attorney General and I am satisfied the new arrangements now being proposed will continue to provide the wanted person with the necessary level of protection while at the same time overcoming the difficulties experienced with the existing provisions. Under the new arrangements, the High Court will be required to refuse surrender where, on the basis of a case made before it by or on behalf of the wanted person, it is satisfied that a decision has not been made to charge and try the person for the offence for which he or she is sought or, as respects specialty, onward surrender or extradition, that the relevant provisions are not being respected by the issuing state. I am confident that we will rarely if ever find that a member state is not meeting its obligations under the framework decision or that it is not acting in a bona fide manner with regard to a warrant it issues. However, the new provisions ensure that, even in such rare cases, we will have an adequate means of protecting anyone whose situation could be jeopardised should there be any non-compliance by a member state.</p>
          <p eId="para_126">I expect to introduce some further amendments to Part 7 on Committee Stage. These new amendments will relate to amendments already inserted in the Dáil and can be considered as completing and tidying up the changes already begun by the earlier amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_127">I am also considering, in conjunction with the Attorney General, bringing forward on Committee Stage an amendment dealing with the retention of communications data. The declaration on combating terrorism drawn up after the Madrid bombings of March 2004 directed the Council to adopt an instrument on data retention by June 2005. It may be necessary to introduce an amendment on data retention to bridge the gap until negotiations on the EU instrument, a framework decision, have been completed after which I intend to publish a more comprehensive communications data retention Bill without delay.</p>
          <p eId="para_128">These proposals represent the key elements of the Bill. The Bill also contains certain other procedural provisions as well as consequential amendments to a number of other Acts to which I could also refer. However, I am conscious that I have already spoken at length. I hope that what I have said will assist the House in its task of considering the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_129">This Bill is necessary to enable us to comply with our commitments as members of the international community and our legal obligation to comply with the framework decision under EU law. Furthermore, our existing legislation has been framed with reference to the threat posed by groups indigenous to Ireland. We clearly need additional legislative measures to counter the international terrorist threat we also face. We must ensure that our legislation is as effective against international terrorists as it is against domestic terrorists. Therefore, I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MauriceCummins" eId="spk_36">
          <from>Mr. Cummins</from>
          <p eId="para_130">I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for his comprehensive explanation of the Bill. This Bill was first presented in the Dáil on 16 December 2002. Second Stage was taken in February 2003. It took almost two years before Report and Final Stages were taken in December 2004. This suggests that the Minister was lukewarm about some aspects or the thrust of the Bill. However, he has explained the reasons for the delay and that he had to consult with other member states on problems that might have arisen. I was worried about his commitment but I need not have been. We must be proactive in processing such legislation in order to meet our commitments as part of the European Union and the broader international community, especially commitments arising from United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373, adopted in response to the dreadful events of 11 September 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_131">When we enact legislation it is, theoretically, put on the Statute Book forever. We should build a sunset or review clause into all legislation. However, leaving that aside for now, there are compelling reasons for having a review of this legislation in five to ten years in order to assess whether it should remain on the Statute Book. The greater the threat that international and domestic terrorism pose, the more restrictive our legislation and, inevitably, our society becomes. It is a slippery slope which leads to greater and greater restrictions as time goes on. We can only arrest these restrictions on our freedoms if we start to assess whether the restrictions are justified in a changed environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_132">Between now and Committee Stage, will the Minister consider the merits of building some mechanism of review into this legislation? He may tell me that all legislation is reviewed periodically by Ministers, but that is not acceptable in this case. We need some statutorily-based period for review for what is, basically, emergency legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_133">The Minister has established a tradition of labelling everything issued by the Human Rights Commission as "tendentious". He should look more seriously at what it says about this Bill. A particular point that struck me was that freedoms and discretion provided for by the framework decision have been seized upon by the Minister as opportunities to be even more restrictive than is expected or necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_134">One of the motivating factors behind the Bill is the protection of democracy. Freedom is one of the pillars of our democracy and legislation of this kind is yet another measure which restricts that freedom. The freedom of the majority must not be scuppered for the purpose of pursuing a small minority. In putting in place the necessary protections we must always ensure that they are proportionate and are in place only for as long as is necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_135">I took the time to go through the transcripts of the Dáil debate on this Bill. While some parties had concerns about various aspects of the Bill, Sinn Féin was alone in its trenchant opposition to it. Given the recent events involving the Northern Bank, is it any wonder Sinn Féin would be irked at the prospect of the Oireachtas debating and passing a Bill dealing with terrorist offences? Sinn Féin seems to shudder at the prospect of the criminalisation of any type of behaviour. Its concept of freedom seems to encompass the freedom to rob, take hostages and injure others. Some would, no doubt, add murder to that list of freedoms. Sinn Féin is the party that Fianna Fáil seems to be eyeing up for the first dance after the next election. Sinn Féin is now out in the political cold, but it was not the sharp and decisive judgement of the Taoiseach that put it there.</p>
          <p eId="para_136">Speaking on this Bill in the other House, Sinn Féin outlined its problems with many aspects of it. I hope this House can unite with Fine Gael in saying that we have many problems with many aspects of Sinn Féin and its chameleon-like tendencies. Just as Sinn Féin denied the killing of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe, the IRA now denies robbing the Northern Bank and Sinn Féin seems nauseated at the thought that its denials are not taken as gospel truth. Sinn Féin is desperately trying to appease the public, while on the other hand making sure it does not upset its activists. For far too long there has been an acceptance of Sinn Féin's passive ambiguity when it comes to condemning crimes like this. This Bill seeks to clamp down on international terrorism. However, we should not lose sight of the terrorists in our midst and the tolerance that we have built up to their presence and their activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_137">This Bill is a response to the challenge of international terrorism. Greater co-operation and targeted action by the international community is required, as well as action on the part of individual countries. It is our duty as legislators to ensure that terrorists will not find comfort in this jurisdiction. It is right and fitting that we should be party to the relevant international conventions on terrorism and co-operate through bilateral and multilateral agreements and take strident action against the perpetrators of such terrorist acts.</p>
          <p eId="para_138">Section 9 provides for the new offence of hostage taking and section 10 deals with the offence of terrorist bombing. I fully support the penalty of life imprisonment for such offences. However, a life sentence in this jurisdiction does not always mean life. It upsets people that such offenders are often back on the streets after seven or eight years. That is an absolute disgrace. What measures can we put in place to ensure that life means at least 20 years?</p>
          <p eId="para_139">The financing of terrorism and money laundering are dealt with in the Bill. I fully support the measures outlined to combat these activities. The freezing and confiscation of funds is a most effective measure in tackling crime. As the Minister stated, we recently dealt with this issue in the Proceeds of Crime Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_140">The world has especially been subjected to international terrorism since 11 September 2001. Terrible atrocities have also occurred in other countries, notably Spain. Terrorist organisations around the world include al-Qaeda, ETA, FARC and the IRA. It is incumbent on us to do everything possible to stem the tide of terrorism throughout the world. The Bill will play some small part in ensuring that our jurisdiction will not be used for terrorist acts.</p>
          <p eId="para_141">I assure the Minister of our full support for the Bill. I hope he will address some of the concerns I outlined in the debate.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TonyKett" eId="spk_37">
          <from>Mr. Kett</from>
          <p eId="para_142">I welcome the Minister and thank him for his most comprehensive analysis of the Bill. As Senator Cummins outlined, the Bill is set against the backdrop of the devastating and traumatic events of 11 September 2001 and the other serious terrorist acts which took place at that time. We witnessed in graphic detail what human life means to these people who justify their actions by means of one cause or another. It also highlighted the challenge facing the international community in terms of creating legislation to deal with these people both at home and abroad. The European Council framework decision of 13 June 2002 was drawn up in response to the events of 11 September 2001. As the Minister outlined, that legislation must be incorporated in domestic legislation. The Bill also incorporates a series of conventions dealing with terrorism. These include the International Convention Against the Taking of Hostages, the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes Against Internationally Protected Persons, including diplomatic agents, and the Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings and the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism.</p>
          <p eId="para_143">Many of the Bill's provisions giving power to the authorities mirror elements of the Criminal Assets Bureau, especially in regard to the freezing of funds and the seizure of assets. We are all aware of the success of the Criminal Assets Bureau and we can only hope that the nations of the world will be equally successful with common legislative measures in regard to counteracting terrorism.</p>
          <p eId="para_144">The Minister referred to the difficulty of defining a terrorist act. We would probably all recognise a terrorist act if we saw one but it is difficult to define it in a few sentences or paragraphs. How does one distinguish an act of war or political assassination from a terrorist act? I am sure the Minister, with his expertise and knowledge of this area, has made a very good stab at it here. I am prepared to let him do the paraphrasing.</p>
          <p eId="para_145">Like most Members of the House I welcome the exclusion from the Schedule of offences of those seeking to change society by engaging in legitimate means of protest. However, I would not like to see that exclusion being used by people to engage in criminality under the cover of protest. At some time in our lives we have all engaged in a protest in the belief that we had a just cause. It is important that citizens have the right to speak out and engage in protest if they so wish. However, they must also understand that in demonstrating, they must act within the confines of the laws of the land. In recent times we have seen evidence of demonstrations that have gone very badly wrong. In one anti-globalisation protest, shops were looted and garages and businesses were set on fire. This may have been due to members of a hard core element finding their way into the demonstrations, people who may not have had anything to do with the cause but just used it as a cover. People who organise demonstrations have a duty to ensure this does not happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_146">Terrorism did not begin on 11 September 2001 and, unfortunately, it did not end then either as the events in Madrid demonstrated. We have had our fair share of terrorism and, as a result, our legislation is better in that respect than that in other countries. We only have to look to the outrageous bombing of Omagh and the death, devastation and trauma that brought. Terrorism presents a continuing threat to the peace process. More than anything else, the events of 11 September 2001 brought a shared determination among the nations of the world that terrorism would not prevail. The question can be asked as to why terrorism is so prevalent now. However, if we look around the world we will see that atrocities are not a feature of this time only. For example, Palestine is an area in which there has been ongoing conflict for many years.</p>
          <p eId="para_147">We all looked on the US as being impregnable and it was a shock for us when we saw the ease with which terrorists found their way into the heartland of America to carry out atrocities. We probably all feel more vulnerable as a result. The stronger the legislation we enact, the better for us. The same holds true for the rest of the world. An organisation is only as strong as its weakest link. We need to be sure that in putting forward legislation we are holding up our end, so to speak. I have no fears in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_148">The link between poverty and global security cannot be overstated. Poverty is the ultimate endemic threat and we should maintain the resolve we are currently showing in tackling terrorism to also tackle poverty. If we extend the fight to poverty we will probably make real progress in promoting global security. The atrocities listed by Senator Cummins and the Minister were undoubtedly terrorist acts carried out by secretive organisations that are hell-bent on undermining the world's governments and the way we live. They challenge everything all of us who believe in democracy and a peaceful existence hold dear. However, their ability to recruit into their organisations is often born out of the type of economic and social justice which some countries uphold. Poverty can also be a factor because people in such circumstances can be frustrated and angry and have a low sense of self-worth. People can join political movements or organisations in order to achieve self-worth at the right end of the gun rather than the wrong end.</p>
          <p eId="para_149">If I had a concern before the Minister made his speech, it was to ensure that, in finalising this legislation, we do not compromise or impinge on civil liberties. The Minister stated that he had included specific provisions in the Bill to ensure that does not happen, about which I am happy. If we started to restrict such freedoms as those to congregate, assemble or speak out as we see fit, we would have already lost the battle in a war concerning the type of democracy in which we wish to live.</p>
          <p eId="para_150">The wider debate on terrorism must address the very real threat of state terrorism as it exists in the international climate in which this debate commenced and continues to take place. There is no doubt that the era of Saddam Hussein and his party in Iraq constituted a terrorist regime which denied freedom of speech and expression to its own people. When Saddam considered that people were not upholding the laws, he oppressed, murdered and maimed them. We need to consider what is the best way to deal with such cases. I am not so sure that we should do so by practising our own form of terrorism. A bomb in Iraq and a bomb in Northern Ireland are both wrong if the intent is to kill innocent people — either collaterally or otherwise. "Collateral damage" is a horrible term used by Americans and others when they get something wrong and kill civilians. We must be consistent in our own principles if we believe in true democracy and its moral basis. Therefore, the definition of terrorism in the Bill is crucial.</p>
          <p eId="para_151">This is one of the most important Bills which has come before the House in the context of world peace and it is important we ensure we play our part in eliminating the conditions in which terrorism can flourish. We must stand with our partners in Europe and the United Nations and implement legislation. I wish the Minister well as he endeavours to do just that.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryHenry" eId="spk_38">
          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_152">I welcome the Minister and the Bill to the House. Any reservations I had about the Bill were greatly assuaged by the Minister's speech in which he stated that he would be most unhappy if legitimate protests were to be considered terrorist acts when that is not the case. It is most important that our reactions to terrorist threats do not impinge on our civil rights. America's homeland security legislation has impinged very seriously on the rights of a large number of American citizens and we do not want anything like that to happen here.</p>
          <p eId="para_153">I wish to address Part 3 of the Bill, which I warmly welcome. Ireland is frequently extremely slow to ratify UN conventions, although we are quick to sign up to them. For example, since I was elected to this House, I have raised the issue of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention of 1972. I have been informed that enacting legislation for such conventions takes some time. However, more than 30 years is a very long time indeed. The most important of these conventions which requires ratification having been agreed to nearly 30 years ago, is the hostage convention.</p>
          <p eId="para_154">We seem to have a peculiar attitude about hostages taken by people abroad in the sense that they seem to be of more importance and the crime more serious and heinous than when hostages are taken in this country. However, we have had a dreadful problem with the taking of hostages by paramilitaries on both sides — but the IRA in particular — for more than 30 years in Northern Ireland and in the Republic. It is a shocking situation. I wish I had heard the same outpouring of grief about Jean McConville who was killed after being taken hostage, as I did about Margaret Hassan. Both deaths were shocking but there was little public outpouring of grief about Jean McConville. I do not remember any church services being held in her memory. In this regard, we have a biased view depending on whether people are taken hostage in this country or abroad. Both situations are outrageous.</p>
          <p eId="para_155">In Ireland we had appalling situations in which some people were made into human bombs while their families were held hostage. It was surely one of the lowest points we reached in our history. It was truly quite dreadful. I ask that we examine the situation raised by Senator Cummins regarding the Northern Bank robbery and the hostage taking in that case. There is a sense that this was a victimless crime since no one was killed. It is stated that £26 million was taken from the bank but that most of the bank notes cannot be used and it is therefore a victimless crime. However, that is not the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_156">Members must have seen on television the interview of the young man from Poleglass who was one of the bank officials kidnapped. He is a very courageous man for the manner in which he spoke out about how it affected him to know that the perpetrators must have been people who lived near him and were in a position to watch him and his family. They told him they knew about him, his brother, father and mother, brother's girlfriend and threatened that unless he did as he was told, they would be killed. It must have been an appalling experience, from which I am quite sure none of them will recover.</p>
          <p eId="para_157">There are two more people in the case who have not spoken out yet. I do not blame them since they are probably still in a state of extended shock. I am referring to the other bank official and his wife who was abandoned in a forest. If the woman had fallen down a cliff, would it have been her fault because she did not know the way out of the forest? This was a truly shocking terrorist crime and it can only be described as such. This incident will affect the woman for the rest of her life.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">Hostage taking was popular at one stage in the Republic of Ireland. Some people were taken and ransoms paid but there was little publicity about these crimes. Some years ago I was involved in fund-raising and I asked one of my fellow fund-raisers if she thought a particular man and his wife would buy tickets. I realised I did not know the man's wife at all and asked my colleague if he did indeed have a wife. My colleague informed me that the man had a wife but that she was virtually a recluse as she was kidnapped 30 years previously by the IRA and has hardly come out since. The woman was approximately 50 years old at the time and although she had a husband and children and all that could be desired in terms of a good home, an income and so on, she is a recluse. These are not victimless crimes and that woman will be a victim of that kidnapping for the rest of her life. How many other people are in this position? Not all the kidnappings had been made as public as one might think. For example, I did not know about that particular case.</p>
          <p eId="para_159">I was on the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation and was present on the afternoon of the Canary Wharf bombing. There were few people there and I do not know if the Minister was present but the two Sinn Féin representatives, Pat Doherty and Rita O'Hare, were present. They were very courageous and were very good contributors to the forum. When the bomb exploded, killing two people — one a newspaper vendor whom I am sure had nothing against the Minister, me or anyone else in Ireland — the forum had to be suspended by Ms Justice Catherine McGuinness because the IRA ceasefire had broken. We were all pretty miserable winding up and leaving the forum. Pat Doherty and Rita O'Hare were as disappointed and concerned as the rest of us. However, members of Sinn Féin will have to do more than that. They will have to say that those in the IRA who commit these dreadful crimes are criminals and that these are terrorist activities. The Taoiseach believes the IRA was involved in that robbery. Considering the time and energy he has put into the peace process and knowing what those words would mean, I cannot but believe he has good evidence to the contrary. We must realise that hostages in Ireland are in as bad a situation as hostages anywhere else. We must realise that those who take hostages in this country are just as criminal and terroristic as those we easily call terrorists when applying it to Iraq, Afghanistan or anywhere else. I commend this section. However, it is a great pity that it takes us so long to ratify many of the conventions we admit are most worthy and sign up to at once.</p>

          <from>Dr. Mansergh</from>
          <p eId="para_162">I welcome the Bill and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the House. The Bill is entitled the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Bill 2002 and was debated in the Dáil in 2003. I am sure there are good reasons and explanations as to why it has taken so long to come to the Seanad. As they have not been stated, I am sure the Minister will outline them in his reply.</p>
          <p eId="para_163">The essential point of this legislation is that it is an expression of international solidarity. Terrorism is a problem that affects us all and it is important there are no gaps in the different ways that member states deal with the problem. As seen with the Madrid bombings, in principle, any state is vulnerable to attack. Without intending to cause any offence, such attacks fall on the just and the unjust alike.</p>
          <p eId="para_164">While the modern international problem has been with us for at least 30 years, arguably it goes back 200 years. The First World War was caused by the assassination of an heir to a throne. Over the holidays, I read a book about the attempted bombing in 1800 of the First Consul, Napoleon. The modern phenomenon arises from the fact that a conventional war cannot be won by those groups who resort to terrorism. Iraq is a clear illustration of this point. While Saddam's conventional forces were quickly defeated, the aftermath has gone on with some intensity. The Minister may have seen al-Zarqawi's recent declaration in which he denounced candidates in the forthcoming Iraqi elections as "demi-idols" and voters as "infidels". In <i>The Independent</i> of 24 January, he was quoted as saying “we have declared a fierce war on this evil principle of democracy and those who follow this wrong ideology”. There is no doubt that terrorism is resorted to by people who cannot get a democratic mandate or who only have the support of a small section of the population. This is clear in the Basque country. In Northern Ireland, as long as the IRA was engaged in a terror campaign, the republican movement never had a majority of the Nationalist vote.</p>
          <p eId="para_165">I have no reason to believe that the Minister does not agree that terrorism cannot be defeated by security measures alone. Realising this does not mean that one should not engage in all the proper security measures. However, it must be recognised there are other dimensions and problems that require political, economic and social approaches, complementary to combatting terrorism. There also needs to be a recognition, through firmness of the Government's concerns, in general, that without a legitimate cause terrorism does not serve the causes it purports to serve. I define a legitimate cause as a struggle for self-determination with the support of the majority of the population. That is clear in the Northern Ireland situation where it would be hard to argue that a united Ireland is closer today as a result of 30 years of conflict than it was in the late 1960s. While other justifications can be put forward, it did not advance one iota the promotion of a united Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_166">It is welcome that the Minister has shown no sign of going in the direction, which unfortunately some democratic governments have, of the total suspension of the rule of law and the legal no-man's land of Guantanamo Bay. I hope we will not go down that route. The Minister is not a member of the Government who would describe himself as a socialist.</p>

          <p eId="para_168">However, I hope he will not follow the example of the recently retired David Blunkett and some of the illiberal policies being pursued across the water. Historically, it is true Ireland had limited internment for certain periods, but it did not involve torture.</p>
          <p eId="para_169">Recently, I again watched Robert Bolt's film of Sir Thomas More, <i>A Man for All Seasons</i>. More is asked by one of his acolytes if it would be right to suspend the law in pursuit of the devil. He replies that it would not as there then would be no protection against the devil. I am happy with the civil liberties provisions, contained in section 6(5), that make clear that legitimate protests of various kinds are not covered by the Bill. Similarly, I appreciate the section which states that those struggling against what everyone would call a tyranny are not deemed terrorists. Were von Stauffenberg and those who placed the bomb under Hitler’s table terrorists by our definition? Clearly not.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">Senator Henry referred to the question of hostages which has a domestic dimension considering the horrifying experience of the recent bank raid and also in the case of Margaret Hassan. I am glad that the Tipperary Peace Prize has been awarded posthumously to her. It is right that there is a distaste about the way in which Jean McConville was murdered. There is a strong suspicion, apart from every other evil aspect of it, that it had a sectarian dimension.</p>
          <p eId="para_171">The biggest contribution that Ireland can make is to ensure that paramilitaries and terrorism disappear from our shores. Much progress has been made which has inspired other countries. Spain and the Basque country, although the situations are different, closely follow what happens in the Northern Ireland peace process. We have the potential to set an example. Our experience is not a recent problem. The truth is that the legacy of the War of Independence and Civil War period — I would in principle be supportive of the legitimacy of the War of Independence — lasted throughout the 1930s, 1940s, 1950s and 1960s. Detective Inspector Curtin was shot dead at the gates of the house in which I live in Tipperary, which was let when my father was young, and he breathed his last in the study where I work.</p>
          <p eId="para_172">There have been persistent statements and innuendo from people critical of the Government and the way it has conducted both the peace process and its security that, out of consideration for people, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Garda and so on are soft on those who engage in paramilitary activity. I am sure the Minister will have no difficulty stating clearly and unequivocally that the gardaí are neither hampered nor discouraged in any way from pursuing those involved in crime and terrorism.</p>
          <p eId="para_173">Crises can be beneficial. The assassination of Kevin O'Higgins brought Fianna Fáil into the Dáil in 1927 within approximately one month. We are probably at such a crisis now because there has been ample time and an ample transition period to deal with this issue. The time has come for an unequivocal commitment to democracy by everyone. Let us remember that modern republicanism in Ireland started with the Society of the United Irishmen, which began as a democratic constitutional organisation. Things went wrong because democracy at that time was equated with subversion. It is time to get back to democratic principles.</p>

        <speech by="#JoannaTuffy" eId="spk_44">
          <from>Ms Tuffy</from>
          <p eId="para_174">Senator Cummins referred to the delay in bringing the legislation to this House. One of the problems about such a delay, even though it is not the longest delay in bringing a Bill to this House, is that the legislation is no longer under the media spotlight. Many criticisms of the legislation have been forgotten. The criticisms of the legislation made in 2002 and 2003 stand.</p>
          <p eId="para_175">Senator Mansergh said the legislation is an expression of international solidarity. We must remind ourselves that we are working in the context of a very different international scene where governments with which we traditionally work are introducing questionable responses to terrorism. There is the example of the United States which introduced the detention of people without trial in Guantanamo Bay. Today, Mr. Charles Clarke, the Home Secretary in the UK, from which we have inherited our legal system, announced that the detention without trial of terror suspects will be replaced with a system of control orders. These will include curfews, tagging and a requirement for suspects to remain at their premises. These orders will apply equally to foreign suspects and British citizens suspected of international or domestic terrorism. Such orders would be preventative. What struck me is that Irish people would be subject to this new legislation when it is implemented in the UK. We have had much experience of Irish people who were the subject of miscarriages of justice. This is partly as a result of draconian legislation in the past. If anyone should have learned from the mistakes of going down this path, Irish people should have done so.</p>
          <p eId="para_176">This legislation does not go as far as the measures being introduced in the UK, but it is far-reaching in terms of civil liberties and human rights. Section 6(5) reads:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_177">To avoid doubt, the fact that a person engages in any protest, advocacy or dissent, or engages in any strike, lockout or other industrial action, is not of itself a sufficient basis for inferring that the person is carrying out an act with the intention specified in the definition of "terrorist activity".</p>
          <p eId="para_178">The definition of "terrorist activity" is an act being committed with the intention of seriously intimidating a population and unduly compelling a government or an international organisation to perform or abstain from performing an act, or seriously destabilising or destroying the fundamental political, constitutional, economic or social structures of a state or an international organisation. This definition is far-reaching. I do not believe it is the safeguard people might think it is or the Minister has indicated it is. It is saying that it is not in itself a sufficient basis to use it against people. In other words, it could be a basis, but it is not a sufficient basis. This means that a person involved in a protest, advocacy or dissent or engaged in a strike, lockout or other industrial action could have that used against them. The act might not be sufficient in itself but it could be used against people, which could have far-reaching consequences. That this is included in the Bill makes it more likely that it would be taken on board by a court. I am not convinced it is the protection it is supposed to be.</p>
          <p eId="para_179">Subsection (6) refers to an act being committed in the opinion of the Attorney General and that no further proceedings in the matter may be taken except with the consent of the Attorney General. However, it allows for remanding in custody. I would like clarification on whether the person could be remanded indefinitely in the meantime. There is a presumption that a court can be satisfied that it is reasonable to assume the act is committed with a terrorist intention. It is outlined in the Act that the person shall be presumed, unless the court is satisfied to the contrary, to have committed or attempted to commit the act. I understand this was not included in the framework decision. My understanding it that this measure is being introduced by the Government without its being compelled in any way by the international community. The Minister may contradict me if I am wrong. A rebuttable presumption about intent is the opposite to the way our legal system is usually intended to work. I have serious concerns about this and other aspects of the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_180">Reference was made to the need to implement the recommendations of the Hederman report. Is this the Government's response to the report because it goes in the opposite direction to what the report intended? This criticism has been made and I am concerned that it is normalising emergency type legislation. The Bill is not being introduced as a temporary measure. It does not have the review provisions that exist in regard to offences against the State legislation. It was argued in the Dáil that it should include these provisions. I agree with the point of view that terrorism is an attack on human rights and we must do what we can as a society to prevent it. At the same time one must keep things in perspective in terms of laws. It is important to put in place measures and resource them to ensure that our society is safe. We must guard against introducing laws which remove rights, which are not as effective as they are meant to be and which could cause more dissent in our society.</p>

        <speech by="#PaschalMooney" eId="spk_45">
          <from>Mr. Mooney</from>
          <p eId="para_181">I too welcome the Minister to the House. The Chinese have a phrase about living in interesting times, which I have discovered is more a negative than a positive, the inference being that if one may live in interesting times, one does not live in interesting times. We do indeed live in interesting times. I was inspired by the alliterations of my esteemed friend and colleague, Senator Mansergh, to recall the famous opening words of Charles Dickens's novel, <i> A Tale of Two Cities </i>- “It was the best of times, it was the worst of times”. In the context of this Bill and the wider issues that have focused the minds of the Government and the Minister in particular over the past few weeks, that is probably an apt comment on today’s mood.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">It is ironic that we are discussing an important piece of anti-terrorist legislation at a time when an organisation which we all knew never accepted the legitimacy of this State, fronted by a political organisation with a philosophy quite separate from the rest of us, is at last unmasked, as it were. On the Order of Business I said that I was not at all surprised that the IRA-Sinn Féin republican movement can make a distinction between what it defines as a crime and something being tactically wrong because that movement has always believed it is the legitimate army of this country and that Sinn Féin is the legitimate government-in-waiting of this country. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Government in its entirety are to be commended on reflecting the overwhelming view of the Irish people that we espouse, support and defend democratic values in this society. Long may that be so.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">All of us were somewhat protected over the past decade by a concerned political establishment, a pliant media and, sadly, by an uninformed public from the fact that we were dealing with an organisation which sees itself as taking the holy grail of republicanism from the first Dáil right through each decade and each Administration which this country has democratically elected. It is as if that organisation's members live in a parallel universe. They also have their own parallel language —"whatever you are having yourself". All of that has come into the open in the past few weeks, which is right and proper.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">Like many others, I was one of the people who believed that by drawing Sinn Féin into the political process, into the mainstream political activity of this democracy, a time would come, not too far in the distance — I hoped it would come at the 2007 general election — when politicians on all sides would be able to debate real politics with Sinn Féin and that the latter would be able to debate its policies, such as they are. However, I found it very frustrating and difficult when the leaders of the republican movement appeared nightly on the six o'clock news speaking on one subject — peace, supposedly involving the equality agenda and the democratic mandate, when the events of recent weeks have shown that to be false. Until such time as the movement clarifies its situation we must take it that it does not accept the legitimacy of this State or of this Government to frame laws for the protection of citizens to define criminality and terrorism. The latter is being defined by this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_185">The comments made and inferences drawn by the threats, implied or otherwise, of the republican leadership in defending its view that the IRA was not involved in the bank robbery in Belfast had a chilling dimension. I thought this language was long gone from Irish society, that it was consigned to the history books. I do not believe that the IRA or any other paramilitary organisation operating in a democratic society — Basque separatists were mentioned as an example — could flourish or even advance its military agenda in the current international climate. Read in detail, the legislation before us underpins that point. After the events of 11 September 2001, all is changed —"changed utterly", as W.B. Yeats said in another context. I was hoping that the "terrible beauty" had not been born but it seems that, as I said earlier, it has not left us. For the first time, the legislation before us is an example of international solidarity in the face of a real global threat to the democratic values we all hold dear.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">I belong to the school of thought which has a sneaking feeling that the international political establishment can also talk up a crisis. If one tells one's people often enough and for long enough that there will be a threat — America is an example — people live in fear constantly. The entire political philosophy of the Bush Administration for the future is security focused. It is creating an environment in which the "home of the brave" and the "land of the free" is no longer the shining light which it was for other generations because people are genuinely afraid. I do not believe that they have any real need to be so afraid but the fear comes from the events of 11 September 2001, from what is going on in Iraq and from the activities of al-Qaeda. That fear pushes democratic governments into taking decisions such as this because they feel helpless in the face of terrorist activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">How does one respond to someone who wants to plant a bomb in a shop to blow up women and children? How does one respond to what is happening in Iraq in a cohesive, militarily viable and focused way? Standing armies fight standing wars. Democracies do the best they can within the framework of the law to ensure they protect their citizens against this sort of threat but, as an American president once said, no matter how much secret service protection a person is given, if they want to get one, they will do so in the end. All one can do therefore is reflect the values one has been elected by the people to reflect in a democratic society and to frame legislation which will protect them, their homes and families in so far as is humanly possible, as well as protecting our own democratic way of life.</p>
          <p eId="para_188">It is time we stopped being defensive about propagating the democratic way of life. We hear George Bush and other American leaders propagating it all the time. Why do we not speak similarly more often? In the past few months, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has increasingly put across that message and it is not something to which he came fresh.</p>

          <p eId="para_190">Regardless of whether we are doing so, no one could criticise successive Fianna Fáil Administrations in a time of crisis in this country when it came to questions regarding illegitimate organisations or a democratically elected government. Without going back into history, those Administrations acted in a very pro-active manner. This Government and any government of which Senator Cummins's party would be a member would take equally strong action. Over the past few years we were lured into a false feeling of security and did not address the real terror among us. We are now saying unequivocally and unambiguously that one is either on the democratic side or the criminal side. Those on the latter side are engaged in criminal activity. One can wrap it up in notions of nobility and the green flag, but those people have no mandate from the people for what they have been doing. As Senator Mansergh so eloquently asked, after 30 years of war and devastation and 3,500 lost lives, what did that achieve in terms of advancing a united Ireland? I suggest the answer he did — nothing. As a young teenager, I went to London and became a member of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association when it was a time of peaceful protest in 1969 to 1970. I walked in many such protests from Hyde Park Corner to Trafalgar Square. These protests were about "one man, one vote", the ending of the Special Powers Act, the equality agenda and so forth. The cause was moving forward and being advanced. Stormont fell, the British Government took action and the Irish Government became involved. Then it all went horribly wrong, because the Provos got involved and decided that matters were not moving fast enough. They decided to start shooting the Brits because all they knew was "Brits out". I do not have any real sympathy for the republican movement in that context. It has continued to justify what it has done over the past 30 years, culminating in the disgraceful remarks of Mr. Mitchel McLaughlin, when he could not bring himself to admit that what happened to Mrs. Jean McConville was heinous and a cruel, foul murder, beyond saying, "But it was wrong".</p>
          <p eId="para_191">My final comment relates to a section of the Bill as introduced by the Minister in the Dáil aimed at trying to head off those who support terrorism. I believe this has been a fundamental problem in this State, as regards the indigenous threat. I may be straying somewhat, but if this legislation had been framed at the time of the trial of those who killed Garda Jerry McCabe, perhaps due process might have taken a different direction because there was large-scale intimidation of witnesses. If the legislation had been there, more definitive evidence might have been brought before the judges, who could then have decided whether the people involved were supporting a cause, forced into the action they took or whatever. I am not taking that case in isolation, and also recall several other instances. That is an important addition to the legislation. As I said at the outset, it is concerned with expressing international solidarity as a sovereign independent country which fully supports the ideals of the United Nations. I believe we are to be commended for taking action on this matter, notwithstanding the fact that the legislation was, perhaps, somewhat delayed. We are going to ratify three important UN conventions. That is to advance another stage in the long journey referred to by Robert Emmett when he said, "When my country takes its place among the nations of the earth..." We are moving in the right direction in taking our place in the international brotherhood of democratic nations and I commend the Bill.</p>

          <from>Mr. McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_192">I welcome the Minister to the House and the proposed legislation, purely in the context of recent criminal activities and also that of 11 September and the Madrid bombings of 11 March 2004. I could continue with a litany of different types of international terrorism. The lay person accepts that international terrorism is a problem. It is a serious issue that has to be challenged, with a strategy being put in place. However, an ambiguity exists among the laity as regards the measures being enacted and strategies being put in place specifically by the US Administration. Anyone with common sense could not accept the rationale for entering Iraq on the grounds that there were weapons of mass destruction there. There were no weapons of mass destruction, therefore, logic is out the window.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">In terms of the confusion and ambiguity that exists in Ireland, matters are not as simplistic as people, including those in Government circles, would like them to be as regards curing the ills or trying to engineer a settlement of the historical dispute in Northern Ireland. If I walk 20 miles across the Border from Letterkenny to Derry, to Free Derry Corner, I am confronted by a large mural of the Palestinian flag. The ambiguity associated with that as regards people who are trying to move forward and evolve in a civilised manner, sends out many connotations. A relationship may exist in terms of oppression through the years, in colonisation by respective countries, but the ambiguity as regards the ordinary citizen living in Northern Ireland or in this State, is very palpable. I read yesterday in the <i>Irish News</i> that an esteemed journalist, Ms Nell McCafferty, believed that the IRA was not involved in the bank robbery in Belfast. That is her opinion. She bases it on the fact that she has asked senior ranking people within the IRA if they had robbed the bank, and they said “No”. That is confusion and ambiguity. One may go on a Saturday night to a nightclub in Derry and get £1,000 sterling in Northern Bank notes for £250 sterling. Laundering of money is taking place on the doorsteps in Nationalist communities in Derry.</p>
          <p eId="para_194">In terms of the money laundering aspects of the legislation, will the Minister say where these take effect? How does the Bill protect Border counties on the Republic side, because this activity is large-scale and widespread across nightclubs, businesses and pubs in Northern Ireland as a result of this bank raid? If one asks in Nationalist communities who was responsible for the bank raid, one will be told it was the IRA. That is the information we are getting and it is the word on the street. We must always take note of what we hear on the grapevine. No matter what legislation we enact on this side of the Border, however, or how much support we give the Garda, we still need a similar police network in Northern Ireland with which it can work in a co-operative manner. That is not happening and will not happen until all members of the community have full confidence in their security system, the PSNI. Mr. Denis Bradley outlines on a constant basis the need for all political parties to become involved in the PSNI. We can talk about peace processes and power sharing at a political level, but the work must be done on the ground. In order to counteract criminal behaviour at a grassroots level there must be confidence in the justice system. We must start at the local level within communities in Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">We cannot stereotype the Northern Ireland culture. There are so many different aspects to it. However, there are elements within the Nationalist community — whether it be a culture or a way of life — that still believe it is acceptable to carry out criminal behaviour. It is not on for a political party such as Sinn Féin to be constantly talking about its electoral mandate. I believe Mr. Martin McGuinness keeps referring to 350,000 voters North and South as Sinn Féin's electoral mandate. I believe I am in politics for the larger community. I would warn Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats as regards something touched on by Senator Mooney. On the one hand, Sinn Féin is talking about its electoral mandate. Now, all of a sudden Fianna Fáil is talking about its own electoral mandate and the PDs are looking at theirs. It is not about electoral mandates, but rather about finding a lasting solution to the problems of Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">It is not about working and establishing how many people vote for one, but rather about a lasting solution. At the last round of negotiations the British and Irish Governments failed. They were not the first administrations to fail. There have been successive failures. Today's debate is not about the peace process, but if we are to move forward in this regard, criminality has to be addressed.</p>

          <from>Mr. Coonan</from>
          <p class="indent_1" title="motionProposal" eId="para_197">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_198">That Seanad Éireann acknowledges the tremendous contribution by the Irish sugar beet industry to the economic and social development of rural Ireland since 1926 and recognises the ongoing importance of the industry to Irish farming:</p>
          <p eId="para_199">—regrets the recent announcement by Greencore plc to cease sugar production at the Carlow plant from March 2005 and calls on the company to reverse this decision and take no other such actions until the EU reforms concerning the Irish sugar quota are concluded;</p>
          <p eId="para_200">—urges the Minister for Agriculture and Food to resist strongly any EU proposals which would threaten the long-term viability of sugar beet growing in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, to the House. It is the first time I have spoken in front of him and I wish him well in his new job. I also thank the spokesperson from the Labour Party who facilitated us with the time to move this motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">We tabled this motion because of the tragic situation in which the workers of the Carlow sugar factory found themselves. We also wanted to debate the issue surrounding the proposed reforms of the sugar industry and its impact on Ireland and acknowledge the contribution sugar production has made to the economy since the 1920s. I thought this would be a unanimous motion and that there was a sense of agreement among the parties about it. However, now I find that there is an amendment to it. We will now have to be more political than we had intended to be.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">The motion comes in three parts. The first part acknowledges the tremendous contribution of the sugar beet industry to the economic and social development of rural Ireland since 1926 and recognises the ongoing importance of that industry to the farming community. The second part regrets or even condemns the recent announcement by Greencore plc to cease sugar production at Carlow from next March. We call on the company and on the Minister to exercise her authority and to reverse the decision that has been made. The third part of the motion supports the Minister for Agriculture and Food and her Department, urging them to resist strongly any EU proposals which would threaten the long-term viability of the beef industry in Ireland. This is a matter of vital national importance and, as such, we urge the Minister to exhaust all procedures to ensure that the interest of the beet growers and of the farming community in Ireland is copper-fastened.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">The industry is worth €80 million to farmers per annum and €140 million to the economy. There are 3,700 specialist tillage farmers involved in production and beet is the backbone of tillage farming. If the beet industry goes, tillage farming will go with it. There are 500 workers directly employed and up to 8,000 jobs are directly or indirectly involved in the industry. Towns like Carlow and Mallow were built on the foundation of a prosperous sugar industry, as were towns like Tuam and Thurles at one stage. Regrettably, they are in decline and have never recovered since the industry was closed in both of those towns. Despite a multitude of promises for Thurles, no industry has ever replaced that which was lost due to the closure of the factory there.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">Everyone is aware that there is a challenge facing the sugar industry due to the EU reforms as proposed, as well as the WTO agreements. If the proposals as suggested by the EU were to be implemented, it would result in a 16% cut in quota for Ireland and a 37% cut in prices, which would be an absolute disaster for the industry and for the growers. The WTO talks are designed to placate the giant sugar cane producers like Brazil, Thailand and Australia. Since the announcements were made, growers, farm leaders, workers, unions, politicians and the Government have embarked on a significant lobbying campaign at EU and national level to ensure a fair deal for Ireland. The Greencore decision to close the sugar factory in Carlow has seriously damaged Ireland's negotiating position. The Minister for Agriculture and Food issued a statement saying that it did not damage our negotiating position. I do not go along with that but, more importantly, the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, emphatically stated at yesterday's protest rally in Carlow that it does serious damage to Ireland's negotiating position. Perhaps the Minister of State here tonight might be able to explain where this has broken down because this is another clear example of a Government in disarray. There is no unity of purpose and no unity of policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">The closure, as proposed, is premature. The chief executive, Dr. Brady, has admitted that the reforms coming from the EU are at least 18 months away. This means these reforms would not take effect before the end of 2006. I believe that the decision was taken solely in the interests of the company and certainly not in the interest of the country, the growers or the workers in Carlow sugar factory. Is this the new version of socialism as outlined recently by the Taoiseach? Is this the impact it will have on the people? There was absolutely no consultation involved. I am not aware of any consultation between the company and the growers, the farm leaders, the workers or the unions. Was there consultation with the Department and the Minister and, if so, when did this consultation take place? When was the Minister of State informed of the decision? What has he done since? Will he outline his programme of action and tell Members the reason for this closure? Nobody seems to know the reason.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">It is time for action. We have lost valuable ground and we need to take immediate action to ensure that this decision is reversed. I understand the Minister has contacted the Office of the Attorney General for advice on the ownership of the quota rights. What was the response of the Attorney General? More important, what is the Government's opinion on who owns the quota rights established with the various factories or with the sugar company?</p>
          <p eId="para_208">What is the situation with what is known as the golden share? Is it the Minister's intention to use that golden share, which gives her the authority to defer any decision taken by the company? We also wish to know more about the timing of this closure. Did the Minister know about the closure or did the company capitalise on the fact that the Minister, the Taoiseach and other members of the Government were part of a significant trade delegation to China? If the Minister did not know, it appears the company was trying to pull a fast one and hoped to get away with it. However, it should be made clear that the farming community and the beet growers will not allow the company to pull the wool over their eyes.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">This closure is driven by greed. The company made a profit of €20 million last year, €10 million of which was from the production of sugar. This occurred at a time when 25% of the sugar consumed in this country was imported. It followed recent unsuccessful Greencore investments in the United Kingdom and the United States. The company lost €71 million in the United States on an investment with Imperial Sugar. In the United Kingdom, the company lost €51.4 million in companies such as Rathbones Bakeries and James Budgett Sugars Limited. Are these bad investment policies by the company management to be paid for by the sugar producer, the farmers and the workers in the industry? They are not; it is time for the Minister to take action on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">This company is putting profits before people and wallets in pockets before jobs. That is clearly illustrated when one sees that the five executive directors of the company pay themselves €2.58 million. The managing director of Greencore, Mr. Dilger, receives €861,000. Admittedly, he has taken a big wage reduction of €100,000 from the previous year. That amounts to €2,500 per day or €17,500 per week. That is obscene at a time when he proposes to kick the workers out of the sugar factory in Carlow.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">I urge the Minister of State to take immediate and urgent action. He should talk to the senior Minister, Deputy Coughlan, and ask her to discard her aura of beauty and charm.</p>

        <speech by="#FeargalBrowne" eId="spk_52">
          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_214">I thank the Labour Party for agreeing to switch its Private Members' time to facilitate this important debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">There was great anger in Carlow at the announcement two weeks ago concerning the closure of the sugar factory. People in Carlow are realistic and are aware there are choppy times ahead for the sugar beet industry. However, it is hard to understand a company that made €10 million from sugar beet processing in Carlow deciding to close that factory, especially when vital talks are due to take place in the EU concerning the sugar quota. That action has weakened the Minister's hand.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">I am severely critical of the Minister for releasing a statement last week in which she said that Greencore's action did not weaken her hand. Nobody believes that. The statement was undermined yesterday in Carlow by the former president of the IFA and current Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, when he clearly said that the company's action did weaken the Government's hand. It is outrageous that Greencore took this action in advance of the decision being taken at EU level which, as my colleague mentioned, could be 18 months hence.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">The annual report from Greencore last year showed that profits before tax increased by 8% and that net debt had been reduced. One section reported on steady profitability in sugar which was driven by an excellent processing campaign, increased quota and cost control. Carlow sugar factory has done excellent work in terms of reducing soil intake when taking in the beet crop. It has done a huge amount of work in the environmental area. The factory has been reducing costs consistently. I presume the same applies in Mallow. The reduction in soil intake means the factory has to deal with less soil, stones and so forth.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">The sugar factory has also put much effort into traffic management in Carlow. Last year's campaign was good. It started on time even though it coincided with the opening of the National Ploughing Championships. People feared there would be chaos on the roads but there was none. Everybody involved in the campaign, including the factory staff, growers and hauliers, co-operated excellently with the gardaí and ensured a smooth start to the campaign, which ended on target before Christmas.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">It beggars belief that Greencore would make this decision in the first week of January without consulting the workers, the IFA, the beet growers and the hauliers and without giving consideration to the impact it will have. There are issues, which must be resolved with regard to the Carlow factory. Even if the factory there were to close tomorrow, transporting the beet from Carlow and surrounding counties to Mallow will be a major difficulty. Greencore suggested building a new rail depot in Bagenalstown but that has not even reached planning application stage. There have been no discussions so far with the local authority. The local road infrastructure will not be able to cope with the extra traffic. Some people believe the rail depot could take four years to complete. I hope it will not take that long but severe difficulties lie ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">Any such planning application will require an environmental impact study and a traffic impact study. Obviously, the local community will also be involved in the planning process. There are major issues of concern in this regard. There is also the problem of extra transport costs for growers in Carlow and surrounding counties who are furthest away from the Mallow plant. They have not been given any assurances with regard to those extra costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">A few years ago I was involved in a protest campaign with Carlow sugar factory about beet prices. The former president of the IFA and current Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, was involved in that campaign during which there was a major stand-off. Finally, the company backed down and the beet prices were agreed. The farmers and the growers campaigned together and won the day. I hope the same will occur in this case.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">I regret and resent the fact that an amendment has been proposed by the Government to this motion. The motion was deliberately non-contentious and simple. It merely sought to recognise the huge contribution the beet growing industry has made to rural Ireland, both socially and economically. It also seeks to put pressure on Greencore to immediately reverse the decision to close the factory in Carlow from 2005 and to take no further action until the EU discussions regarding sugar quota are concluded. That was a fair and reasonable request and it was made, loud and clear, yesterday by all the parties, including that of the Minister of State, and by Deputy Nolan when speaking in front of 4,000 people in Carlow. The president of the IFA, the beet growers and everyone involved in the industry made the same request.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">It is regrettable that the Government has decided to amend the motion. In my view, it has turned its back on the factory in Carlow. It has raised the white flag, accepted defeat and is stating that the Carlow factory cannot be kept open for even one further season. This is despite the fact that the EU discussions are a long way from completion and that the necessary rail depot might not actually be in place in time for the autumn campaign in seven and a half months' time. I regret that the Government has thrown in the towel in respect of this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">It is time the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, abandoned her "Mary from Dungloe" approach and got tough with Greencore. She should ask the executives of the company what they are playing at, take them on and ensure that the sugar quota is returned to the ownership of the beet growers of Ireland. In my opinion, Greencore cannot be trusted.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">The difficulties experienced in Carlow during the past two weeks may also be experienced in Mallow in a few years' time, particularly if Greencore decides to import sugar cane from abroad. Senator Ulick Burke will later relate the experience in Tuam. Senator Coonan already referred to what happened in Thurles, namely, that when Greencore pulled out, the town was devastated and no substitute industry was put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">It is a matter of concern that Greencore obviously had a plan to develop the Carlow site, which is extremely valuable. However, it could be in for a shock. At recent meetings of Carlow County Council and Carlow Town Council, members gave clear indications that they will not co-operate with any rezoning to make the land more valuable for development, that they want it to remain zoned for industrial use and the creation of jobs and that they will not play into the hands of Greencore. That message should be broadcast loud and clear to the company. There is existing infrastructure at the plant which could lend itself to the creation of future jobs in the area of biotechnology. However, Greencore has not even considered this fact.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">Greencore is a huge company and sugar production is only a small element of its activities. It could consider locating another aspect of its business at the Carlow factory in order to ensure that jobs are not lost in the town. I cannot overemphasise the fact that people in Carlow are extremely annoyed about the behaviour of Mr. Dilger and the executives of Greencore who decided to announce this decision to the Stock Exchange before consulting anyone else involved. This is not a simple matter of closing the factory in Carlow, building houses on the site, making a fortune and moving on. Major issues will arise in terms of the development of the land and the decommissioning of the site. There could be soil contamination and the lagoons and swamps might not lend themselves to development is the context envisaged by Greencore. There are also issues involving planning, particularly in terms of transport and the railway depot at Bagenalstown.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">One must question Greencore's long-term plans for the sugar beet industry. During my lifetime, the number of sugar beet operations has been reduced from four to two and now down to one. Where will it end? I hope people in Mallow will not in the future experience the difficulties currently being faced by their counterparts in Carlow.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">I have great pleasure in seconding the Fine Gael motion. I hope the Minister will, as a result of this debate, come to the conclusion that there is a need for steely resolution on her part in terms of taking on the Greencore executives on this issue, in respect of which they are blatantly wrong. These individuals were proven wrong a number of years ago in respect of beet prices and they backed down. I am of the opinion that they should again back down and take no further action until the EU discussions are concluded. That is a fair and reasonable request, particularly when one considers that Greencore made a €10 million profit from the Carlow plant last year.</p>

          <p eId="para_230">I move amendment No. 1:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_231">To delete all words after "Seanad Éireann" and substitute the following:</p>
          <p eId="para_232">—acknowledges the tremendous contribution by the Irish sugar beet industry to the economic and social development of rural Ireland since 1926</p>

          <p eId="para_235">—supports the Minister for Agriculture and Food in her ongoing efforts to ensure that the future shape of the EU sugar regime will be consistent with the continuance of a competitive sugar beet growing and processing industry in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">I have particular pleasure in welcoming the Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Smith, on the occasion of his first visit to the House. I am glad he was appointed to this portfolio because he is a person of tremendous competence and I welcome the fact that this has been recognised.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">The similarity between the motion and the amendment is apparent. One could ask why an amendment was tabled. I had contemplated tabling a motion similar to that under discussion. Be that as it may, however, we are dealing with a motion and an amendment thereto. I recognise the sensible approach taken by the proposer and seconder of the motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">I am as shocked as anyone regarding the sudden announcement about the closure of the Carlow beet plant. One must be surprised by the fact that it has come at this particular point. My reasons for highlighting the latter may be different from those of others. I do not entirely support those who state that it could undermine the Minister in terms of her negotiations with Europe. If we adopt that defeatist attitude from the outset, we are saying to the Minister that she will not achieve anything and that the sugar industry here will disappear.</p>

          <from>Mr. Coonan</from>

          <from>Mr. Callanan</from>
          <p eId="para_240">Greencore is a private company. While ownership of the sugar quota being produced has not yet been established, the fact is that if we commence with a defeatist attitude and state that the Minister will not be able to achieve anything in the negotiations as a result of the closure of Carlow, it will merely be a sign that we are throwing in the towel. If people say that the closure of Carlow is wrong, I will agree with them. I will not formally state that, however, even though I have indicated my agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">It is right and proper that Greencore should take a responsible attitude in terms of the future. What is the nature of such an attitude? Before I attempt to answer that question, I must state that I am somewhat surprised by the timing of Greencore's announcement. I say this because, like everyone else, I am aware of the challenge posed by European sugar producers such as the French who are dying to enter the Irish market. If we do not consolidate and improve the situation here, we will not be able to meet that challenge.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">I may be the only Member present who has a direct interest in the growing of sugar beet. Some may state that I am making my remarks from a Cork perspective but that is not the case. However, I am making them from the perspective of my direct interest in the industry. The sugar industry in this country could well be lost unless we are prepared to meet the challenge we face and to change. There is no doubt that change will occur. The Minister's greatest task will be to minimise the effect of that change and protect the Irish industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">I welcome the fact that the motion and the amendment state that the House should give every support to the Minister in her endeavours to protect the sugar beet industry. If significant changes cannot be achieved under the Fischler proposals in May or June, Ireland will lose the industry. It does not matter whether the Mallow or Carlow factories or both remain open, there will be nothing. We should adopt a cautionary, responsible attitude. It is easy to criticise Greencore but I am doing so because they are closing the factory so suddenly and Senator Browne raised a number of questions deserving of consideration. The House should call on Greencore and Irish Sugar to put what is required in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">Senator Browne referred to the loading bay at Bagenalstown. Will it be in place next September? If Greencore is given an excuse, what will it say or do? Laois beet growers rightly say they need a connection to Mallow. If a climate of doubt, dispute and tardiness is created, Greencore will say the Government and the taxpayer should pick up the tab because the company wanted to do it. I am surprised at the attitude of Carlow County Council and Carlow Town Council. If one is to take a sensible approach, the survival of the industry is critical and it requires us to put our shoulders to the wheel together and I hope we can do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">I refer to the golden share. There is ambiguity regarding who owns it. There are special conditions under which Greencore cannot dispose of the controlling interest in Irish Sugar Limited, its sugar assets or the sugar quota without the prior written consent of the Minister. The Minister is not empowered to become involved in operational matters or ordinary business decisions made by the company. We, the growers, own the quota and if there is a doubt about that, the Minister and the Department should legislate in this regard because there will not be asset stripping and our rights will not be abolished.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">Is the European Union serious about the ACPs or poorer countries when it says they can import everything except arms? Will developing countries be held back? The World Trade Organisation and wealthy countries such as Brazil seek to stop the provision of funds to the ACPs and allow slave labour to continue. Let us reach out with the hand of friendship and help to poor, developing countries.</p>

          <p eId="para_247">Everybody with a heart and a sense of compassion and justice will be concerned about the workforce of the Carlow sugar factory, which is located only 12 miles from my home town. It was recognised as a serious, secure but difficult employment for full-time workers and people travelled in significant numbers during my childhood from Athy to work in the factory. The sugar company was a considerable achievement on the part of the State and it will forever be associated in my age group's mind with Lieutenant General M. J. Costello, a classic example of a public sector entrepreneur who was never short of ideas.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">However, it was a different world then and the motion and the amendment raise an unanswered question. Let us consider what has happened in Ireland over the past 40 years. Significant textile, footwear and car assembly industries have almost disappeared and, while we still have a major information and communications industry, sections of it that were located in the State ten or 15 years ago are gone. When Seagate in Clonmel closed, I suggested, with my tongue firmly in my cheek, that the State should buy its surplus product and sell it at a subsidised price in the developing world. While I was joking, there were parallels between that and the defence of agriculture that I often heard in the House at that time, which comprised the belief that a tide could be held back.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">The debate should address the tide that is impossible to hold back. The two largest political parties in the State have served farmers poorly by pretending to them that if we keep our eyes shut and our hands over our ears and avoid everything, like the famous ostrich burying its head, nothing will happen. If we say "Boo" in the dark, it will all go away. However, that is not the case and the job is to manage the transition.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">I am not impressed by what I have seen so far. A serious strategy involving Government, Greencore and other agencies to manage the transition has not been devised. Greencore has made a brutal decision in the interest of no more than short-term viability. The conditions that have forced the company to consolidate at one site will lead in the medium term to a decision that the indigenous sugar industry is non-viable. For example, I do not know whether specific speciality brands of sugar could be produced only from domestic beet. It is a great tragedy because the sugar company is extraordinary and unique in terms of its capacity for technological and product innovation and its capacity to extend itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">However, its looks increasingly likely we will not have to deal with a determination to say, "No, it will not happen", but to manage a process, the outcome of which none of us can forecast. I do not know whether we can put together a beet-based sugar processing industry which can compete with international imports. I agree with Senator Callanan on this matter. I received a firm reprimand from a senior representative of a Third World country. One of our jobs is to ensure that wherever we have free trade — and we should have it — those who work to produce should operate according to standards that are decent in their own country. I do not want to tell people they must be paid as well in Brazil as here in Ireland. However, by the standards of their country they ought to have the freedom to join a trade union. If we are endeavouring to import from countries where those rights do not exist, it is our Government's job to negotiate a deal though the World Trade Organisation. However, I do not believe there is a long-term future for a viable, commercially independent sugar beet industry even if that were done.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">I attended a World Trade Organisation parliamentary assembly in Geneva two years ago. Delegates were talking about the changes that had been agreed in the area of sugar production. It was a slight relief for Irish parliamentarians because the reiterated complaint of the parliamentary representatives of the developing world was that, on the issue of agriculture, Ireland and France were holding back progress within the EU. In their view, Ireland's rhetoric and acknowledged generosity were tainted by the Irish determination not to allow them to properly and fairly use their comparative advantage in many areas of agriculture to access one of the two biggest markets in the world. It was not just an Ireland and EU issue; it was a complaint against the EU and the United States. These Third World countries were aware France and Ireland were the culprits. Many of them could say that if France did not have Ireland, it would not in many cases be able to stop it on its own. They saw it as a political combination of a big and a small country.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">It is a great pity that we only discuss issues such as this in the middle of a crisis. As such, it is very easy to say we should act like King Canute and stand in front and say, "Go back". This will not go back. We are misleading both the workforce in the two factories and those who produce sugar beet if we tell them it will. We can only manage the change; we most assuredly cannot stop it. It is high time we began to talk about a future for all agriculture and food industry based on the reality that within five, ten or 20 years it will be based on a free trade arrangement where the only boundaries to trade will be issues of quality in terms of human safety. To pretend otherwise to farmers or people who work in the food industry is to mislead them.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonScanlon" eId="spk_57">
          <from>Mr. Scanlon</from>
          <p eId="para_254">I welcome the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, to the House and am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on the amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">That the motion and amendment are compatible reflects the seriousness of the situation. I am aware of a farmer in Portarlington who grows 30 acres of sugar beet with a quota of 440 tonnes. From the planting of the beet until it comes out of the ground, it costs €14,000. His quota is worth €22,000 which represents an approximate profit of €8,000 when it is taken to the factory in Carlow. As a result of the decision to close the Carlow plant that farmer is well and truly out of business because there is no way in the world he can transport his sugar beet from Portarlington to Mallow.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">I ask the Minister to use her influence whatever way she can to ensure facilities are put in place for the farmers of the general midlands area who are growing sugar beet to take the beet by rail to Mallow, as proposed. Can she also ensure that such facilities are put in place before the factory closes to facilitate those farmers? Otherwise, farmers in the midlands who grow sugar beet will be out of business. At this stage they have no way of obtaining entitlements on their land for the reference years 2001 and 2002. They have no way of being compensated for having to stop growing sugar.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">I have no doubt the Minister will do her utmost in the coming talks to ensure these farmers are looked after. Many speakers have suggested that the decision could perhaps be deferred for one year. This would allow people more notice and time to try to resolve their personal situations with regard to the growing of sugar beet.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">Greencore is a private company and must live within the boundaries of the global business market. However, perhaps its decision was premature and it should have waited. I am giving the Minister the opportunity to make the best case for Ireland at the WTO talks. We all know there is a problem within the industry, that the market must be opened up, that there will be a 16% reduction and that the Irish sugar beet industry will face tough times. However, it would have been better if Greencore had deferred its decision and given the Minister every opportunity to fight the best case.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">I hope the Minister is successful for the sake of the farmers in the Midlands and the workers employed in the Carlow factory.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture_and_Food" eId="spk_58">
          <from>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mary Coughlan)</from>
          <p eId="para_260">Tá lúcháir orm bheith anseo le cúpla focal a rá faoin tionscal siúcra in Éirinn agus faoin díospóireacht atá idir láimhe san Eoraip.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">Sugar beet growing and sugar processing have a long tradition in Ireland dating back to 1926 when the first sugar factory was established in Carlow. The Government has always been very committed to the industry, both to sugar beet growing and sugar manufacturing. In 1933 the then Government acquired the Carlow factory and Irish Sugar came into existence. For many years Siúcra Éireann Teoranta, a semi-State body, was the only manufacturer of sugar in the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">The manufacturing industry provides the essential outlet for the sugar beet crop which is a very important element in the agricultural economy and a valuable source of income to 3,800 farmers in the beet growing sector. On the manufacturing side, the industry has provided important employment opportunities at the sugar plants in Carlow and Mallow in addition to supporting employment in associated industries.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">The most important element in the overall sugar sector is the EU sugar regime which underpins the entire sugar beet growing and sugar manufacturing industry in the community. The essential features of the regime are rules on prices and production quotas. The objectives of the current regime which has been in existence since 1968, long before Ireland joined the EU, are to guarantee a reasonable and secure standard of living and income to growers of sugar beet and sugar cane; to ensure a constant supply of sugar beet and sugar cane to the sugar manufacturing industry; and to ensure a continued supply of high quality sugar at reasonable prices to consumers, both industry and domestic.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">Great credit is due to all involved in the industry in that they have consistently contributed to the delivery of all of these objectives. Growers receive a good return on their investment, the industry has a constant supply of raw material and the consumer has a guaranteed and secure supply of high quality sugar.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">Under the EU sugar regime, Ireland has a quota for manufactured sugar of approximately 199,000 tonnes which amounts to roughly 1.1% of the total EU quota. The quota is available for use by the sugar manufacturing enterprises in the member state. In Ireland the quota is processed by Irish Sugar Limited, the only manufacturer of sugar in the country. Irish Sugar Limited places annual contracts with farmers to grow a specific tonnage of sugar beet sufficient to manufacture the quota. I compliment those involved in the industry on the fact that, in almost every year since we joined the European Union, the quota has been filled. There have been a few exceptions, mainly due to bad weather. This year, the 2004 harvest was very good and beet deliveries allowed for the manufacture of more than 220,000 tonnes of sugar, well above the quota.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">Reform of the EU sugar regime is high on the EU agenda because of international pressures. These pressures fall under three main headings. The first is the WTO round. This will bring strong pressure on the European Union to allow increased access to our markets for all products including sugar. In addition, demands will be made to reduce the level of export refunds paid on Community products being exported to third countries. Second, Australia, Brazil and Thailand have taken a WTO panel action against the EU sugar regime on the grounds that there is cross subsidisation of EU sugar exports. The initial ruling is against the European Union. It has appealed the decision and the outcome of that appeal is expected in March or April 2005. An unfavourable ruling would have very serious consequences for EU sugar exports. The third heading is the Everything But Arms initiative which will allow sugar from the least developed countries, LDCs, to be imported into the European Union duty free from 2009 onwards. As the internal price of sugar in the European Union is considerably higher than the world price, the provision of unlimited access for cheaper LDC sugar will lead to a significant surge in imports, thus impacting on the production and price in the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">The European Commission is expected to bring forward legislative proposals for reform of the sugar regime in May of this year. However, it outlined its broad ideas for reform of the regime in a communication to the Council and the European Parliament last July. These proposals include a reduction in two stages in the institutional price of sugar by 33% to €421 per tonne; a similar two-stage reduction in the price of sugar beet to €27.40 per tonne; partial compensation to farmers of 60% for the reduction in the price of sugar beet — the compensation to be part of the direct payment and subject to cross compliance; and in the case of quotas, a reduction of 16% across all member states is proposed. The transfer of quotas between member states is also envisaged.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">It is generally acknowledged that reform of the EU sugar regime, which was not dealt with in the main CAP reform process in 2003 and 2004, is unavoidable because of developments at WTO level and other international pressures. However, the European Commission's initial reform ideas would, if adopted, have serious repercussions for sugar beet growing and processing in this country. I have made it clear in discussions in the Council of Ministers that the Commission's initial proposals are unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">Along with nine other EU member states, I signed a letter to the European Commissioner for Agriculture stating that the Commission proposals would have a devastating effect on farms and the industrial enterprises working in the sector. We accept the necessity to reform the existing regime but feel that the reform should aim at maintaining the existing distribution of sugar beet and sugar production in the entire EU territory. We believe that reform should be based on the following principles: an import system from third countries should be put in place which will ensure predictable and regular import quantities; the price reduction should be significantly less than what is currently proposed and should be implemented more gradually; the impact of the quota reductions should fall mainly on those member states that are net exporters of sugar; and the transfer of quotas among member states should not be allowed.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">As I mentioned earlier, the Commission is expected to bring forward legislative proposals in May with a view to reaching agreement in the Council of Ministers before the end of the year. My overall objective in the forthcoming negotiations is to ensure the future shape of the EU sugar regime is consistent with the continuation of an efficient sugar beet growing and processing industry in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">I am conscious that the recent decision by Greencore to close its plant in Carlow, with the loss of 189 full-time and 137 "campaign" jobs, came as a shock to many people. I am obviously concerned about the personal impact these job losses will have on families. I have been in contact with my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, and I am aware that Enterprise Ireland is actively looking at replacement jobs for the area. That said however, the decision to close the Carlow plant was a commercial decision taken by the company in light of the increasing competition in the sugar sector and taking account of the reality that changes will occur in the industry as a consequence of the reform of the EU sugar regime.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">The trend towards rationalisation and increased productivity in the sugar sector has been evident throughout the European Union for some time, with the number of sugar plants decreasing by over 40% between 1990 and 2001. However, I am glad that Greencore's rationalisation programme involves an investment of €20 million to €25 million in Mallow, which clearly demonstrates a commitment to maintaining an efficient sugar processing industry in Ireland. I understand that work is to begin immediately on a substantial upgrading of the Mallow plant.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">To facilitate the one factory operation, beet from the Wexford region will be diverted to Wellingtonbridge for transport to Mallow by rail. The company plans a new rail depot to be established in the Carlow region to assist beet growers make their deliveries. I understand that a planning application will be submitted to Carlow County Council shortly in this regard. I am confident that the company and the beet growers will be able to work out satisfactory arrangements to cope with this new situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">As Minister, I hold a single special share in Greencore plc. That share has the same monetary value as any other share in the company. However, it has conditions attached which prevent the company from engaging in a number of activities without the prior written consent of the Minister.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" eId="spk_60" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture_and_Food">
          <from>Mary Coughlan</from>
          <p eId="para_276">In summary, the special share prevents the disposal of the controlling interest in Irish Sugar Limited or the sugar assets and prevents a single shareholder or group of shareholders acting together from gaining control of Greencore plc. The special share does not allow me to interfere in the commercial decisions of the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">The issue of the ownership of the quota has been raised in the context of the Commission's proposal to allow the possibility of cross border quota mobility. Several member states, including Ireland, are opposed to this idea. The Commission has indicated that if the proposal on quota mobility is maintained, it will propose appropriate rules to deal with that situation. In the meantime, I have sought the Attorney General's advice on the issue. I am aware that the ownership issue is unclear throughout the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">In facing the future, I anticipate that there will be difficult and protracted negotiations on the reform proposals. As I stated earlier, my overall objective in these discussions will be to protect the viability of sugar beet growing and processing in this country. I will work vigorously in common with like-minded member states towards that end.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">Following debate there were views that my position at negotiating level within the European Union would be undermined as a consequence of the decisions made by a private company. My view, and that of those I have spoken to and from whom I have taken advice, is that this in no way undermines, from a sugar beet point of view, the negotiations that will take place. The situation is difficult. The negotiations will be protracted. We do not have, in the political sense of the Council, support from the large players. However, we have a blocking minority. In any further discussions with the Commissioner, whom I met before Christmas, and working with our officials at Commission level, we will do all we can to support the sugar beet industry here.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">To reiterate, for the many concerned elected Members in the House who represent constituencies that are affected, replacement jobs should be a priority.</p>

        <speech by="#PaulBradford" eId="spk_64">
          <from>Mr. Bradford</from>
          <p eId="para_284">We are discussing market reforms and structural reforms in Irish agriculture and I am aware that a similar debate is taking place in China. I welcome the Minister, Deputy Coughlan. As she is aware, she has the full support of every Member of the Oireachtas in the challenges which face her at European Union level as talks move towards a conclusion on the EU sugar proposals. It is important that she has full political support, in as far as is possible and politically practicable, from all sides of the House for her endeavours at European Union level. The future of the Irish sugar industry is at stake in the weeks and months ahead. The Minister, her party colleagues and all of us know full well that if the original EU proposals, or any similar set of proposals, are implemented it will sound the death knell of the Irish sugar industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">The Minister put the issue in context when she referred to the fact that Ireland has 1.1% of the European sugar quota. That shows what a small player we are on the European and world stage. However, within Irish agriculture, the sugar industry remains a core sector. At one time we had four sugar factories and now that number is down to two with the intention of moving to a one-factory situation. Almost 4,000 growers are dependent on sugar beet for their livelihood. The number of people employed directly and indirectly is in the region of 10,000 which indicates we are dealing with a significant industry. The EU is now threatening the core of this industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">A document on the reform of the sugar sector was issued by the European Commission in Brussels on 14 July 2004 to the European Council and Parliament. This was brought to the attention of the Sub-committee on EU Scrutiny of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs, on which I serve, on 9 September last year. We immediately referred it to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture and Food. All Members of the House, regardless of whether they are from rural or urban areas, are aware that these proposals would decimate this indigenous industry. We must send a strong message to Europe that the Irish political family is united behind the Minister in her attempt to secure the future of the industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">The Minister said her negotiating hand is not in any way weakened by the recent Greencore decision to shut the Carlow plant. However, her junior ministerial colleague, the former IFA president, Deputy Parlon, thinks differently. I am not making a political point. The view of the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, is on the record, as is the view of the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon. Nobody can be totally certain of what will be the outcome. It must be most disappointing for the workers and growers in Carlow and the broader area and everybody involved in the local economy to see Greencore take such a sudden decision. We are very relieved in Mallow that it has been decided to retain the plant there. We consider that a wise decision. There have been many improvements in Mallow in recent years, not just from an infrastructural point of view but from a work practice point of view. The Mallow plant has a future as long as the sugar industry has a future. The challenge for this House and for the Minister is to address not where the factories are located but whether the industry will survive.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">Senator Ryan stated that we cannot ignore the future of agriculture and hope the problems will go away. I have called for a debate on the future of agriculture in the House on a number of occasions in the past 18 months. We need to examine the question of young people in agriculture and the matter of diversification. If we are to diversify Irish agriculture, the sugar industry must play its part. We can ill afford to lose any of our tiny 1.1% sugar quota.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">The Minister outlined the set of proposals coming from Brussels which include a quota reduction of 16%, a 37% cut in price and an inadequate level of compensation. If adopted, these measures would wipe out the sugar industry, which would result in the loss of up to 10,000 jobs. We cannot allow this to happen. Unusually in the context of EU agricultural negotiations we cannot count on the support of some of the countries that generally stand by us, especially France. That will cause political problems. It is important that the House unites on this issue and that we work with our sister parties across Europe to stress the importance of this industry to this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">The Minister outlined her views on the issue of quota transfer. I welcome the fact that she appears set to strongly oppose quota transfer. That is very important because there are regions and countries waiting to snap up the Irish quota if it should become available. Now might not be the time to reach a conclusion on the ownership of quota issue. I hope the position is as straightforward as that outlined by Senator Callanan. I urge the Minister to clarify the matter and bring it to a conclusion as soon as possible. I accept that the advice of the Attorney General has been sought. However, beet farmers would like to know the exact position concerning quota ownership as soon as possible. I urge the Minister to expedite this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">The motions before the House are similar. We all have a reasonable command of the English language. I am disappointed we have not been able to reach a joint approach. Although the House will divide politically on the motion and amendment, it is vital that the political establishment takes a single approach. We must show a united front to the Minister's colleagues in Brussels. Sugar beet is an indigenous industry, which has been part and parcel of Irish agriculture since the mid-1920s. We will not accept any set of proposals, which would bring that industry to an end. We are cognisant of the changes that have to take place in agriculture at European level, and to the sugar regime in particular at a world trading level. The Irish sugar industry must be maintained. The Minister must put the security of this industry at the top of her agenda for the medium term. I and my party wish her well. We are united behind what she is attempting to do for this industry at European level. Irish farming would not be the same without the sugar industry.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DrMartinMansergh" eId="spk_65">
          <from>Dr. Mansergh</from>
          <p eId="para_292">I thank the Fine Gael Party for tabling this motion which is well worth debating. I congratulate the Minister on a very lucid speech which sets out all the considerations. I also compliment our spokesperson on a very judicious speech.</p>
          <p eId="para_293">I am afraid the most I have had to do with sugar beet is helping with the harvest in eastern Austria near the Iron Curtain 40 years ago, which was quite hard work when it was only semi-mechanised.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">What is proposed will be a wrench for the workforce, the families and the town of Carlow, but we are referring to one of the first enterprises in independent Ireland and one of the first State enterprises. When I became involved as a political adviser to Fianna Fáil in 1981, one of the first political battles fought and won — at least for a time — was over the closure of the Tuam sugar factory. The economy was in a very different state in those days and real regional problems existed in the north west. The plant was closed in 1986. The price our colleague, Deputy Michael O'Kennedy, had to pay for being Minister for Agriculture was to accept and see through the closure of the sugar factory in Thurles, from which I accept, as Senator Coonan pointed out, it took the town a number of years to recover. I admire the town of Thurles. It is a reasonably thriving and go-ahead Tipperary town today but it took some time to reach that point, which I freely acknowledge.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelCoonan" eId="spk_66">
          <from>Mr. Coonan</from>
          <p eId="para_295">It is still recovering.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DrMartinMansergh" eId="spk_67">
          <from>Dr. Mansergh</from>
          <p eId="para_296">Carlow is a town which I greatly admire. It is a fine progressive town. I do not believe that the closure will hit it as hard in qualitative terms as Thurles, partly because the overall economic conditions are quite different. I am sure that fairly generous redundancy terms can be negotiated and that State agencies will try to assist in filling an economic gap, which will be easier than, was the case for Thurles in the late 1980s.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">In the choice between the two towns, many criteria applied. For example, the Mallow factory has the advantage of being a couple of miles outside the town and, if there is increased throughput, there will be fewer environmental problems if the plant is located a bit further away from the town. It is also connected to the railway line, although Carlow could also have been since the plant is beside the line.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">I go a certain distance in agreeing with Senator Ryan's assertion that one cannot play King Canute. We normally urge private companies to anticipate and move ahead of developments and be prepared rather than wait for the last possible moment before adjusting and making changes. Despite similarities between the Government and Fine Gael motions, the latter contains an element of telling what is now a private company what it must do, namely, that it must reverse this decision and take no other actions until negotiations are concluded. I accept that Greencore has perhaps in a commercial sense been a bit opportunistic in moving ahead with this decision now. However, half the time that is what we expect of private commercial companies. Given the state of the economy at present, I would hesitate to dictate to the company. Nevertheless, I would have no particular difficulty if the company could be persuaded in its own interests to defer the decision for a year or so.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">The Minister has made clear what the golden share relates to and what it does not, namely, that it does not give her the power to stop this development. From the farmers' point of view if a rail depot is established in the Carlow area, they would still be moving beet from one point to another. The rail depot at Wellington Bridge worked very well except for when the Cahir viaduct collapsed during the beet season, although it has since been put back in very fine working order. I travelled across it when it was re-opened and presumably nearly all the beet will travel by rail now, which may have positive environmental benefits.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">Under the ethos of the EU, Ireland has the right to be self-sufficient in sugar production. As I understand it, Ireland is usually somewhere between 99% and 101% self-sufficient, depending on the harvest. Alan Matthews of Trinity College has an article in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>, which suggests that we should give over sugar production to the real world. However, none of us can foresee the future. One of the purposes of the Common Agricultural Policy was to provide for food security. If we are able to provide security in this area, we are not under some moral obligation to give it up, particularly as the ACP countries do quite well under the sugar regime as against countries like Brazil. We need to be a bit cautious about using the Third World argument. We are not dumping sugar on world markets.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">Reference was made to France and Ireland blocking progress. On this issue, unusually, we are on opposite sides so I do not think the Minister will be awarded the Légion d'Honneur for her battle on this issue. Senator Callanan put his finger on the issue when he stated that what was required was to ensure the survival of the industry. There have been difficult negotiations. I have great faith in the Minister and our negotiating team to get a much better result than the original proposals. I fully agree that our position has not been undermined. On the contrary, one can strengthen one's negotiating position if it looks as if one is rationalising one's industry and getting it in order.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">Perhaps our colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, was slipping back into his role as a former president of the IFA. We have an absolute right to defend our sugar industry but we must put ourselves in the best possible position to do so. Therefore, I support the amendment to the motion.</p>

          <p eId="para_303">I welcome the Minister to the House to debate this very important motion. As we know, some 3,800 farmers in Ireland grow sugar beet, which represents an annual income of €80 million to Irish farmers and in the region of €140 million in total to the Irish economy. The production of beet is mostly confined to the southern counties of the south midlands and Munster, upon which many people directly depend.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">Earlier this month the Minister for Agriculture and Food pledged to fight against the proposed EU reforms of the sugar regime as a priority this year. She stated that she felt the proposals would be the "death knell for the industry". In light of such a statement, I am sure the Minister will support the appeal to her in this motion to strongly resist any EU proposal which would threaten the long-term viability of sugar beet production. The amendment does not differ too much from the Fine Gael motion and it appears the Government parties are saying the same as Fine Gael. I am thankful that the Government has nearly come on side with Fine Gael on this issue.</p>

          <from>Mr. Bannon</from>
          <p eId="para_306">Sugar beet has long been an important part of the tillage sector, contributing to the economic and social development of rural Ireland since 1926. For those lucky enough to hold contracts, beet is a critical component of profitability, being much more valuable than alternate tillage crops.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">However, we now face radical reforms of the EU sugar regime, the first since it was established in 1968. This will strengthen the EU's hand in the current round of world trade talks. However, these proposals must be fought tooth and nail at EU level, including the cutting of sugar support prices, reducing production quotas, decreasing export subsidies and the introduction of partial compensation. These proposals provide for reforms to commence in 2005, rather than 2006, as provided under current regulations. A cut of 25% in the price of beet in 2005-06 is provided for and a 37% cut, plus a European quota reduction of 2.8 million tonnes or 16% over four years, is provided for in 2007. Ministers from Spain, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Portugal and Ireland are opposed to the reforms. It is important that these countries work together to block these proposals. I am glad that the newer EU member states are on side with Ireland on this issue. It is imperative for the Government to ensure the EU designates sugar as a sensitive product, subject only to minimal tariff reduction, as has already happened for dairy and beef products from Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">Pre-empting the EU proposals and anticipating their negative effects on the industry, the decision by Greencore to close its Carlow plant from March 2005, with a loss of 300 jobs, is definitive proof of the threat posed by the EU proposals and their effects on sugar beet production. If the EU proposals go through in their current form, they could lead to the inevitable end of sugar production in Ireland. An impact assessment carried out by the European Commission into the proposed reforms points out that Ireland is one of the most vulnerable countries. A senior Commission official indicated to my colleague, Ms Mairéad McGuinness, MEP, that there could be no sugar industry in Ireland after the reforms.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">The implications of the reforms on the workers in countries such as Brazil must also be considered. The Brazilian sugar crop topped 26 million tonnes in 2004. Brazil, Thailand and Australia are the largest exporters in the world. Ireland is permitted to produce 199,000 tonnes of sugar. Consumption of sugar in Ireland for 2003 was approximately 158,000 tonnes and the actual figure for production in that period was 223,746 tonnes. The dark side of the industry in Brazil is that it is controlled by 100 growers who use what can only be described as slave labour from Mexico to harvest the crop. In doing so, they destroy rain forests to expand their crop bases. There are concerns in Brazil that the reforms would allow already environmentally unsustainable sugar production to expand even further to the detriment not only of the environment, but also of the many low-paid workers. In many European countries, the sugar industry has been decimated, giving companies like Greencore the perfect excuse to cut costs and restructure a business that has become extremely profitable for all concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">Union leaders, farmers and local politicians, including Senator Browne, claim that Greencore's pre-emptive move has weakened Ireland's hand in the EU reform negotiations. In the light of this shocking closure, Greencore must ensure its employees suffer no disadvantage on account of its decision to close the Carlow plant and move all its beet processing to its Mallow plant. Farmers who have been growing beet for the Carlow plant will now have their crops taken by rail to the Mallow plant. It is imperative that they should not be penalised by having to meet the extra cost involved in transporting their beet to the Mallow plant. Under EU regulations, Irish Sugar pays transport costs of up to a maximum of €7 million. However, this is not likely to cover the increased transport cost incurred, with 48% of Ireland's sugar beet being transported to Mallow by rail. This replaces the 12%, which was transported in this manner last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">Up to 189 full-time and 137 seasonal jobs will be axed at the Carlow plant, with 35 full-time and 16 part-time jobs going to the Mallow plant. Total employment will be cut from 614 jobs to 288, with 63 jobs remaining in Carlow in sales, marketing, packaging and other areas. Members on this side of the House ask the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, to open negotiations with Greencore to urge it to reconsider its decision and take no further action on this matter until the EU reforms on the sugar quota have been concluded. He must realise that the decision to close this plant after 79 years is a devastating blow for Carlow town, the workforce and the sugar beet industry. Local farmers gave loyalty for many years to the company. Such a decision is premature and detrimental to both Carlow and the economy as a whole. There is also the danger that the decision has made Greencore vulnerable to a take-over threat which, if it were to succeed, with the transfer of the Irish sugar quota, would see the ownership in the hands of foreign investors. Their focus would be on a quick return, not on the viability of Irish beet production. It is essential that the Minister of State clarifies ownership of the sugar quota and takes all necessary steps to retain it for Irish growers. The IFA is totally opposed to the transfer of national quotas between member states. The Minister must introduce legislation to legally vest the ownership of Ireland's sugar quota in the hands of the beet growers.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatMoylan" eId="spk_71">
          <from>Mr. Moylan</from>
          <p eId="para_312">I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, to the House, on this his first occasion to attend Private Members' business. I compliment him and the Minister for Agriculture and Food on their excellent work.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">Valid points have been made by speakers in support of the amendment. From meeting farmers involved in beet production, I have learned of their concerns about transport arrangements and costs. The Greencore decision to close its Carlow plant will disadvantage many farmers, many of whom are successful and efficient beet growers, in the midland counties of Offaly, Laois and Carlow. Their concerns are justified, particularly as the decision was taken quickly. Many farmers accept that if the decision had been delayed for another year, it would have given them the opportunity to decide whether to stay in beet production and make proper transport arrangements for their produce to the Mallow plant. I am concerned that the rail facilities for transporting beet are not up to speed. In an article in the farming section of the <i>Irish Independent</i>, the chairman of Carlow County Council claimed the proposed facility in Bagenalstown would not be in place in the next 12 months. In its absence, a situation would arise whereby a significant amount of extra beet would have to be transported by road. One would probably arrive at a situation in Mallow where there would be queues of lorries for miles and miles, causing road blocks and so on. People involved in the transport business calculate that they will travel from A to B, for which there is a particular charge. If they travel to Mallow and spend two or three hours at the side of a road waiting to unload the beet, who will pay for this? I have no doubt it will be the farmers. We must take this aspect into consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">I urge Greencore to consider postponing its decision for at least 12 months until the infrastructure is in place to ensure farmers will be in a position to deliver the beet to Mallow when the time comes. An investment in the region of €25 million will be required in Mallow to deal with the extra beet delivered there. Some €25 million will not be spent very quickly in the development of a factory. Someone said to me that Greencore might spend a large proportion of that money on remunerating some of the directors. Perhaps the less said about that, the better. I understand it is a commercial decision on the part of Greencore. Before making a decision, Greencore should take on board the views of the people who have been loyal to the company over a number of years. It is accepted by many beet growers that, given some time, they will put facilities in place to enable them to transport their beet to Mallow.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">Another point that should be made is that beet growers have done reasonably well over the years. This group of farmers were in a position to lease land and pay a reasonably good price for it. If they are taken out of the picture, many farmers in the midlands with reasonably good land will lose out financially because beet growers will not be in a position to lease the land for 11 months. This is something of which we should not lose sight because many of these people need that extra money. Many people who let their land over a number of years will not be in a position to benefit from any payments that may apply in this case. The Minister outlined that she made it clear during discussions on beet production in the Council of Ministers that the EU proposals are unacceptable. This will be another fight for the Minister who must ensure that farmers are allowed to make a reasonable living from the land, particularly from beet growing.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">A number of farmers indicated that people who were good at beet growing and who moved with the times made a reasonable living from it. Beet growers also had an opportunity to make extra money by allowing farmers involved in the sheep meat business to feed the beet tops to their sheep. This will be a loss to people who budgeted on taking X number of acres of beet tops.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">The loss of employment in Carlow, which is a fairly large town, will be severe. It is a huge loss to any town to lose a couple of hundred jobs, including a number of part-time jobs. If farmers change their production methods and fewer farmers produce beet, it will mean a loss in employment. Contractors involved in the harvesting of beet employed many people, whether part time or full time, in seasonal work. Commercial companies make difficult decisions and move on. Given what we read, the board members are better looked after than many. However, they should consider extending the deadline by at least one year. This would give farmers, particularly farmers in the midland region, an opportunity to make alternative transport arrangements to transport their beet to Mallow.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnPaulPhelan" eId="spk_72">
          <from>Mr. J. Phelan</from>
          <p eId="para_318">I support the Fine Gael motion. I took part in the protest march yesterday in Carlow town to mark the outrage that exists among ordinary Carlow people, including factory workers, producers and the wider community in the south-east region who will be adversely affected by the closure of the plant in Carlow town.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">Senator Moylan spoke about the traditional position of beet farmers and the fact that the beet industry has been one of the most profitable sectors of agriculture over the past number of years. It is fair to say that milk and beet producers are the two sectors of agriculture that have done reasonably well over the past number of years. However, the recent announcement means that the future is far from certain for milk producers. If people's worst fears become a reality, then there may not be a beet sector in the future. This is of great concern to someone like me who represents a part of the country where there are a number of producers, including Carlow and the immediate catchment area.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">It is fair to say that the sugar factory in Carlow has been the bedrock of industry in that part of the country. Carlow has performed well in recent years, as have many towns throughout the country. This success was based firmly on the industrial employment generated for hundreds of people in the plant and by the incomes secured for farming families who supplied the plant in Carlow town.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">I agree with Senator Browne regarding the proposed depot now being signalled by Greencore as a solution to the problem of transporting all the sugar beet from the Carlow catchment area to the plant in Mallow. It seems that as yet there is no planning permission for such a depot and the announcement of its establishment would see the plant close before the beginning of the next beet campaign. It is clear to all involved in politics, who know how the planning system works, that such a depot could not be operational by the time the next beet campaign starts. I share the wish of other speakers that Greencore would at least postpone its decision so the factory is not closed in 2005.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">Many of the beet producers have invested over the past few years in facilities for transporting beet. They have invested a lot of money in machinery and equipment to bring the product from the farm to the factory and these people will be at a severe disadvantage. If one is travelling to Mallow from where I live, it is a long way and the roads in that part of the country are not in good condition. As previous speakers have noted, it would be incredible if this particular cost were to be passed on to the producer. Previous speakers have also pointed out that the plant in Carlow continues to be very profitable, making profits of some €10 million last year. I do not see how the board in all good sense could make the decision it made two weeks ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">It was also remarkable that after we were informed of the decision to close the plant two weeks ago, each producer got a very detailed brochure from the company on the following day outlining the reasons the plant would be closed. They must think we came down in the last shower if they expect us to believe that a decision made the previous day resulted in these pamphlets being printed and posted to every grower in the country. Clearly the board decision was not made a number of weeks ago but some time earlier.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">I missed the comments made earlier by the Minister for Agriculture and Food and cannot comment on what she said in this House but I urge her to use her role and the State's role — the State still has a stake in Greencore — to ensure the future viability of the sugar beet sector. It would be remiss of the Minister not to use the opportunity which exists while the State retains a shareholding in Greencore.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">I and most beet producers worry that the Carlow plant closure will be followed by the Mallow plant closure. By means of strong reassurances from Greencore we were all led to believe that the closure of the factory in Tuam would consolidate the beet sector for the future, that there would be no need for future closures and redundancies and that we could continue into the future with some degree of certainty. It is clear that there is very little certainty in the beet sector. People trying to make their living from sugar beet production, many of whom live in my area, now find themselves in a very precarious position.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">There is an alternative use for sugar beet which some other speakers may have noted. It can be used as a biofuel. As I understand it, the terms of the legislation which governs that area, and grant aid for that area, explicitly exclude sugar beet from grant aid if it is developed as a biofuel. I urge that to protect the long-term future of this important sector of the agricultural economy, the Ministers for Finance and Agriculture and Food ensure that grant aid which applies to other products be extended to sugar beet so it can be used as a biofuel in this country in the future.</p>

This is my first time to address the House in the presence of the Minister of State. I wish him well in his role as Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food. He was an excellent choice and the post was well deserved as he has been a very hard-working and dedicated Deputy from the time he was elected.

          <p eId="para_328">I am not as familiar as the previous speaker with the Carlow factory and with Greencore. Senator Phelan said it would be Carlow now and Mallow next.

          <p eId="para_331">When the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, addressed the House earlier she also said that a rail system was being promoted for the transport of beet from Wexford to Mallow. This would be very effective as was the rail system in years gone by, in our fathers' time, when cattle were transported by rail. It was a very effective system and it was very unfortunate that in my neck of the woods and that of the Minister, the railway lines were closed. The railways were discontinued and lines were lifted. That was a terrible disservice to our part of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">Nevertheless, farmers will certainly get as good and perhaps a better price than before for their beet as a result of the amalgamation. The Minister has assured us that farmers will get the same price and that they will be at no disadvantage in Carlow or surrounding areas as a results of the closure of the Carlow plant. We have seen job losses in the Cavan-Monaghan constituency from time to time but the loss of jobs in County Carlow would be a more serious problem. I understand the factory was established in 1926 and the closure is very unfortunate for people who have worked there for, perhaps, all their lives, and for their families. I sympathise with them. Nevertheless, we must move forward. We saw what happened with creameries. First there was the amalgamation and closure of small co-ops which was followed by the bigger ones. Now we have six major co-ops in the country. There was much dissatisfaction among farmers at the time but there is not a word about the situation now.</p>

Senator Callanan warned against delay which might jeopardise the future of the industry and, in effect, said to get on with it and do it fast, that Carlow was over. Senator Moylan said it was being done too hastily and we must ask for a postponement. Then I heard all the usual promises that we have heard before. I come from a constituency in east Galway where the first factory was closed. The same promises were given then as now. The Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, said that Enterprise Ireland would be involved in job replacement activity. We were promised that in Tuam as well but the jobs never came. An engineering concern was located in the factory for a couple of months as a token response by the sugar company to the closure in Tuam. Nothing happened. Then it was said that we could have a rail link to Thurles or Carlow. Not only did the sugar factory close, but the railway line closed as well. I believe it clearly indicates——</p>

          <from>Mr. U. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_338">I remind Senator Moylan that at the time of these closures, his party politicised the situation to the ultimate degree. It actually recruited the Archbishop of Tuam and dragged him to Government Buildings when he was quite unable to come in order to emphasise how much of a crime the closure was for the west of Ireland. So it was because the jobs that were, and are, in the sugar factories cannot be replaced. I do not know whether the Minister realised that when she said she would ask her colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, to get replacement jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">The Government is destroying the fabric of so many families that have worked in Carlow loyally over the years, either part time or full time, and who have become dependent on it. It appears there is scant regard across the House for the investment of the farmers who have produced beet in those areas, which has been enormous. The numbers not currently involved in producing beet, servicing and supplying the Carlow area on a traditional basis, will deteriorate and decline rapidly. The number of farmers producing beet in the traditional Tuam catchment area may now be counted on one hand. I accept Tuam was in a peripheral area, outside the most beneficial regions for producing beet, but the cessation of beet growing on the periphery of the Carlow region will be a loss to that area as well and it will happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">On listening to the disarray from the Government side, it is no wonder that the CEO of the sugar company said on the six o'clock news this evening that it was a done deal, over and finished for Carlow. That is a serious situation. However, the Minister was not aware or at least did not declare her awareness of the fact that it was a done deal. The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, said he was going to fight on for the retention of the Carlow plant, but he was pandering to the crowd, the people he knew so well, and his colleagues in the IFA. There was not an ounce of sincerity in what he said on that particular occasion. We cannot realistically say there is a chance of survival in Carlow. That is the tragedy and the Government has no plan to overcome that situation. Fianna Fáil played the game in the past to the ultimate degree over Tuam. I am not too sure about Thurles.</p>

          <p eId="para_344">I listened to the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, say only yesterday that the decision taken by Greencore would undermine the position of the Minister. However, the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, said it would not undermine her position. The Government is in complete disarray on this issue. There is no question about it. I cannot understand how a company decides to close a plant that is making a profit of €10 million. Usually when there are redundancies of that nature, with 350 full-time and part-time jobs being lost, the company concerned has hit rock bottom and is losing money hand over fist. However, this is a company that has made a profit of €10 million from the Carlow plant.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">We have assurances from the Minister, for what they are worth, that the farmers will have guarantees on price which will not change and that they may even gain from this situation. However, what are the assurances for more than 300 workers employed in Carlow, families who have worked there for years? These are people who will not get another job because many of them are in their 50s and older. People say the south east is thriving. Outside its north-eastern area, the south east is the least serviced region in the country as far as grant aid, jobs and everything else is concerned. People are not aware of this, but it is a fact. What is on offer for the people of Carlow and the 300 workers and their families dependent on the sugar plant is years on the dole.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">This is as a result of the decision made by Greencore. The least it could have done was wait until the rail link was put in place before it carried out this act. However, it will not wait. The same assurances were given in Tuam where they talked about having the rail system in place but the rails were taken up. These is the type of assurance we are hearing tonight. The Government is in disarray and does not know where it is on this issue. The Progressive Democrats are saying one thing while Fianna Fáil is saying another. Fianna Fáil is saying one thing and its own people are saying something else here tonight. We do not know what is happening. What chance is there of the workers and the producers in Carlow getting out of a situation such as this if the Government is in such disarray?</p>

          <from>Mr. Coonan</from>
          <p eId="para_347">I am most disappointed with the response of the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, to the motion. Everything that is in her script I have already read, either in the local or the daily papers and certainly in the <i>Irish Farmers’ Journal</i>. She refused to answer the pressing questions as to whether she knew about or had discussions about the closure or was given reasons for it. Those are pressing issues which the growers and the workers at the Carlow sugar factory want addressed. We have not been told the answers yet this evening.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">I wish to address some of the matters raised by Senator Callanan and other speakers who argued that it was time to face the challenge. The farming sector is a section of the community that has faced continuous challenges, especially in the past five or six years. It has never been afraid to face challenges or take on fresh ideas and adapt to new situations. Senator Ryan's point that farmers have their eyes shut and are continuously in the dark, refusing to accept transition, is appalling. I look forward to the farming community dealing with that point. Farmers will not take long to open the Senator's eyes when they hear about that comment.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">Senator Mansergh spoke about Thurles but only told part of the story. When the former Deputy, Michael O'Kennedy, was canvassing prior to a general election, he gave a commitment to save the factory. Having been elected, he was made Minister for Agriculture but failed to appoint the working director from the area. Instead he put in someone from Belfast or some place where no one knew anything about the farming industry. On one vote, the sugar factory was closed. Had that not happened, I am sure it would still be here today. Senator Mansergh stated he was sure that there would be a generous redundancy for the families. That is a poor consolation to the workers. The same was said in Roscrea when Antigen Ireland closed down, yet three years later the workers in that factory have not received their full rights. Shame on Senator Mansergh for suggesting such a thing.</p>

          <p eId="para_351">This is a matter of national importance and it should be treated that way. I am disappointed that the Government parties did not agree with our motion. It is basically the same motion as theirs, but we are calling for the decision to be reversed until the EU proposals are sorted out. We should wait and see what comes from the negotiations. Speaker after speaker on the Government side agreed with that. In their heart, they are in favour of what we are proposing and I am going to afford them the opportunity to put into practice what they are saying. I want to thank everyone for contributing to the debate, which was excellent. We hope that the Minister will take on board the many issues that were raised. If the Minister is not willing to give an explanation to the House, he should at least give an explanation to the growers, the farmers, their representatives, the workers and their unions.</p>

          <from>Mr. Wilson</from>
          <p eId="para_395">This is the first opportunity I have had to congratulate Deputy Killeen on his appointment as Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. I wish him well in the years ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">What steps will be taken to secure replacement jobs in view of the closure of Ezy Koter Limited, Virginia, County Cavan? This is a pressing issue. Last week, the announcement of the pending closure of Ezy Koter Limited was a devastating blow to the east Cavan region. For over 20 years the company has brought huge benefit to the Virginia area. Ezy Koter Limited manufactures paint rollers and trays but the company has found itself unable to compete against cheaper imports manufactured in Asia. This Easter, 46 people will lose their jobs with the closure of the plant and this has been a major blow to Mullagh, Maghera, Munterconnaught, Virginia and the surrounding area.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">It appears that the company will offer a good redundancy package to those affected but replacement jobs must be an immediate priority. While IDA Ireland carries the main responsibility for ensuring that a replacement industry is found, I urge the Minister and his Department to redouble their efforts in job creation in this area of Cavan. I call on FÁS to visit the factory and conduct a skills audit of the workforce and, where necessary, provide training for those who require it to assist them in obtaining alternative employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">I am aware from the chief executive officer of Cavan County Enterprise Board, Mr. Vincent Reynolds, that a number of people are interested in purchasing this valuable asset of 30,000 sq. ft. of factory space. I urge the Minister to provide any assistance he can in this regard. My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Smith, has been in contact with the Minister and I, along with my colleague, local councillor Shane O'Reilly, support him in his endeavours to find a replacement industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">Deputy Brendan Smith also had discussions at the end of last week with senior officials in both Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland about the urgent need to provide new jobs in the Virginia area. The county manager, Mr. Jack Keyes, my colleagues on Cavan County Council and the county enterprise board will support the national development agencies in their task to create jobs locally.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TonyKilleen" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_92">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Killeen)</from>
          <p eId="para_400">I thank Senator Wilson for raising this important matter on the Adjournment and, like the Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Smith, for raising it previously with the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">I am conscious of the adverse effect on the workers and their families of the announcement of the closure of Ezy Koter Limited, Virginia, County Cavan. Ezy Koter, which manufactures paint rollers, announced on 20 January 2005 that it is to close its operations at Virginia with the loss of 45 jobs. It is expected to do so around Easter.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">According to the company, underlying market conditions have rendered the operation non-viable and, unfortunately, with cost-competitiveness now the key to the marketplace, many companies in lower-tech manufacturing are experiencing the same difficulties. Ezy Koter blames cheaper foreign imports for the closure as it has been operating in a marketplace that has become increasingly more competitive. It has decided to source roller products from the Far East.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">Finding alternative employment for the workers affected is a priority for the State development agencies. I assure the House that IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and FÁS will play their part in developing a way forward in conjunction with the Cavan County Development Board.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">FÁS, which met representatives of the company yesterday, will provide advice and training opportunities for the Ezy Koter workforce and has outlined the full range of its services to the company. The range of FÁS services on offer includes the following: top level agreement with the company on responsibilities and actions; intensive interviews, individually and/or in groups, with affected workers that will outline the range of supports and services available; preparation of a skills analysis report by FÁS based on identified workers' needs and local opportunities; referral by FÁS of affected workers to jobs, training courses or other options; establishment by FÁS of special or customised training courses where necessary; and ongoing support and action to keep redundant workers in touch with the labour market.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">IDA Ireland, with the co-operation of EzyKoter's parent company, will make a full assessment of the company's facilities to establish whether it can be marketed for other activities. IDA Ireland is also actively marketing the new privately owned 25,000 sq. ft. factory premises in Virginia. In addition to promoting Virginia, it is also actively marketing Cavan town for potential foreign inward investment. It has recently completed a €1 million upgrading of Cavan business park to raise its profile and increase its attractiveness for inward investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">IDA Ireland also received planning permission for two 25,000 sq. ft. advance technology buildings on Cavan business park at the end of 2002. While it would have been the intention to seek a developer to provide the first of these buildings during 2003, the final vacation by Teradyne of the existing building on the park means that it is currently available for marketing. This effectively requires that the plans for a new building be postponed. In addition, with the completion of the metropolitan area network in the early part of next year, the park should be able to provide considerable broadband solutions to potential customers. IDA Ireland is also cognisant of the range of smaller buildings provided through private developers in Cavan and through bodies associated with Cavan County Enterprise Board.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">I assure the House that the State development agencies, under the auspices of my Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, will continue to work closely together and with local interests in order to promote Virginia and County Cavan for further investment and job creation.</p>

        <heading>Mental Health Services.</heading>
        <speech by="#MaryHenry" eId="spk_93">
          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_408">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, of whose interest in the area of mental health I am aware.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">The Minister for Health and Children has made a resolution of the chaotic situation in accident and emergency departments a major objective of her term of office. However, this problem is caused by a lack of staff, beds and funding in other areas. Too frequently we focus on physical rather than mental problems. I applaud the Minister's action in respect of the Ballymun health centre. This centre was to be a pilot scheme in respect of primary care but it remained unopened for between two to two and a half years because of a turf war between the local authorities and the Department of Health and Children. I am delighted the Minister applied common sense to the situation and I have written to her to indicate my pleasure with the initiative she has shown.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">There are other areas outside of primary health care which are causing problems in the context of accident and emergency services. Bed shortages in acute hospitals are an important factor but we must also address the issue of people with mental illness and the way in which they are being seriously short-changed. Some of these individuals end up in accident and emergency departments which worsens a chaotic situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">I wish to refer to the example of the Jonathan Swift clinic of the department of psychiatry in Trinity College which is based at St. James's Hospital and which deals with a catchment area covering the south inner city. This is an area with many socio-economic problems. As the Minister of State is aware, poor mental health is frequently associated with socio-economic conditions. The catchment area to which I refer is discriminated against in respect of certain basic psychiatric services.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">Other parts of the country have far more facilities available to them, particularly those relating to rehabilitation, assertive outreach, community services, family therapy, long-stay accommodation, etc. Without these facilities, patients are at increased risk of relapse with, as the Minister of State is aware, attendant risks such as attempted suicide, which lead to further admissions to accident and emergency departments, increased use of alcohol and other drugs and a diminished quality of life. Patients with these problems who attend the accident and emergency department at St. James's Hospital are referred to the Jonathan Swift clinic. This means there is a chaotic cycle of inadequate support and funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">Funding for this community service runs at approximately 50% of the national level per patient. As everyone is aware, funding for mental health has decreased in the past ten years from 9% to less than 7%. In the United Kingdom, funding for mental health services amounts to between 12% to 14% of the health service budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">Mental illness is very common. Depression causes more days lost from work than any other illness. The cost to the Department of Social and Family Affairs of paying long-term benefit for those out of work due to mental illness is less than the funding provided for mental illness services by the Department of Health and Children, including the provision for the upkeep of buildings. Immigrants suffer high levels of mental ill health and many immigrants live in the south inner city. The service is severely stretched. Homeless people and those with psychiatric conditions who come to the accident and emergency department in St. James's Hospital consume much in the way of resources before general patients are dealt with. A total of 30% of acute psychiatric inpatient beds are blocked by long-stay patients in St. James's Hospital because there are neither staff nor financial resources in the community to enable them to be discharged.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">Mental health services in Cavan-Monaghan are rightly given much praise. There is one non-consultant hospital doctor in psychiatry per 11,500 of the population in this region. In the St. James's Hospital catchment area the figure is one per 22,167, representing nearly half as many doctors to patients. The figure for Tallaght, which also has problems, is one per 16,667. Those working in community psychiatry in St. James's Hospital leave because it is impossible for them to do their job. People are frequently urged to obtain psychiatric help in the early stages but what happens if it is not available?</p>
          <p eId="para_416">Funding for the clinic was reduced by 5% in 2003. There is a low level of nursing staff. For example, Kerry employs 250 nurses for a population of 125,000 while the Jonathan Swift clinic has 65 nurses for a population of 133,000. St. James's Hospital has the lowest provision of consultants and NCHDs for psychiatric patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">Is it fair to treat such vulnerable people so badly? Are they not as valued as those who live in more affluent areas? The situation does not just demand equity, it demands that the service be given greater than average resources. Will the Minister of State explain why this has not yet happened?</p>

          <p eId="para_418">I thank Senator Henry for giving me the opportunity to outline the position in respect of this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">Responsibility for the provision of mental health services at St. James's Hospital is a matter for the HSE eastern region and the HSE south-western area. According to figures supplied to my Department, the cost of the St. James's Hospital area 3 mental health service will be in excess of €9 million this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">In area 3, the public mental health service is provided in partnership with St. Patrick's Hospital and St. James's Hospital on behalf of the HSE south-western area. The Dublin south city service caters for a population of 130,000 across two sectors, Camac, which serves the south inner city, and Owendoher, which serves the outer sector as far as Rathfarnham. This catchment includes significant areas of social deprivation.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">Community mental health services are provided by St. Patrick's Hospital. Inpatient care is provided at the Jonathan Swift clinic at St. James's Hospital, which has 50 beds, including nine specialist beds for psychiatry of old age. This is in line with the bed ratio as recommended in the policy document, Planning for the Future. The Jonathan Swift clinic is a professorial unit and has well-developed academic links with Trinity College, Dublin. Many mental health services have had the benefit of a legacy budget associated with a large institutional base. This service, unfortunately, has not had this advantage and, as a result, all resources require additional allocation from the Exchequer.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">A new community mental health centre was opened at St. Martha's on the South Circular Road in October 2002 and this facility provides a sector headquarters and day hospital for the Camac sector. This service has a number of high, medium and low support hostels for patients with continuing care needs and has been working closely with Dublin City Council to develop and acquire additional accommodation for rehabilitation clients. It is intended to create a day hospital and sector headquarters for the Owendoher sector and a site has been identified by the South-Western Area Health Board for this purpose. The service has four consultant-led teams and works in close collaboration with the specialist service of psychiatry of old age and liaison service — two consultant-led teams employed directly by St. James's Hospital. A new consultant-led team has been allocated to this service to cater for the needs of clients in the Drimnagh area.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">I refer to capital funding. The Health Service Executive eastern region will invest proceeds from the sale of the lands at St. Loman's Hospital into the development of mental health services on the St. Loman's site and in other locations in the HSE south-western area. I assure the Deputy that the needs of mental health services in the south-western area have been communicated to the HSE in the annual service planning process and will be taken into consideration in the context of the future development of services in this area.</p>

          <from>Mr. U. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_424">I welcome the Minister of State. Will the Minister for Health and Children provide funding for the Health Service Executive western area for the provision of a health and day care centre on the site of the old County Galway Vocational Education Committee building at Gort, County Galway? Will she indicate whether funding was sought for this project by the former health board? The health centre in Gort comprises a small house, utilised by the health service over the years, which is located outside the town on the N18 to Ennis. A general practitioner, public health nurse, secretary and community welfare officer operate from these premises. It is an inadequate facility operating to Third World standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">When most local people hear the Minister talking about world class services, they want her to visit Gort to see how far the State is from providing proper health services in the town. A site was offered to the former health board by the vocational education committee when the school there was closed. It is ideally located and has ample space for expansion. The committee, as of last Monday, had the offer on hold waiting for the HSE to take it up. The Minister claims the priority is primary health care services but Gort represents an ideal opportunity to provide such services to the many people in the west who need them. People are wasting their time attending University College Hospital, Galway, because they will be put on a trolley.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">It is unforgivable that the premises at Gort are inaccessible for people with disabilities. If the Minister of State and his Department can stand over such conditions indefinitely, questions must be asked about how serious the Minister of State and his senior ministerial colleague are about reform of the health service. The building contains one toilet, which is locked at all times except on demand. If a health and safety inspection was carried out on the building, it would be closed and the people of Gort would have to go without its services but that cannot happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">A site for a day care centre has been offered. Currently, staff provide day care facilities in another premises in the town, which are inadequate and not of the required quality. However, the staff are determined to continue serving the people dependent on them. Promises were made in the past by various Ministers. For example, the Taoiseach visited Gort prior to the last general election. He said the provision of premises would not be a problem and it would be built in a short time because the Government intended to upgrade primary health care services throughout the State. However, nothing has happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">I contacted the Galway VEC last Monday to ascertain whether the offer stands regarding the premises. The VEC does not sell its premises and this site is available on a long-term lease to the HSE to provide adequate facilities in Gort. The Department has received a request for funding to upgrade the health services and to provide a day care centre at Gort. I hope this will be acted upon as a matter of urgency.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TimOMalleyPD" eId="spk_96">
          <from>Mr. T. O’Malley</from>
          <p eId="para_429">I thank the Senator for raising this matter. The Government has made services for older people a priority and is fully committed to the development of a comprehensive health service capable of responding quickly, fully and effectively to the health needs of older people. In recent years, health and social services for older people have improved, both in hospitals and in the community. Since coming into office, the Government has substantially increased funding, both capital and revenue, in respect of services for older people. For example, more than €295 million in additional revenue funding has been allocated to these services from 1997 to date. This serves to demonstrate the Government's ongoing commitment to improving services to our older population.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">Significant capital funding for the health sector has been provided since the commencement of the national development plan in 2000. Total expenditure for the years 2000-03 was approximately €1.7 billion. Considerable progress has been made in addressing the historical deficits in health infrastructure and improved the standards of facilities required for quality modern patient care. The NDP provides considerable capital funding to services for older people. This will enable a comprehensive infrastructure of community nursing units and day care facilities to be put in place on a national basis as well as the refurbishment of existing extended care facilities and the replacement of old workhouse-type accommodation. Older people deserve first class facilities and we intend to provide such facilities in appropriate locations.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">Responsibility for the provision of health services in County Galway rests with the Health Service Executive western area, in the first instance. The HSE western area has advised that agreement was reached, in principle, with the VEC regarding the use of its premises in Gort as a health facility for mental health and community care services. This project, which was initiated by community services due to constraints on their existing facilities, was subject to planning for change of use and also in regard to ownership of the site. With plans under way for the re-orientation of services in east Galway, it is intended that developments in the Gort area will be considered as part of this overall process. No formal application for funding has been submitted to the Department of Health and Children for the provision of a health and day care centre in Gort but the project was included in the Health Service Executive western area's submission for funding under the NDP.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">As the Senator will be aware, the Health Act 2004 provided for the Health Service Executive, HSE, which was established on 1 January 2005. Under the Act, the executive is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">As part of the HSE's responsibility to prepare and submit an annual service plan for approval, it is obliged to indicate any capital plans proposed by the executive. In this process, the executive can be expected to have regard to the full range of potential capital developments, its own criteria in determining priorities, available resources and any other relevant factors.</p>
