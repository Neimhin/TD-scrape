#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I move:That, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders:1.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I move amendment No. 1:To delete paragraph 2(ii) and substitute the following:"(ii) that Leaders' Questions pursuant to Standing Order 26A shall be deferred today and taken on Thursday, 30 September, at 10.30 a.m.".I have also tabled amendment No. 2 which states: "In paragraph 3, line 6, to delete "3 hours" and substitute "5 hours"". I have tabled these amendments because this is the first meeting of the Dáil since the summer and, as Taoiseach's questions will not be taken today, I would like them to be taken tomorrow morning. I understand the Taoiseach is to announce the Ministers of State as well as new members of the Government at 3.30 p.m. and appropriate time should be set aside for discussion on that. I recommend five hours for that discussion. It appears the only safe Member on the Government side is Deputy Walsh. Perhaps the emphasis should be on the line in the prayer, "happily ended".

I make no issue of the fact that there are no Leaders' Questions today or questions to the Taoiseach, given this day. However, it is entirely reasonable that we should have Leaders' Questions and Taoiseach's Questions in the normal way tomorrow.On the amendment for an extension, if I heard the Fine Gael leader correctly, of two hours of debate on the appointment of the Government that time is, if anything, too short.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	6	The Taoiseach has been discussing it since 11 June last while the media have been debating it for three or four months. This House is apparently supposed to dispose of it in three hours before the adjournment. That is entirely inadequate. My party will have two slots to contribute on whatever changes are proposed. Other colleagues who want to contribute are in the same position. It is entirely too short and, for that reason, I too support the amendment.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	7	The Green Party has no hesitation or difficulty in supporting these amendments. Our party will probably get 12 minutes to respond to the raft of changes that will be announced. Having had a summer recess during which the Government was uncannily quiet and behaving itself for reasons that have been speculated upon by those seeking to report and those seeking preferment, it is important that we should resume and get down to the business of holding the Government to account. The amendments seek to do so and the Green Party asks the Government to accommodate the need for Leaders' Questions and to provide more time so that smaller parties are not unfairly disadvantaged by not having enough time to comment fully in the debate on the proposed changes, which we expect the Taoiseach to provide.

I was not aware of the proposition from Deputy Kenny to amend the Government proposal on taking Leaders' Questions tomorrow and I am not sure that is necessarily the correct approach. That should have happened today. It is absolutely correct and it should be expected that the Taoiseach should come to the House today to face the questioning of the leaders of the Opposition parties. There is no good reason for deferral of the normal expected practice of the House on the resumption after such a long break.I strongly object to the Government's proposition. I will reluctantly agree to the proposal in Deputy Kenny's amendment and, in particular, the element that seeks to extend the time for participation in the debate soon to the addressed by the House. I emphasise that real and important issues need to be addressed and the Taoiseach should be here to address them, not least of which is the indication of a proposed statement by the Northern Secretary of State, Paul Murphy, that the British Government is considering unilateral action on an amendment to the Good Friday Agreement and its outworking in terms of the business of the Assembly. It is an internationally binding Agreement. I would like to hear the Taoiseach's response to that statement and that revelation this morning. It is a serious matter.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	9	We have waited for months to have the Taoiseach and the Government accountable to the people on critical issues that face us. Over the months in which the Dáil was not sitting, for example, 1,300 jobs in Aer Lingus were wiped out and the privatisation of our national airline was plotted behind the scenes with the Government in consonance with a management team engaged in a massive conflict of interest. They were appointed allegedly to guard the rights of the taxpayer but, in reality, they were plotting for their own massive enrichment by privatising this national asset.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	11	I cannot wait until next week for an opportunity to question the Taoiseach on many issues, one of the most critical being the future of our national airline and thousands of its workers. The Taoiseach should attend the Dáil, if not today, at the very latest tomorrow morning to answer such questions. It is incumbent upon the Government to provide answers for ordinary people through public representatives such as myself.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	26	I wish to announce, for the information of the House, that the President, acting on my advice, has accepted the resignations of Deputies McCreevy, Walsh and Michael Smith as members of the Government. I pay tribute to the contribution made to the work of the Government and the country by the former Ministers for Finance, Agriculture and Food and Defence, Deputies McCreevy, Walsh and Smith. In the case of the former Minister, Deputy McCreevy, he will also step down from Dáil Éireann upon taking up his new duties as European Commissioner for the Internal Market.Deputies Walsh, McCreevy and I first entered this House in 1977. Deputy McCreevy has spent ten years at the Cabinet table, most notably as Minister for Finance but he previously served as Minister for Tourism and Trade and Minister for Social Welfare. There is no one better qualified to fill the role of Irish member of the European Commission. His remarkable talents and record of achievement are reflected in the important and prestigious portfolio which the President designate of the European Commission has decided to assign to him. I am sure the House will join me in wishing him well in his new and onerous responsibilities, while congratulating and thanking Commissioner David Byrne on his very successful term, during which he has contributed so positively to the welfare of the people of Europe.While the past couple of years have been difficult economically, the determined and decisive action taken by this Government in 2002 ensured that Ireland has come through the international economic downturn as well as any other country and better than most. The policies that Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats have implemented since 1997 have supported the creation of 420,000 extra jobs and won strategic new international investments for Ireland. During that period the Government managed the economy prudently and successfully and we will continue to do so. We have established a position of strength from which we can now confidently go forward to grow the economy over the next three years and beyond.Apart from his role in managing the economy, Deputy McCreevy instituted a number of key reforms, including the restructuring of the income tax code, the establishment of the national pension reserve fund, the commitment to record rates of investment in infrastructure, underpinned by a new multi-annual capital envelope framework, and a package of reforming measures for the public service covering both legislation and pensions.I have known of Deputy Walsh's decision to retire from the Cabinet since last Christmas. His tenure as a Minister in one Department, the Department of Agriculture and Food, is unique in modern Irish politics. Having first served nearly five years in that Department as a Minister of State from 1987 to 1992, he has gone on to sit at the Cabinet table as Minister for Agriculture and Food for ten years in total.Deputy Walsh has made an immense contribution to agriculture and rural Ireland. His skilled negotiation of the most radical reform of the Common Agricultural Policy since its inception led to the decision on the full decoupling of direct farm payments from production. Ireland was the first EU member state to have made that momentous and courageous decision that will encourage the sustainable development of the sector, while guaranteeing a high level of income stability. However, it will be for his management of the foot and mouth crisis that Deputy Walsh will be most widely remembered. His calm and effective handling of a disease crisis which had the potential to cause major damage to the whole economy rightly earned him the plaudits of Deputies on all sides of this House.Deputy Michael Smith was first elected to the Dáil in 1969. He previously held the energy, environment, education, and science and technology portfolios, but since October 1997 has served as Minister for Defence. For the past seven years, he has successfully revamped our Defence Forces with a policy of continuous recruitment and a programme of investment in new equipment and infrastructure. In 2000 he put in place the first ever White Paper on Defence, which sets out a blueprint for the development of the Defence Forces over the period to 2010.I also pay tribute to Deputy Michael Smith's excellent work in reducing the overall level of costs to the State arising from the Army deafness issue. Thanks to a robust strategy, the total cost is expected to be approximately €300 million, far short of the €1 billion originally feared.I move: "That Dáil Éireann approves the nomination by the Taoiseach of Ministers of State Hanafin, O'Dea and Roche for appointmentby the President to be members of the Government."In addition, I wish to advise the House that I intend to make the following proposed reassignments. I propose to assign responsibility for the Department of Health and Children to the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, the Department of Finance to Deputy Cowen, the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to Deputy Noel Dempsey, the Department of Foreign Affairs to Deputy Dermot Ahern, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to Deputy Martin, the Department of Social and Family Affairs to Deputy Brennan, the Department of Transport to Deputy Cullen, the Department of Agriculture and Food to Deputy Coughlan, the Department of Education and Science to Deputy Hanafin, the Department of Defence to Deputy O'Dea——

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	28	I am glad that even the Opposition agrees.Furthermore, I propose to assign responsibility for the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to Deputy Roche.Subject to the motion that I have put to the House being approved, Deputies Hanafin, O'Dea and Roche will cease to be Ministers of State on their appointment as members of the Government.I propose to nominate to the Government Deputies Seán Power, Batt O'Keeffe, Killeen, Brendan Smith and Conor Lenihan to be Ministers of State. I will propose to the Government the Departments to which they will be nominated and some other changes in the allocation of responsibilities to existing Ministers of State, including the appointment of Deputy Kitt as Chief Whip. It will also include the assignment of a Minister of State to the Department of Agriculture and Food in succession to Deputy Aylward, who ceased to be a Minister of State upon election to the European Parliament in June.I would also like to inform the House that I have accepted the resignation of Deputy McDaid as Minister of State. I thank him for the contribution he has made to the Department of Transport over the past two years.In the period ahead the key objectives of Government policy will continue to be those set out in our programme for Government. These are to manage the economy and the public finances; to maximise sustainable growth and employment; to maintain and deepen our competitiveness, especially by addressing infrastructure deficits; to maintain and enhance social cohesion; and to continue the development of our caring services, building on the major investment over recent years.The Government is firmly focused on the achievement of these objectives. That requires energetic and professional leadership, the kind that results from the right combination of experience and innovation. That has been my aim in shaping my team for the next phase of this Government's term. In bringing in new members to the Cabinet and nominating new Ministers of State, I am renewing the ministerial team with energetic and ambitious colleagues, who are also experienced and professional politicians. By reassigning departmental responsibilities, I am taking the opportunity to bring a fresh perspective and renewed commitment to achieving our objectives across much of the machinery of Government.Public office is demanding. The people whom we are privileged to serve expect and deserve much from those they elect to high office. This requires hard work, but also the capacity to deal effectively with problems and to deliver results that make a difference. My colleagues know that their nomination by me is based on my expectation that they will meet that test. The Tánaiste and I are satisfied that our two parties in government can and will deliver on what we have promised to achieve.Achieving our economic goals will require a continuation of sound fiscal policies. Confidence and stability are vital ingredients in our strong performance. We will continue to pursue tax policies that promote enterprise, support jobs, ease the burden of taxation on those on modest and especially low incomes and underpin the productive capacity of our economy. We know, and the people know, that the tax policies that maximise revenue for spending on important public and social services are those we have been pursuing since 1997, and they are the policies that we will continue to pursue.On the spending side, we will use the additional resources available to secure real increases in all of those services that make for a decent quality of life, especially for those most in need of our support. Capital spending will continue to grow in line with the growth of the economy. Our commitment to a modern infrastructure is reflected in the multi-annual framework which has brought confidence and better value through better project management to our rapidly developing public infrastructure. We will take a number of key strategic decisions over the coming months about the next generation of projects, especially in the area of public transport. We will build not only to meet the needs of citizens today, but we will lay the foundations for economic and social success for the decades ahead.With regard to current spending, our well-established record of continuing, real increases in social services will be maintained. We will secure better value through reform and restructuring, wherever that is necessary. The economic challenges for the period ahead will be to consolidate our development over recent years, to maintain our attraction for overseas investment, to improve the performance of new and developing Irish enterprises, to increase skill levels right across the economy and to identify and exploit opportunities presented by EU enlargement and the advent of new industrial powers, especially China. We are well placed to do this, not least through the policies implemented by the Tánaiste over the past seven years. Recent major announcements of inward investment projects in leading global sectors are proof of our success.I will say a little about some of the priorities within the framework of the programme for Government, which we will pursue over the period ahead, building on the very real and substantial achievements of this administration to date.We have worked to address Ireland's lack of infrastructure in a coherent and determined way. Capital investment envelopes totalling €33.6 billion in spending commitments for the period 2004-08 were introduced in the last budget. These include a commitment to keep the level of Exchequer-funded capital investment at 5% of GNP over the period. This allows for an even flow of investment projects, facilitating better value for money and allowing us to plan to meet our development objectives. We make no apology for leading the largest ever public sector investment programme in transport in Irish history. Investment in our national roads is at an all time high, equivalent to €100 million every month. More than €8 billion is committed to national roads between now and 2008.Under the national development plan we are investing almost €3 billion in public transport. New carriages are in service on the DART and suburban rail, while new commuter services have been introduced between Mallow and Cork, and between Ennis and Limerick. Bus Átha Cliath and Bus Éireann were given substantial numbers of new buses last year. As Deputies will be aware, the second Luas line from Tallaght to Connolly Station joined the very successful Luas from Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green and further proposals are being prepared for extensions. It will play an integral part in keeping transport in the city of Dublin moving in a fast, efficient and clean fashion far into the future.To put the scale of housing activity during our time in government in perspective, almost one third of the country's homes will have been built in the period 1997-2004. Increasing supply was our goal and this year, we will build more than 80,000 homes, which is three times the average rate per head of population in the EU and five times the rate in the UK. On social and affordable housing, our range of initiatives, supported by €1.8 billion in funding, is meeting the needs of some 13,000 households every year. Through the social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, 59 projects on State and local authority lands are planned, a demonstration of the Government's commitment to ambitious and early delivery in this area.A key priority for this Government is the health service. In the national health strategy, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats set out the blueprint for the most fundamental restructuring ever of our health system and we intend to complete it. In the past year the Minister, Deputy Martin, announced significant initiatives regarding a new health services executive, which will include a national hospital office, a primary and continuing care directorate and a shared services centre.Taken together, these structural reforms represent the biggest single national reorganisation of the health system since 1970. They will build on the foundation of the 162% spending increase, shorter waiting lists and increased staffing and treatment levels achieved in recent years. It is our policy to continue to match investment with reform, so more and more patients will benefit through this Government's progressive development of a world-class health system. We will push forward the physical-renewal and development of services in all parts of the country, including an ambitious programme of bringing new acute specialities to the regions. Services for the elderly and people with disabilities will continue to be prioritised.Our record on old age pensions and on child benefit is one of which we are very proud. From the outset, we said those who are most vulnerable in our society are the young and the elderly. It is at the beginning and at the end of our lives that we need help the most. In Government, we have delivered record increases in the old age pension. In 1997 it was €99, today it is €167 and we will focus on increasing the pension again and again, so that we reach our target of €200. In the same period, we have more than trebled the rate of child benefit to €131.60 per month for the first and second child and to €165.30 per month for the third child and subsequent children.Education will remain a priority for this Government. A high quality education system with equality of opportunity is vital to a modern republic as it offers all our citizens the chance to participate fully in the social and economic life of our country. That is why since 1997 we have increased overall investment in education by 124% to €6.5 billion this year. We are determined to reach the highest international standards on class sizes and the foundations are now there to achieve our goal. Since I became Taoiseach, there are 4,000 additional teachers at primary level and an additional 2,337 teachers at post-primary level. To ensure further progress, we also increased primary teacher training places by almost 300%.As a Government, we promised to cut crime by getting tough on criminals. We have done just that. Serious crime dropped 18% last year and has already dropped a further 19% in the first half of this year compared to the first six months of 2003. This is not a cause for complacency; we need more gardaí and more prison places in an effort to further target street violence and drugs. Our policy is clear; more gardaí to protect the innocent and more prison places to punish the guilty. We have built more than 1,200 new prison places with more on the way to make sure the revolving door for violent criminals remains firmly closed. We have put more gardaí on to the streets than ever before.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	31	I now turn to our work on the peace process. When this Government was formed, I said peace in Northern Ireland was the issue to which I would give priority above all others. Irish people everywhere take tremendous pride in the role we played in negotiating the Good Friday Agreement, which provides the political framework for building peace based on a just settlement.Working closely with our British counterparts, we have sought to bring about the conditions for full implementation of the Agreement. After the recent talks at Leeds Castle, both Governments believe that what is on offer now is reasonable in its substance and historic in its meaning. In the period ahead, we will do everything in our power to ensure we maintain the momentum in the process in order to allow for the return of devolved government as soon as possible.This Government has the proven capacity to meet the key opportunities and challenges facing this country. Our people understand that we must first ensure our economic success in order to ensure that we succeed in implementing our social objectives.In addition to record investment in roads, rail and housing, the Government has also dramatically increased its spending on social services, especially in health and education.In the period ahead, the Government will build on this record to address a number of critical social needs. We will work with the social partners to continue the balanced and consensus-based approach to managing change and protecting jobs, living standards and the quality of life of our communities. We intend to continue to provide incomes so that the elderly and others can live life with dignity. Through additional targeted spending and improved management, we will continue the development of the health services, especially the provision for accident and emergency and long-stay patients. We will also address the needs of those with disabilities, both through a new legal and service framework and through agreed targeted investments.I am proud to lead a Government with the talents and record of achievement of those whom I have named for my team for the balance of the Government's term. I commend them to the House.

The Taoiseach has laboured for three months to produce this political mouse. I congratulate the new office holders. This is a big day for them. It is a great privilege to serve one's country as a Cabinet Minister. It is also a big day for the families of the new office holders and I know that they are proud of them and of the honour the Taoiseach has bestowed upon them. I remind each of the new office holders that with honour and privilege comes responsibility. That onus must inform every aspect of the work they do for and on behalf of their country and ours, and our people.I commiserate with those who have been dropped from the Cabinet or redeployed or forced to leave. It is never easy when this happens, especially when one's redeployment may be down to nothing more than naked political expediency or the sudden desperate requirement for lambs. Sacrifice is part of national politics. Our desire to serve makes sacrifice something we do to ourselves in terms of our families and personal lives. However, when it is done to us, when we are the sacrificed, it becomes something else entirely, as the former Minister, Commissioner McCreevy, has plenty of time to contemplate from the splendid remove of the Berlaymont building in Brussels.My comments on the so-called new Cabinet are directed generally because they apply generally. Old and new are all guilty and all to blame because they are all the same. For the sake of democracy and the sanity of the electorate, I wish to nail the lie that this is a new Government. If the answer to the so-called new Government is to be the face of Corporal O'Dea, then it must have been some hell of a question.

They stood over how they deceived the public, bought their votes, dismantled their society and broke their trust. They stood over the obscene and bull-headed wastage of €50 million on electronic voting while at the same time a man in Tallaght told the newspapers that given the state of the accident and emergency department, he would rather not have a pulse the next time he is there.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	38	They sanctioned the funding of pet political projects while the savage 16 cuts were waged relentlessly against the country's poorest and weakest by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. Two years ago, all of them went to the country with a raft of promises they knew they could never keep: 2,000 extra gardaí, 200,000 extra medical cards and an end to waiting lists in two years. Those were the promises, the contract and the commitments made by the Government which have all been dishonoured. Two years later, the Taoiseach is back with a new improved version — new blue Daz washes whiter than white. He is trying to pull the same old confidence trick again.Let us be clear on collective responsibility and collective guilt. The new Ministers are every bit as guilty as the old. If the electorate wants to know who is to blame for the successive waves of stealth taxes, the higher charges and poorer delivery in almost every public sector and service, the increase in personal taxes because of the failure to widen allowances and credits in line with inflation, the way Ireland is tumbling down the international competitiveness league which threatens our jobs, our future and our children's future, the answer is sitting on the benches opposite — the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government, old and new.It is clear that Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats knew well before the summer elections that they had got it wrong. However, getting it wrong was not the problem, rather it was being found out. That meant being punished and hence the new leaf, the new look and the new veneer. The reason was naked political fear, a Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats phobia of losing power. Despite the pomp and circumstance which the House has just witnessed, any change is just cosmetic, a cheap veneer. The Taoiseach is reshuffling his deck in the hope he can play a better hand at the next election. In the case of this Government, one thing is clear — it is probably the only thing that is clear about this Government and of which we can be sure — in its pursuit of power, the more things change, the more they remain the same. It is plus ça change, a case of new faces and old motivation. It is a case of making politics work for their parties and not for the people.Today the Taoiseach and his new Ministers are busy selling the idea that "The past is a foreign country: they do things differently there." The writer, F. Scott Fitzgerald, stated that the test of a first-class mind is the ability to hold two opposing ideas simultaneously and not be paralysed by them. That statement should be given some thought today. On the one hand the Taoiseach is shouting "All change" to a new Government that listens and learns and shows its caring face, while on the other the Tánaiste is threatening to walk if any change is made to An Agreed Programme for Government or if it is not implemented. The Taoiseach says it is all change and the Tánaiste says it is the old way or no way. What are the Government's values? What does it believe? How is it to govern? Which one of them is telling the truth? Who or what are we to believe? The answer is neither of them and nothing. The people have learned one salutary lesson, that the Taoiseach will attempt to do whatever it takes to have his Government, in whatever incarnation, returned for a third term in office. For that reason, the people cannot be expected to believe daylight from the Taoiseach.In congratulating the Tánaiste on her appointment as Minister for Health and Children, I am not sure what the future of the Hanly report and the reform programmes will be. The former Minister, Deputy Michael Smith, referred to a sacrifice on the altar of Hanly. It may be that disappointment could prove to be the Tánaiste's exit strategy from Government, although I believe the Department of Health and Children and the health services are crying out for and willing to adopt a measure of common-sense reform.The good news is that we will not need to believe daylight from this Government because the people already know that a better alternative is emerging comprising democratic parties on this side of the House which are committed to making the tough decisions and doing what they say they will do.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	39	The Government's deceit and arrogance caused it to underestimate and insult the electorate, but it did not learn its lesson. It is doing the same with this reshuffle and rearrangement. The Taoiseach persists in the belief that the people share his low standards, but they do not.The election results showed what I have believed for a long time now, that Ireland knows at a deeper level that it can no longer afford a Government that reduces its people to economic units, assigning them to their proper place in columns of profit and loss. I believe in a different kind of Government, one that respects the full humanity of all our people, that recognises, regardless of that damaging piece of PD cant that inequality is good for you, that we are all in this together, an interdependent people living interdependent lives. Politicians may lead, Taoiseach, some actually do, but it is the people who rule. They showed their power in the recent elections and I am convinced that when it comes to choosing the next Government they will be waiting again in the long grass and will do so again. When they vote in that election, now 100 weeks hence or less, they will not choose between candidates, parties or leaders but will choose the kind of Ireland they want to live in — an Ireland run for the short-term good of the parties under Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, or an Ireland run for the long-term good of the people led by Fine Gael and like-minded parties.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	42	The Minister should be careful. I would never try to fax employees from the Department out of Tullamore the day before leaving office. The Deputy has got a big job.Instead of the charade we are witnessing today, we will give the people a real change by providing an honest Government, a Government that believes in the possibilities of a shared life, a society and collective opportunity, one that believes not what the Government can do for them, or they for the Government, but in what we can achieve when we work together toward a common end, the Government and the citizen, side by side.If anyone was to say to me, "look, this is way too ambitious, it can't be done", I would say to that person "for society's sake, for our children's sake we cannot do any less." Everyone knows the battleground of the next election will be the vital areas of economic and fiscal policy, health, education and other sections of Irish life and it will also be about something more. Specifically, how in this country today we need a Government of trust, one the people can trust and one that will keep its contract with the people, a new kind of Government, that is brave and forward-thinking enough to take account of the massive change we have undergone as a country and as a people in the past 20 years.That is a huge challenge and opportunity and it demands huge courage — courage to say to people that Government on its own cannot and should not do everything. The Government on its own cannot give us safer streets and communities or greater knowledge and better learning. This happens only when the person, the community and the State work together, support each other, are committed to each other, understand, respect and depend on each other and when we, as citizens, assert our rights and live up to our responsibilities.That kind of Government is not easy. It will challenge people, but it is possible when the people can have faith in their Government and trust it to keep its word. The people cannot expect the Government to do everything, but they can expect it to do what it said it would do. In this, the Taoiseach and the old and new Government are all collectively responsible and collectively guilty.This country needs a Government that is capable, efficient and honest, one that lives up to its promises and keeps its word, but that in itself is no longer enough. What we need now is a Government that has the courage and confidence to be innovative, intuitive, insightful and compassionate because then and only then will people see their Government as a true reflection of themselves.That is the kind of Government I believe in. It is true to say our economy has done very well and is strong, but we must make our economy work smarter for us so that it will work for all our people in all the crucial areas of their lives. The smart economy will be the means to an end, not the end in itself.I am optimistic for this country. Good as they are, I believe things should be better. The Taoiseach is of the view, and he has repeated it on many occasions, that he single-handedly dragged us up off our knees and rescued us——

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	52	The people deserve a Government that will lead and give Ireland a better chance to enjoy its wealth by putting it to greater and better use, specifically, tackling the recession in health, education and law and order that is hurting our people and damaging our communities. That Government will have the capacity and the courage to tackle the inevitable problems of our new-found and most welcome affluence — obesity, lack of fitness, our new generation of latch-key kids, the range of psychological disorders, from being plain fed up to being severely depressed, even hopeless, the hours of commuting and the lack of a sense of community or belonging to one. We can tackle all of this and more when we line up our rights with our responsibilities, when we each fulfil our duty to each other.On 6 June 2002, the Taoiseach told this House that his Cabinet of that day — the old one — was "a team with an unparalleled range of experience and wealth of abilities." On 11 June last, the people gave their verdict on that unparalleled range of experience and wealth of abilities, as delivered by the Ministers since June 2002. I look at those on the backbenches — a backbench of all the talents — Deputies Power and Devins, even Deputy Carty from my own constituency and Deputy Martin Brady, who all have reason to be aggrieved today. They did not get the call. They had new suits hanging in their closets, waiting for the call to office, but the call never came.

It will be no different from the last one; it has the same philosophy but different faces in some places. I say good luck to them because I tell the Taoiseach that on his side of the House, they will need it. The Taoiseach can and no doubt will try to plan for his election survival, but on this side of the House we will plan for something better, the country's future. To us, winning the next election is not the end in itself, it is just the beginning — the beginning of real change, real opportunity, real government.

I hope he has success in restoring devolution and in restoring the institutions in Northern Ireland.I also offer my sincere congratulations to the new Ministers. I wish them well in the interests of the country. Deputy Roche's happiness with his lot is so infectious that I feel overwhelmed for him too. After all the months of talk about a reshuffle, radical departures and a new direction, it is amazing that 13 of the 16 faces who met around the Cabinet table last week will meet in the Áras tonight.Looking across from where I am sitting, I see no change. I cannot see where the new direction will come from. I suppose the Ministers of State were announced to take the bare look off the lack of change. I congratulate Deputy Seán Power, the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, on his elevation to Cabinet and Deputy Batt O'Keeffe. My heartiest congratulations to Deputy Brendan Smith. I always felt Deputy Killeen deserved promotion but was victimised because of a stand he took on Shannon. I am pleased to see him there because, given the way things are going outside the gate in regard to Aer Lingus, we will need him again. I offer him my congratulations. I save my best wishes for my constituency colleague.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	64	The question which Deputy Conor Lenihan's elevation raises is what is good for Tallaght could be bad for the nation. I wonder what will happen to the nation and where will the shares be put. I am pleased for Deputy Lenihan. I have some regrets, in the interests of a capable Cabinet discharging the responsibilities of Government, that the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, is not in the Government. It is a very minimalist old wine, and rancid old wine, in the Cabinet. I find it remarkable that the Taoiseach is arguing for a new direction and new policies when the people he has promoted, including the Ministers of State, Deputies Roche, O'Dea and Hanafin, were the most loquacious advocates of the old policies. How does that mark out a change of direction? No one defended the citadel in the way these three Deputies did. I see no change of policy there, nor do I see any explanation for shuffling virtually every Minister in the Cabinet.The Taoiseach said that whoever would be elected to the new Cabinet would not be in a comfort zone and they would not be time servers. It scarcely appears to be a vote of confidence that virtually all Government members have been transferred from what they were doing. This has been done in a circumstance where we have been, since 11 June, in a state of paralysis. Ministers could not do anything — not that they did a great deal before 11 June — because they did not know whether they would be there. Now what does he do? He transfers virtually all of them to different Departments. This means that between now and Christmas nothing will be done either. The only one left in his previous position is the Minister, Deputy McDowell, who has never been impeded by Cabinet boundaries and who has spoken for everyone when it suited him, and he is still Minister for equality. This is the man who said that a good dollop of inequality is necessary for economic progress, and he is the Minister for equality.When I look at the old, tired, failed faces, the only thing for which I am grateful is that Deputy Woods was not brought back. Other than that it is more or less "as you were". I have concerns about the elevation of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea. For a start, it will leave a hell of a hole in the Sunday Independent. I suppose one can see an invitation to my colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, to fill that with more quality than was the situation before now. We can be thankful that the Minister of State, Deputy O’Dea, was not appointed Minister for Transport. That would make a dramatic shift in the policy on taxis, judging from the fact that he is so well on the record in terms of opposing what he called “a PD measure on taxis”.The existing Minister for Transport has been well and truly shafted. The man who wanted to put Luas on stilts and raise the height of the Dublin Port tunnel has now been given the task of dealing with social welfare. Given his disposition — it is a perfectly legitimate one of being more PD than the PDs themselves — and the policies pursued, surprisingly, by the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, which were so harsh on people dependent on social welfare, I have great concern that a Taoiseach who expects there will be a change of direction à la Fr. Seán Healy and Inchydoney has chosen the Minister, Deputy Brennan, to implement social welfare policy. If we were to take any comfort from that in terms of the situation at Dublin Airport, preparing Aer Rianta for privatisation and setting up the national airline for sale, I do not think, when one looks at the man who is taking over from the Minister, who is a real PD as distinct from a pretend PD, the workers outside the gate can take any comfort from that.

I am absolutely delighted you were not moved, Sir, and that I can rely on your protection as usual.The Minister, Deputy Cullen, has a lot of bottle to heckle on this point. This is a man who, according to the Comptroller and Auditor General, wasted €52 of taxpayers' money. This is the man who boasts about the private sector. If he was in the private sector, he would not be put in charge of a sweet shop if he lost €52 million on introducing an IT programme or something like that.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	70	Now he is Minister for Transport. I do not know how many Fianna Fáil backbenchers spoke to the Aer Lingus workers outside the gate. They are genuinely and understandably alarmed at the future direction of the national airline. We appear to be hurtling down the road towards the creation of a second Ryanair. We had one Ryanair, which has done a tremendous job for consumers, and why we need to convert the national airline into a second Ryanair is beyond me. In terms of the interests of this country as an island, the economic interests of the country and the statements made by some of the leading companies in the country, why do we want to jettison the cargo out at Dublin Airport? I hope when I see the Minister, Deputy Cullen, shaking his head it means this will not happen and that he agrees with me, because it would be a tragedy for this country.Everyone on that side of the House boasted about the tremendous success of the privatisation of Telecom Éireann. Has it brought more tariffs or more competition? Has it been in the interests of rolling out broadband faster? It was a debacle. Whatever about the argument in the communications area, the argument for leaving us bereft of a national airline, with no say in it by this House or the Minister responsible, is wrong and I hope the Minister, Deputy Cullen, will not go down that road.I offer the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, my sincere congratulations. It is brave to take on the Department of Health and Children, given seven and a half years of failed reform. Frankly I do not know how to read it. I think all the Fianna Fáil backbenchers will join with this side of the House and say: "It is the PDs, sure we would have a great health service only the PDs are in charge." They will row in behind this side of the House in raising the kind of issue that is on the front page of the Medical Times today. The article states that 150 Tallaght beds are held up over funding. This would deal with the accident and emergency crisis in at least one hospital and with some of the waiting list problems on which we have had so many commitments I cannot count them. According to the article the hospital is being paralysed. It is not long ago that the Tánaiste represented the constituency which I am proud to represent and I hope she will turn her mind to that as a first step.What is happening is alarming. I am trying to match all this with the Fr. Seán Healy conversion at Inchydoney. I cannot understand a Taoiseach who says "We want to convey a new caring, sharing image, we want to put our past behind us, we are striking out in a new direction." As the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, said, there was always a social democratic dimension to Fíanna Fáil. However, a Progressive Democrats member has been appointed Minister for Health and Children and a Deputy who might have been a member of the Progressive Democrats has been appointed Minister for Social and Family Affairs. It is difficult to understand how this constitutes a new direction for the Government. The only reason the poor unfortunate Fr. Seán Healy was brought to Inchydoney was for image purposes, to convey the image that the Government parties learned their lesson at the local and European elections and that there would be a change of direction. A new, more compassionate Fíanna Fáil was always lurking under the hard exterior best promoted by the man now reading the Racing Post in the Berlaymont.The former Minister, Deputy McCreevy, was to get all the blame, he was responsible for everything that went wrong. The appointment of Deputy McCreevy to the European Commission was the only tough decision the Taoiseach confronted. He has exiled the friend of business to the Berlaymont. That is the only tough decision he made. The rest are all the same. What is the point in changing Cabinet posts? If the Minister, Deputy Martin, has the same success with jobs in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment as he had with medical cards when he was Minister for Health and Children, there will be an unemployment crisis. He promised 200,000 additional medical cards and what happened? There are now 100,000 fewer medical cards in the system. People constantly come up against the threshold. A similar performance with regard to the accident and emergency services will cause a serious difficulty.I do not see what hope there is for people who would like to believe that this is about more than image making? There is a significant category of people, including those with disabilities, those who are unemployed or cannot work, those who are caught in the low pay trap, those whose children drop out of school early, those who are caught in large urban unemployment blackspots or isolated in rural poverty, who take today's events seriously. They would like to think it is about more than image change and that different policies which affect the quality of their lives will emerge under the aegis of different Ministers. From what we have heard today, it seems unlikely that will happen. These are people who over a decade of unprecedented economic growth have found the quality of their lives worsened, or certainly not relatively improved.Three or four reports in the past couple of days bear out the figures to which I am referring. The ESRI report on relative income poverty shows the position has deteriorated in Ireland from 1997 to 2003, that relative income poverty has increased from 19% in 1997 to 21% in 2003.

The Minister, Deputy McDowell, wants to intervene on this issue. If one reads today's article by the Europe editor of The Economist intelligence unit, the writer of which is not possessed of any left wing disposition, he challenges the entire conventional wisdom about the departing Minister, Deputy McCreevy. He says, among other things: “As a proportion of national income, the tax burden did fall between 1997 and 2003, but only slightly, from 35.4% of GNP to 34.2%.” He deals in some detail with that economic record. That is the size of the fall. The optimum beneficiaries were the highest earners and the person on average industrial earnings is now being taxed at the same rate as the highest income earners in the land.

The Tánaiste agrees with me even if her immovable and unshakeable Minister does not. Those are the figures from the Minister, Deputy McCreevy. A person on the average industrial wage is liable for the same tax rate as the highest earners in the land.There is a category in this society other than the category about which I have spoken, of those who are poor and disadvantaged. That category comprises people who made wealth beyond their wildest imagination in the past seven and a half years. These are people who have aggregated property beyond their wildest dreams, have enjoyed a halving of capital gains tax and so on. They will also be watching today's events with great interest. They will want to know whether there was any reality behind Fr. Seán Healy's visit to Inchydoney and whether the Taoiseach has traded his Minister for Finance for a meddlesome priest. They will come to the conclusion that it was all cosmetics and there is no cause for concern. They are happy to put up with presentational changes because that is all that is involved. Nothing more fundamental has changed.In the interests of the country, I wish the new Cabinet well and extend my congratulations again to the new Ministers. I would like to think they will be in office long enough to avail of full ministerial pensions at senior level but I am afraid that will not be the case. I look forward to seeing the Minister, Deputy O'Dea, stepping through his first parade of the Defence Forces in due course.

I shall speak for six and a half minutes, a further six and a half minutes will be shared between Deputy Joe Higgins and Deputy McHugh and the final six and a half minutes will be assigned to Deputy Sargent.What we have been presented with today is barely a change of faces. We are looking at the mere shuffling of a deck of cards. This is still the same Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government as has been here for the past seven years since 1997. There is no substantive change. That said, I wish all the appointees, without exception, well in their new responsibilities, particularly Deputy Dermot Ahern in his new role as Minister for Foreign Affairs at this critical time in the peace process. I wish him well in taking over the reins of that office. I also extend my congratulations to my constituency colleague, Deputy Brendan Smith, and wish him well in his new role as a Minister of State. Mo chomhghairdeas dóibh.The Taoiseach said the other day that new people would give the vibrancy and activity base we need. I agree we definitely need new people. Based on the Taoiseach's own advice, we need a new Government, new Ministers and, perhaps, a new Taoiseach. Above all, we need a new direction on the part of Government driven by a vision of equality. Therefore, I take this opportunity to urge the Taoiseach to facilitate and accommodate the most important change of all, namely, to take the decision to hold a general election that will allow the people to make the determination, choice and judgment as to who will best occupy these roles and positions. He will be delighted to know that we in Sinn Féin are ready for it any time. Why wait until 2007?

When it comes to challenging and dealing with the Taoiseach and the constituencies in this jurisdiction, the Taoiseach is looking at it.This has been the longest drawn-out reshuffle of Cabinet in history. It was a useful tool and provided the Taoiseach the opportunity over the long period of the summer to divert attention from the failed policies of his Administration and to have the media focus instead on the endless speculation about who would be in or out. The reality of the divided society created in this State since 1997 is plain to see. Yesterday's Combat Poverty Agency report showed that one fifth of our population now lives in poverty and that the gap between the wealthy and less well-off in society has widened over the past seven years of the Taoiseach's Administration.This reshuffle is about a change of image. I do not believe it is about a change of substance, but hope I can be proved wrong and that the Government will deliver on some of its broken promises. I remind the Taoiseach that after the European and local elections in June he said: "We lost this election, there is no doubt about that. Sinn Féin won it." If the Government delivers, as I hope it will, on some of its broken promises because it fears the rise of Sinn Féin, that is well and good and all the more reason the electorate should continue to support Sinn Féin in ever-growing numbers.On the other hand, this reshuffle has undoubtedly increased the Progressive Democrats' power in Cabinet. That party did not run a single candidate in the European elections and failed miserably in the recent local government elections, with its city and council numbers dropping from 25 to 19. However, in the words of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who retains a clear hold on his portfolio, this is the party that believes inequality is a good thing for society. The Tánaiste and Progressive Democrats leader has taken over the health portfolio and will be in charge of what I can only describe as one of the most inequitable health systems in Europe. I predict the purpose and intent of that is that we will yet come to recognise and realise that the names Hanly and Harney were inevitably going to become synonymous. That is a vista that must create real concern throughout the length and breadth of this jurisdiction.The Progressive Democrats, without doubt, imposes its ideology on Fianna Fáil. The latter party's backbenchers who paraded to the plinth in the aftermath of the June elections to complain of the Progressive Democrats influence are complicit in that. They cannot pretend innocence of surrender to the Progressive Democrats of whatever social conscience Fianna Fáil had. It had a conscience and many good people in the organisation wish it was in evidence now.This reshuffle will do nothing to reassure or assuage the fears of many ordinary Fianna Fáil supporters who, in contrast to many cynical backbenchers in this House, are disillusioned by why and how this Government has become so identified with the perpetuation of and increase in inequality, despite a decade of unprecedented prosperity. Many genuinely believed that their party represented fair play and protection for the vulnerable. Many in my family did and I grew from that root. It is time for people who support Fianna Fáil to ask themselves a simple questions. Where is the spiritual home of Fianna Fáil today? Is it in Bodenstown or Punchestown?I remind the new Minister for Health and Children that her party's 2002 general election manifesto stated:Our policy on medical card eligibility is based on medical need and income. We will ensure income eligibility criteria at least keep pace with movements in incomes.The Minister comes into office with that Progressive Democrats promise already broken. Almost 100,000 fewer people have medical cards now than in 1997 and the income guidelines have been allowed to drag behind inflation. Families, especially children, are suffering as a result, and I have spoken in the House on this issue on many occasions. While I wish the Minister well in her new portfolio, I must point out that she will be judged carefully on all these matters in the future.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	91	I do not congratulate the Taoiseach, nor any member of the Government appointed today. No matter what face we put on this Cabinet, we still have a Government that is right wing in the extreme and which will continue to push reactionary neo-liberal policies across the board. We will get a Government that continues the policies of the past, the handing over of crucial public assets to private greed in the form of privatisation, placing an increasing number of burdens on working people while giving mass tax breaks to big business, thus allowing profiteers and speculators to continue to put a home out of the reach of ordinary working people. It will continue to bend a suppliant knee to the United States and British imperial powers and continue the unmitigated disaster this has given us in Iraq.On one issue alone, any Government responsible for and standing over what is being done to our national airline, Aer Lingus, deserves a summary dismissal. It beggars belief that a management appointed to Aer Lingus to protect the interests of the taxpayer and the thousands of Aer Lingus workers who have made the national airline a dependable and vital service should be allowed to sit in its office and plot the destruction of 1,300 jobs and announce its wish to make this public asset its personal private property through privatisation.The management team entrusted to look after the interests of the taxpayer sat down with financial speculators to discuss how section after section of the national airline could be outsourced and asset stripped so that they could take command and enrich themselves obscenely in the process.The conflict of interest in Aer Lingus is so breathtaking that in any jurisdiction where even the slightest modicum of bourgeois ethics prevail, such a management team would long ago have been summarily dismissed. Far from doing so, the Government is conniving in this piracy and it is incredible that the media, which regard themselves as watchdogs, do not even raise an eyelid.Working people cannot look to the Government with any comfort. Even the hospital trolleys must be rattling at the prospect of the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, becoming Minister for Health and Children, let alone the old or the sick who will be dependent on further investment in that area. Communities, workers and trade unionists must mobilise their own power and strength to counterpoise these reactionary policies. They certainly cannot depend on this Government.
#PaddyMcHughIND	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-party	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-dob	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	92	I congratulate Deputies Hanafin, Roche and O'Dea on their appointment to the Cabinet and I also congratulate the new junior Ministers. I wish them the best in the coming years.My wish is that the new Cabinet will take on board the results of the local elections, accept the message and act accordingly for the good of the country. As a west of Ireland Deputy, the good of the country matters and not the good of the east at the expense of the west, which has been the case over the past two years and under previous Governments. The review of the national development plan highlights an underspend in the BMW region. The challenge for the new Cabinet is to ensure there is equity in the way in which Government decisions are made so that people in the west are not treated as second class citizens consigned to an existence where they must battle on a daily basis with an outmoded, outdated infrastructure, elements of which would be an embarrassment to Third World countries.Sewage is flowing along our streets, a number of national secondary roads will not facilitate the passage of two trucks and our railways, which in the past were vibrant, are disused, overgrown and deserted while our children, the future of the country, are piled into decrepit classrooms. That is the reality of life in the west. Six months into the life of the Government, the national spatial strategy, a vital blueprint for the future balanced development of the State, was published but the Government has done absolutely nothing to underpin it, except launch it and talk about it. Subsequent action on decentralisation illustrates the Government is not engaged in strategic thinking because there is no cohesion or synergy between the national spatial strategy and the decentralisation programme.The people of the west were content to follow a particular political philosophy for years, irrespective of delivery to the region, but the results of recent elections indicate they are no longer prepared to accept lip service. They have demonstrated they want equal treatment and their fair share and they are no longer happy to exist on the crumbs that fall from the Cabinet table. They are fed up of unfulfilled promises. Tuam hospital in my constituency is an example. The Taoiseach, when in opposition and on his appointment to office, promised to provide the hospital, as did the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, but they reneged on their promises. I call on the new Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, to deliver on these premises.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	93	I congratulate the new Ministers and commiserate with those who did not get preferment. However, the changes leave me quite cold. The message from the local and European elections was clear and there was an opportunity to make changes not only in personnel but also in regard to the Departments. For example, there is not a Department of consumer affairs and a number of Departments are in need of reform as well as a change in personnel.Instead, a Politburo-type approach has been adopted whereby seniority is the determining factor in appointments. Nobody elected for the first time in 2002 has been promoted. The Taoiseach is going through the motions by creaming off those who have been in office for a while for retirement and bringing on another batch of Deputies in a mechanical and uninspiring manner. This is a missed opportunity and it is sad. The spin on the nominations is that they represent a fundamental change, which is incredible, and I hope that will not be taken at face value because a closer examination indicates there has not been a change. It does not give hope to those who were crying out for change.Many of my constituents work for Aer Lingus and they will not be comforted nor will they find cause for hope in the appointment of Deputy Cullen as Minister for Transport. The people of Clare and surrounding counties will not take much comfort in the context of Ennis General Hospital from the appointment of the Tánaiste to the Department of Health and Children. Many people in the agricultural sector who are attending the ploughing championships in County Carlow will also not take much comfort from the appointment of Deputy Coughlan as Minister for Agriculture and Food. However, the Government faces a challenge and these changes will not quell the unrest.Many people are unhappy and, prior to the summer recess, it was clear that issues needed to be addressed radically. I warned that the cost of fuel would increase over the summer. The price of oil is approximately $50 a barrel. However, there are people who are prepared to address this issue by producing biofuels but they are being thwarted at every hand's turn. I ask the Government to examine a number of Green Party policies that provide solutions. However, there is a lack of joined up thinking at Government level to address what needs to be done.Lack of access to broadband technology was brought to my attention when I attended the ploughing championships as was the lack of progress on renewable energy. The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources attempted to be revolutionary in his speeches on these issues but action did not follow. The only action taken by the Government over the summer was to throw out proposals on a carbon tax like throwing a rattle out of a pram. That was a panic measure rather than an action measure.Many bush fires broke out around the Government while it was in the bunker over the summer and a great deal more than what we have witnessed this afternoon will be required to address various issues. Deputy McDowell has retained his post as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and both he and the Taoiseach have been content to tell us that Garda strength has never been higher, yet they know because it has been pointed out to them repeatedly that there are fewer gardaí where I live than there were in 1988, even though it is one of the fastest growing areas in the State. The Taoiseach is determined to repeat the mantra that things have never been better. However, the reality on the ground is different. Unless he is out of touch entirely, it will be impossible for him to continue to say that. Garda numbers will be a test for the Government, with many other issues.With Deputy O'Dea now scheduled to take over the Department of Defence, I urge the Government to take serious action to address the concerns of people around the country before the Minister is tempted to get the Army to operate as a quasi Garda Síochána. While people are demanding solutions, I do not want to see that being one of them.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	94	I pay tribute to those Ministers who are leaving the Government today. I welcome the fact that Deputy McCreevy will be the new Irish Commissioner in the next European Commission. As the Taoiseach said, he will have responsibility for the EU Internal Market. It is a huge area of responsibility in a Union where services account for at least 50% of GDP and up to 70% of jobs. It will be a major challenge for him to ensure the barriers to services in the European Union are removed as quickly as possible, just as we removed many trade barriers in 1992. We still do not have a perfect market but the Union has gained enormously from those reforms. I thank the outgoing Minister, Deputy McCreevy, for his service in Government, particularly over the last seven years when I worked closely with him. It is generally acknowledged by fair and independent commentators that he has been an outstanding Minister for Finance.I also pay tribute to the outgoing Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh. He was elected to the House in 1977, the same year I was appointed to the Seanad. In those early years I had the privilege of sharing an office with Deputy Walsh and have known him well ever since. Over the past seven years in government we have worked well and closely together both on a personal and political basis.I also wish to pay tribute to another outgoing Minister, Deputy Michael Smith, who has been a Member of the House since 1969. His has an incredible record of service in many Departments. As Minister for Defence, he has worked with me in Government since autumn 1997.The outgoing Ministers now face a turn in their careers. It is an honour and a privilege to be elected to this House. We understand that most the first time we cross the plinth, while afterwards we perhaps take it for granted. Over the years, thousands of citizens have sought election to this House but have not been successful. Therefore, none of us should take lightly the privilege bestowed on us by our fellow citizens in this Republic.It is an even greater privilege to serve in Government. It has certainly been a great privilege for me to serve with the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, over the last seven years. Notwithstanding the fact that we lead two different parties — in the case of Fianna Fáil a very large party and in my own case a smaller party — and that a coalition environment can present tensions, challenges and difficulties, we have been able to work well in the spirit of partnership to resolve those difficulties and keep them to a minimum, recognising that obviously we have different priorities and perspectives from time to time.I also wish Deputy John Bruton the best of luck. He will be leaving the House shortly to become the new European Union ambassador to the United States. It is a great honour for him personally, as well as for Ireland. He is taking over as EU ambassador in the US at a critical time in the relationship between the United States and the European Union. That transatlantic relationship is so important for peace, security and stability, as well as for economic success in the global environment.If I had been listening to the Opposition contributions to this debate as a visitor to the House, I would wonder if I was in the Ireland of the 1980s when we had mass emigration and unemployment. A sign of the success we have achieved is the comment made by Deputy Sargent that yesterday at the ploughing championships farmers asked him about broadband. We should think about what that represents. It indicates the kind of progress this country has made——

In the last two years over 70,000 extra people have joined the workforce. There is no doubt that we have transformed the economic fortunes of this country, although not single-handedly because there are many who went before to lay the foundations. Nobody can take away from the track record of this Government when it comes to the economy. In recent years, people have come from all over the world to visit Ireland to find out how we created the economic success that this small country has experienced.

We are working at full capacity. Our country today is host to at least 120,000 foreigners who have the privilege of working in the economy. I am delighted this small country can provide those opportunities to people who need employment, just as many other countries provided such opportunities to us in the past when our economic fortunes were not what they are now.Given what happened last weekend concerning two foreign workers, I want to extend my sympathy to them and to their families. This is an open, pluralist society. Those who come as guests to our country in search of employment are entitled to the respect and dignity that every citizen is entitled to by virtue of being a human being. Human rights are universal. Those who did the damage to the two individuals, one from Lithuania and the other from Latvia, did not do it in the name of this country, which is a confident, open and pluralist society.Deputy Rabbitte wondered why I was going to the Department of Health and Children. I do not take my politics from any ideology; I am not an ideologue. My views come from my own personal experience. My background is no different from Deputy Rabbitte's. I come from the same kind of background. He and I were fortunate to benefit from a good education, something my parents did not have. I value and appreciate that fact. The one thing I want for the country I love is to have a health service that is accessible to every citizen, regardless of their wealth.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	102	There are many in this society who have private health insurance or are wealthy and they will always get the medical attention they need. However, there are too many others in our society who do not have that opportunity. Working in Government as part of a team, I want to play my part in dealing with what the Taoiseach described as the Government's number one priority. We have the analysis and the blueprint — a huge effort went into preparing that. The challenge now is to implement the reform. In reply to Deputy Kenny, I wish to confirm that it will be common sense reform, not driven by any ideology. It will be driven with only one motive in mind: the patients' interests. Anybody who thinks there will be any other agenda, whether they are newspaper commentators or Members of this House, should wait and see.A successful economy and economic reform is not incompatible with public service reform. They are not pulling in opposite directions, but must be integrated in one vision of a vibrant and sustainable economy. We cannot have one without the other. If we do not generate the resources, no matter what plans, ambitions or targets we have, we will not be able to achieve success. Government is about choice and priorities. Even in the days when we are doing well economically one always has to have choices and priorities. Clearly, for this Government the priority will be reform in health care, education and infrastructure, particularly in the area of transport. A big investment programme will be driving that reform as far as resources are concerned. Above all, we must ensure that with additional financial resources, we have the reform programme, otherwise the money will not deliver the kind of change we all want to see.For all of us there is a challenge associated with change. We can all become complacent doing the same thing all the time. Very often it is easier to keep at what one has always been doing, but there is a challenge in change of any kind. We all know that from personal experience.It is also difficult for our citizens when they are asked to play their part in delivering change. I believe genuinely that most fair-minded people recognise how much we have achieved. Most of them are very proud of what we have done, none more than those who had to leave Ireland in the 1950s and 1960s. When one meets them overseas or back here, one finds they are very proud of what this country has achieved in recent years. Equally, none of us can be happy notwithstanding our economic success with a society that is not delivering the quality of life our citizens expect.The Constitution delivers to the Taoiseach and 14 other members of the Government the responsibility of running this country. It is a responsibility from which we cannot run or delegate to others, nor will we. Notwithstanding the criticisms, this new, reorganised and reinvigorated Government is determined during the two and a half years before the next election to deliver on the strong commitments we have made in the programme for Government. In the first instance, we have committed to maintain our economic success. I had the opportunity to read the speeches made in this House when the Government was re-elected in 2002. While I do not want to embarrass anybody by quoting them, Members spoke about the economy going under and the Taoiseach was asked if we would have a soft landing. Who is asking that question now? This country was steered through the most difficult global economic crisis in recent times so successfully that even many Members of this House were astounded. We sometimes take economic success for granted as if it came down from the sky. That success was delivered only as a result of difficult measures adopted by the Government. It is certain that if we had not maintained our economic success, we would not have 70,000 more people at work and we would not be talking about increased resources in health care, education and, in particular, for people with disabilities, 2,000 extra gardaí and the many other matters to which the Taoiseach referred in his speech.

I pay tribute to Deputy Roche. This country steered a very successful European Presidency that was skilfully handled by the Taoiseach and involved the negotiation of a successful outcome to the constitution by him, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and Deputy Roche. Today's promotion is an acknowledgement of the important role played by Deputy Roche on behalf of the country. In many places I have visited, he has been mentioned as having done an excellent job.

We have a healthy economy and we want to have a healthy people but without resources and reform, we will not achieve very much.Equally, the priority must be on restoring institutions in Northern Ireland as the Taoiseach said. Our task is not only to manage the economy and reform public services, it is to deal with the peace process, which everybody wishes to see succeed. Significant efforts will continue to be assigned to the Government's main priority as the Cabinet works as a team of people who care. We are a compassionate, caring and sensible Government. The challenge for the new members of the Government working with the outgoing members, of whom only two are remaining in the same jobs, is to apply a new vigour, energy and determination to the task at hand. When we do that, we will see a public response. Above all else, the public expects of its Government that we deliver in terms of results and on behalf of the country. The public is prepared to support us when we do that.Deputy Hogan asked me two years ago if I could control insurance costs. Not only have they been controlled, they have been substantially reduced. New statistics will provide even more positive news than we have had in recent times. That goal was achieved on a cross-Government basis with a number of Ministers working together. Real joined-up Government resulted in the implementation of a number of targeted reforms. We did not bring everybody with us which meant an absence of consensus. While the legal profession in particular was not happy, we had to move ahead. The citizens see the results. Equally, there are other areas of Government in which we will identify a few targeted initiatives to ensure the success of which we are capable in the delivery of public services.

If one takes the consistent poverty measure, there has been a reduction of two thirds over the past seven years. Relative poverty is not a fair measure. If one person on an island earns €10 million and another €150,000, the latter is poor relative to the former, but neither is poor. We all know that consistent not relative poverty is the correct measure to use.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	129	I pay tribute to and congratulate the new Ministers, Deputies Hanafin, Roche and O'Dea on a great day for them personally and for their families. It is nice to see new faces in the Cabinet. A great deal has been said about a massive reshuffle. Over the summer months, the Taoiseach indicated that there would be a radical reshuffle. The move from the Minister of State ranks to Cabinet for the three people involved is richly deserved. They have served their apprenticeships and done a fine job in their previous roles. I wish them and their families well in the work that lies ahead.I pay tribute to former Ministers, Deputies McCreevy, Walsh and Michael Smith. Crocodile tears are being shed for Deputy McCreevy who took the rap from the Taoiseach for the debacle of the European and local elections. According to spin after spin in the aftermath of 11 June, Deputy McCreevy was the one person who caused the performance of the Government parties in the elections. When one hears the economic statistics trotted out by the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach, one wonders what was so wrong with Deputy McCreevy that he had to be got rid of. While that question has not been answered, the word of the Taoiseach is not the best in these matters. I understand that when Deputy McCreevy asked the Taoiseach if he would hold on to his Department if he did not take the European Commission job, the Taoiseach is supposed to have answered in the affirmative. That Deputy McCreevy took the European Commission job does not say much for the Taoiseach's word in these matters. I acknowledge that the Taoiseach must do a difficult job.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	134	Even though the Taoiseach has been telling people Deputy McCreevy craved the job, the people of Kildare have not yet got the message that his version of the story is correct. However, I wish Deputy McCreevy well in his new position.The Taoiseach did not need to hear from 25 or 30 backbenchers about what he needed to do in that regard: he should not have used backbenchers to facilitate his getting rid of a man who did a very good job for the economy. While I may not have agreed with him at all times, I agreed with the general trend of what he was trying to achieve for the country, in particular our enterprise economy.We were promised a radical reshuffle but what we got was a minimal reshuffle. Ministers have been shuffled rather than reshuffled with the addition of a few new faces to replace former Ministers, Deputies Smith, Walsh and McCreevy. Deputy Walsh served as Minister for Agriculture and Food for a long time and did a good job. He should have been shuffled a long time ago rather than reshuffled now. Had he been shuffled to another Department some time ago it would have helped his career. Deputy Michael Smith served with distinction for many years as Minister for Defence and I wish him and his family well in the future.The ministerial appointments announced illustrate that the former Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, is unique. I am sure he survived efforts to have him removed from the Cabinet for trying to reform public transport services. I know he encountered many difficulties with some of the trade unions and semi-State companies on more than one occasion during the past two years. Perhaps the Taoiseach went behind his back on a number of occasions in an effort to tidy up matters with the trade unions. Nevertheless the principle of opening up air and bus transport services to competition is the way forward. Competition is always good for the consumer. The vote of no confidence in Deputy Brennan — albeit he remains a member of the Cabinet — is notable in the context of the decisions made today.I congratulate the Tanáiste in her new role as Minister for Health and Children and thank her, as Opposition spokesperson on enterprise, trade and employment, for the kindness and courtesy she extended to me in the work we have undertaken together since my taking up this position two years ago. I wish her well in that Ministry. Luck is something she will need given the legacy left to her by her predecessor.The Tanáiste triggered this reshuffle last Christmas by indicating she wished to move having spent seven years at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The gestation period to today's announcement has been long and not good for the country. People, particularly Ministers, are often paralysed by thoughts relating to where they might end up in a reshuffle. The Taoiseach is responsible for the long period of procrastination.Luck will also be in demand if the Tanáiste's record at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is anything to go by. She inherited a growing economy, a growing labour force and a business sector with growing confidence. While she can look back on a solid performance on the economic and enterprise fronts, unfortunately, she leaves the Department under the shadow of rip-off Ireland with a sorry lack of competition in a range of areas from the professions to the insurance sector. She has presided over a drastic reduction in our competitiveness in recent years.The Tanáiste may be an ideal candidate for the job as Minister for Health and Children. I hope she will not follow in the footsteps of her predecessor who commissioned report after report and sought consultation after consultation resulting in empathy, sympathy and no action. The consumer council has metamorphosed into the consumer strategy group much to the delight of rip-off merchants around the country given the lack of action which followed. We are always one step away from making a decision that will mean something to consumers and from dealing with matters in a similar fashion to that of the Ombudsman which sets out how and where the consumer can be assisted and seek redress. I hope the new Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, will take action in the interest of consumers, something the former Minister did not do.I acknowledge the Tanáiste's remarks about the Motor Insurance Advisory Board's recommendations, 80% of which have been implemented. While motor insurance prices have stabilised, we have yet to see benefits in the area of employer's and public liability insurance. I was delighted to provide cross-party support for the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board to deal with small claims and provide opportunities to reduce the cost of processing claims. I acknowledge that the board has yet to undertake the type of work which will provide us with the opportunity to establish whether there is a measurable reduction in insurance costs. However, I welcome the fact that we are heading in the right direction in that regard.The Tanáiste has allowed the Government to become the godfather of rip-off Ireland. Responsibile for the entire CPI figure in recent years, the Government has implemented 30 stealth taxes since its election. While we might have reduced personal income taxes, we have paid for it by loading indirect stealth taxes on to the business sector and consumers. The forthcoming budget provides the new Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen — whom I congratulate and wish well — with an opportunity to do something to ensure we will not continue along the slippery slope into a worse position than that of 30th in the World Economic Forum's competitiveness rankings.Taxpayers have contributed vast amounts of money for the provision of increased resources for the health service. It would be nice to think that all of this money was invested wisely and productively on behalf of the taxpayer and the users of the services to which the Tanáiste referred. If money could solve the problem, it would have been solved a long time ago. Sadly, this is not the case and responsibility for many of the ongoing problems in the health service can be laid fairly and squarely at the door of outgoing Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin. Just as we have highlighted the need to end the rip-off culture in the commercial world, we must also deal with the ineffectiveness and poor value for money achieved in respect of some of the expenditure in the health service.The former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, has been making good news announcements to beat the band in the last two weeks. There has been a rehash of statements issued 18 months ago on breast cancer facilities, although such facilities in the southern and western regions have not yet opened. There has been the announcement of the provision of another €85 million for the opening of a string of new health faciilties worth up to €400 million that have been lying idle for a number of years. Sadly, his desperate attempt to give himself glowing references for his new job not only highlights two scandalous issues in the health service — access to cancer services depending on where one lives and the number of expensive health facilities lying vacant while thousands suffer on waiting lists — but reveals the consistent pattern of the Cabinet's work style: promise it, announce it, provide some of it, announce it again and again raising false hopes and giving the impression one is making progress but rarely delivering the goods.I remind the Tanáiste of the scale of the task awaiting her in trying to sort out the mess in the heatlh service she has now inherited. The national health strategy and primary care strategy published in 2001 before the last general election remain to be implemented. The three health reform reports, the Prospectus, Hanly and Brennan reports, all published in 2003 remain to be implemented with the only reform so far being an even more bureaucratic and less accountable structure worsened by the added threat of the closure of accident and emergency departments. The radiotherapy report completed in 2003 also remains to be published.Worst of all, the Tanáiste inherits a string of broken promises and has responsibility for restoring trust in the Department after so many false hopes were dashed once the election was out of the way in 2002. The Government was re-elected on a platform which included promises to eliminate waiting lists by 2004; extend medical card eligibility to 200,000 extra people; take 26,000 patients off public hospital waiting lists within two years; provide 3,000 extra beds, a network of primary care centres, community facilities for the elderly and improve accident and emergency services with senior doctors available at all times. The reality and the vista before the Tanáiste is an indictment of the Government and her predecessor. Unless she does something drastic, it will be an indictiment of her also.More than 46,000 medical cards were withdrawn in the past two years. Since the Government took office in 1997, 93,353 have been wiped off the medical card list. Waiting lists were not eliminated in May 2004. We have not been given figures since then as the Minister is trying to find out how many are on the list following consultation with the NTPF. As envelopes are heaped on desks in hospitals which have not been processed, we do not know the extent of such waiting lists. It is a deliberate attempt by the Department of Health and Children to conceal the true extent of the problem. Instead of providing new beds, some 192 beds in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area were closed in 2003.We were promised 709 beds in acute hospitals before the end of 2002 but that deadline passed 21 months ago and only 589 are in place. The Government promised an investment of €1 billion over ten years but only €16 million has been spent on the primary care strategy. Three years after the publication of that strategy, the Department is still examining ten pilot projects. We were told recently that the much needed funding for primary care is now being withheld until 2007. Community services for the elderly are rationed, particularly home help facilities. Those who are forced into nursing homes owing to inadequate community services find it difficult to keep up payments and there is no adequate inspection of nursing homes to ensure their safety.Our accident and emergency services are in crisis, with overcrowding and significant numbers on trolleys, even at traditionally quiet times of the year. Fianna Fáil's plans for such services will leave small hospitals with no accident and emergency departments, forcing many to travel longer distances for medical attention.On every difficult issue, on every occasion when chaos reigned, Deputy Martin, the former Minister for Health and Children, empathised and  sympathised but produced no action or solution. Commitments were made on blood transfusion services. Despite the publication of the Finlay report on the former Blood Transfusion Service Board seven and a half years ago, important issues remain to be addressed without which the reform process will not be complete. There were inordinate and unacceptable delays in notifying more than 24 donors, including Donor L, of the date of discovery of their infection with hepatitis C. Information I received under the Freedom of Information Act showed that there was internal dissent and contradiction between professionals when the board's decision to contact affected donors was attempted.We also know that more than two years ago, the outgoing Minister agreed with Positive Action, Transfusion Positive and the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, IBTS, to put in place an independent investigation to discover why this delay occurred. The process has run into the sand and we wonder why. Perhaps the fact that the new Minister is not a native of Cork will assist her in cutting through the political knot that has been created and which led to the resignation of the chairperson and other board members of the former BTSB in 2001. It is a mess that must be sorted out sooner rather than later so that patients and donors can have confidence in the blood transfusion system.There are many parents and family members who have had to face again their grief at the loss of a child when they discovered that their child's organs had been retained or used without their knowledge or consent. The Dunne inquiry has not yet reported and there are many unanswered questions surrounding this issue which must be speedily and comprehensively addressed. Again, the former Minister made many promises but he did not deliver. Allowing this issue to fester only increases the pain for those people.We received indications over the summer from the silence of the lambs on the Fianna Fáil backbenches that the Taoiseach would carry out a radical reshuffle. We have witnessed a minimal reshuffle with the normal cautious approach of the Taoiseach of treading slowly and carefully in these matters. There is a system of promotion in his mind that has stood the test of time today, with those who were expecting promotion being disappointed at both senior and junior level. This reshuffle was a political damp squib.

I also congratulate my constituency colleague, the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, who is going to the Department of Health and Children. It is a challenging position but I have no doubt that she will deal with it effectively. She is single-minded and focused and will bring a radical approach to the Department.I assure those Opposition Members who wonder about the co-operation between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats that we have a very good working relationship, none better than the Tánaiste and myself.

#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	137	She will look after the Department of Health and Children and I will look after the constituency. There will be no problems.A key objective of the programme for Government is to sustain a strong economy and to keep Government finances close to balance or in surplus. This is a responsibility with which the new Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, has been charged in the period ahead. His record as a Minister points to someone who will not be found wanting in dealing with the major challenges over the next few years and beyond.Like Deputy Hogan, I pay tribute to Deputy McCreevy whose management of a complex brief over the past seven years has been exceptional. As Minister for Finance he presided over the longest sustained period of economic growth in Irish history and wisely used that growth to ensure real social progress. Even during the recent global economic slowdown, the Irish economy remained remarkably resilient thanks in no small part to prudent management of the public finances.It is worth pointing out that as Minister for Finance over seven successive budgets, Deputy McCreevy generated policies that have been responsible for the creation of 420,000 jobs, long-term unemployment falling by 80% since 1997, €5 billion in tax cuts being returned to workers, sustained investment in public services with €40 billion being spent this year, economic growth averaging 8% per annum since 1997 and Ireland having the second lowest debt level in the eurozone. Deputy McCreevy may have his detractors on the Opposition benches but these facts speak loud and clear.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	138	He has his detractors on the Government benches as well. Was DeputyCurran not one of those who went to the Taoiseach about him?
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	139	No I was not. He has done more than the critics could have ever dreamed and no Minister for Finance can claim to have achieved more. Those critics who would have people believe that these are the worst of times would do well to pause and reflect on the fact that last year Ireland's economy experienced real growth of nearly 4% of gross domestic product, GDP. That is compared with an estimated eurozone growth rate of less than 0.5%. The latest report from the ESRI indicates that our economy will grow by almost 5% this year with an even stronger performance expected next year. Ireland is set to benefit from the global economic recovery. This has happened not by chance but because of the prudent policies we pursued in the first phase of this Government. Our prudent approach during the downturn kept Ireland working.The Government's record in jobs speaks for itself. Since June 1997, when the Taoiseach was elected, unemployment has been halved from 10% to our current historically low level. We sustained employment even through the downturn, and the latest employment figures show that we are now creating 1,000 new jobs a week.Our public finances continue to offer hope for the future. Our debt to GDP ratio, at just over 32%, is the second lowest in the eurozone. In 2004, little more than 7% of tax revenue and 7% of net current expenditure would be required to service our debt, which is a huge change. In 1997, the annual cost of servicing the debt peaked in absolute money terms at €3.5 billion. Next year it will only be €2.4 billion. Our financial indebtedness, which seven years ago was still near to the EU average under the rainbow coalition, has improved hugely and has freed up more resources to invest in people and communities.A far-sighted measure taken by this Government is the investment of significant sums against the future demographic challenges of an ageing society through the national pensions reserve fund. In addition, we are investing twice the EU average in public infrastructure, another long-term investment in the future well-being of the Irish economy and the benefit of the Irish people.The Government's tax policy has been a key element in helping to generate unprecedented growth levels in the Irish economy. Our programme of lowering taxes has been key in growing employment and Government revenue. We are proud of having delivered record tax cuts which are benefiting all groups, with low paid workers in Ireland paying the lowest tax in Europe. We reject the proposals of some of those on the Opposition benches who want to raise taxes. The lesson of the past is clear. High taxes lead to high unemployment and low revenue for funding pensions and services.It is a fact that 670,000 income earners have been removed from the tax net, compared with 380,000 in 1997. At present, PAYE workers do not pay tax on income which is below €246 per week. In 1997 that figure was €98. Business tax rates have been slashed, fostering new employment and growth while sustaining revenue. The point is often missed that while the tax rates are low, we are still sustaining revenue.Much has been achieved, especially for low income earners, but Fianna Fáil's clear republican philosophy means there can be no resting on our laurels — we must go further. I urge the Taoiseach to push ahead with targeting the 100% exclusion of the minimum wage from the tax net, which could perhaps be achieved in the next budget. In the past two years, the Government has done much to enhance the position of the more vulnerable in our society. Our record stands head and shoulders above the record of the Administration of which Deputies Kenny and Rabbitte were members. There is no getting away from the facts that since 1997 the annual expenditure on health has been just short of trebled to €10 billion, annual expenditure on education has been more than doubled to €6.6 billion and child benefit has been increased by more than 200%, while old age pensions have increased by two thirds.Fianna Fáil has always understood that a healthy economy can do far more for the vulnerable in our society than an economy in difficulties. Put simply, without economic strength there will never be an Ireland in which everyone can prosper and fulfil his or her potential. I strongly urge the Government to continue to make progress on the social front as our economy grows and more resources become available.The Government can be rightly proud of its record of managing the economy as well as building a more inclusive Ireland. I look forward to the Government getting on with the job in hand, dealing with the challenges ahead and continuing to deliver for our people. I wish the new Ministers well and look forward to working with them as Members on this side of the House work to build on the achievements of the past seven years to ensure that the Government continues to foster the conditions for sustaining employment, further social progress and greater economic growth for all of our people.
#JohnDennehy	unknown-#JohnDennehy-party	unknown-#JohnDennehy-dob	unknown-#JohnDennehy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	140	Ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a dhéanamh le gach Aire agus gach Aire Stáit nua. I will be forgiven for reserving a particular word of congratulations for my constituency colleague, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe and wish him well. He will be joined in Cabinet by my other colleague, Deputy Martin, and I hope we will make a good team. Like Deputy Curran, I will look after the constituency for them.I am particularly pleased to speak in support of nominations for members of the Government. One of the most important aspects of the Government's work has been its commitment to the pensions issue. It deserves our support and great credit is due to the Government for the manner in which it has gone about delivering on its promise to prioritise the needs of pensioners. Since June 1997, I am proud that my party in Government has implemented the largest pension increase ever. The derisory increases given to pensioners by the parties opposite when they were last in office is one of the reasons they have been consigned to the Opposition benches for so long. In contrast to Fine Gael and the Labour Party, we believe in and deliver on pensions for today's pensioners and make sure that others can be afforded their due pensions when they retire.In the programme for Government, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats gave a clear commitment to achieve a pension of at least €200 per week and to protect the national pensions reserve fund. Old age pensioners received a €10 increase in the 2004 budget, which was more than three and a half times the projected rate of inflation. Government is about deciding on what is really important and Fianna Fáil and its partners in Government, the Progressive Democrats, have put older people at the top of their agenda. The increases in pensions, which will continue to be made by the Government highlight this fact.In monetary terms the statistics speak for themselves. The effect of the increases under Fianna Fáil is that the rate of the old age contributory pension now stands at €167.30 per week. This is a monumental increase on the £99 per week which was the payable rate on the day the self-styled champions of social justice, namely, Fine Gael and the Labour Party, left office. The increase in pensions in every one of the Government's budgets have been real and well ahead of inflation. The critics on the Opposition benches should explain why, when they were last in office, old age pension increases were below the level of inflation. The rainbow Government implemented meagre pension rises.The contributory pension in 1995 was increased by just £1.80 or €2.29. The average rise in the pension under the rainbow Government was €2.95 compared with €10 under this Government. The rainbow Government increased the pension by just 4% over inflation, while this Government has increased it by 43%. Deputy Rabbitte and others can juggle and spin all they like but these facts are on the record.Most damning of all was that the rainbow Government made no provision for paying pensions into the future. I am proud to support a Government which has taken a far-sighted approach and has taken measures aimed at boosting Ireland's ability to continue paying decent pensions, even when the population ages significantly, through the establishment of the national pensions reserve fund. The Government deserves great credit for the disciplined manner in which it has maintained that fund despite the international down-turn. The annual payment of 1% of GNP into the fund is a courageous approach which will pay dividends in the future, on which I complimented the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy on many occasions. It makes far more sense than the proposal, made by Fine Gael in the lifetime of this Dáil, to raid the national pensions reserve fund. It is easy to spend money now but we need to plan for the future even if there is no immediate political recognition for doing so.The national pensions reserve fund was established to assist in paying the increased cost of social welfare and Civil Service pensions as the population ages. The fund was set up to pay for pensions in the future, when there will be one pensioner for every two people of working age. Those of us who have been around for a while have probably heard every economist who spoke in the past 20 years refer to a pensions time bomb. However, the Government and the Minister for Finance were willing to work to deal with that time bomb and defuse it in good time.I commend the Government for the role it has played in encouraging personal retirement savings account products. The PRSAs, introduced on 24 February 2003, will play a leading role in meeting Government targets in respect of private pension coverage and ensuring that people have an adequate income on retirement. Mandatory employer access to PRSAs was introduced in September 2003 for employees not covered under occupational pension schemes. Other measures taken by the Government include the establishment of a pensions ombudsman, in respect of which action has been taken with the ombudsman receiving and investigating complaints arising from the operation of pension schemes.Other measures of which I am proud include the changes which have been initiated in the tax code on behalf of our senior citizens. There has been much talk about harsh budgets and right-wing economics but no Member of this House can, with any credibility, criticise the caring steps taken to reduce the burden of personal taxation which has exempted more than 81,000 persons aged 65 or over from the tax net as a result of the past seven budgets. The issue was of concern to many of us who knocked on doors over the past two years and I am glad action was taken in this regard.There is no arguing with the fact that, since June 1997, more than 200,000 people have been lifted out of poverty. This is because jobs have been created and because of major increases in direct support for poorer families and communities. With other countries, Ireland is now poised to recover from the global economic down-turn because we adopted sensible policies and the Government is now well-placed to build on the unprecedented rises in social welfare and targeted social inclusion spending to end consistent poverty in Ireland once and for all. It is ironic to hear Members opposite refer to Thatcherite economics when the facts point to the inescapable conclusion that the Government parties have implemented the most generous social welfare improvements since the establishment of the welfare state.Deputy Kenny did away with his alibi when he referred to former Deputy De Rossa and his colleagues proposing a £1.20 increase. He told them to hand it over because the money was not there to pay for it. While complimenting some members of the Government, Deputy Rabbitte side-tracked somewhat to suggest Deputy Michael D. Higgins start working for the  Sunday Independent. I am sure Deputy Higgins will consider that a very poor consolation for not being allowed to run for the position of President. I commend the motion to the House.

It has dramatically changed us as a people and our hopes and ambitions. It has radically changed our collective value system to the point at which this could be accurately described as a valueless society in freefall. Gone is the sense of community, the role of Government in striving to create a sense of fairness and, for many people, especially the young, the sense of belonging. At a time of unprecedented economic growth to which all the major political parties contributed, the Government has presided over the dismantling of many of our public services and a fracturing of our society. It has created a free-for-all in which the rich have become vastly richer and the poor have been left behind.This brave new world has been personified by the departing Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. For most people it is a case of good riddance to him. During his seven years in office he devised every scheme and scam imaginable to incentivise wealth accumulation for the rich while at the same time he put the squeeze on those on middle incomes and completely screwed the poor. From the special savings incentive accounts, SSIAs, and individualisation to halving capital gains tax and the many tax shelters he has created, his aim has always been the same, namely, to create opportunities for the wealthy to make more money and avoid paying their share of taxes. If that was not enough, he consistently denied the existence of widescale tax evasion when all the evidence pointed to the contrary.The former Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has not been alone. While he has been the most ideologically driven member of the Cabinet, his ministerial colleagues have been all too willing to participate in the exercise of shifting wealth to the rich at the expense of ordinary people while cutting back on universal services and entitlements. Rather than using the fruits of economic success to improve the country and modernise and upgrade our public services, they slavishly followed the American model which promotes the survival of the fittest.For most ordinary people, the past seven years have proved a major disappointment and a lost opportunity. For the first time, the money to solve our problems has been available. We could have created a decent health service, upgraded all the dilapidated schools and provided a modern transport and telecommunications infrastructure. Instead, the Government squandered the opportunity and created a deeply divided, highly unequal and widely discontented society.In June, the public rightly passed judgment on the performance of the Government. I wonder if it has received the message yet that people do not like what this country has become. We heard a great deal of spin over the summer, the Taoiseach having stifled any opposition within his ranks. Usually after a disastrous election performance, a move is made among backbench and Front Bench Deputies to remove the leader who has become a liability. In his usual cunning manner, however, the Taoiseach immediately announced a reshuffle would take place in the autumn, which silenced everybody. Looking around the deeply disappointed faces on the Government backbenches I could not help thinking it is surely only a matter of time before Government Deputies start to regroup in the realisation that the Taoiseach has become a serious liability to the Government. Watch this space because the mutterings and caucuses will start soon. How long will the Taoiseach survive as leader of the Fianna Fáil Party? If it wants to be in Government afterthe next general election, he is not the man to lead it.Today's much-hyped reshuffle has been a damp squib. So much for a fresh, new look and a change in direction. The Taoiseach has rearranged the deckchairs. With few exceptions, we have the same tired team, operating to the same old programme for Government. As for a new, caring approach, I will not hold my breath.In the area of transport, while I welcome the change in Minister, I am not hopeful of any major change in direction. We have replaced one aspiring Progressive Democrats member with another former Progressive Democrats member, which does not augur well. I urge the new Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, to learn from the disasters the incumbent created and, first and foremost, to think matters through before making announcements and issuing press statements. Essentially, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, has done nothing other than issue press statements, shoot from the hip, cause endless trouble and bring the country to the brink of industrial crises in the transport companies on umpteen occasions. Only when the Taoiseach stepped in and rescued him was the situation brought under control.I also ask the new Minister to drop the obsession with ownership of the commercial semi-State companies. He should develop them to their full potential and allow them to act in accordance with the purpose for which they were established. He should stop the political interference and allow them to operate commercially.I hope the new Minister will concentrate on improving road safety, sort out the shambles of the penalty points system and ensure sufficient resources are made available to provide for the enforcement of our road traffic laws. The priority in the transport brief is undoubtedly to develop the capacity of public transport, on which little progress has been made. People must still contend daily with traffic gridlock which has a major impact on their quality of life.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	144	I extend my good wishes to the new Ministers, particularly the new Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, whom I wish well. He has spoken many times about the deficiencies in housing, environmental safeguards and infrastructure in County Wicklow and I hope he will seize the opportunity to address them. If he forgets any of these issues, I will certainly remind him.I also listened with great interest to the comments on the health area of the leader of the Progressive Democrats Party and new Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney. While I wish her well, I advise her not to confuse reform of the health service with the tortuous set of administrative changes commenced by the incumbent. Although she pinpointed the issue of inequality, we must have no more of the guff we have had for so long on this issue. We have repeatedly heard that the Government is committed to equality and fairness and we heard it again from the Tánaiste without any explanation of what she intends to do about it. Simply parroting her predecessor's commitments on the issue of equality is not good enough. People have grown weary of it and she will find that it convinces no one. Let us hear something new with regard to the health service. It would be refreshing, for example, if the Tánaiste were to explain what she intends to do as Minister for Health and Children and answer some of the questions I will outline.Two hundred thousand medical cards were promised and 200,000 poor unfortunate people, an increase of almost 100,000 since 1997, are still waiting. They desperately need the security and support of a medical card. When will they get one? Will the Tánaiste, as Minister for Health and Children, deal with the inequality at the heart of our health service? Will she now guarantee that the essential principle that the money follows the patient will apply to all patients, not just to those who have health insurance?The Labour Party spelt out very clearly its set of proposals on inequality. We set out and explained our position on universal health insurance and Fianna Fáil attacked us over and over again on that vision. Let us hear what the Progressive Democrats have to say about inequality in our health service and, more importantly, how they intend to bring about equality. The fudge that we have had year in, year out, is simply not good enough.The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, raided necessary funding that was earmarked for primary care and mental health services. Mental health is the Cinderella of the health service. The Minister transferred the funding from these necessary areas into the acute hospital service to fill the gaps that he had created. Will Deputy Harney deal with this issue when she is Minister for Health and Children? What about the mentally ill who thought they would receive decent community services? What about the elderly who thought they would get good quality primary care as a result of commitments made by the Government and who are now being short-changed?Will Deputy Harney deal with an issue that is close to her own area, that of accident and emergency departments? Tallaght Hospital, to which my party leader referred, has an average of 20 people waiting in its accident and emergency department for admission. Thirty to 50 people are occupying beds in the hospital but should not be doing so because they should be in rehabilitation. However, they are stuck because the rehabilitation beds were never provided. Some 150 additional beds could be provided at the hospital but the Government is blocking their provision and will not provide the necessary money.The Minister, Deputy Martin, and the Taoiseach promised 3,000 beds and an end to waiting lists within two years. These commitments were made to the people and were dishonoured by what happened subsequently. Will we see a difference or will it be more of the same under Deputy Harney? She needs to talk a little more about what she intends to do, not engage in the rhetoric at which she is very good. She is a great communicator but the problem is that, very often, the words do not add up to much and we do not receive the hard-headed information people need to hear. We have had enough reports on health, commissions and press launches that would dazzle one, regardless of whether they pertain to health strategies, primary care strategies or otherwise. We have been there and done that.I pay tribute to Deputy Harney, who is about to take on a difficult brief. As Opposition spokesperson, I will not be found wanting if the Minister does the correct thing and can deliver on commitments that alter peoples' lives and genuinely improve access to health care. However, the cynicism in regard to health care in particular and the Government is very extensive. We now need to hear more than empty promises and rhetoric.This Government has been holed by an iceberg. The massive drop in support for the Government, as evidenced at the last elections, set alarm bells ringing, but somehow it is as if the Government is deaf. We do not see a change but people moving around into different seats. There is no change of heart or policy. The Progressive Democrats are talking about the same programme for Government that existed at the beginning of the life of the Government rather than about a real attempt to create something out of the message that the public gave the Government. I do not believe that the Government is capable of change. It is stuck, tired, worn out and past its sell by date, and the same faces in different seats will not change that one whit.We have serious problems in our health service and sick and elderly people, who have a right to decent care, have waited too long. There are excellent people working in the health service who want to provide such care but very often they carry out their work under conditions that would not be acceptable in any other European country. At the heart of the system there is an inequality. Those who can afford to pay can gain access to health care and those who cannot go on a waiting list. That is the nature of the apartheid in our health service and this has been the case since the Government took office.The commitments that were made were dishonoured. Somebody who cannot afford to go to a family doctor because his income is low but just above the limit should by now be very aware of who is to blame for the blocking of his access to health care.

#JohnEllis	unknown-#JohnEllis-party	unknown-#JohnEllis-dob	unknown-#JohnEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	147	I pay tribute to the three Ministers who will leave office today. Deputy Walsh served Irish agriculture extremely well. When history is written, Deputy McCreevy will go down as the only Minister for Finance who kept the finances of this country under control at times when people wanted them to go out of control. The benefits of his work will be seen in the future. Deputy Michael Smith served the country extremely well and served the Government as Minister for Defence. I wish well those who have been promoted, especially Deputies O'Dea, Roche and Hanafin, and also my near neighbour Deputy Brendan Smith and Deputies Killeen, Batt O'Keeffe, Seán Power and Conor Lenihan.We have heard from many people in recent times in regard to the health service. This Government's commitment to health and personal social services is reflected in its very significant extra investment in this area over recent years. Today's annual investment of over €10 billion represents a 188% increase in seven years and has allowed work to commence on 88% of the 121 actions set out in the health strategy action plan at this relatively early stage in its implementation.This unprecedented level of investment has brought significant results, a whole range of additional services provided in all the major programmes of care and record levels of activity in the acute hospital system. In conjunction with the massive investment we have seen in our health services over the past seven years is the reforming zeal that Deputy Martin has brought to his portfolio, as evidenced in the far-seeing reforms he has brought about, which will pay dividends into the future.The existing health service structures have been in place for more than 30 years. I remember when the late Erskine Childers, as Minister for Health, brought about the changes that set up the health boards. In the past thirty years, major improvements in services have been implemented. There is no comparison between the services that were available at the beginning of this period and those available to people today. During his term of office, Deputy Martin rightly identified that as we move forward in trying to further build the system, we must make sure that the structures are able to deal with the challenges of the 21st century. These challenges are enormous.It is reassuring to hear that it will be a central priority of this Administration to continue to deliver the health service reform programme begun by Deputy Martin to modernise health structures so they can deal with the demands placed on the system now and over the coming years. Every Member in this House knows that central to this is the ability to deliver a high quality of service for people on a consistent national basis. People do not always recognise that sickness can come about very quickly. Nobody knows when a flu epidemic, for example, will lead to people having to use trolleys in hospitals.Without doubt, the Government decision to reform the health services is both radical and challenging. It is a testimony to the determination that Deputy Martin has shown that the implementation of the health reform programme is broad-ranging and that tangible steps have already been taken towards progressing the necessary structural reform of the health system. The Hanly task force report is just one element in this process and despite the scare-mongering from the "can't do anything, won't do anything" brigade on the other side of House, the Government deserves to be commended for setting forth on implementing the most comprehensive reform programme in the recent history of Irish health care.As Deputies are aware, it has been this Government which has announced decisions regarding a new health services executive which will include a national hospital office, a primary and continuing care directorate and a shared services centre. Taken together, these structural reforms represent the biggest single national reorganisation of the health system since Erskine Childers introduced the health boards. Work is well under way to make these changes a reality. The health boards and other health agencies are already working closely with the Department of Health and Children to put flesh on the organisational structures decided upon by the Government.In terms of reform, our record of leading progressive change stands in stark comparison to the sorry comments made by the Labour Party spokesperson on health who, in a most damning indictment of that party's credibility on health issues, two days before the general election conceded that her party's health policy was "not workable for five years." I have listened many times to Opposition Deputies in the past two years trying to distort the Government's record and the achievements of those who work in the health service. The irony in all of this is that many of those who are predicting the worst and criticising us for bringing forward innovative reforms are the same people who trooped through the division lobbies in Leinster House in support of the shameful record of the rainbow coalition. There is no need for a reminder on the amount of money spent by the last coalition on health in its last year. No multi-annual funding was provided for capital projects. It is near impossible to plan and construct large projects on the basis of year-on-year funding. The decision to provide for multi-annual funding is one of the greatest taken by the Government. Through the mid-1990s the health system was crying out for development funding. Renovations and new buildings were required. However, the coalition of the callous refused the necessary funding. In 1997 it actually made cut-backs in this key area. In 1996 €152 million was spent on health capital projects. In its final budget in 1997 this was cut to €138 million, a cut of nearly 10%.I know that the Deputies opposite will say they did not have the benefit of the boom that the policies of the Government have generated but I reject that argument as an excuse. While a shortage of funding can excuse early failings in terms of health system reform, by 1996 there was sufficient funding available to advance the agenda of reform. This simply was not done. What was absent was the political will. Starting from the low base left by the rainbow coalition, Fianna Fáil has since increased the health spend to over €10 billion, an increase of over 162%.Since Deputy Bertie Ahern formed his first Administration, the last seven years have brought substantial additional spending on health care; capital projects, staff and the day-to-day running of a continually increasing level of services. More and more patients and clients have benefited from the extra resources we have put into the health system.I want to say a few words about the national treatment purchase fund, for which there is a multidisciplinary team which has been working with individual hospitals to identify patients on waiting lists. This initiative has made considerable progress in tackling waiting lists. On 4 May 2004 the fund reported that waiting times had fallen significantly with 37% of patients now waiting between three and six months and 43% waiting between six and 12 months for surgery. The fund has the available capacity to treat additional numbers of patients and will continue to focus on reducing waiting times even further. If referrals can be maintained at the level of the fund's full capacity, it expects waiting times for surgical operations should be reduced further to bring them into line with the health strategy targets of three to six months.I congratulate Deputy Martin on his achievements on which I know the Tánaiste will follow up. I hope that Manorhamilton, where the North Western Health Board was located, will receive significant consideration when it comes to the allocation of new sections under the new health strategy. I wish the Tánaiste and the new Ministers well and know that when we go to the electorate in three years time, they will give us the same rousing endorsement that they gave us in 2002.
#JimGlennonFF	unknown-#JimGlennonFF-party	unknown-#JimGlennonFF-dob	unknown-#JimGlennonFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	148	I congratulate the new Ministers on their appointment today, as well as the outgoing Ministers who have served with such distinction. I was listening to the speeches in my room before I came to the House. The common thread running through them was the honour to serve not only as a Deputy in this House, but particularly to be asked to serve in Cabinet or a junior ministerial role. I know that the outgoing Ministers did so with distinction for many years. I have no doubt that their successors will continue to do so in the best traditions of their parties and this House.I welcome the opportunity to address the House today and speak in this debate on the nomination of the new Ministers. Since Deputy Bertie Ahern was elected Taoiseach, Fianna Fáil and our partners, the Progressive Democrats, have given unprecedented priority to education. The House will be aware that this year the Government is investing over €6.5 billion in the education system. Our prioritisation of education is grounded in our conviction that it has a critical role in sustaining economic growth and building an inclusive society.It is to the great credit of the Government that it has provided for an additional 5,000 primary teachers and more than 1,600 extra second level teachers. We have made significant improvements in direct funding to schools and reduced the pupil-teacher ratio. In contrast, is the record of the parties opposite that their Deputies in their last budget voted to freeze school funding and cut back teacher numbers. It was left to the Government to undo the catastrophe the rainbow coalition left behind in this sector.Far too often in this House we hear rhetoric about what should be done but soundbites are no substitute for action. The record shows that the Government has substantially increased supports for children from disadvantaged backgrounds and those with special educational needs. We have also made dramatic improvements in the areas of adult and continuing education, expanded the numbers at third level and significantly boosted the student support system.In An Agreed Programme for Government, there is a commitment to improve school buildings. I pay tribute to the outgoing Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, for the manner in which he has gone about delivering on this commitment. It was not an easy task, with rapidly expanding populations in urban areas, but he went about it in his own inimitable fashion and set up new systems that may not have been particularly popular at the time but which will prove themselves over time.In the current year the Government is investing €387 million in the school building programme. The prophets of doom will always be with us but the facts show this is the largest school modernisation programme in the history of the State. This morning I visited the local community school in my home town of Skerries where a magnificent new building costing €8 million will house 1,000 students. The difference to an environment in which teachers can teach and students can learn is tangible as one walks in the door. It is a great tribute to County Dublin VEC which put the building in place. It puts previous efforts by our colleagues opposite into context.While Ireland is fast becoming a knowledge society, I urge the Minister to continue to focus on the development of basic skills for employability and citizenship. We must keep in mind that while education is crucial to economic development, its primary purpose is to provide everyone with the opportunity to achieve his or her full potential, both as individuals and members of society. Creativity, tolerance, appreciation of diversity and social skills, also form an important part of education in the knowledge society. The move towards a knowledge-based society means that education and training systems gain even greater importance. An education system that delivers the goods in respect of economic development while also delivering on social justice must be put in place. An education system which is utilitarian in nature and focused solely on economic benefits should be classified as a failure. Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats in Government will never travel that road.For Fianna Fáil, education has always been unquestionably the key route to escaping from the effects of inter-generational disadvantage and poverty. Building an inclusive society requires targeted additional interventions for those of our citizens who need particular help to access education, continue through the system and successfully complete their studies. Keeping all our young people in school at least to completion of upper secondary education must remain a key priority. I commend the Government for the significant progress to date.The percentage of 85.6% of 22 year-olds in Ireland with upper secondary education is a full 10% above the EU average. In acknowledging that success, we must aim higher. I am confident that this Government, and in particular, Deputy Hanafin in her new brief, will act accordingly. I commend the motion to the House.

Ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a ghabháil leis an Aoire nua, an Teachta Tom Kitt, agus tá súil agam obair leis mar Aoire, go háirithe i leith leasaithe Dála atá ag teastáil go mór.The most significant move in this so-called Cabinet reshuffle is the retention of the Progressive Democrats Deputy McDowell in the ministerial post with responsibility for justice, equality and human rights. On a purely politically selfish level, I thank the Taoiseach for doing Sinn Féin a great favour. I thank Deputy McDowell because he has been the single most helpful member of the Cabinet in securing Sinn Féin's ongoing electoral successes. As the personification of the regressive right-wing political and social agenda in his unparalleled egotism, his class arrogance and his ridiculous penchant for adopting failed policies from other jurisdictions, he is great fun to campaign with. His actions result in a great response on the doorsteps for Sinn Féin. I look forward to his assistance in the run-up to the next general election, which is a selfish view.However, in terms of social justice and the public good, the Taoiseach is making a huge mistake in confirming his ongoing ministerial position. The reappointment of Deputy McDowell sends a clear message from this Government to the people. It says the Government does not expect its Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to tackle growing insecurity in working-class areas caused by the concentration of increased street crime and illegal drugs trading in those areas. Instead, the Government is content to indulge an anti-republican ideologue who would prefer to concentrate available resources on scapegoating more vulnerable people in society such as refugees, Travellers and children. The reappointment of Deputy McDowell says that this Government has no commitment to building a rights-based society and it reaffirms its view that social and economic inequality should persist.The real significance in the reappointment of this Minister is that it confirms to the voters not that the Progressive Democrats dominate the coalition Government but rather that the Minister, Deputy McDowell, is nothing more than a handy tool to do the dirty work of the senior partner in Government, the work for which the senior partner is not willing to take responsibility. If one wishes to decode the real agenda of today's reshuffle, one need look no further than the reappointment of this ministerial thug. Deputy McDowell is not just the medium, he is the message that this Government is giving out.

That is the situation which pertains and it is an indication of the two-tier society created by this, the most right-wing Government in the history of the State. Over the past seven years, a study of the parameters which define quality of life shows that for the less well-off, these parameters are negative. Health services have disimproved. Some 150,000 people are on local authority housing waiting lists. There has been a significant reduction in the number of medical cards issued. Crime and anti-social behaviour afflicts society. Poverty exists, with 21% of the population living in relative poverty and 8% living in consistent poverty. The number of children living in households classified as poor stands at 70,000. That is the legacy of this Government.Today's Cabinet reshuffle is a no-change situation and is more of the same even though the money is available with which to create a just and fair society. However, the political will to do so is not present. The current budget surplus stands at over €5 billion. If the political will was present, health, education and housing services could be made available for the less well-off.I regret that the leader of Fine Gael and the Labour Party Members are not present in the House. The alternative to this Government is a Fine Gael and Labour coalition, with or without a green tinge. That is no alternative. In the past, coalitions of Labour, Fine Gael and rainbow groupings have been anything but helpful to ordinary people. The Labour Party, the Green Party, Sinn Féin and other Independent Deputies should come together to put forward a broad Left programme before the people in the next election.

As the Minister for Foreign Affairs he was proactive in the production of the report of the task force on emigrants which is a good report and a good blueprint for the future. Funding was only a tiny fraction of the emigrants' remittances. The Minister struggled to acquire the financing. Now that he is the Minister for Finance, there is no excuse for not paying the moral debt that is owed in justice rather than in charity to our emigrants.I hope that the new Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, will realise the importance of Knock Airport to the West. It is a catalyst which has always been regarded as a regional airport rather than as the international airport which it is.I congratulate the Tánaiste on becoming Minister for Health and Children. I was very touched by her words. We all agree that there is terrible inequality in the system. I was disappointed that even though the Tánaiste stated she would make up her own mind, she then spoke of the reports such as the Hanly report which must be implemented. I attended a meeting between the Tánaiste and Cancer Care Alliance. I was very impressed with the Tánaiste. In my view, it is due to her that An Agreed Programme for Government contained a mention of units in the south-east and north-west. I ask the Tánaiste to meet Cancer Care Alliance to discuss the need for those units. Seriously ill people are being herded like cattle. These are people with a shorter lifespan, who undergo radical surgery and have a painful death. It is too far for them to travel and it is inhumane to expect them to travel that distance. I hope the Tánaiste will consider that area.The new Health Service Executive is primarily accountable to the Minister for Health and Children but it is also accountable to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children. I am concerned that the Tánaiste will carry on like the previous Minister who treated that committee with total disdain. If that is to be the level of accountability, I call, as I have done previously, for the abolition——

In rearranging the deck chairs on the ship of State today, the Taoiseach should bear in mind the example of the other rearranging of deck chairs on another ship, the  Titanic. It was an exercise in futility when deck chairs were rearranged for the benefit of the orchestra on the Titanic. The Taoiseach has merely given the musicians different musical instruments to play. Come the next general election the tune the Government will be playing will still be Nearer, My God, to Thee. Just as the Titanic hit an iceberg, in the local and European elections this year the Government also hit an iceberg. We should be aware that only one-eighth of an iceberg is visible above the water. The remaining term of this Government, even if it is for two and a half years to which the Taoiseach would aspire, will see the ship of State being further torn asunder and sinking further below the water line because the song remains the same.

#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	158	The Taoiseach can rearrange his deck chairs as much as he likes but the message, the policies and their effects on the people will remain the same.I wish to point out some inconsistencies in the choices made today. Both parties in Government would like to take on a new caring and sharing image. However, there is nothing in the personnel appointed today or in the policies they are likely to adopt that would see such a change come about. I am particularly interested in the Tánaiste being appointed Minister for Health and Children. I would be interested to see whether innovative funding approaches, as suggested and implemented in transport and telecommunications, will be implemented in the health service. Will the service be broken into various components and sold off? Will there be a contract for the provision of services in the area of paediatrics, geriatrics and oncology? Might we see "Kids ‘r' us" medical services taking care of the medical needs of our children in the future? That is the reality of the policies the Government has put in place and continues to put in place. The Government showed no sign of changing its policies today or for the remaining two and a half years of its term of office.A similar appointment that causes amusement to members of the Green Party is that of Deputy Roche as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. He represents the constituency of Wicklow, the home of illegal dumping, the area that now wants to take over from Dublin as the pre-eminent area for dodgy planning. It is fast becoming the region of scary decisions at local government level. That is the area for which this Minister is to take responsibility. He will be judged on his actions in that area. The Minister, Deputy Cullen, lost his position following the implementation of policies that have been the worst in terms of the protection of the environment in the history of this State. We will reserve credit for the work of the incoming Minister on the basis of how he manages his portfolio.I congratulate my constituency colleague, the Minister, Deputy Martin, on being given a new economic portfolio, which will justify what Shakespeare said of Cassius in "Julius Caesar", that he now has his lean and hungry look. This appointment will give him a rounded portfolio in terms of any future changes that might happen in the leadership of the Fianna Fáil Party.I also welcome the appointment at junior Minister level of another constituency colleague, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe. We must wait and see what portfolio he will be given. I look forward, as a talisman, to when there is next a change in the composition of the Government. It will also be a change of Government and I hope those of us elected to Cork South Central will have a better chance for consideration.Ultimately, the futility of what is being done here will not change anything in how the Government is perceived. One can quote as many statistics as one likes. I heard the argument about relative poverty that was debated earlier in the Chamber by speakers in a ping pong fashion. The reality is that not only have we relative poverty, we have persistent poverty. People are far removed from earning an average income and are further and deeper removed from the level of those earning the highest incomes here than at any time in the history of this State. The Government cannot walk away from that reality. It is fatuous to quote examples of one person earning €150,000 and another person earning €10 million. The reality is that people on the minimum wage are being taxed.During the seven years in which the parties in Government have been in office those who have had least have borne the highest burden. We see little change in that on this side of the House. Changes are introduced in the budget which the new Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, will present in the House in a number of weeks. The Government will not be burdened with any revelations that it has done anything wrong and its approach will be that everything can be repaired in the future.We still have a programme for Government that is being implemented in a fairly bull-headed way to the effect that damage, inconsistencies and inequalities will persist in this country. Nothing that can be put forward in terms of spin or gloss will change that reality. No amount of statistics will change the fact that the majority of people are not happy. They do not feel they are safe. They do not believe that their circumstances make them very wealthy. I hope that when we have a general election, which I accept will be in two to two and half years' time, the nature of the debate at that time will present a clear choice that will not only be about policies but about the future and the soul of this country.

I also congratulate the new Ministers of State. I commiserate with those who are no longer in Government and I thank them for the tremendous work they have done.The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, does not have to defend his policies in this House; they have been well articulated in other fora. Since 1997 some 420,000 extra jobs have been created in this economy, there have been strategic new investments for Ireland, a restructured tax code, as the Taoiseach said, the establishment of the national pensions reserve fund, record rates of investment in infrastructure, multi-annual capital programmes, and reforms in the public service, in legislation and in pensions. It is a magnificent record and a strategic approach which we intend to continue in this Administration.

The many reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy, his deft handling of the foot and mouth disease crisis, which saved us from possible destruction in terms of the rural economy, and his support for the food processing industry and its development have been significant milestones in a distinguished political career.The Minister, Deputy Smith, has been in five Departments of State and laterally as Minister for Defence. He has overseen the modernising of the Defence Forces and restored their morale. I know from people who were in Liberia recently that they were the best equipped, best trained and best prepared contingent ever to engage in work on behalf of the United Nations. In recent times, there was his work on the Army deafness issue, in respect of which it was estimated there would be a liability of €1 billion when he came to office, but which ended up being a liability of €300 million. For that alone he has done the State some service. He is one of the quintessential team players in Cabinet. I have had the great pleasure of working with him throughout my ministerial career and we have all learned a lot from his wise counsel and experience.I welcome those who are joining us, the Ministers, Deputies O'Dea, Roche and Hanafin, who has moved up from the position of Chief Whip. They will be excellent members of the Government. As explained by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, we are a team committed to implementing our programme for Government. The alternatives we have is what is called the Mullingar accord. That is a commitment to talk. I look forward to people getting together and having a chat and trying to come up with some sort of a coherent set of policies which we can debate in this House.We need an economically literate debate in this House. Whoever is in government must work within the macro-economic framework of the stability and growth pact to which every government must adhere. As a member of the European Union and the single currency, we must be prepared to ensure our critically adjusted budget balance is balanced or in surplus.

I want a discussion whereby the Opposition which claims it is ready for government will bring forward responsible fiscal and economic arguments. Let us have such as debate. Let the people be informed in order that they can make an informed choice. I am confident, based on the achievements of this and the previous Administration, and the comparisons which can be made with any European Government in terms of present growth and employment creation rates, that all the indices that affect ordinary families here compared to those in Belgium, Germany, France or anywhere else compare very favourably. We are prepared to defend these policies.The idiocy of what passes for economic debate in this House is the idea that those who want to tax more are more committed to public services than those who want to ensure we have taxation rates which are competitive and consistent with an enterprise economy and which have led to the creation of about 420,000 jobs since this so-called incompetent Government took office, an unprecedented record in modern history, but one cannot make that assumption. If that is the contention, the empirical facts are against it.I want to quote a couple of basic facts. We often hear from the Opposition that we are not interested in taking a fair share from the corporate sector. In 1996 the rate of corporation tax under the rainbow Government ran at 38%, yet the total percentage tax take from corporation tax was 11.4%, or €1,810 million. The rate is now 16% but, more important, the reduction from 38% to 12.5% resulted in greater enterprise and more jobs being created. As a result, we received revenue amounting to €5,348 million from corporation tax in 2004, the budget target.

People must come up with better ideas. The idea that increasing the tax rates will result in more money from the corporation sector is denied by the facts. In terms of taxation on labour, in 1996 the percentage tax take under the rainbow coalition was 36.6%. The figures available to me at short notice indicate it stood at 30.9% in 2002. What does this confirm? It confirms that the economic model we should be discussing is whether we want to go back to a failed policy of high taxation rates, high corporation tax rates and fewer jobs or whether we accept the current taxation system.

I listened silently for two hours to what others had to say and, as incoming Minister for Finance, subject to a vote of this House, I am entitled to comment on economic policy. I am simply making the point that when one sets a target, one must be prepared to implement the policies to achieve it.Reference was made to the minimum wage. It was this Government which introduced it and it is the highest in the developed world. Prior to its introduction, people were taxed on everything. As the Taoiseach outlined and the Tánaiste confirmed, our budgetary policy on taxation will seek to ensure those on the minimum wage will be exempt from tax.

That figure has now been increased by 150% with the result that people do not fall into the tax bracket until they earn €240 or €250 a week. That is the reality and the reason we want to continue with the model.As regards social and public services, the point I am making bears out the fact that the unprecedented increase in revenue and growth and the economic model we are pursuing have allowed us to bring about investment in public services. This includes the biggest modern hospital building programme and the biggest school building programme ever undertaken in the history of the state, an extra 3,500 special care assistants to look after the disadvantaged, support packages for 2,278 schools, an extra 19,000 people in third level education and an increase of 40% in the number of part-time students in third level education.

It is a startling figure. Until I began to research this issue, I had no idea that such an enormous number of people went to prison for non-payment of fines or debt.Prison should be a last resort. In general, it should be reserved for hardened criminals who should serve out their sentences without access to a revolving door mechanism or to release because of over crowding, which is accentuated by putting people in prison for non-payment of debt or fines.It is horrendously unfair that up to 50 people per day are in jail for non-payment of fines, particularly given that poor people make up virtually the entire number. Most of the 40 to 50 people who are in jail this evening for non-payment of fines or debt come from the poorer and more vulnerable sections of our population.Apart from this travesty of justice, the current system is hugely inefficient and costs tens of millions of euro to run annually. Six years ago Fine Gael first proposed a Bill that would have had a major impact on the Exchequer, prison places and people on whom the courts impose fines. The then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, rejected the Fine Gael proposal claiming that the Government's own version of the proposal was in the final stage of preparation. No legislation relating to attachment of earnings or enforcement of court orders has been produced and we are still waiting. There is no sign of a Government Bill and, according to the legislative programme issued yesterday, such a Bill will not be published in the short term.Fine Gael cannot wait a few years to get into Government to make the change because it wants this job done now. We are introducing our Bill because if we wait a few years, another 2,000 people will have been jailed under a system sanctioned by the present Administration for the non-payment of fines and debts. I ask the Government to stop playing party politics and to support the Bill. There is no social, economic, logical or moral case for opposing it.I will illustrate the moral aspect of this issue with one example. A few months ago a mother of seven who did not have a television licence was fined €150. She did not have the money and she was imprisoned. She is one example of the type of person who is imprisoned under the iniquitous system operated by the Government. It is unfair and it is wrong. I accept entirely that in many instances the stay in prison is short term. Fortunately, because media attention focused on this case, the unfortunate lady was released quickly but, at the same time, it happened and without the media focus her case would have passed unnoticed. She is one of many who are forced under this system to go to jail because they cannot afford to pay fines. In addition, she could not pay the €150 fine at €10 or €5 a week because instalments are not provided for under the system. Why is Ireland one of the few countries in the western world that still operates such a system? I am reminded of the debtor's prison of medieval times. The inertia of the Government parties, which have been in office for seven years, is highlighted by their failure to tackle this problem.Fine Gael seeks to create a win-win scenario for both the State and the individuals involved. We want to make it easier for people to discharge their debts instead of sending them to jail. If they pay the fines in instalments the Exchequer will benefit from the money received whereas under the current system they are hauled into prison and the fines are not paid. It is more expensive to keep someone in prison than to keep them in the Shelbourne Hotel. It costs €250 per day on average to keep somebody in prison. What is the advantage to the Exchequer, for example, of putting the woman to whom I referred in prison? It is a waste of time and money.In addition, costs are incurred by the Prison Service as it deals with people who receive unnecessary custodial sentences. For example, it must pay for induction procedures. The Garda also incurs expense. I asked a chief superintendent in rural Ireland recently what happens when a warrant must be executed for non-payment of a fine. He said he must dispatch two officers from his force — a force that is over-stretched because the Government will not provide extra officers who are needed — to arrest the person and they must hire a car and transport the person to Mountjoy Prison. The two officers who should be engaged in crime prevention and detection must transport an unfortunate debtor to Mountjoy Prison at enormous expense. That is a significant waste of Garda resources.The Bill is a serious attempt to eliminate an unjust system, which results in people being sent to jail for failure to pay a fine or debt. Meanwhile, other criminals are granted early release in some instances because of a shortage of prison places. The cost of keeping defaulters in prison is approximately €4 million a year. More than 1,000 are imprisoned annually for failure to pay fines or debts. However, when the debtor is freed, the debt remains unpaid. That is a lose-lose scenario on every front.According to the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on the collection of fines a number of years ago, a significant sum — up to €10 million a year — was expended in the area of uncollected and unpaid fines. The collection rate for fines was extremely low. He found from a sample in Dublin that almost half the fines were not recovered. He failed to see a reason the same did not apply throughout the State.The Bill provides a legislative basis to provide those who have difficulty paying fines with the opportunity to pay by instalments and to ensure those who refuse to pay fines or debts will over time have the amount deducted from their wages or social welfare payments. An attachment order will be sent to their employers to deduct the amount decided by the court per week to pay the fine. The Exchequer will gain and there will be a benefit in that Garda and Prison Service time and resources will not have to be wasted in dealing with the debtor.This issue also involves a human right. I do not wish to weep for the poor but it is utterly unjust that a poor person should have to go to jail because he or she cannot pay a fine or debt. Surely, in this day and age, that is wrong. Why do we not change the system? It is because the Government will not produce the necessary legislation to do so.The Bill serves a number of purposes and provides an alternative to jail where a person cannot afford to pay a fine. I am not saying such debts should be wiped out but the Bill provides for a system whereby fines can be easily collected. They can either be paid by instalment or by an attachment of earnings or welfare. I understand the sensitivity concerning welfare payments and a number of people have pointed out their concerns that those surviving on social welfare should not be subject to extra pressure. God knows the amounts involved are not enormous and there is much that is free, but it is better for people on social welfare to have the system I am suggesting than to go to jail. I do not believe someone should go to jail because they are poor. They certainly should not go to jail because the sole income in a household is from social welfare.The Bill provides for a protected welfare rate below which a person will not be expected to make any instalments. I am providing that the Minister for Social and Family Affairs — we have a new Minister, Deputy Brennan — will make an order as to what the protected welfare rate will be. In that way, the courts will not be able to demand payment of an instalment which would reduce the income of a welfare recipient below that rate.My colleagues will deal with the situation in more detail but I wish to run briefly through the Bill's provisions. Section 1 sets out the Short Title of the Bill and section 2 defines its terms. Section 3 states the general application of the Act as being that it applies to a person who has defaulted on payment of money, which arises from a court order. Section 4 is one of the principal sections, which allows the court to grant an attachment of earnings order, directing the debtor's employer to periodically deduct specified sums from the employee's wage at source. In deciding on the amount to be deducted from the employee's wages under the Bill the court must ensure the employee's wages will not be reduced below an amount which he or she needs to maintain themselves or their family. There is a protection built in there concerning employment.Section 5 is a technical provision requiring the official to serve the attachment of earnings order on the employer concerned. The employer must then comply with the order within ten days. Where deductions are made from the employee's wage, the employer must provide him or her with a statement of the deduction made.Section 6 provides that when determining an application for an attachment of earnings order, a court may ask the debtor to provide a statement of his or her earnings. Section 7 requires that where an attachment of earnings order has been made and the debtor moves to another job, he or she must notify the court of that fact. Also, where an employer becomes aware that an attachment of earnings order has been made, he or she must notify the court that they are the current employer of the debtor.Section 8 enables an application to be made to the court where there is doubt as to whether payments being received by the debtor actually constitute earnings for the purpose of the order. The debtor, the creditor or the employer may make such an application to the court.Section 9 clarifies the employment status of persons who are civil or public servants for the purposes of identifying an employer in the event that an order is to be made. Section 10 empowers the court to discharge or vary an attachment of earnings order. Section 11 provides that an attachment of earnings order will become ineffective if it is discharged by the court. Once an order ceases to be effective, the court must notify the employer.Section 12 states that where an attachment of earnings order has been made, proceedings to imprison a defaulter for failure to pay family law maintenance will lapse and any warrant or order issued under that section will no longer have effect. On the other hand, where an attachment of earnings order has been made and an order to imprison a defaulter for failure to pay such maintenance is made, the attachment of earnings order will no longer have effect.Section 13 sets out the penalties for a breach of aspects of the Bill, failure to comply with such orders and the provision of false information.Section 14 is quite important because it gives the Minister for Social and Family Affairs the power to make regulations to put in place a system under which a court could make an attachment of welfare order to allow the Minister to deduct money owed by a person who is in receipt of social welfare payments. This section specifically provides that the Minister will set a limit beyond which the person's social welfare payments must not be reduced. That limit is referred to as a protected welfare rate. I envisage that, under the Bill, it will be subject to annual review to ensure it keeps pace with inflationary and other influences.Effectively, section 4 dealing with attachment of earnings, and section 12 dealing with attachment of welfare orders, will ensure that we will see an end to people being sent to prison for failing to pay a fine or a debt.Section 15 amends the Criminal Justice (Community Services Orders) Act. Section 16 allows a court to extend the time within which a payment must be made. Section 17 allows a court to direct a debtor to pay the fine by instalment. It is ludicrous that we do not have such a system in this country and that one cannot pay a fine by instalment. I know of no other country in the world that has continued with that policy, yet the Government sits on its hands in allowing that to continue.Section 18 provides that where a person has been given time to pay a debt and has failed to do so, a court may order that such a person be placed under the supervision of a probation and welfare officer. I hope that provision could be used with a view to advising the person how best to manage the payment of the fine.As the House can see from the sections I have outlined, a fair bit of thought has gone into how the system can operate. It is not a question of reinventing the wheel; similar situations have existed in the United Kingdom for quite a long time. As far as I know, similar systems exist in virtually every other country in the western world.It is time to stand back and look at what we are talking about. We have had much fuss today about some people losing their jobs and others getting a step up. I am sorry for those who have lost their jobs, and the best of luck to those who got the step up. One must compare that situation, however, with the 50 people who are in our prisons tonight because they cannot pay fines.

The essential message is that because they are poor they cannot pay what in many instances are relatively small fines. I want to make it quite clear that I am not a bleeding heart liberal. If somebody commits a serious crime they should be put in prison and kept there. However, prison places should be kept for hardened criminals. For God's sake do not put people into prison merely because they are poor. That is what is happening day in and day out under this Government. If this Bill is not accepted, it will continue to be the case during the term of this Government. We were promised change six years ago in the programme for Government, but as with many other commitments and promises nothing has happened. Let us call a halt, draw the line now and make the change. I do not say this to the Government because this is a Fine Gael Bill, but because this legislation deals with the problem. There may be details which need to be changed or amended, but that is the purpose of Committee Stage. I urge the Government strongly to accept this Bill, co-operate on Committee Stage to make it law and change the iniquitous, unfair, stupid and costly system in which between 40 and 50 people are put into prison because they cannot pay fines.

We must record the facts for this so-called caring Government as they are not as its members have explained them. Perhaps the Minister of State recognises the document I have with me. It is An Agreed Programme for Government, agreed between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, page 70 of which refers to building a caring society. On page 59, the following commitment is outlined: "The enforcement of fines Bill which will provide new procedures for the enforcement of fines focusing on alternatives to imprisonment for non-payment is currently under consideration." The date of that caring commitment was June 2003. The court of public opinion will pass judgment at the next election.Listening to what the Taoiseach has been saying in the press, it is clear that the so-called caring Government could not care less. As Deputy Jim O'Keeffe pointed out, the Government has done nothing to address real inequality in our society. People who are unable to pay fines for many different reasons are going to prison, which wastes millions of euro while the Minister clearly could not care less. Fine Gael is facing the court of public opinion tonight with our proposal to say that we care. We challenge the Government with its born-again commitment to caring to tell us what it intends to do. We want to hear and see the response. We want the Government to take on board the principles of this Bill, if not every comma. People want the Government to take action and they want change, which is something they are not getting. We are prepared to provide change and we ask the Government to take on board our points tonight.I have had two clients in the recent past who went to prison for non-payment of fines. When I asked the first person who had failed to pay her television licence why she was going to prison instead of making arrangements to obtain the money from the credit union, she said simply that she would not pay. While I pointed out that she had a young family, she insisted on going to prison rather than pay the fine. There are people like that who do not listen to anybody and decide that going to prison is the short way out and that they cannot afford to pay. I do not support such people and I think the lady in question should not have gone to prison because her children needed her at home. There should be a mechanism in our legal system to intervene to prevent that from happening.The second case was also very difficult. A person who had committed a driving offence by driving without road tax opted to go to prison rather than pay the substantial sum involved. The man had a mental health problem and would not listen to me, his parents, gardaí or anyone else who tried to advise him. The difficulty was that he had to pay the whole fine and could not settle over a period of time. Deputy Jim O'Keeffe made a critical point about such scenarios. The man in question went to prison despite the fact that nobody wanted him to go. The warrant for his arrest was outstanding for two months before it was executed. The enforcing garda and other members of the community in Drogheda wanted to help him, but he insisted on going to prison. He came to me recently and I asked him what it was like. He told me that he had been in the probation area which is not as strict as full prison and that everyone said he should not have been there. That is the shame and disgrace in our society and, as Deputy Jim O'Keeffe pointed out, that is what we must change. Clearly, the Government has not yet realised that.I turn next to the social issue of families which have split up. I use the term "families" in the broadest possible sense to refer to couples who have split up who have children. In many cases, a court order is made that the person who is working, most often the male, must provide money to support his family. Such arrangements are not made in all cases. Often people come to our constituency offices to say they cannot afford to feed their children or buy school uniforms. Women tell us that they are supposed to receive money from their husbands by order of the District Court, but nothing happens. They do not get the money and the children are not properly looked after. These are the circumstances Deputy Jim O'Keeffe is addressing in this Bill. If an order is made against a person, the money should come out of his or her wages in the way outlined.From my constituency work, I am aware of a case in which a man went to prison rather than support his wife and children from his fund. While the cases I am raising are exceptional, they happen. There is no social justice in a man choosing to go to prison rather than look after his family. The children of the man in question lost out as a result. There are many instances in our society of fathers refusing to take on the obligation to support the children they have fathered. The mother who has serious need of the money does not receive it and the man in question gets off scot free. The mother should be able to apply to the court for an order to have the money deducted from the man's income. Such a mechanism would be fair and just, but we are missing the opportunity to implement it.The Government does not care about this issue and continues to refuse to act. This Bill is before the House to force the Government to think more seriously about these matters and to do more about them. There are other cases to consider. A Member of this House went to prison for non-payment of bin charges, which was a joke and a waste of time. It is a waste for hundreds of people to go to prison for refusing to pay a legitimate charge. Is there not a case for legally imposing payment where a person refuses to pay a reasonable local authority charge? If a person refuses to pay a fair and equitable charge which has been agreed by the Houses of the Oireachtas, it is a waste to send him or her to prison. We should implement attachment of earnings provisions whereby charges due are properly paid over a period of time. What goes on is a disgrace.I draw the attention of the House to the profile of prisoners who go to prison in these circumstances. As Deputy Jim O'Keeffe has said, most of them are very poor and unable to handle money properly. On later Stages, I would like to see consideration of a mechanism of referral to the agencies which offer help with finances, particularly the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, which is absolutely first class at dealing with people who get into financial difficulties. An assessment of income and a person's ability to deal with the issues in question should be made and reported to the court before it makes a decision. The problem with the system is that such an assessment is not done currently. Too many people are being sent to prison, some of whom want to go there to avoid paying their fines, which is a waste of taxpayers' money. These circumstances must end.Deputy Jim O'Keeffe addressed the question of people on income support and social welfare income against whom charges are made. I support the view which has been expressed that one should be very cautious in such circumstances and carry out a proper income assessment. In the United Kingdom, the maximum that can be deducted on a weekly basis from someone on income support is £2.65. We should set a limit beyond which one could not go. The maximum we should deduct from an unemployed single person in receipt of approximately €138 is €1 or €2. However, we should ensure sensitivity in such cases. With a proper co-ordinated cohesive system, with a caring Government and a Minister who acts as well as talks, we will get the action required. The current lack of action makes a mockery of our commitment to a caring society. It is time the Government went about looking after its citizens.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	191	I welcome the opportunity to support this important Bill. As Deputy Jim O'Keeffe stated already no action, other than the preparation of a proposal for Government which was supposed to solve everything, was taken on a similar Bill before the House six years ago. The current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who unfortunately is not here tonight, is an active Minister who informs us of all he intends to do and how quickly he proposes to do it. He has promised to provide 2,000 extra gardaí. Although he has not done so this term he has once again promised to deliver them within the next two and a half years. He also told us today he will provide drug-free prisons by early next year. That is fantastic news. We are all aware that the drug problem in prisons is extremely serious. We on this side of the House will keep the Minister to that promise.Is it right that people on low income who are unable to pay fines or debts are detained in prison alongside druggies, as referred to by the Minister in today's The Irish Times? Is that the right place for a person who cannot afford to pay a fine? As Deputy O’Keeffe said, there are up to 50 people in prison tonight simply because the Oireachtas has failed to provide a system which allows them to pay fines or debts from their income or social welfare payments. Such people are detained in prison at a cost to the State of approximately €220 to €240 per night, in many cases less than the amount owed in fines or debts.The last report on the matter stated the amount outstanding in unpaid fines was €5 million, possibly €10 million today. That money could be of benefit to disabled and other people who are currently unable to obtain care. Some €3.5 million to €4 million was spent on keeping people in prison last year. The State lost through unpaid fines and unnecessary expenditure. Many gardaí are deployed to collect fines. We all know there is a scarcity of gardaí in many areas. Gardaí are involved in transporting to Mountjoy Prison those who cannot pay fines be they from Donegal, Cork or Monaghan. Often such people are taken to prison by taxi.I wish to tell the House of an incident which took place in my constituency. A young man who got himself into many difficulties was unable to deal with life and unable to pay fines against him of approximately €2,000. He could not face the situation and decided it was best to leave the country. However, he could not enjoy life and decided to return and deal with the problem. His family organised a good job for him and a member of his family organised a meeting for him with the credit union which agreed to put his case before the board the following Friday night. However, the gardaí arrived at 7 a.m. on Friday and took him to Mountjoy Prison, where there was no place available for him. That person had agreed to pay his fines by way of credit union loan over a number of years. While the two gardaí involved returned to work by taxi the prison authorities had to provide the young man with the money to make his way home. He thumbed his way home and spent the money in the pub while telling of his great ordeal. That sends out a very poor message and was not helpful to that young man. Had he had to pay his fines by way of attachment of earnings he would have been reminded on a weekly basis of his misdemeanours. I could tell many similar stories of people who believing they could take the same route ended up in other prisons.Much revenue has been lost through uncollected fines and detaining people in prisons. Can we not once and for all deal with this issue? The Bill allows for instalment orders, attachment of earning orders and attachment of welfare orders. The issue of uncollected fines can be dealt with in a simple way. Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, can ensure his colleague, the Minister, does not, for the sake of rhetoric, rubbish this Bill. It is a genuine effort to introduce something positive, realistic and workable. In that context, it should be supported.I wish to refer to two important sections of the Bill. Section 17 allows for the introduction of instalment orders, something which I have sought several times in this House. That provision would allow people to pay their debts by instalments. Many people have begged the Garda to allow them to pay their fine by instalment but the Garda have had to refuse. That is wrong. Giving the person an opportunity to pay his or her debts would be a major step forward. As Deputy O'Dowd said, sometimes people over-react and insist on going to prison rather than pay a fine.Section 14 relates to the attachment to social welfare payments. That is a delicate issue. We are all aware of the level of social welfare payments in 1997 and of what they are today as a result of increases. However, the cost of living has also increased. For instance, a house which cost £70,000 in 1997 costs €300,000 today, an indication of how little use money is nowadays. However, when social welfare recipients are overpaid, be it their fault or that of the Department, an attachment is made to their payment. The precedent of attachment orders to social welfare payments already exists. It is much better to have a person pay unpaid fines or bills by stopping €2 or €5 from his or her payment. It reminds them on a weekly basis that they have done something wrong without costing the State a ransom and without putting these people in jail where they do not belong. I commend the Bill to the House.
#TomParlonPD	unknown-#TomParlonPD-party	unknown-#TomParlonPD-dob	unknown-#TomParlonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	192	I commend Deputy Jim O'Keeffe for introducing in Private Member's time the Enforcement of Court Orders Bill 2004.In 1998, when Deputy Jim Higgins introduced his Enforcement of Court Orders Bill, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy John O'Donoghue, on behalf of the Government, indicated that the approach in the proposed Bill could undermine the existing system for payment of fines, prove vastly and disproportionately expensive to administer, place impossible administrative burdens on both the courts and the Garda and would not make any significant improvement in relation to pressure on prison accommodation. The 2004 Bill is almost identical to the 1998 Bill.In the meantime, the Government has been extremely active in related areas and considerable work has been done or is in hand. There continues to be good and sound reasons essentially the same Private Member's Bill is not acceptable and will be opposed by the Government.The Government's legislative programme, published yesterday, proposes two Bills to deal with fines. The first, a fines Bill, while providing primarily for updating and indexation of fines, will also provide for a mechanism to strengthen the means assessment procedure used by the courts in assessing a person's ability to pay the fine. It will also provide for payment of fines by instalment. The second Bill is an enforcement of fines Bill and is intended to end imprisonment where practicable for inability to pay fines and to provide for new ways of enforcing fines. While examination of the later proposal has not yet concluded, the Minister is of the view that care must be taken to ensure that such proposals are measured and tailored to meet specific circumstances. Otherwise, as with the Deputy's Bill, the potential exists to undermine the entire fines system.The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform intends to bring forward proposals to provide for payment of court imposed fines by instalment and to provide for a stronger means assessment mechanism. While he is considering the introduction of alternative means of enforcing fines, he will do so in the context of the impact of other developments, including the introduction of a facility to pay fines by instalment.With regard to the issue of civil debt, the Minister has consistently maintained that it is not the primary function of either his Department or the Courts Service certainly in terms of personnel and resources, to take on the significant role of operating a debt management service in situations following the granting of enforcement orders against persons who find themselves, for whatever reason, in arrears to banks, finance houses, public utilities etc.The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been involved in an ongoing review of the fines system. As part of that review, his Department commissioned the Nexus Research Co-operative report, entitled Imprisonment for Fine Default and Civil Debt, which was published in 2002. The report examined some of the key issues, such as why people ended up in prison in regard to non-payment of fines or debts. The Minister directed that the report be considered by his officials with a view to drawing up whatever proposals may be necessary for inclusion in the proposed enforcement of fines Bill.It should be noted that the Nexus report dealt in effect only with the issue of fine default. It could not, therefore, provide the basis for developing new policy approaches to the separate and more complicated issue of civil debt or over-indebtedness.The report was based on interviews and the personal circumstances, opinions and experiences of a sample of 24 imprisoned persons who responded to the Nexus request to be interviewed, of whom only two persons, one on principle and the other due to confusion, were imprisoned for refusing to pay a civil debt. It found that almost half of the offenders committed to prisons for fine and civil debt default were for periods of less than ten days. It is noteworthy that 29% of these committals were discharged for various reasons on the same day they were committed. About one third of those had paid or part paid the fine in question. The research also revealed that the vast majority of the committals in respect of fine defaults related to offences under the Road Traffic Act.The Nexus report indicated that persons imprisoned seemed to have limited knowledge of the court process or of the level of their indebtedness. They did not, for the most part, have the capacity to pay the fines imposed, which had to be paid in full. Most of the persons interviewed were not in permanent employment. Only a very small number do not pay fines or debts on a point of principle. The idea of a payment process by instalments as an alternative to prison was broadly attractive, but may be of little real use in light of the financial circumstances involved. Similarly, in the absence of an employer for the majority of the persons surveyed, an attachment of earnings arrangement would not be a real solution. It was considered that an attachment of social welfare benefits would be problematic for people living on or close to the poverty line. The report has helped to inform policy in the context of development of proposals in the Minister's enforcement of fines Bill.Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, in proposing this Bill, is seeking to suggest that somehow criminals are being released from prison, almost willy nilly, to accommodate large numbers of persons who are in fine or civil debt default. This is a total exaggeration with no basis in reality. Let us deal first of all with the numbers of persons on which a court has imposed a prison sentence for fine or civil debt default.Statistics on the number of people in custody for non-payment of fines and debts tend to be used in a way that distorts reality when the implications for prison accommodation are being considered. The latest information provided to me by the Prison Service is that, as of today, out of a total prison population of 3,100, there are 29 persons in custody serving sentences for failure to pay a fine, and eight persons in custody in respect of failure to discharge a debt. This amounts to approximately 1.2% of the prison population, a proportion that has remained roughly constant over the years.The explanation for this is straightforward — the time spent by debt or fine defaulters in custody is generally short and the sentences in these cases are relatively short. In addition, some defaulters make payment either on committal or shortly afterwards. Even if the Deputy's Bill had the effect that no fine or debt defaulter took up prison places in future — and it would be most unlikely to have that effect — the result in terms of prison places freed up would be so minor as to be of little significance. Also, many defaulters are held in open prisons and there is no guarantee that there would be other prisoners in closed institutions suitable for transfer to open centres to take up these places should they become available.While it is recognised that fine and debt defaulters represent only a tiny fraction of our prison population at any given time, the number of committals places an administrative burden on our prison system. Nevertheless, to seek to displace that burden to the Courts Service and the Garda, as the Bill appears to do, is no real solution. While the Minister accepts the general proposition that imprisonment should be a sanction of last resort, it is also clear that it is unsustainable to suggest that this proposed Bill could have substantial positive implications in terms of prison accommodation.Deputy Jim O'Keeffe also raised the issue of costs associated with prison. No one can deny that these costs are quite large. The average cost of keeping an offender in custody in 2003 was €87,950, or €1,691 per week. This cost is calculated by averaging out the current running costs of the prisons and places of detention against the average number of offenders in those institutions. It should be borne in mind that these costs include certain items that are fixed, such as utilities and staff salaries, no matter how many offenders are in custody.The Minister regards the level of costs arising as unsustainable and is actively pursuing the application of more efficient staffing arrangements, particularly those that involve reducing overtime. The Irish Prison Service proposal to reduce overtime substantially holds out the prospect of substantial savings annually and, consequently, the costs of imprisonment would be likewise substantially reduced.The 1990s, in a prison context, were blighted by a persistent high level of overcrowding in our committal institutions that resulted in granting release in an unstructured manner to many offenders at an early stage in their sentences. This situation was in serious danger of undermining the credibility of our whole system of criminal justice as the prison capacity available was totally insufficient to accommodate those sent there from the courts. As a result, almost 20% of prisoners under sentence were out on temporary release. The construction of a large number of prison spaces, particularly with the opening of Cloverhill Prison and the Midlands Prison in recent years has created a situation whereby the Prison Service is now in a much better position to accommodate prisoners for the duration of their sentences.However, with most of our prisons operating at or near full capacity, some accommodation difficulties occur from time to time. It should also be noted that this issue is not simply one of matching the global prisoner population to a global figure for beds or cells. A number of factors have to be taken into account including the prisoner's age, gender, the nature of the offence, location, security and whether he or she is on remand or sentenced.The Minister obtained Government approval in principle to replace the Mountjoy Prison complex with a modern prison facility. He also plans to replace Cork Prison with a new facility on Spike Island to incorporate the existing Fort Mitchel detention centre on the island. The development of the new complexes will present the Irish Prison Service with an excellent opportunity to create facilities which, in terms of custody, care and rehabilitation, will be a considerable advance on the penal and rehabilitation structures in the mainly Victorian facilities of Mountjoy and Cork Prisons, as well as addressing overcrowding difficulties which arise from time to time. In addition, work is ongoing on upgrading facilities at Wheatfield, Cloverhill and Portlaoise Prisons and Loughan House Place of Detention.Any shortage of prison spaces is not as a direct result of the forced mothballing of the places of detention at Fort Mitchel and the Curragh. Overall, these two institutions had a capacity of 204 spaces. The recent opening of a new wing in Limerick Prison has fully offset the loss of Fort Mitchel. This programme of prison building and modernisation evidences the Government's determination that our criminal justice system should have available to it the resources necessary to meet the demands placed on it. I emphasise that this approach is fully consistent with developing appropriate alternatives to custody to the greatest extent possible. As I mentioned earlier, it is not a question of doing one or the other.The Minister agrees that reform is necessary and there are complex issues involved in regard to the issue of fines. It is essential that such reform is tailored to meet the problems which exist and to finding solutions which are fair, effective and efficient. In December 2000, the Comptroller and Auditor General published a value for money audit of the collection of fines based on the year 1998. A high level interdepartmental group, chaired by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, was formed on foot of the report and following the appearance before the Committee of Public Accounts in April 2001 of the Secretary General of that Department. The group, which was representative of the Departments and agencies with a role in fines collection, undertook an in-depth examination of the issues raised in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and submitted a detailed report and recommendations to the Committee of Public Accounts in November 2001. This was considered briefly by that committee in November 2002 when it examined the courts Vote.The reports of both the Comptroller and Auditor General and the high level group noted the impact of the introduction of clamping in reducing the number of fine notices issued for parking violations. Dublin City Council is now reporting a 60% decrease in illegal parking incidents since wheel clamping and towing services were introduced in 1998 to tackle the problem of illegal parking in Dublin. Driver behaviour has also improved since clamping was introduced in 1998. The adverse effect of illegally parked vehicles on traffic movement has been greatly reduced and spaces are now available for short-term parking virtually on demand. The improvement in compliance has enabled the council to increase the maximum parking time from two to three hours.The high level group found that road traffic offences constitute a large percentage of the offences which attract the penalty of fines and that the introduction of a system of administratively imposed cumulative penalty points would have a significant impact on persistent offenders.The Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 facilitates the establishment of a central office of the Courts Service to which applications can be made for the issuing of summonses and from which summonses can be issued. Up to the introduction of this section, applications for a summons had to be made to the District Court office in the District Court district in which jurisdiction in regard to the offence resided. The establishment of the new centralised office does not do away with the issuing of summonses by the local court offices. Rather, the two systems operate side by side. The purpose of the centralised issuing is to facilitate organisational changes to implement the penalty points legislation. It also provides for the application for and the issuing of summonses by electronic means.A major recommendation of the high level group, proposed the establishment of an executive office, under the aegis of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to oversee and manage fines collection policy. Among the issues which such an office could examine would be the possibility of contracting out to the private sector the collection of fines. The establishment of that office remains an objective of the Minister. His Department has advanced as far as possible and in consultation with the other Departments and agencies involved the detailed recommendations made in the report of the high level group to ensure that the necessary improvements in the functioning of the fines system, including in the processes for the effective collection of fines, are being effected on an ongoing basis. These have concentrated on fines for road traffic offences.The Courts Service has taken measures to reduce the time taken to deal with cases and to minimise the delay in issuing warrants following court convictions. The development of IT systems in the courts by the Garda and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is designed to improve the overall delivery of information electronically across their systems, resulting in a reducing likelihood of fines going unenforced due to error or inadvertence. These systems will also greatly improve the level of management information on which to formulate policy.The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is carrying out developments to the national driver file, where penalty points received are recorded, thus adding to the deterrent effect of penalty points.It may be useful to outline the changes happening within the courts in relation to the processing and collection of fines. In recent years the courts have developed and piloted a criminal case tracking system which, among other things, records fines imposed and produces fines notices, reminders and warrants. The roll-out of this system to all District Court offices was recently completed.In 2002, the Courts Service began the development of a new courts accounting system to handle the processing of all court receipts, including fines. The Courts Service has taken a modular approach to implementing this system. Initially, two modules have been implemented which handle family law and minors. The service is looking at other processes, including fines. Based on the experience to date, the service is now of the view that the most effective approach to fines collection is to consolidate it within one main office which will handle all receipts and payments in relation to fines. It is intended to pilot this approach with the fines office in the Dublin Metropolitan District. One of the key factors for the success of this project will be the development of interfaces between the case tracking system and the accounting system.In addition, the Courts Service will look at introducing a range of payment options for fines which will be made available to customers, including payment on the Internet in banks and post offices, by credit and debit cards, by phone using lo-call numbers.There has been a number of reports which made recommendations for legislative proposals in relation to payment and enforcement of fines as well as civil debt. These include the report, in February 2000, of the sub-committee on crime and punishment of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights on alternatives to fines and the use of prisons, relevant reports by the Law Reform Commission in 2002 and 2003 and the already mentioned Nexus report of 2002.A summary of the recommendations from these various reports in regard to fines would conclude that there should be improved means assessment by the courts to ensure fines imposed are within the means of the offenders to pay them, a facility to allow offenders to pay fines by instalment and a means of enforcing fines other than by way of imprisonment.The Minister agrees largely with these conclusions and the legislative proposals which he intends to bring forward will reflect that. He is taking an incremental approach to reform of the fines system because he believes it is necessary to assess and evaluate how different developments affect the overall system. As a first step, the Minister intends to bring to Government the fines Bill in the near future. Although this Bill will be primarily intended to update existing fines and provide a mechanism for indexation, the Minister will also likely include proposals to strengthen the criteria to be used by the courts in assessing the means of the offenders before imposing fines. This provision is fundamental.The reality is that most offenders who do not pay fines have financial difficulties. It is vitally important in the interest of fairness to these people and in the interest of efficiency in the system that fines are set at an affordable level. Yet the Deputy's Bill, focused as it is on procedures, omits such a provision to ensure basic fairness to the less well off in our society. One of the effects of that Bill is that it could use up valuable court resources, resources which should necessarily be available to the more affluent in society.Most importantly, the Minister's proposed fines Bill will also include provisions for the payment of fines by instalment. In respect of the latter, it is the intention that such a payment arrangement will only be available to those who genuinely need it, having regard to their financial circumstances and the amount of the fine imposed. Bearing in mind that more than 110,000 fines are imposed in the District Court annually, if every such fine could attract an instalment order serious administrative problems could arise for the Courts Service. There is no doubt in my mind that those who can afford to pay a fine in one amount should have to do so.The Minister's proposed enforcement of fines Bill, which is also on the Government's legislative programme, aims to end imprisonment as far as practicable for non-payment of fines and provide for new ways to enforce fines. The Minister is actively considering a range of alternative measures but will only introduce such measures when he is satisfied they will improve the efficiency and fairness of the system.

For example, in the United Kingdom, a large range of alternative enforcement options is available to the courts, yet the indications are that it is not used to any great extent. The most workable solutions in that jurisdiction appear to be the facility to pay fines by instalment and extended time to pay. This reflects the fact that doing all that can be done to help people to pay is an essential prerequisite to introducing more wide ranging enforcement measures, particularly as such enforcement measures may have harsh consequences.

The introduction of attachment of earnings and attachment of social welfare contributions without first establishing a fairer procedure for imposition of the fine and its collection raises serious questions.The intention of the Minister is to build on the measures introduced in his fines Bill. This will allow a more accurate assessment of what other measures are required and allow him to take into account the impact of the proposals contained in that Bill. It will also allow for consideration to be given to the effect of other developments, for example, the impact of the increasing number of road traffic offences for which a fixed payment and-or penalty point is provided. I mention this to emphasise the importance of ensuring that measures to improve the situation take account of all dimensions of the operation of the fines system. Alternative means of enforcement of fines must be considered with caution and must be fair, efficient and effective.On the issue of civil debt, the Minister has consistently maintained that it is not the primary function of either his Department or the Courts Service to take on the significant role, certainly in terms of personnel and resources, of operating a debt management service in circumstances following the granting of enforcement orders against persons who find themselves, for whatever reason, in arrears to banks, finance houses, public utilities, etc.The Minister, like all of us, is supportive of any efforts to find alternative non-judicial approaches to the resolution of debt problems. Little reference has been made to the fantastic work being done by the money advice and budgeting service, MABS, of the Department of Social and Family Affairs. MABS provides funding for 52 projects around the country which address the problems of money lending and over-indebtedness. Its programme was established in 1992 as a response to the Combat Poverty Agency's report, Money Lending and Low Income Families. It operates through 52 locally based management committees with funding for staff and other costs being made available by the Department of Social and Family Affairs.The MABS approach, based primarily on the willingness of the debtor to attempt to manage his or her circumstances, offers significant prospects of a successful resolution of the credit problem. MABS has a special relationship with the credit unions, which operate a special accounts system to enable MABS clients to repay debts and save small amounts. A loan guarantee fund also operates to provide crisis loans as an alternative to the moneylender. While MABS projects give advice and assistance, they do not pay debts and are not a source of money. The key elements of MABS are the resources, contacts and expertise of all relevant people in an area who co-operate to provide a special service for people who may require intensive help and advice in working their way out of serious debt. The Government's commitment to MABS is demonstrated by the allocation of funding amounting to some €11.4 million in 2004. More than 12,000 new clients approach MABS annually and the service deals with 30,000 people on an ongoing basis.A pilot debt settlement programme was agreed by MABS and the Irish Bankers' Federation and supported by the other main creditors. This scheme provides a non-judicial alternative for resolving cases of multiple consumer debt which are likely to prove intractable and otherwise end up in court. It introduces a range of innovative features new to this jurisdiction, such as a finite period for an agreed debt repayment programme, the freezing or reduction of interest and the write-off of residual debt on successful completion of the programme. The debtor's principal private residence is secured against enforced sale or repossession. The debt settlement pilot commenced in four MABS offices in the greater Dublin area in June 2002 and was extended countrywide in June 2003.This voluntary approach is significantly more preferable, cost effective and likely to yield a result satisfactory to all involved than seeking to impose on the Courts Service the role of managing a debt collection and recovery process, especially one as cumbersome as that envisaged in the proposed legislation.I hope it will be clear from my contribution that we have doubts about the practicality of much of what is proposed in the Bill. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is aware of, and is addressing, issues of concern and will consider the views expressed during this debate this evening and tomorrow.In contrast to what some speakers would have us believe, we have ended the form of early release from prison known as the revolving door syndrome which, unquestionably, caused considerable difficulty for many years. Having done so, I am convinced we will succeed in bringing crime figures down even further.I accept there are other methods which must be applied to dealing with the issue of non-payment of fines and civil debt, some of which Deputy Jim O'Keeffe mentioned. As I have made clear, the Government is working across a number of initiatives to bring forward real solutions to effectively assist persons in difficult circumstances. It would be wrong of me, however, not to acknowledge that, unfortunately, there are people for whom the ultimate sanction of imprisonment will have to remain as a deterrent available to the courts.

If he needs to travel abroad on important Government business, I will do my best to represent his interests in the constituency.I also congratulate the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, and wish him well.

It will only be 1,000 days to the next general election and I intend to work hard and enjoy every one of them. I understand the Fine Gael Party is targeting me. The Deputy should tell it I am good and ready.Although I wish him well, I will not vote for Deputy O'Keeffe's Bill tomorrow night. I support the points made by the Minister of State, particularly regarding the critical role played by the money advice and budgetary service. This is not only because of the tremendous work MABS does in Tallaght but because of its great work throughout the country. Primarily based on voluntary arrangements, its efforts are best placed to deal with cases of indebtedness, particularly before they reach the critical stage of court orders.As the Minister of State indicated, evidence suggests the banks, finance houses and utility companies are willing to work and co-operate with the efforts of MABS, which is excellent. The Deputy should heckle me on another day because my time is limited. There is considerable satisfaction to be derived from seeing the Irish Bankers' Federation and the Irish Mortgage and Savings Association working jointly with MABS on pilot projects to provide a better method of dealing with defaulting creditors. When fully evaluated, I hope the results of these programmes will validate this approach.In my experience, financial institutions usually favour alternative approaches over seeking a court order. Voluntary arrangements, through MABS or otherwise, for the payment of debt by instalment which result in some, if not all, moneys due being paid are surely the preferred solution. Even Deputy O'Keeffe would agree with that assessment.

However, the examination of some of the evidence available thus far from MABS seems to suggest that some persons in debt are often more reluctant to engage with any process, whether voluntary, mediation or court proceedings, until it is too late. I am not, therefore, convinced that the Courts Service should have a role in managing a debt collection and recovery process, especially one as cumbersome as that envisaged in the Bill.I am sure the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, whom I wish well, would wish to examine court procedures, including changes in rules of court, that would help to streamline court enforcement procedures for both debtors and creditors. Presumably, in civil debt cases the courts might also have recourse to any new suitable financial procedures introduced to help reduce fine default.The two issues of fine default and civil debt are essentially unrelated although they always seem to have been lumped together. Perhaps this is due to a common feeling that imprisonment for them should be a case of last resort or no resort in our justice system. It would be useful if we could separate the issue of civil debt and any sanction that might ultimately be involved when a person cannot or will not repay the cost involved in the provision to him or her of goods and services from the issue of non-payment of fines following the imposition by the court of a sanction in respect of various offences. I will be happy to support the Government amendment tomorrow night. I wish Deputy Jim O'Keeffe well and remind Deputy Broughan that I am enjoying my day.

I suppose the recent debate was about the priority of elections and the fact that the general election, by definition, must be the number one priority upon which everybody must focus, particularly those in smaller parties.I am deputising for my colleague, Deputy Costello, who has a prior engagement. On behalf of the Labour Party, I warmly welcome efforts made by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe by way of the Enforcement of Court Orders Bill to address some of the most serious issues in our judicial system and the range of sanctions available to courts. As Deputy O'Keeffe said, a serious issue is that up to 50 people who have failed to pay fines imposed by court order are imprisoned daily. It is appropriate that this Bill is a typically thoughtful production by one of our most able parliamentarians.The imprisonment of citizens for not paying fines and debt is almost characteristic of the behaviour of the 18th and 19th centuries. It is important that this is addressed. Deputy Jim O'Keeffe can take credit for the fact that the Minister has made clear tonight that the payment by instalment system will be introduced. This is a great and very welcome step forward. Deputy Jim O'Keeffe introduced the concept over five years ago to bring us into line with many other common law jurisdictions.It must be said, however, that the Government has been less than generous in its response to this Bill, as has been the case regarding other Opposition Bills. I, like the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and others, am very familiar with the great distress citizens often feel when they have to call to see fines officers in Garda stations. Such citizens may have accumulated fines, often because of the late payment of television licences and the failure to meet other obligations to State agencies, for example. It is welcome that this Bill attempts to introduce a methodology to address this.The Labour Party has grave difficulty with section 17, which pertains to the attachment of social welfare payments. Deputy Jim O'Keeffe and I were social welfare spokespersons for our parties for three and a half or four years. A common refrain of both of us throughout that period concerned the low level of social welfare payment. Even the basic level today, €134, is such that even a fine of €127 — the old £100 fine — would represent a great percentage of the weekly earnings of somebody on assistance.Consider the legislation of our colleagues in the UK, namely, SI 1407 of 2004, the Fines Collection Amendment Regulations of 2004, and SI 176 of 2004, which provides tables of periodical deductions from earnings. Certain basic payments, such as disability benefit and maternity benefit and certain social welfare payments or benefits are absolutely excluded. The tables indicate clearly what can be taken from a citizen. In the table listing deductions from weekly earnings, I note that if net earnings do not exceed £55, the percentage deductions rate is 0%. If they are between £55 and £100, the rate is 3%, and if they are between £100 and £135 the rate is 5% etc. Other jurisdictions, particularly the UK, have obviously thought very carefully about this as a result of having had many problems in this area. The Labour Party feels that it would like Deputy Jim O'Keeffe to re-examine this area. If the Minister accepted the Bill this evening, this would need to be teased out very carefully on the next Stage.I am a little alarmed that the Minister, Deputy McDowell, would be the person with an input into or the ability to determine the levels those on welfare would have to pay, perhaps through regulation. As my party leader stated this evening, although Deputy McDowell is Minister for equality, he is effectively the Minister who believes inequality is good for us.Many social welfare recipients are on household budgets, as Deputy Jim O'Keeffe stated. MABS was rightly praised a few minutes ago but the household budget system should be considered in this regard. Deputy Jim O'Keeffe and I made a contribution to the discussion on this over the past decade. The net payments people receive are often very low and very difficult to survive on, even with a graduated instalment system. We have some doubts about this matter.When the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, was a leader of the farming community, the notorious petition system existed whereby citizens used to go to Deputies and ask them to postpone their fines. A considerable part of the work of this House in respect of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform involved the postponement of fines for as long as possible until those concerned could get the money together to pay them.I have often noticed that some almost prefer to do time in prison than to pay a fine. It is tragic that anyone would be imprisoned for not purchasing a television licence, for example, but sometimes a woman in this position might prefer to go to the women's prison in Mountjoy to do a few hours. Deputy Jim O'Keeffe is correct in saying that it is scandalous that the mother of a family should be placed in this horrendous position.I reviewed some of the literature surrounding Deputy O' Keeffe's Bill and discussed some of the issues in it with the Labour Party senior legal adviser. It appears there is a general problem regarding fines, to which the Law Reform Commission referred, especially the impact of fines. The Minister has indicated that the levels of fines will be reviewed. For many citizens, particularly for those on low incomes, a few hundred euro is a very heavy imposition. For other citizens, this is a derisory amount, perhaps the cost of a meal in a few hotels down the road. Much thought needs to be given to the impact of fines. If we want to see fines working and people deterred from going to prison in the first place, this Bill will allow us do that.The current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and his party have participated in Government over the last seven years, when the income gap between the top and bottom 20% of society was never as wide. My party and the Government parties had a little contretemps this afternoon regarding poverty levels in this State. The reality is that the lowest income deciles of our society find life in this economy very difficult. It is an aspect of the Bill which probably needs some further research, including a major review of fines and the structure and level of sanctions.All of this tends to refer to employees and people on social welfare income. What about the large section of society that is self-employed? We need the appropriate level of sanction in that area as well. Fines per se can be quite inegalitarian and that is an area that has to be kept under review. Deputy O’Keeffe has set out a system whereby employers would have a role in attachments regarding fines. They already have a role in other attachments, so this would be an additional group. There might be complaints that this would lead to further bureaucracy. On the positive side, the system exists in a range of other areas.In general terms, I welcome the effort to produce this Bill. It makes very little sense to detain fine defaulters in prison, thereby increasing the cost to the State through the expense of housing them in prison. My Fine Gael colleague referred to debtors being put into prison with criminals who are serving serious criminal sentences for very serious crimes against society.Prison should be the last resort for those who have incurred this sort of fine under court orders. Prison is for the most serious offenders and the most recalcitrant criminals in society. We would like to see section 14 of the Bill changed, which obliges payments from those in receipt of social welfare.The Bill is concerned with two categories of people who end up in prison, namely fine defaulters and civil debtors. I want to concentrate on those imprisoned in default of payment of a fine. Strictly speaking, this should be a very small category within the prison population. As a matter of first principle, a sentencing court should first consider whether a fine rather than a prison sentence is adequate to meet the seriousness of the case. Since the District Court deals only with cases that are, by definition, minor, a fine should be appropriate. The court should then consider whether the accused has the means to pay the fine it proposes to impose. If not, the court should reduce or waive that fine. It is constitutionally impermissible to impose a prison sentence where a fine would be appropriate simply because the accused does not have the means to pay a fine. Given that this is clear and established law, why do we have so many fine defaulters sentenced to our prisons?It is common enough for a court to impose a fine of a few hundred euro on an individual, with provision for, say, seven days in default of payment. It is difficult to know what sort of assessment is carried out by most courts as to the means of defendants before such sentences are imposed. There is a dearth of research in Ireland on fines imposed by the courts generally and the same deficiency arises when trying to ascertain the extent of the inquiry made by District Court judges into an offender's financial circumstances when determining the amount of a fine to be imposed. The Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights in its 2000 report on alternatives to fines and uses of prison recommended a full means inquiry in every case where a financial penalty is being considered in order to ensure that fines are explicitly tailored to the defendant's ability to pay. I would welcome if the Minister took that route. I commend Deputy O' Keeffe, who has spurred us to start down this road.The report on imprisonment for fine default and civil debt, commissioned by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, concluded that inquiries in the court process about offenders' means and capacity to pay fines would appear to be non-existent or at best cursory. The current system is clearly not working effectively given the high level of imprisonment for default of payment of fines, the rate of which was 35% in 1993.As the explanatory memorandum points out, a recent examination conducted by the Comptroller and Auditor General into the efficiency of the fines system regarding cases within the jurisdiction of the District Court sheds important light on some of the issues. The report on value for money examination on the collection of money for fines notes that the ultimate objective of the fines system is to reduce the level of offences committed by deterring undesirable behaviour. Having examined the available data on legal proceedings in Dublin District Court cases in 1998, the report found that fines were imposed in half of the 57,100 summons cases actually heard. Overall, the average fine imposed by the Dublin District Courts was €127, varying considerably between different types of offences. Average fines imposed in fine cases in Dublin in 1998 were as follows: €84 for parking offences, €151 for disc offences, €86 for speeding offences, €123 for other motoring offences and €212 for other criminal offences. These figures raise questions as to the extent to which these fines adequately effect the aims of criminal law, namely to make an impact on offenders.More than 95% of all criminal offences are tried summarily in the District Court. It performs the essential task of disposing of very large numbers of minor offences, without the checks, balances and safeguards that surround trial on indictment before a jury in the higher courts. The subject of maximum fines permissible in the District Court has attracted less attention than does that of the maximum sentence of imprisonment. The District Court punishes offenders by fining in the great majority of cases. The level of fine is rarely such as to give rise to any question of the limit of fine which might be constitutionally permissible.In practice, the Legislature, or those who draft its Bills, appear to operate a general District Court fine limit of €3,000. The working group on the jurisdiction of the courts believes this limit is much too low. The Law Reform Commission seems to agree and a general limit of €10,000 is suggested. If this is introduced, there will be far greater significance attached to the question of what to do with those in default of such substantial fines. It is clear that a fine of the same amount will affect different defendants differently, having regard to their means. In its report on penalties for minor offences, the Law Reform Commission discussed whether the means of the accused were a relevant factor in assessing whether the penalty was appropriate to a minor offence.While a fine of €127 may have quite some severe financial implications for an unemployed offender, it is unlikely to impact on those with much higher incomes. This brings us to the law as regards equality of impact in fining as it currently stands. There should be some provision for means adjustment in the District Court. Section 43 of the Criminal Justice (Administration) Act 1924 provided that a court of summary jurisdiction fixing the amount of any fine to be imposed on an offender shall take into consideration, among other things, the means of the offender. It is a long-established common law rule that fines should not be increased for the better-off. The Law Reform Commission has suggested that the principle of equality of impact, which the Labour Party believes should be the key theme of the new fines legislation, requires that fines should be adjusted to reflect the means of offenders to ensure that fines will be felt by offenders, whatever their wealth. According to the commission, this common sense approach requires that fines be increased for those who are better-off. I welcome the commendable construction of this Bill.

However, while significant progress was made on Strand I, II and III issues, it was not possible to conclude agreement on these at Leeds Castle.After the Leeds Castle talks, all of the parties, supported by Secretary of State Paul Murphy and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Tom Kitt, engaged further on these issues. We wish to draw these discussions to a successful conclusion as soon as possible.The Governments believe that what is on offer from the republican movement is reasonable in its substance and historic in its meaning and we are determined to move ahead. On the one hand, there must be the complete end to violence in all its forms. On the other, there must be a genuine, lasting and stable commitment to power-sharing. If agreement cannot be reached between the parties, when it is clear it should be, we have said that we will find a different way to move this process forward.

Those outside the authority's remit include, for example, perfumes, cosmetics, other personal hygiene products and pesticides.The Health and Safety Authority's role relating to exposure to aerosol chemicals arises under EU originated legislation on the marketing and use and classification, packaging and labelling of certain dangerous substances and preparations. This legislation bans or restricts the use of certain agents and, in other cases, requires that the product be labelled with appropriate risk and safety phrases, for example, to draw the user's attention to the fact that it may cause sensitisation and gives advice as to its use in a safe manner.In the industrial or workplace context, any exposure of workers to aerosol chemicals that may arise in the course of work would be subject to risk assessment and the application of appropriate prevention or control measures, including, if relevant, the application of occupational exposure limit values, OELVs, but not tolerance levels, under relevant legislation.Neither my Department nor the Health and Safety Authority has any role in relation to aerosol chemical tolerance levels in general in the atmosphere. In addition, neither party has any information on any research being undertaken as regards allergies to atmospheric pollutants.I understand that, apart from the Health and Safety Authority, other Departments or agencies such as the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Agriculture and Food would also have roles in this matter. I also understand from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government that Directive 2004/42/EC on the limitation of emissions of volatile organic compounds, VOC, due to the use of organic solvents in certain paints and varnishes and vehicle refinishing products, and amending Directive 1999/13/EC, set maximum VOC content limit values for prescribed products in these particular areas. Article 9 of the directive invites the European Commission to submit a report by 2008 at latest to the European Parliament and to the Council examining, inter alia, the broad scope and potential for making reductions in the VOC content of products outside the scope of the directive including aerosols for paints and varnishes.

The plant ceased production at the end of July with the loss of 167 jobs.According to the company, this decision was based on economic factors and the continuing downturn in the printing market, in particular, the technical publications sector. The company states that this has resulted in an unsustainable operation and the company is taking action to de-invest in this sector.FÁS has previously been in contact with the company and made its full range of support services available to the workers. These supports include skills analysis, job placement, guidance and counselling interviews, identification of training needs and suitable training courses. I am advised that, already, some 40% of the workplace has found alternative employment. In addition, IDA is currently examining alternative possibilities for the site.

During the six weeks period either party concerned may appeal on a point of law to the Circuit Court. At the end of the six weeks period, if the employer has failed to implement the award, the District Court-Circuit Court, on application by the employee concerned, i.e. the employee may decide to pursue a determination from the Employment Appeals Tribunal privately; any trade union, with the consent of the employee, as a member; or the Minister, if the Minister considers it appropriate to make the application having regard to all the circumstances, may make an order directing the employer to carry out the determination in accordance with its terms.The Deputy should be aware also that where an employee requests the legal services unit of my Department to make application to the court to have a determination enforced, other difficulties may arise, such as the employer, as a company, is no longer a legal entity, in which circumstance it is not possible for the employer to be made the subject of legal proceedings; the employer, as a company, is in receivership or liquidation; proof that a copy of the determination was served on the employer cannot be offered in court; or legal searches that have been carried out show that the employer has no discernible assets.Currently, the legal services unit of my Department has 80 cases on hand which relate to EAT determinations. Thirty of these have been referred to the Chief State Solicitor's office to institute legal proceedings — proceedings are heard in the county where the employer resides. A further four are the subject of instalment orders. The remainder are in preparation for referral to the Chief State Solicitor's office or are cases in which further inquiries are in train.

The legislation places a duty on employers to safeguard the health and safety of their employees. Work activities must also be carried out by the employer in a manner which will not affect the health and safety of others at the workplace. The health and safety of students in full-time education is not covered by the 1989 Act but would be covered by the employer's duty of care to non-employees.The monitoring and inspection of workplaces is a day to day matter for the authority in which I have no direct function. However, I am informed that authority inspectors inspected 19 primary schools and 12 secondary schools in the period 1 January to 10 September 2004, which resulted in a total of 35 visits.These inspections would have reviewed workplace conditions for teachers and ancillary staff and monitored conditions for other workers such as those involved in construction or maintenance work, removal of asbestos containing material etc.The Health and Safety Authority, in accordance with the provisions of section 45 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989 relating to restrictions on the disclosure of information, does not publish details of the names and addresses of workplaces inspected by it.

I take it the Deputy is seeking information on IDA supported jobs created in each of the years from 1997 to 2003 and to date in 2004.The attached table outlines the number of IDA Ireland supported jobs created in County Kerry from 1997 to 2003, inclusive. This data is compiled from the annual Forfás employment survey. County data for 2004 will not be available until mid-2005.IDA Ireland is actively promoting County Kerry to potential investors via its network of overseas offices and project divisions with every effort being made to secure new investments for the area. In addition to targeting potential new projects, IDA Ireland continues to work with the existing base of companies in the region with a view to supporting such companies with potential expansions and diversification of activities. In this respect, two of the existing companies in the county had announcements in April 2004: Dollinger (Ireland) Limited, present in Killarney for over 20 years, is to become the global centre for production for its compressed air products range. Dollinger Ireland will have global responsibility for the development of this particular product. This €1.1 million investment will create over 70 new jobs over the next four years and has resulted in Dollinger relocating to larger premises on the IDA Ireland Business Park in the town; and Liebherr Container Cranes Limited, which has been in Killarney for 46 years, is to recruit six highly skilled R&D personnel for a new R&D specialised team. The team, which will be of strategic importance to the parent company and will enhance the facility's role as the centre of control for Liebherr's container crane products, will develop products from concept through to product launch. In addition, any intellectual property, IP, developed will be the property of the Irish company.To continue to improve the attractiveness of Kerry as a location for inward investment, IDA Ireland completed site development works in 2003 on its business and technology park at Tiernaboul, Killarney, County Kerry. The site area totals 4.66 hectares, approximately 12 acres. In addition, a local group of business people under the BES scheme have completed a new building of 14,716 square feet on a site acquired from IDA on the park and the agency is actively marketing this facility as an alternative property solution to present to potential investors.In Tralee, IDA Ireland is actively marketing Shannon Development's 35-acre Kerry Technology Park, which is adjacent to the Institute of Technology, ITT, and offers high quality office accommodation in a suitable environment for ICT, software and international services sectors.County Kerry1997199819992000200120022003No. of Companies232425232232223Employment1,8591,9362,1962,6462,9612,4442,505New Jobs16017734654337415382

All time worked on CE after this date is taken into account by FÁS when determining an individual's eligibility for the programme. This change was introduced to discourage repeated participation in CE and to encourage unemployed persons to avail of training-education options where possible, which are shown to have more successful progression outcomes for individuals.The three year cap was amended in August 2001 to allow a limited number of particularly disadvantaged persons to remain on the programme for a further period. FÁS considers participants for such an extension if on reaching the end of their normal entitlements on CE they are likely to experience difficulty in getting employment. A number of CE participants have difficulty in progressing to open labour market employment due to their age, literacy or numeracy problems or a lack of suitable jobs available locally.The terms of participation on CE are under continuing review. In this regard, senior officials in my Department are currently examining submissions received from the social partners in response to a Government consultation paper on the future of active labour market programmes. I intend to meet with the social partner representatives in the near future to discuss their responses.The outcome of this process will be taken into account by the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion, which will consider the matter further.

Since the Square D closure announcement in January 2003, there have been 12 site visits to Ballinasloe. FÁS continues to participate with other State agencies in helping people to find suitable employment in the Ballinasloe area.The construction of a second advance technology building is also under way at the IDA Ireland Business and Technology Park in Ballinasloe and completion is expected before mid-2005. In addition, a site has been provided by IDA to the ESB for the construction of a 38KV station to satisfy the electricity needs of new projects locating on the park. I understand that ESB is currently out to tender for the construction of this station.IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are actively working with existing base of companies in the county and the Ballinasloe area to encourage them to grow and expand. IDA Ireland and other State agencies continue to actively participate in locally generated marketing initiatives.Enterprise Ireland is providing support for the appointment of a manager for Ballinasloe Enterprise Centre as well as supporting a one year training programme for entrepreneurs in nearby institutes of technology under the enterprise platform programme, as part of encouraging high potential start-up companies in the region.In the area of telecommunications, Galway County Council and the State development agencies are currently finalising a proposal for submission to the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources for the development of broadband infrastructure.The major decentralisation package announced in the budget includes 110 jobs to be relocated to Ballinasloe. This move demonstrates the Government's commitment to balanced regional development and will provide a further boost to enterprise development in this area.The State development agencies are fully committed to ensuring an equal distribution of job creation opportunities and to encouraging the establishment of industry in the regions, in particular, the Border, midlands and west, BMW, region, of which Ballinasloe is an integral part.I can assure the Deputy that the State development agencies, under the auspices of my Department, will continue to work closely together and with local interests in promoting Ballinasloe for additional investment and job creation.

I understand that IDA Ireland is also at an advanced stage of negotiations with a potential small/medium sized client for one of the advance technology buildings on the Athlone Business and Technology Park.Alienware Corporation's official opening of its European Operations Centre in Athlone in September 2003 creating 80 jobs was a welcome development, as was the announcement in October 2003 that Mapics Incorporated would establish a technical support and shared services centre in Athlone, creating 55 new jobs. Both companies have commenced operations in Athlone.Enterprise Ireland infrastructural projects include the community enterprise centres and incubation facilities in the colleges. A prime example of this approach is their extensive involvement with the Athlone Institute of Technology. Currently under construction is the new Midlands Regional Innovation Centre at the Athlone Institute of Technology. This 8,000 sq. ft. centre is expected to be completed in December 2004. The centre was approved grant assistance of €2.54 million by Enterprise Ireland in recognition that increased innovation and start-ups, particularly in the high tech sectors, are vital to the future growth of Athlone and the Midlands. In addition, Enterprise Ireland works closely with the institutes of technology to encourageindustry-third level partnerships in the region.The major decentralisation package announced in the budget includes 145 jobs to be relocated to Athlone.

However, the cannery activity survived and continues to employ approximately 100 people.No grant aid has been returned to Enterprise Ireland, EI, to date. Discussions are ongoing between EI and the company to determine the level of liability. While certain activities have been discontinued, the cannery operation has been retained and is being further developed with new added value products which have the potential to significantly increase sales from the Roosky facility.In ongoing discussions with the company, Enterprise Ireland, the agency charged with responsibility for the development of indigenous industry, has reiterated its objective to preserve and develop activities on the site. In addition, EI is also promoting the site and its capabilities to a number of independent promoters. However, no definitive proposals have emerged as yet.As regards alternative employment, EI announced in July 2003 that it had provided assistance to Vistamed Limited in Roosky, which should lead to the creation of 30 jobs in the company. In nearby Longford, the recent announcement of a 600 person operation by Abbott Diagnostics, with support from IDA Ireland, is a significant boost to providing job opportunities. In Carrick-on-Shannon, MBNA have increased employment to more than 1000 people over the last three years, thereby providing further job opportunities for the area.The State agencies, including the County Enterprise Board, will continue to promote the region for further investment and job creation.

The management of IDA Ireland's industrial property portfolio is a day-to-day operational matter for the agency and not one in which I have a direct function.I understand from IDA Ireland that the lease on the factory commenced on 2 January 1983 and is due to cease on 1 January 2018, a period of 35 years. Under the terms of the lease, rent reviews are due to take place every five years and following the last rent review on 2 January 2003 the current rent is now €160,450.57 per annum.IDA Ireland is continuing to market the building for suitable inward investment and to Enterprise Ireland supported companies. IDA Ireland continues to evaluate all proposals for the use of the building against the need to have buildings available for inward investment and Enterprise Ireland supported companies.I am confident that the policies and strategies being pursued by IDA Ireland in relation to the management of its property portfolio are properly focused and will hopefully result in attracting additional overseas investment and jobs for the people of Ballinrobe.

Ultimately decisions regarding where to locate a project are taken by the overseas investors.At present there are 19 IDA Ireland assisted companies in County Louth, employing approximately 2,339 people; 11 of these companies are located in Dundalk, seven in Drogheda and one in Ardee. Recent developments include ABB in Dundalk, which has provided 40 additional jobs in its manufacturing operation during 2003 and is now embarking on a major expansion of its research and development and marketing functions which will see the creation of a further 115 jobs, mainly for graduates, and Finmatica Trademark Limited which has begun the process of locating in a 3,000 sq. ft. section of the Science Services Centre in Finnabair Business Park in Dundalk, with projected employment of 60 within three years.In an effort to further enhance the attractiveness of the county to overseas investors, IDA has recently developed a new 63-acre flagship business and technology park in Drogheda. Planning permission has also been obtained to upgrade the Finnabair Business Park in Dundalk to flagship park standard, and 35 acres are available for development there. In addition, IDA is actively promoting its strategic site at Mullagharlin, Dundalk.Enterprise Ireland works with companies in its portfolio in County Louth to assist them grow their sales and exports and improve innovation in order that they can compete on world markets. The agency is encouraging companies to adopt new technologies to add value to their products and services. To this end Enterprise Ireland has approved financial support of over €5.2 million to companies in County Louth since the beginning of 2002. This support enables companies to fund their plans for innovation and new product development.In addition, Enterprise Ireland supports the Dundalk Institute of Technology, DIT, to foster links with industry thereby encouraging industry to increase its use of technology. Under the Enterprise Ireland innovation partnership and research funding programme, Enterprise Ireland has, since 2003, approved over €470,000 in funding to the DIT for research projects with industry.Enterprise Ireland has supported the development of a business incubation space at DIT. In May 2004 the agency approved a further €0.414 million of capital support for the development of phase 4 of the regional development centre at the college. This is in addition to capital support of €1.97 million and €76,000 towards the cost of a centre manager which was approved in February 2002.As part of the community enterprise centre programme which encourages local enterprise, Enterprise Ireland has provided funding for enterprise centres in both Drogheda and Ardee. It is expected that the first four units of the Drogheda enterprise centre will be completed in November 2004, and completion of the Ardee enterprise centre is expected in January 2005.I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued by both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, will continue to bear fruit in terms of delivering the maximum possible level of additional jobs for County Louth, including the towns of Dundalk, Drogheda and Ardee.

A number of smaller units are available at Donore Business Park in Drogheda.The main focus of IDA's targeted business is now on the services sector where office accommodation is the normal requirement. A quality office building comprising 27,000 sq. ft. at Donore Road, Drogheda, was completed in August 2004 by a private developer, and this is now being actively marketed by IDA Ireland for potential inward investment.IDA Ireland has planning permission for more than 150,000 sq. ft. of office space at its new IDA Ireland Drogheda and Business Technology Park. Although located approximately 100 metres inside the boundary of County Meath, this park, which comprises 63 acres, has undergone a €5 million development. The park, which is a flagship development, will be the main catalyst for attracting inward investment to Drogheda. IDA Ireland hopes to tender for the provision of the first buildings on the park over the coming months. IDA Ireland also has planning permission for a 25,000 sq. ft. advance technology building on the park.In Dundalk, Finnabair Business Park is currently being upgraded by IDA Ireland in a €5 million investment programme to bring it to flagship standard. Planning permission is in place for three 30,000 sq. ft. office buildings and two 25,000 sq. ft. advance technology buildings. As in Drogheda, a similar tendering programme for the construction of the first of these buildings is about to be undertaken.IDA Ireland has recently secured planning permission for two smaller units on Finnabair Business Park. These units will be located in an area of the park where master planning has been undertaken for up to seven more units, all comprising approximately 7,000 sq. ft.IDA Ireland's plans are augmented by similar proposals from the private sector to provide marketable space in the town. In addition to the above, approximately 12,000 sq. ft. of marketable space is available at Blackthorn Business Park which can cater for activities from light manufacturing to office accommodation. A total of 2,000 sq. ft. of quality office space is available in the Sciences Services Centre on Finnabair Business Park.IDA Ireland is also actively marketing the vacant 160,000 sq. ft. of available space at the Xerox campus in Dundalk and the 120,000 sq. ft. available in the former Tellabs in Drogheda.

It was praised, in particular, for the amount and quality of information it contained.In December 2003, as part of the Department's commitment to continuous improvement and quality customer service, the information resource unit commissioned a redesign and enhancement of the Department's website bringing the website further in line with industry standards for accessibility and usability. The new site is completely user-centric and is based on popular themes rather than divisional structures. The website is now more accessible to all users, including people with disabilities. Other new features of the website include an improved search engine and syndicated press releases.The provision of timely and accurate information on the website is a departmental priority. To this end, there are 35 website content controllers in my Department with responsibility for regularly updating website content for their business units' areas of responsibility.

Tallaght in south County Dublin continues to be actively marketed by IDA Ireland to potential investors and is well equipped to compete with other areas for potential foreign direct investment, with a third level institute, Tallaght Institute of Technology, and superb infrastructural facilities at Citywest and Grange Castle.A number of companies in the electronics, internationally traded services and software sectors such as AOL, GE Interlogix, UPS, and SAP have established operations in the Tallaght-Citywest area and will continue to grow in line with projections.The Japanese pharmaceuticals project, Takeda Chemical Industries, which announced its major new investment in Ireland, has begun construction in Grange Castle, Clondalkin. The plant will employ over 60 people upon completion. Also in Grange Castle, Wyeth Biopharma has approximately 700 highly skilled people already employed at the facility. The Government approved support for this major investment, which will create 1,300 jobs by the year 2005. Companies that have availed of IDA Ireland incentives include Loctite in Tallaght, which has established a state of the art R&D facility, and Sage and Xilinx in Citywest.Enterprise Ireland works with companies in the south Dublin region to assist them grow their sales and exports and improve innovation in order that they can compete on world markets. The number of people employed in Enterprise Ireland companies in the region, which includes Tallaght, has increased from 9,797 in 1998 to almost 11,000 today.Enterprise Ireland works closely with the Institute of Technology in Tallaght in encouraging the commercialisation of research and has supported the development of business incubation space at the college to the amount of €2.54 million. In August 2004, the institute signed an agreement with Enterprise Ireland to commence construction of a campus incubator facility. This facility when completed will generate quality start up enterprises emanating from college research.In addition, as part of the community enterprise centre programme which encourages local enterprise, Enterprise Ireland provided grant assistance to the four community enterprise centres in Tallaght, namely Main Road, Bolbrook, Brookfield and Killinarden.The South Dublin County Enterprise Board is actively involved in supporting the creation of enterprises employing ten people or less in the Tallaght area. The board provides supports such as financial grants, advice and enterprise training to those establishing or expanding their business. In the current year, an additional €125,270 has been approved to seven Tallaght-based clients with a potential of 25 additional new jobs. Amongst the priority categories identified by the South Dublin Enterprise Board are the unemployed, and promoters from disadvantaged areas in Tallaght and Clondalkin.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	241	The figure of 11.2% increase shown in the recent report of the National Competitiveness Council, NCC, in respect of non-life insurance premia in Ireland relates to the year 2003. The insurance reform programme was launched in October 2002. Spiralling motorcar insurance premia costs hit a peak with an index of 108.0 in March 2003, and since then the index has dropped to 92.8 in August of this year, according to the Central Statistics Office monthly indices — based mid-December 2001 — which is a decrease of 15.2 index points or 14.07%.Data obtained by the MIAB in its quarterly surveys shows significant decreases in motor insurance premia over the past 12 months. For example, the data provided by MIAB for three specific companies between March 2003 and March 2004, indicates the following reductions: 10% to 15.6% in comprehensive insurance for a 30 year old male; 10% to 41% in comprehensive insurance for a 50 year old female; and, 10% to 44.6% for third party, fire and theft insurance for a 21 year old male.Anecdotal evidence supplied by representative groups suggests that liability premia are also falling.In addition, there has been an improvement in the functioning of the Irish insurance market. The Irish Insurance Federation, IIF, recently revealed that the 20 non-life insurance companies operating in the Irish market made a combined operating profit of €747 million in 2003. While insurers profitability has led to reductions in insurance premia it also enhances the attractiveness of the market to prospective new entrants.A number of new entrants in the motor and liability areas are now authorised to operate on a freedom of services basis in Ireland and a number of companies have applied for authorisation to locate in Ireland.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	242	I understand that employees based in Belfast, who are deferred pensioners of the Richardsons pension fund, are likely to receive a much reduced pension and that the staff in question are, understandably, very aggrieved about this position.The specific financial position of the Richardsons fund appears to have arisen primarily from a combination of the statutory rules which currently apply on the winding up of a pension fund in the UK and a shortfall in the assets of the Belfast fund compared with its liabilities as a result of the fund trustees' investment strategy coupled with a significant fall in the equities market.I understand that the UK government has announced proposals to deal with the issue of pension shortfalls arising from insolvencies but I am not aware of the impact, if any, this may have on the shortfall in the Richardsons' scheme. In addition, I understand that the trustees of the Richardsons scheme have submitted a claim to the liquidator of IFI, though the status of this claim has not yet been established.While I have the utmost sympathy for the plight of the members affected by the shortfall that has arisen in the scheme, I am satisfied that the Irish Government does not have any obligations in respect of the shortfall which the pension scheme faces and I do not see any basis on which we could reasonably be expected to make good the shortfall involved.Without any legal obligation to do so, the shareholders jointly funded €24.5 million in ex gratia severance payments to the former IFI employees. These payments were distributed to the employees on the basis determined by the trustee appointed to manage the funds. The approach adopted by the trustee was endorsed by a ballot open to all employees. The cost of the ex gratia scheme borne by the shareholders was on top of the loss of their equity investment in IFI and the write-off of €34.5 million in loans to the company.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	243	I understand that the pension schemes covering all employees in the Republic, apart from a scheme covering two former CEOs, had sufficient funds to meet all of the entitlements provided under the scheme but that there was not sufficient funds to pay some discretionary benefits that employees had hoped to receive. I have only very limited information available about the scheme covering the former CEOs but I understand that this may have been significantly underfunded.As regards the Richardsons pension scheme, which covered the employees based in Belfast, I understand that the scheme currently believes that it will only be able to pay active members, that is the employees still working at the time the company ceased operations, less than half their entitlements under the scheme. However, the UK Government recently announced proposals to deal with the issue of pension shortfalls arising from insolvencies but I am not aware of the impact, if any, this may have on the shortfall in the Richardsons scheme. In addition, I understand that the trustees of the Richardsons scheme have submitted a claim to the liquidator of IFI, though the status of this claim has not yet been established. Until these and other issues are determined it is not possible to precisely quantify the shortfall involved.I understand that the liquidation is progressing in an orderly and efficient manner and that considerable progress has been made in relation to the realisation of the company's assets. However, while the company's principle properties at Arklow and Marino Point, Cork, have been placed on the market, I am advised that it may take some time to sell them.I also understand that most of the company's obligations to secured creditors have now been settled while payments to preferred creditors, which would include some amounts due to former employees, have been or are in the course of being made. Unfortunately, it is unlikely that any payments will be made to unsecured creditors, including trade creditors, until the main property assets are sold, which I understand could take some time. At this stage, I am not in a position to determine the prospective level of payment to unsecured creditors.

Following a review of community employment a decision was made by Government that community employment drugs related schemes would be ring-fenced and maintained at 957 participants nationally. These places have been maintained to this number.Community employment supervisors have received drugs awareness training and this programme is being provided to all supervisors.Currently a review of all aspects of community employment in relation to drugs related projects is being completed and will be presented to the drugs task force for consideration and appropriate action.Only one application was received under the social economy scheme in relation to a drugs project. This application was successful and the project started on 9 December 2002. The sponsors, Merchants Quay, did not consider social economy as a suitable progression option for their clients and the project closed on 2 April 2004 following major difficulties recruiting suitable participants.However, FÁS will assist the work being undertaken by the sponsor by providing three participants on community employment.

He was the only person executed, as a number of other capital sentences were subsequently commuted.His father was granted a dependant's allowance under the Connaught Rangers (Pensions) Act 1936 until his own death in 1943.His body was repatriated to Ireland from India and was re-interred at Glasnevin in 1970. The remains of two other Connaught Rangers, who had been killed in the course of the mutiny, were also repatriated and re-interred at the time.A memorial was erected in Glasnevin cemetery in 1949. The great personal courage and conviction of those involved in the events in India in 1920 has always been freely acknowledged.

It is a basic requirement of the special beef premium scheme that all animals are held for the regulatory two month retention period and applicants are advised, in writing, in respect of each application lodged when the particular retention period expires and the first date on which animals may be sold. In this case the first date on which these animals could be sold was 19 April 2004.Following computer validation of this application it transpired that one animal applied on was sold on 17 April 2004, before expiry of the regulatory two month retention period, and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the scheme the animal in question must be rejected, namely no premium will be paid in respect of this animal and a reduction penalty applied to the premium in respect of the other animals concerned.However, in support of an appeal to the Agriculture Appeals Office the person named has supplied medical evidence showing that at that time normal farming duties were prevented by illness. Accordingly, rather than being rejected the animal in question will be deleted from the application and counted for stocking density purposes, which means that while no payment will issue, as the animal was not retained for the regulatory retention period, no further penalty will apply. Therefore, the person named will receive full payment in respect of the five animals which fully complied with the scheme's terms and conditions.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	257	The Forest Service operates a dedicated pre-approval authorisation procedure for the aerial application of fertiliser to forest sites. As part of the approval procedure, the Forest Service consults with relevant statutory agencies and recommendations from these bodies are made a condition of any approval issued.The authorisation procedure is supported by on the spot policing and inspections by the Forest Service inspectorate and strict adherence to the forestry and aerial fertilisation guidelines is mandatory. These guidelines clearly detail the comprehensive operational obligations on landowners, machine operators, pilots and managers.The Forest Service developed the forestry and aerial fertilisation guidelines through extensive consultation with a wide range of relevant parties including statutory agencies, stakeholders and academia. The guidelines, cover all aspects of aerial fertilisation including site suitability, fertiliser rates and types, weather conditions, soil suitability, the application process, consultation, flight paths, slope, storage areas for fertiliser, helicopter equipment, supervision and timing of operation. Most importantly, the guidelines clearly identify unsuitable sites such as those with inadequate drainage systems and those prone to water logging. It should also be added that 100 metre exclusion zones apply to points of abstraction of all drinking water and reservoirs and that 50 metre exclusion zones apply to all aquatic zones, namely all permanent or seasonal rivers, streams or lakes shown on Ordnance Survey 6 inch maps. Operational measures applying to helicopter operators include the recording of flight paths using a suitable global positioning system, or GPS, and a requirement that the hopper or bucket must be closed when flying over aquatic zones.Any incidents of pollution as a direct result of aerial fertilisation may be dealt with by local authorities, regional fishery boards and the Environmental Protection Agency under relevant legislation.Helicopters are currently the only method approved for the aerial application of fertiliser in Irish forests.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	258	I am aware of the decision by the Austrian Government to introduce a ban on battery chicken farming.The current EU rules for the protection of laying hens, including those in battery cages, are set out in EU Council Directive No. 1999/74/EC, which have been transposed into national law by way of the European Communities (Welfare of Laying Hens) Regulations, 2002 (SI 98 of 2002). These regulations provide for minimum standards for the protection of laying hens and specify the accommodation and other welfare requirements for their keeping and rearing. The directive, which I supported during Council discussions, significantly improves the welfare of laying hens throughout the EU and will in particular prohibit conventional battery cages from 2012. This deadline is generally in line with a vote of the European Parliament on battery cages and has been welcomed by the animal welfare interests. It is my intention that the approach to this issue in Ireland will continue to reflect broad consensus at EU level, as reflected by the directive, rather than the particular perspective of any single member state.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	259	To underpin the financial stability of the sector, my Department operates a range of measures including market supports and direct payments aimed at supporting farm incomes. In 1990 direct payments accounted for 23% of aggregate farm income; since the CAP reform in 1992, direct payments to farmers have risen, and by the late 1990s they accounted for 50% of aggregate farm income. In 2003 direct payments of €1.6 billion contributed almost 75% of aggregate farm income. I have vigorously pursued the goal of supporting farm incomes by maximising the level of direct payments to farmers, ensuring that the EU Commission utilises all available management tools to support the markets and by providing the best possible development framework for the sector.Last year there was an improvement in farm incomes with aggregate farm income as calculated by the Central Statistics Office rising by 2.6% to €2,174.8 million. Average family farm income in 2003 was estimated to be €15,054 by the National Farm Survey; although this varies significantly depending on the size and enterprise mix on farms and whether the farms are full-time or part-time. Full-time farms, defined in terms of labour requirements, had an average farm income €29,000 an increase of 4.6%.

Under the Musk Rats Act, 1933 (Application to Mink) Order 1965, the keeping of mink is prohibited except under licence from the Department of Agriculture and Food. Licences are issued under this legislation only if the applicant, following an inspection, is found to be compliant with a number of key conditions.Licensed fur farms are also inspected to assess compliance with the Council of Europe recommendations concerning fur animals and Council Directive 98/58/EC concerning the protection of animals kept for farming purposes. These inspections have to date found that the licensed fur farms have been operating in compliance with current legislation. Inspections have also found that the slaughter methods employed by the licensed fur farms are permitted under the Sixth Schedule of the European Communities (Protection of Animals at Time of Slaughter) Regulations, 1995.Fur Farming is considered to be a legitimate farming activity throughout the greater majority of member states of the European Union.Given that the licensed fur farms operating in this country meet current national and EU requirements there is no reason why what is after all a legitimate farming activity, which is permitted in the greater majority of EU member states, should be banned.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	275	The person named having been notified that the circumstances outlined by him do not satisfy the criteria for force majeure-exceptional circumstances under Article 40 of Council Regulation (EC) No. 1782/2003, submitted an appeal to the independent single payment appeals committee.Following a full examination of the circumstances outlined in the appeal the single payment appeals committee made a recommendation and a letter issued to the person named on 24 August 2004. The findings of the appeals committee were that the original decision taken by my Department should be upheld.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	276	The person named, having been notified that the circumstances outlined by him did not satisfy the criteria for force majeure-exceptional circumstances under Article 40 of Council Regulation (EC) No. 1782/2003, appealed this decision.The independent single payment appeals committee will examine the circumstances outlined in the appeal, and a decision will issue shortly to the named person.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	277	Under EU regulations 2003 extensification premium may only be paid where the stocking density of a holding does not exceed 1.80 livestock units per hectare.Since the stocking density of the holding in this case was 1.8589 livestock units per hectare, the person named was not considered for payment.The person named was a joint herd owner. As no case was made to the effect that the other joint herd owner was ill, the illness of the person named cannot be accepted as justifying force majeure in this case, since the other joint herd owner was in a position to manage the herd in order to keep under the stocking density.Also, the medical evidence provided in respect of the person named would not appear to justify force majeure.

On 13 May 2004, outstanding documentation, namely an electrical certificate, was requested from the contractor who carried out the construction of the slatted shed. The applicant was also advised that this certificate was required. When this documentation is received, processing of the application for payment will commence.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	280	A final decision in this case issued directly to the persons named on 17 May 2004. They were advised of their right to appeal the decision to the Agriculture Appeals Office, which is statutorily independent of my Department. I understand they have done so, as the appeals office has asked my Department for clarification on certain matters which the persons named have raised with it.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	281	The application received from the person named was incomplete and my Department requested further documentation on 16 September.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	283	My Department conveyed its decision directly to the person named on 12 May 2004. He has since sought to have the matter reviewed by the Agriculture Appeals Office, which is statutorily independent of my Department.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	284	My Department's website was completely upgraded and revised in 2003 making it more streamlined and accessible to a wider public, including those with disabilities. The Department has worked with a combination of web content accessibility guidelines, WCAG, published by the Web Accessibility Initiative, WAI, and with accessibility experts to create and maintain the site to be as accessible as possible to all users.It is the responsibility of each division of my Department to maintain accurate and up to date information on the website in relation to its own area of work. Editing and publishing that material on the website is the responsibility of one officer in corporate affairs division and two webmaster staff of information systems division. The website provides a facility for comments on content and technical issues.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	285	In February last I announced the outcome of a review by my Department which concluded that a number of changes would be appropriate to give effect to the Irish Medicines Board report on intramammaries and also to take account of developments since the original legislation was put in place. Having considered a number of points made by stakeholders in subsequent exchanges with my Department, it is my intention to proceed, following the requisite consultation with the animal remedies consultative committee, to finalise the amendments to be made to the present legislation.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	286	It is the policy of my Department to ensure that all interview boards of two or more members are gender balanced.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	287	The person named has been notified that the circumstances outlined by him did not satisfy the criteria for force majeure-exceptional circumstances under Article 40 of Council Regulation (EC) No. 1782/2003, as the illness of his father dated back to 1977.Following this decision the person named submitted an appeal, the full circumstances of which will be examined by the independent single payment appeals committee. The decision in respect of this appeal will be issued shortly to the named person.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	288	The rate of pension payable under the 1994 scheme of early retirement from farming is the maximum provided for by the EU Council regulation under which the scheme was introduced. The regulation does not provide for indexation of payments.My Department's proposals for the current early retirement scheme, which commenced on 27 November 2000 and is one of the measures in the CAP rural development plan for the period 2000-06, included provision for annual increases in pension over the period of the plan. The European Commission rejected this proposal and insisted on legal grounds that a fixed rate be set instead.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	289	The person named will not be penalised on the double as penalties, due to late area aid applications, applied to eligible animals or eligible areas under the direct payment schemes will not be applied in perpetuity in respect of the single payment scheme. As a result each case, where such penalties were applied, will be examined individually by my Department.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	290	The person named has been notified that the circumstances outlined by him do not satisfy the criteria for force majeure-exceptional circumstance under Article 40 of Council Regulation (EC) No. 1782/2003. The person named has been advised that he can appeal my Department’s decision to the independent single payment appeals committee.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	291	The person named has been notified that the circumstances outlined by him, that is, non-eligibility for extensification premium in 2002, do not satisfy the criteria for force majeure-exceptional circumstances under Article 40 of Council Regulation (EC) No. 1782/2003.Having been notified of this decision the person named submitted an appeal to the independent single payment appeals committee. Following a full examination of the circumstances outlined in this appeal a decision will be issue shortly to the person named.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	292	The person named applied for consideration of force majeure-exceptional circumstances on 9 January 2004 on medical grounds and following examination of the circumstances he was deemed ineligible for force majeure. However, arrangements have been made to re-examine the circumstances put forward and my Department will contact the person named with a result of this review as soon as possible.The person named subsequently submitted an application for consideration as a new entrant to farming during the reference period. Following initial processing of this application he was requested to submit additional documentation, this documentation has now been received in my Department and a final decision will issue shortly to the person named.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	293	The person named included a parcel of land on his 2003 area aid application that was also claimed by another herdowner. The area aid unit is awaiting legal documentation from the person named that shows his entitlement to the land parcel and his 2003 area aid application cannot be fully processed until this matter is resolved.Under the 2003 EU special beef premium scheme the person named lodged one application in respect of 17 animals. One animal was deleted from this application as it was too young to be included for special beef premium and payment is delayed on the remaining 16 animals due to the area aid problem.In relation to the 2003 extensification premium, the position is that eligibility cannot be determined until the 2003 area aid problem is resolved.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	294	The reason the person named did not receive a provisional entitlement statement is that there was a change of ownership during the reference period.My Department will examine the details of the case and issue a provisional entitlement statement as soon as possible.

However, I understand that the second instalment grant has not been claimed in respect of this plantation. Payment of the annual forestry premium cannot be released until payment of this second instalment grant has been claimed and approved.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	296	No legislation has been drafted for my Department by solicitors outside the office of the parliamentary counsel in the Attorney General's office.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	297	The location of the proposed new laboratory in Macroom was a decision of the Cabinet sub-committee on decentralisation and is part of the Government's overall decentralisation plan. While my Department is in the process of preparing detailed accommodation briefs no formal plans regarding dates etc. can be made at this stage. The central decentralisation implementation group will report to the Cabinet sub-committee in the autumn outlining its views on sequencing and timing of decentralisation.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	298	I have no plans to hold a commission of inquiry into the decentralisation programme. Immediately after the Government announcement of the programme an implementation group, chaired by Mr. Phil Flynn, was appointed to drive forward implementation of the programme. This group has issued two reports to date. I can confirm that the Government has no plans to postpone the programme and is fully committed to its implementation as soon as possible.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	299	I am informed by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government that new buildings commenced since 1 June 1992 must, by law, comply with mandatory thermal performance and insulation standards under Part L of building regulations made by that Minister. I am also informed that the relevant standards are periodically updated and are now among the highest in the EU. The EU directive on the energy performance of buildings, 2002/91/EC of 16 December 2002, requires that, no later than 1 January 2009, all new buildings, and all existing buildings when offered for sale or letting, must be accompanied by an energy performance certificate. A low energy performance rating is expected to impact on the marketability of the property involved, depending on overall market conditions. This is expected to provide some incentive for landlords and vendors to improve the energy performance of buildings before placing them on the market.In these circumstances, I do not see the need to introduce a stamp duty incentive which could be quite complex to operate in practice if it were implemented. Stamp duty is a very efficient tax from the point of view of administrative costs, and such complex proposals would run counter to the current administration of the tax.

A revised sketch scheme is being finalised at present, which aims to maximise the full development potential of the proposed station site.
#TomParlonPD	unknown-#TomParlonPD-party	unknown-#TomParlonPD-dob	unknown-#TomParlonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	301	Maynooth Castle was open to the public on a staffed basis daily from 6 June 2004 to 26 September 2004 inclusive, a total of 119 days. During that time a total of 1,353 people visited the site, which is an average of 14 per day.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	302	The most recent developments regarding the decentralisation programme include the publication of the second report of the decentralisation implementation group on 31 July 2004 and the publication of the central applications facility data on 17 September 2004. Both of these documents are available on the Department of Finance website, www.finance.gov,ie. The central applications facility data contain information on the number of applications and expressions of interest received by the central applications facility up to 7 September 2004, the deadline for priority applications.It has been clear from the outset that the programme is an entirely voluntary one and there will be no redundancies. Those persons not wishing to relocate outside Dublin will be offered alternative public service jobs in Dublin.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	303	I propose to take Questions Nos. 280 and 286 together.I am aware of the concerns expressed by a number of commentators in relation to the continued increase in credit growth, particularly in the household sector, and the possible effects of increasing indebtedness upon borrowers.Credit developments are a matter for the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland, taking into account its role as a part of the European system of central banks and its functions, as the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, in relation to the prudential supervision of financial institutions and the protection of the consumers of those firms.The provision of consumer credit in Ireland is effectively regulated by the Consumer Credit Act 1995. The Consumer Credit Act 1995, which is administered by the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, obliges credit providers to include specific information in all credit agreements in relation to such matters as the total cost of credit, the amount of each repayment instalment, the number of instalments, etc. Additionally, in the case of housing loans, the Act specifically obliges mortgage providers to inform borrowers of the effect on the amount of their repayment instalments of a 1% increase in interest rates in the first year of their mortgages. The purpose of obliging credit providers to provide this information is to ensure that consumers when making credit decisions are armed with the fullest possible information in relation to any credit agreement they are entering into and most importantly the impact that servicing a loan will have on the consumer's household budget.In addition to the aforementioned requirements of the Consumer Credit Act 1995, the Central Bank and the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority have sought to raise the level of awareness of both borrowers and lenders of the importance of prudent borrowing and responsible lending. The financial services regulator with its statutory consumer mandate has developed a number of specific initiatives to help consumers make informed choices in terms of the financial products they choose, the amount of risk they take on and the cost of financial products. These initiatives have been developed through the framework of the financial services regulator's It's Your Money campaign and have involved publishing consumer guides on credit products, fact sheets, cost surveys on personal loans, all of which are intended to assist borrowers in making the most appropriate credit decisions given their circumstances.In addition to responsible borrowing initiatives outlined above, the financial services regulator, together with the Central Bank, undertook a recent study into mortgage lending and mortgage lending practices. Arising from the study, mortgage lenders were requested to review their practices in relation to customer income verification and the funding of mortgage balances so as to ensure that not only were loans properly secured but also that borrowers would be able to fully repay their loans. Additionally, lenders were advised of the need to stress test every would–be borrower's ability to meet their credit obligations, particularly mortgage credit, not just in the current economically favourable circumstances but also in more challenging times.Responsible use of credit clearly can have advantages for borrowers in terms of their lifestyles, etc. On the other hand, it is very important that loans fully suit borrowers' requirements both in terms of amount borrowed and ability to repay. This is equally important for lenders as inappropriate lending-borrowing can also be damaging to the economy. I, therefore, fully support the Central Bank and the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority in their endeavours to raise the level of awareness of the risks of reckless credit growth to all economic agents, particularly consumers and lenders.

Negotiations between the OPW and Limerick City Council are ongoing in relation to the price of the lands adjacent to the Model school. The Commissioners of Public Works are currently awaiting a response from Limerick City Council to their latest offer for the property.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	305	Stamp duty exists on various financial cards in order to provide Exchequer revenue. The stamp duty on cheques, bills of exchange and promissory notes has existed for many years and when electronic means of money transfers, such as credit cards, ATM cards and laser cards were subsequently introduced, stamp duty was gradually extended to these products to ensure that the stamp duty from cheques etc, were not eroded.The current annual rates of stamp duty are as follows: credit card account and charge card, €40; ATM card without a laser function, €10; laser card without an ATM function, €10; combined ATM and laser card, €20.There is no stamp duty payable in respect of ATM cards issued in respect of deposit accounts where the average daily balance on that account is less than €12.70.Stamp duties on credit cards and ATM cards are significant contributors to the Exchequer and help to fund public services, such as health and education, and are in accordance with the overall taxation policy of widening the tax base in order to keep direct tax rates low, thereby helping job creation. In 2003 the stamp duty on credit cards, ATM cards and other cash cards issued by financial institutions contributed €84.31 million to the Exchequer.If an exemption was introduced for one group of people such as students, there would be demands for similar treatment for others, and accordingly, there are no plans to introduce exemptions from stamp duty on such cards for any category of individual.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	306	The Deputy appears to be referring to the use of bogus non-resident accounts to evade tax. This matter has been dealt with extensively and thoroughly in the special inquiry by the Committee of Public Accounts into this matter in 1998 and subsequently. I do not propose to add anything to its findings. As a result of the work of that committee and action in the Finance Act 1999, in particular, substantial sums of money have been recovered by the State by way of tax, interest and penalties. That sum to date comes to about €775 million.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	307	In July 2002 the Government issued its debt relief strategy, Policy on Developing Country Debt, which was prepared jointly by my Department and Ireland Aid, now called Development Co-operation Ireland. This forms the basis of our policy on the total cancellation of the debt of the world's poorest countries.The Government has advocated this policy on debt relief in discussions, both at political and senior official level, with the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, IMF, Ministers from Heavily Indebted Poor Countries, HIPC, a number of our EU partners and in other fora.While the Government advocates debt cancellation, it does so in the context of the availability of resources and the competing claims on the resources available to the international financial institutions. Total cancellation would have to be funded largely through additional donor contributions. To mobilise such necessary funds for total debt cancellation, a greater number of donors, particularly the larger economies, would have to increase their overseas development aid, ODA, more rapidly and take concrete steps to meet the UN target of 0.7% of GNP for ODA.In the spring 2004 meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, acting as chairman of the EU Council of Economic and Finance Ministers, I urged all creditors and donors, that had not yet done so, to provide their share of bilateral debt relief and multilateral financing to the HIPC initiative. My Department, in close co-ordination with the Department of Foreign Affairs, will continue to promote our views on debt relief in all relevant international fora.

These factors included: the need to achieve a fit with the national spatial strategy, in terms of the gateways, hubs and their respective catchments; the location of existing decentralised offices; the desirability of clustering a Department's decentralised units within a region; the importance of respecting the scale and character of locations in terms of their capacity to absorb the number of new jobs involved; the existence of good transport links by road, rail and-or air; and, the general infrastructural capacity in the areas selected.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	309	I propose to take Questions Nos. 287and 312 together.There are no such specific proposals at present in this area. As the Deputy knows, all tax issues are a matter for the budget. The core objective of Government policy in the area of child support is to provide assistance which will offer real choice to parents and which will benefit all children. In that context, our policy has been to increase child benefit by substantial amounts as the main fiscal instrument through which support will be provided to parents with dependent children. Child benefit provides assistance to all parents in whatever caring choices are most appropriate for them and their children. In addition, unlike tax relief, it provides support to parents irrespective of their income status.We have also undertaken measures to favour the supply of child care by tax incentives to set up facilities and relief from BIK taxation for free or subsidised child care provided by employers. Child care fees are also exempted from VAT. Taken together these represent substantial measures to assist with the cost of child care.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	310	The position is that the maximum amount of qualifying fees allowable under the scheme is determined by the Minister for Education and Science, with the consent of the Minister for Finance. It is currently €3,175 per year and has remained at that level since tax relief on third level fees was introduced in 1995 for full-time undergraduates in approved private third level colleges in Ireland. Adjusted for inflation generally, this amount would be €4,200.Any proposal to increase the amount of qualifying fees allowable for the purposes of tax relief would, in the first instance, be a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey.

I have arranged to have a copy forwarded to the Deputy. I had the opportunity to present copies of the report to representatives of the IFA at a meeting on 24 September. Copies will now be distributed to all the other stakeholders who contributed to its completion and-or who were consulted in its preparation. The report is comprehensive and very detailed and I would expect that all stakeholders will require sometime to consider its recommendations.

It formed part of a composite submission on behalf of a number of local authorities made by the County and City Managers Association, CCMA, to the national flood policy review group.The question of funding for work on flood prone roads is a matter for either the relevant local authority, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government or the National Roads Authority, depending on the classification of the road in question.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	313	The general position in the case of legally enforceable maintenance agreements in this jurisdiction is that the spouse who pays the maintenance is entitled to a tax deduction for payments made for the benefit of the other spouse; the maintenance payments are taxed in the hands of the receiving spouse; and the couple are treated for tax purposes as if unmarried. However, a separated couple may, except where a civil annulment has been obtained, jointly elect to be treated for tax purposes as if the separation had not taken place provided they are both resident in the State and, if divorced, neither have remarried.When such an election is made, the maintenance payments are ignored for tax purposes — the payer does not receive a tax deduction for them and the receiving spouse is not taxable on them.Where the receiving spouse has income other than the maintenance, separate assessment will apply in respect of that income. The Revenue Commissioners' information leaflet IT2, Taxation of Married Couples, which is available on the Revenue website at www.revenue.ie, sets out how separate assessment works. In the case of non-legally binding maintenance payments, such payments are not taxable in the hands of the receiving spouse and the paying spouse cannot claim a tax deduction for them. However, the paying spouse would be entitled to the married person’s tax credit if he or she is wholly or mainly maintaining the other spouse.I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the most recent data relating to the short tax ‘year' 2001 indicates that there were 4,800 cases where maintenance payments were made under legally enforceable maintenance agreements in that tax year. The aggregate value of the maintenance payments under those agreements amounted to €24.5 million. On a 12 month basis, this equates to €33 million approximately. After making adjustment for the proportion of recipients who would not be liable for tax, the tax liability attaching to the €33 million is of the order of €7 million. Taking account of incomes growth in the intervening period, this would amount to about €8 million in 2004.The general position in United Kingdom income tax rules, which apply in Northern Ireland, in relation to maintenance arrangements entered into after 15 March 1988 is that income which is used for maintenance payments is taxed in the hands of the person making them, in effect by denying him or her a tax deduction. The payments are not chargeable to tax in the recipient's hands.It is important to note that in the arrangements which apply in Ireland and in the United Kingdom, there is a common underlying principle in place that income — in the form of the maintenance payments — should be subject to taxation. Under the general arrangements which apply in this country, the payments are taxed in the hands of the recipient. In the United Kingdom, the general position is that they are taxed in the hands of the person who makes them. In this jurisdiction as mentioned above, the option exists in certain circumstances of tax treatment as if a separation had not taken place. While this may result in no tax being paid by the recipient spouse, it also means that the paying spouse receives no deduction, thus ensuring that the income is subject to taxation.If the general position in this country in relation to legally enforceable separation agreements were to be altered in order that the payer rather than the recipient were to be subject to tax on the amount of the maintenance, such a move would benefit recipients but the position of those who are required to make such payments would disimprove. If maintenance payments were not subject to taxation in the hands of either the recipient or the payer this would breach the principle that income should be subject to taxation. Accordingly, there are no proposals to abolish or alter the present arrangements regarding the taxation of maintenance payments which have been in place since June 1983.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	314	There are no proposals to abolish or alter the present arrangements regarding the taxation of maintenance payments which have been in place since June 1983.The general position in the case of legally enforceable maintenance agreements in this jurisdiction is that the spouse who pays the maintenance is entitled to a tax deduction for payments made for the benefit of the other spouse; the maintenance payments are taxed in the hands of the receiving spouse; and the couple are treated for tax purposes as if unmarried.However, a separated couple may, except where a civil annulment has been obtained, jointly elect to be treated for tax purposes as if the separation had not taken place provided they are both resident in the State and, if divorced, neither have remarried. When such an election is made, then the maintenance payments are ignored for tax purposes — the payer does not receive a tax deduction for them and the receiving spouse is not taxable on them. Where the receiving spouse has income other than the maintenance, separate assessment will apply in respect of that income. The Revenue Commissioners' information leaflet IT2 — Taxation of Married Couples, which is available on the Revenue website at www.revenue.ie, sets out how separate assessment works.In the case of non-legally binding maintenance payments, such payments are not taxable in the hands of the receiving spouse and the paying spouse cannot claim a tax deduction for them. However, the paying spouse would be entitled to the married person's tax credit if he or she is wholly or mainly maintaining the other spouse.The general position in United Kingdom income tax rules, which apply in Northern Ireland, in relation to maintenance arrangements entered into after 15 March 1988 is that income which is used for maintenance payments is taxed in the hands of the person making them, in effect by denying him or her a tax deduction. The payments are not chargeable to tax in the recipient's hands.It is important to note that in the arrangements which apply in Ireland and in the United Kingdom, there is a common underlying principle in place that income, in the form of the maintenance payments, should be subject to taxation. Under the general arrangements which apply in this country, the payments are taxed in the hands of the recipient. In the United Kingdom, the general position is that they are taxed in the hands of the person who makes them. The option in certain circumstances of tax treatment as if a separation had not taken place which is mentioned above may result in no tax being paid by the recipient spouse but it also means that the paying spouse receives no deduction, thus ensuring that the income is subject to taxation.If the general position in this country in relation to legally enforceable separation agreements were to be altered so that the payer rather than the recipient were to be subject to tax on the amount of the maintenance, such a move would benefit recipients but the position of those who are required to make such payments would disimprove. If maintenance payments were not subject to the taxation in the hands of either the recipient or the payer, this would breach the principle that income should be subject to taxation.Based on information from the Revenue Commissioners relating to the short tax ‘year' 2001, it is estimated that tax amounting to about €8 million annually is collected in respect of maintenance payments received under legally enforceable maintenance agreements.I have difficulty with the suggestion in the document which accompanied the Deputy's question that income tax on maintenance payments received should be charged at no more than the standard rate. As you are aware, over the last seven years the Government has made great progress in reducing the tax burden for all categories of income earner and there is no reason why income in the form of maintenance payments should be treated any differently from any other form of income. Such an approach would be inconsistent with the general thrust of Government income tax policy in recent years which has been to have lower tax rates but applied across a wide base.

The group examined all aspects of the scheme including the qualifying medical criteria. The report was published on my Department's website in early July and copies have been made available in the Oireachtas library.The Government has agreed that the Minister for Finance will consider the report on an ongoing basis in the overall budgetary context having regard to the existing and prospective cost of the scheme.

Further work on the drafting was required subsequent to the barrister's submission of a completed draft. The barrister in question was engaged in line with the Government policy that outsourcing of the transposition of EU directives could be considered favourably, in order to ensure the transposition of directives which were outstanding prior to the commencement of the Irish Presidency. There is no legislation being drafted on behalf of my Department by firms of solicitors outside the Office of the Attorney General. I currently have no plans for outsourcing of legislative work to private legal firms. It is not the general policy to engage legal firms outside of the Office of the Attorney General in the drafting of legislation.However, a number of situations have arisen in the past where particular circumstances required the use of outside legal assistance, in particular during the development of draft heads of Bills. Since 2001, for example, external legal advisers were appointed, following a competitive tendering process, to carry out research for and otherwise assist my Department in relation to the establishment of a single financial regulator, including drafting the heads of a Bill. The view of the Office of the Attorney General was sought before the tender process was commenced, and that office confirmed that it had no objection to the proposal to appoint legal advisers.As Deputies will be aware, heads of a Bill are submitted in the normal course through the Attorney General to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel so that the Bill may be drafted. It was on the basis of heads produced with the assistance of external legal expertise that the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel drafted the relevant legislation which eventually became the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2003.The drafting during 2002 of heads for the unclaimed life assurance policies legislation subsequently enacted in 2003 also benefited from external legal assistance. This too was sought only after consultation with the Office of the Attorney General. I should say that in this case an invoice for €60,500 was paid in late 2002, which related to work done during 2002, including the period of 2002 prior to June of that year.

The presence of asbestos materials were confirmed in the flue pipe and rope seals in the boiler house. The removal of the asbestos materials in this area was carried out in 2002.The presence of asbestos materials was also confirmed in the ceiling tiles in three classrooms, toilet areas, an office area and nine toilet cisterns. These removal/replacement works were completed in 2004.Chrysotile asbestos cement confirmed between the brick and ridge cap on the gables still remains. In accordance with normal practice and as recommended by the specialist consultant this will be addressed if, and when, any structural works are planned that would be likely to cause disturbance.

Each one will be considered in the context of the forthcoming budget.The Deputy will be aware that there is already a significant level of investment by Government in disability specific services through a number of Departments. At the moment, some €2.5 billion, representing 7% of gross current public expenditure on services, is provided specifically for people with disabilities. This includes health sector services specifically for persons with an intellectual disability or autism, physical or sensory disabilities and mental illness; first and second level special needs education funded through the Department of Education and Science; the specialised training and employment support services provided by FÁS, the cost of various tax relief schemes; and local authority spending to adapt accommodation specifically for people with disabilities. These figures do not take account of the income support and other services provided through the Department of Social and Family Affairs or the fact that many people with a disability participate in, or benefit from, mainstream public service programmes and services. For example, speech and language therapy, physiotherapy and other similar key services for people with a disability are provided as part of the mainstream health services. Similarly, improving access to public transport services for persons with mobility and sensory impairments is an integral requirement of all Exchequer funded new investment in buses, rolling stock and station infrastructure.The Deputy will, of course, also be aware that the Disability Bill was recently published and was accompanied by an announcement of new funding arrangements for capital and current spending on disability support services. On the capital front, a multi-annual capital investment programme for disability-specific services will be developed within the overall system of five-year multi-annual capital envelopes that was introduced in budget 2004. This was a major change in the treatment of capital spending. It provided for a rolling investment programme and a structured and planned approach to capital spending. These envelopes will be reviewed and rolled forward in the forthcoming Estimates and budget process. Decisions in relation to the investment programme for disability-specific services will be announced as part of that process.On the current side, the Government has decided on a fundamentally different approach to current funding for high priority disability support services. In contrast to the traditional year-to-year basis, a multi-annual funding package for current expenditure on these services will be agreed within the Estimates and budget process. This is the first time that Government has adopted this approach in the case of spending on services. This new approach shows the Government's commitment to funding for disability support services and overall to implementing the initiatives announced with the publication of the Disability Bill.

The exemption is only available to individuals who are resident here for tax purposes.Section 195 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, formerly section 2 of the Finance Act 1969, allows the Revenue Commissioners to make a determination, under guidelines drawn up by the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, and the Arts Council, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, that certain works are original and creative, and generally recognised as having cultural or artistic merit. Earnings derived from such works are exempt from income tax.Under the terms of section 195, the Revenue Commissioners can make determinations in respect of works in the following categories: (a) book or other writing; (b) a play; (c) a musical composition; (d) a painting or other like picture; and (e) a sculpture.Thatched roofs are not listed as a specified category within section 195 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and therefore, the artists exemption is not currently available to thatchers. There are no plans at present to include thatched roofs in the artists exemption scheme as suggested by the Deputy.

The Valuation Act 2001 maintained the long-standing position that commercial facilities, including child care facilities such as play schools, pre-schools, crèches and Montessori schools, are liable for rates. Exceptions to this key principle would quickly be followed by demands for similar treatment from the providers of other useful services and products, which would be difficult in equity to resist. The process could thus substantially reduce local authority revenues, which would have to be made good by imposing corresponding increases on the remaining ratepayers.The rateable valuation of commercial property is based on net annual value, that is the rental value of the property. Any ratepayer dissatisfied with the rateability of a property, the valuation assessed on a particular property or the method of calculation can appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation in the first instance and subsequently to the independent valuation tribunal. There is a further right of appeal to the High Court and ultimately to the Supreme Court on a point of law.The core objective of Government policy in the area of child support is to provide assistance which will offer real choice to parents and which will benefit all children. In that context, our policy has been to increase child benefit by substantial amounts as the main fiscal instrument through which support will be provided to parents with dependant children. Child benefit provides assistance to all parents in whatever caring choices are most appropriate for them and their children. In addition, unlike tax relief, it provides support to parents irrespective of their income status.We have also undertaken measures to favour the supply of childcare by tax incentives to set up facilities, relief from VAT and relief from BIK for free or subsidised child care provided by employers. Taken together these represent substantial measures to assist with the cost of child care.My colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has overall responsibility for the formulation of national policy on child care. In that context, the establishment of the €449 million equal opportunities child care programme 2000-06, EOCP, with funding provided by the European Union and the Exchequer under the NDP, aims to increase the supply of centre based child care places by 50%, or about 28,400, by programme end.

This measure is implemented by Area Development Management-Combat Poverty Agency on behalf of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. I understand that all of the funding available under this measure is now committed.I realise that this project is extremely valuable in developing community infrastructure but regrettably, there is no further funding available under this measure this year. This is because PEACE II is due to end in 2004.However, because of the valuable work this project and other PEACE II-ventures are doing, Ireland and the United Kingdom are seeking a two -year extension to PEACE II for 2005 and 2006. The proposal received the support of the European Council on 18 June last and will require a Commission decision and ratification by the European Parliament by the end of the year.If this extension is granted, it is expected that the measure, from which this project was funded, will be retained as both member states realise the importance of capacity-building in rural areas. Therefore, this project should be able to apply for further funding in 2005 and 2006.

I also indicated that further pension changes benefiting both serving and new entrant public servants, along lines originally recommended by the Commission on Public Service Pensions, were being considered. The recent announcement, to which the Deputy refers, provides for changes to take place in a number of key areas of public service pension delivery. The changes form another significant element in the modernisation and reform of the public service.I also announced that a number of other recommendations of the Commission on Public Service Pensions are under active consideration, including the establishment of joint management-union working groups to consider the recommendations on SPEARS (a single AVC-type scheme for the public service) and proposed revisions to the spouses' and children's pensions schemes, including benefits for non-spousal partners.The information set out below provides additional information of the most recent changes and gives examples where applicable.Cost-neutral early retirement: This facility will allow public servants to retire early with actuarially reduced superannuation benefits. Workers whose current minimum pension age is 60 will be able to avail of the facility from age 50 upwards, while those whose minimum pension age is 65 will be eligible from age 55 upwards. This facility is being made available to serving staff and the option will be extended to staff who resigned with an entitlement to preserved superannuation benefits as and from 1 April 2004. Superannuation benefits in such cases will be based on pensionable service at the time of resignation reduced, appropriately, to take account of early payment. An outline of the table to be used for this purpose is set out below.The table shows the values for each full year of age; adjustments based on exact age, i.e. years and days will be made when calculating actual benefits due. For example, an established civil servant who is a member of the non-contributory pension scheme, is earning €40,000 a year, is aged 54 and has 34 years reckonable service would, if s/he resigned, under the arrangements for preserved superannuation benefits, receive a lump sum of €51,000 at age 60 and an annual pension of €17,000, also payable at age 60. If s/he were to opt for actuarially reduced benefits, s/he would receive a lump sum of €45,339 payable immediately and an annual pension of €12,631, also payable immediately.Minimum Age 60Minimum Age 65Age Last BirthdayPensionLump SumAge Last BirthdayPensionLump Sum%%%%5062.482.25558.282.45165.183.95661.184.05267.985.55764.185.65371.087.25867.487.35474.388.95971.089.05577.890.76074.890.75681.692.46179.092.55785.794.36283.694.35890.196.16388.596.15994.898.06494.098.0Integration formula: Public servants with full social insurance get an old age contributory pension and their public service occupational pension is reduced to take account of this fact. This process, known as integration, can mean that lower-paid workers get only small public service pensions, or none at all. The calculation formula underlying integration is being adjusted to deliver a boost to the public service pension income of lower paid public servants. Accrual rates under the new formula are: 1/200th for pensionable remuneration below 31/3rd times OACP; and 1/80th for pensionable remuneration in excess of this limit.This revision represents an improvement in rates of occupational pension for lower paid workers, without any requirement to increase contribution rate. The current salary "cut off point" below which workers and retired public servants will benefit from this revision is €557.67 per week or €29,099 per annum. Persons with remuneration above this level are unaffected. For an employee, therefore, on, say, €25,000 pa with maximum service at retirement, the annual increase in pension benefits would be in the order of €1,230 that is €23.57 a week.The revised basis of calculation will apply to existing pensioners with effect from 1 January 2004 and all relevant retirees as and from that date."Pro rata" integration: "Pro rata" integration (as opposed to "full" integration which applies at present) will apply to part-time public servants (and relevant pensioners) with full social insurance, as and from 20 December 2001. The terms "full" and "pro-rata" integration refer to different methods of co-ordinating OACP with public service occupational pension in the case of part-time employees. The new method of pro rata calculation along with the new integration formula will be of significant benefit to part timers. For example, the value of the increase in the occupational pension of a part-time employee on, say, €15,000 pa, with maximum service at retirement would be in the order of €3,135 pa, €60pw. The revision to the integration formula (see earlier paragraph) may also further increase benefits payable to certain part-time employees.Teachers' access to the revised spouses' &children's scheme: An option to join the revised scheme, available for a fixed period, will be made available to all primary and secondary teachers serving at 31 March 2004. This represents an extension of the original recommendation of the commission that is, those teachers who had opted not to join the original scheme will also be given the new option. Revised contribution rates of2%, periodic, and 1.5%, non-periodic, willapply.Notional added years: Existing schemes of notional added years will be replaced for new entrants from a current date by a single "transitional" scheme which will be reviewed in 2015. The commission had recommended the abolition of such schemes. Following discussion with the unions however, the Government has decided to replace the existing schemes with a new interim scheme with a lower maximum award.Reckoning of allowances for pension purposes: The calculation of pension on variable pensionable allowances will be based on "the best three consecutive years in the ten years preceding retirement", rather than on the three years immediately prior to retirement, as at present. The new system will apply to relevant staff who retire or have retired from the public service as and from 1 April 2004.Compound interest rate: The current pension interest rate, which applies, in particular, to repayment of marriage gratuities, will be cut from 6% to 4% in respect of repayment due for periods from 14 November 2000 onwards.Implementation of the various changes will commence as soon as detailed guidelines have been prepared and circulated by my Department. The preparation of these guidelines is being addressed, as a matter of urgency, by my officials. Public service pensioners who may have entitlement to benefit from any of these changes will have such benefit passed on to them, as soon as practicable. In general, there should be no need for individuals to make application in advance of payment.

Successful candidates are offered a position in strict accordance with the order of merit in which candidates are placed on the panel. The person can contact the human resources section in the State Laboratory for an update on the panel situation.In line with the Government's policy on decentralisation it is planned that the Department of Arts, Sports and Tourism, which is currently based in Dublin, will be decentralised to Killarney, County Kerry. The decision to move the State Laboratory from Abbotstown to Backweston on the Celbridge Road was taken before the Government's decentralisation programme was announced. This move, which is at an advanced stage, does not form part of the decentralisation programme and will have no impact on appointments to be made from the panel.

The PSO levy is based on the approved costs incurred by the ESB in complying with public service obligations imposed on it. These obligations require the ESB to purchase the output of certain peat and renewable-alternative electricity generating stations in the interests of security of supply and environmental protection respectively.The PSO levy constitutes part of the consideration which is payable to the ESB by its customers and is directly linked to the price of the electricity being supplied. EU VAT law, with which Irish law must comply, requires that VAT be applied to the total consideration due in respect of supplies of goods or services, including all taxes, duties, levies and charges but not including value added tax chargeable in respect of the supply itself. On this basis, the ESB is obliged to charge VAT on the PSO levy. The rate at which VAT is charged is 13.5% which is the same rate as that applying to the supply of electricity.

Stamp duty receipts also allow for a broader tax base than would otherwise be possible.All owner-occupiers are generally exempt from stamp duty on new houses where the property is 125 square metres or less, whereas an investor who purchases a new house for renting is liable for stamp duty where the price exceeds €127,000. First time buyers are also exempt from stamp duty on second hand houses up to the value of €190,500 and benefit, thereafter, from reduced rates on second hand properties up to €381,000 when compared to other purchasers, including investors. In addition, mortgage interest relief is available at source in respect of interest paid on moneys borrowed for the purchase, maintenance, repair or improvement of that taxpayer's main residence, including second-hand houses.Applying the exemptions currently in force for new properties to first-time purchasers of second-hand houses would result in a loss of approximately €60 million per annum to the Exchequer. If these exemptions were granted to all owner occupiers, the cost would be considerably higher.The Deputy will be aware that I receive numerous requests to introduce new tax reliefs and expand the existing ones associated with the purchase of residential property. However, tax reliefs reduce the tax base and would inevitably lead to calls for other concessions to be introduced into the stamp duty code. In addition, there is no guarantee that the tax revenue forgone would accrue to the purchaser as there would most likely be a consequent increase in house prices.As the Deputy will appreciate, given the forthcoming budget, it is not appropriate for me to comment at this stage on the possibility of changes to the stamp duty code.

The company in question has a subsidiary which owns a minority shareholding of about one quarter in the main Israeli cement producer, Nesher. My understanding is that this shareholding does not give the Irish company in question management control over operational matters in respect of Nesher. I also understand that, as Nesher supplies cement to all concrete manufacturers in Israel, it has no say in the final use of those concrete products and has no direct involvement in the construction of the separation barrier.

The incident to which the Deputy refers, which is one of many such incidents, has not been specifically raised with the Israeli authorities, but they are well aware of the position of the EU and the wider international community, in particular as set out in the Quartet statement of 4 May which emphasised that the Israeli Government should refrain from attacks on civilians and demolition of Palestinian homes and property, as a punitive measure or to facilitate Israeli construction.

However, the restrictions applying to the person in question have been the subject of judicial review by the Israeli Supreme Court. I do not think that there is any likelihood that the Israeli Government will overturn the court's decision. The Government will continue to monitor the situation, and should it develop in such a way that it appears that an intervention would be of use in this case, the possibility of making such an intervention will be considered.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	346	Ireland and the EU are deeply concerned about the ongoing proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery, considering it to be one of the most serious threats to international peace and security. The European Council last December adopted a strategy against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Under this strategy, the EU will use all political and diplomatic instruments at its disposal and undertake a wide range of actions to stem the proliferation of WMD and their means of delivery by both state and non-state actors. In this context, the EU underlines the importance of full compliance with and national implementation of existing disarmament and non-proliferation treaties and agreements and other relevant international obligations.The EU attaches great importance to the universalisation of international instruments against the proliferation of WMD and their means of delivery through signature, accession or ratification, as appropriate, of all relevant instruments. Last April, at the preparatory committee for the 2005 review conference of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, NPT, Ireland on behalf of the EU called upon Israel to accede unconditionally to the NPT as a non-nuclear-weapon state. Ireland further stated that Israel's accession to the NPT, and the placement of all its nuclear facilities under the comprehensive safeguards of the IAEA is of great importance to the EU as it would contribute to the peace and stability of the region and the prospects of an overall settlement in the Middle East.An integral and important aspect of this policy is the EU's continuing commitment to the objective of pursuing a mutually and effectively verifiable Middle East zone free of weapons of mass destruction, nuclear, biological and chemical, and their delivery systems, as set out in the Barcelona Declaration of 1995.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	347	It is difficult to estimate the number of Irish citizens who may be resident in the United States without the appropriate authorisation. While the United States citizenship and immigration services have estimated that the number may have declined to 3,000 in the year 2000, I know that many of the agencies working with our emigrants would regard this figure as a low estimate. Figures published by the US Office of Immigration Statistics report that 49 Irish nationals were deported from the United States between October 2003 and July 2004. Of these, 29 were categorised by the US authorities as "non-criminal" deportations and are likely to have arisen from immigration offences. The situation of the undocumented Irish continues to be raised regularly in our bilateral contacts with US political leaders, including when the Taoiseach and I met President Bush in June 2004. I welcome the proposals on immigration made earlier this year by President Bush and members of Congress. I believe that all of these proposals represent genuine efforts to deal with the situation of the undocumented in the US in a constructive and sympathetic way. The Daschle-Hagel and Kennedy proposals in particular appear to offer undocumented Irish people an opportunity to obtain permanent legal residency. These proposals will have to be approved by the US Congress and it is too early to say what changes or amendments may be made in the course of their consideration by Congress. I will continue to monitor the progress of these initiatives through the US Congress, though I would not envisage any real movement in advance of the US elections.Last week in New York I announced an allocation of $607,000 for services for Irish emigrants in the United States. Recipients of funding are agencies which provide information, advice and outreach services for our emigrants, including the undocumented Irish. This funding represents an increase of over 70% on last year's grant. It reflects the Government's continuing and strong commitment to support efforts which improve the circumstances of vulnerable Irish living abroad. The Embassy in Washington and our network of Consulates continue to work closely with Irish citizens in vulnerable circumstances in the United States. Through the ongoing efforts of our Embassy and my own contacts and those of my Cabinet colleagues with political leaders in the US, I will continue to encourage and support measures that would benefit Irish citizensthere.

The British and Spanish Governments are agreed that the question of Gibraltar should be resolved through dialogue. The Government fully support this approach to issues such as Gibraltar which involve differences between friendly states on matters relating to territory, people and sovereignty.In 1984, the British and Spanish Governments launched a dialogue on the future of Gibraltar known as the Brussels Process. Talks were aimed at overcoming differences between them over Gibraltar and at promoting co-operation on economic, cultural, tourism, aviation, military and environmental matters. It was agreed that issues of sovereignty would be discussed under the process. The most recent meetings at foreign minister level under the Brussels Process were held in Barcelona in November 2001 and in London in February 2002. A referendum which was organised in Gibraltar in November 2002, without the participation of the UK or Spain, rejected the principle of joint sovereignty, although no such proposal had been agreed under the process. No meetings have been held under the Brussels Process since then, but there have been regular meetings between representatives of the two governments, at which the full range of bilateral issues have been discussed.The question of Gibraltar is considered annually by the UN General Assembly. Most recently, on 9 December 2003, the General Assembly adopted a decision by consensus recalling the agreement to inaugurate the Brussels Process and urging both Governments to continue their negotiations with the object of reaching a definitive solution to the problem of Gibraltar in the light of relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and in the spirit of the charter of the United Nations.The Spanish Foreign Minister, Miguel Angel Moratinos, stated in a newspaper interview earlier this month that the time had come to resume the dialogue and to return to seeking a mechanism to focus on future negotiations on Gibraltar. The Government supports all efforts by the British and Spanish Governments to overcome their differences on the issue.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	349	The Government has been active in highlighting the crisis in Darfur and in urging action to address the humanitarian, security and political challenges which exist there. I availed of my visit to the United Nations General Assembly last week to press the case for stronger international action.In my address to the General Assembly, I urged the UN Security Council to assert its will, as articulated in Resolution 1564. I also expressed concern that the Security Council had failed to act unanimously in adopting this resolution and urged the Council to unite behind its full implementation. I likewise used the address to appeal for continued support from the international community to meet the major humanitarian needs arising in Darfur. I paid tribute to the efforts of the humanitarian aid workers helping to relieve the situation and, in particular the efforts of Irish agencies such GOAL, Concern and Trócaire. The Government has provided almost €6 million in emergency assistance to meet the immediate needs of some of the most vulnerable populations in Darfur. Assistance amounting to over €3 million is being provided to other areas of Sudan where needs are also great. In addition, as I noted in my UN speech, the Irish people have been extremely generous in their private contributions to the aid agencies.The Deputy will be aware that the Minister of State with responsibility for development co-operation and human rights, Deputy Kitt, visited Sudan, including Darfur, in July. While in Darfur, he had a series of meetings with Irish and International NGOs and United Nations agencies implementing relief efforts funded by the Irish Government. He also met the Sudanese authorities, including the Foreign Minister, Mustafa Ismail Osman.I used the occasion of my visit to the UN last week to meet Minister Osman and to urge that his Government comply immediately with the obligations imposed on it by the Security Council in Resolution 1564. In particular, I stressed the need to open up all areas to humanitarian intervention, as well as the particular obligation on the Government of Sudan to disarm the Janjaweed militias. I also urged the Sudanese Government to intensify its efforts to conclude a final peace agreement with the SPLA/M in southern Sudan. In this regard, I call on all parties to the Darfur peace talks, including the rebel groups, to show flexibility, goodwill and commitment to reach a comprehensive agreement when talks resume in Abuja, Nigeria next month under African Union mediation. Ireland has also been active within the European Union in relation to Darfur.The EU, under the Irish and now the Netherlands' Presidencies, has been centrally involved in addressing the political, humanitarian and security aspects of the crisis. The External Relations Council has issued several condemnations of the humanitarian and human rights violations in Darfur and has repeatedly called on the Government of Sudan to provide unhindered and safe humanitarian access to the region. The European Union has also condemned the actions of the Janjaweed militia and urged the Government of Sudan to take immediate action to disarm this violent militia and provide protection for the population of Darfur.During its EU Presidency, Ireland worked to ensure close co-operation between the European Union and the United Nations in responding to the crisis in Darfur. As EU Presidency, we co-chaired a high level consultation meeting on Darfur, with the United Nations and the United States, on 3 June last in Geneva. Ireland has also pressed for a greater level of engagement by the Security Council on the issue of Darfur. I very much welcome the clear benchmarks set out in Security Council Resolution 1556 and reaffirmed in Resolution 1564 for measures, including disarmament and disbandment of the Janjaweed militia. I also welcome the call on the UN Secretary General contained in Resolution 1564 to establish an international commission of inquiry to investigate and make a determination as to whether acts of genocide have occurred in Darfur. The resolution makes clear that, if the Government of Sudan does not meet its commitments to disarm the militias and protect its civilians, the Security Council will consider further measures, including possible oil sanctions against the Sudanese Government.The African Union is performing a crucial role in relation to the crisis in Darfur, through both its ceasefire monitoring mission and its mediation of the peace talks in Abuja. Ireland and the EU fully support the AU mission in Darfur and welcome the plans to substantially expand this mission in order to provide for more proactive monitoring of the situation in Darfur. The European Union is collaborating closely with the African Union on how best it can assist an expanded AU mission. The European Union has already provided substantial support to the existing mission, including an allocation of €12 million from the African Peace Facility established under the Irish Presidency. The EU is also contributing a number of observers to the ceasefire monitoring mission, including an officer from the Irish Defence Forces.

That appeal is currently being considered by a panel of judges and their decision is awaited.I met the Colombian Foreign Minister in New York last week, and I again stressed the importance of an early decision on the appeal. Minister Barco, while emphasising the independence of the courts in Colombia, indicated that she shared our wish for an early decision and that she was hopeful that the appeal would be concluded in the autumn. I am satisfied that, as a result of the representations we have made over recent months, the need to progress the matter expeditiously is accepted by the Colombian authorities.Pending the outcome of the appeal, the three men have left the prison in Bogotá. However, the appeal judges ruled that they must remain in Colombia until the appeal is decided. We will continue to maintain contact with the Colombian authorities in this case and provide all possible consular assistance for the three men and their families.The other case raised by the Deputy relates to five Cuban citizens who were convicted in the US in 2001 on charges ranging from espionage to conspiracy to murder, and whose appeal was heard in March of this year. The court's decision is awaited. As I have previously informed the Deputy, the Irish Government has no standing in this matter which is a bilateral consular question between the Cuban and US authorities.

In respect of the policy of the Irish Government, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No.111 on 8 July 2004, in which I made a full statement on this issue. In particular I would state, as I did in that reply, that the contents of the British Government's published intelligence dossiers had no bearing on the Irish Government's position in relation to the threat posed by Iraq, or on Ireland's behaviour as a member of the United Nations Security Council. The Government did not rely on UK or US intelligence sources in arriving at its position.

It is not customary to circulate the text of the Attorney General's written advice to the Government. As the Deputy is aware, Dáil Éireann subsequently passed a motion supporting the decision of the Government to maintain the long-standing arrangements in relation to Shannon.

In particular, a comprehensive debate on this matter took place in Dáil Éireann on 20 March 2003.During the debate, the Government outlined the various political, diplomatic, legal and other considerations which determine its policy in this area. At that time, and following an extensive discussion of the issues, Dáil Éireann voted to support the Government decision to maintain the customary arrangements at Shannon Airport. The use of the term "hostile position" in the context of the debate was clearly intended in a political, rather than a military, context. In the circumstances, the question of the Defence Forces being placed on particular alert is not relevant.

There have been substantial increases in expenditure in recent years. Summary data for the past six years and the expected out-turn for 2004 are set out in the table below. This level of expenditure demonstrates the strong commitment of the Government to attain the UN target of 0.7% of GNP. In percentage terms, Ireland is one of the world's leading donors — we are currently in joint seventh place — and well above the EU average. It is hoped that increased allocations, the scale and timing of which will be considered on an ongoing basis, will be possible over the coming years with a view to achieving our objective.

As the House is aware from my replies to previous questions on this subject, Ms Ingrid Betancourt — a candidate in the 2002 Colombian presidential election — was kidnapped by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, FARC, on 23 February 2002. She remains in FARC captivity, along with a large number of other hostages.The Colombian Government made an offer on 23 July this year to the FARC leadership for the exchange of 59 prisoners, including Ms. Betancourt, in return for some 50 FARC prisoners, provided that none of the latter had been found guilty of murder or kidnapping. The initial response by FARC to this offer was to dismiss it. However, they have subsequently suggested the suspension of military operations for 72 hours in order to enable them to meet with the government's peace commissioner to discuss details of the proposed exchange. The Colombian Government is currently considering its response to this proposal.Earlier this year during the Irish Presidency of the European Union, the General Affairs and External Relations Council, GAERC, underlined the European Union's view of the importance of a rapid release of all remaining hostages and kidnapped persons. I hope that progress can now be made in contacts, being facilitated by Switzerland and others, between the Colombian Government and the rebels and that this will result in the release of the kidnap victims, including Ingrid Betancourt.

They have been investigated by the European Commission and no evidence to date has been found to substantiate them. The investigations are still ongoing and no final conclusions, therefore, can be drawn at this stage.I would also like to make the general point that the issue of possible diversion of aid funding is a matter of serious concern to the EU, and is therefore kept under careful review and investigation, both by the Commission and by the individual member states of the EU.

To this end, Ireland works closely with its EU partners at the international level. Earlier this year, during Ireland's Presidency, the EU co-sponsored a resolution on the rights of the child at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, in Geneva. Ireland ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child on 28 October 1992. On 18 December 2002, Ireland ratified the optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict. This convention highlights the particular importance of access to education for children. In this context, ensuring access of children to education in times of violent conflict is very important, as is a safe learning environment.The rights of the child, as enshrined in the convention, must be applied, without distinction, throughout the jurisdiction of all states party to it, and the right of children to education in safety ensured. As a practical contribution to achieving these ends, my Department, through Development Co-operation Ireland, provides ongoing assistance to the Palestinian Ministry of Education towards meeting the basic education needs of Palestinian children. The Department has also allocated €200,000 to assist the victims of the tragic events in Beslan to provide counselling services for the children and their families

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	361	My interest in the Irish abroad and their needs, and my desire to alleviate the difficulties facing elderly and vulnerable Irish people resident abroad, is strong and committed. On taking office as Minister for Foreign Affairs, I saw the need for a more structured and strategic approach to emigration policy. I commissioned a task force on policy regarding emigrants to assess the situation better and, in fulfilment of an undertaking in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness "to address the special needs of those Irish emigrants abroad who are particularly marginalised or at greatest risk of exclusion". The report of the task force contained many wide-ranging proposals and recommendations involving the work and responsibilities of a number of government departments and other bodies. The issues of concern identified can best be addressed by a collective effort involving governmental and non-governmental agencies.With a view to introducing a new dynamic and focus to this collective effort, I have established a dedicated unit, the Irish abroad unit, within the Department of Foreign Affairs. This unit, headed by the former ambassador to Estonia, Mr. Seán Farrell, is now functioning and will work in the closest co-operation with all the agencies involved with emigrants. I want to see the talents and experiences of all those active in this area being fully harnessed for the benefit of all. The unit has already had positive meetings with immigrant agencies on the ground in New York, Boston, Philadelphia and elsewhere in the United States.This year I have secured €5 million for emigrant services abroad, an increase of two thirds on 2003. Most of this allocation is directed to the needs of our vulnerable emigrants in Britain. Since it was established by the Government in 1984, the Díon fund for Irish emigrants in Britain has provided more than €21 million to agencies that provide front-line services to our emigrants.I am very conscious of the difficulties faced by elderly Irish emigrants. At my request the Díon committee, which considers applications for funding, is paying particular attention to the needs of older people and those who wish to return to Ireland. To date in 2004, €1.2 million has been allocated to services for the elderly Irish in Britain. In addition, €182,000 has been allocated to projects aimed at assisting people who wish to return home to Ireland.The Deputy can be assured of the Government's continuing and strong commitment to improving the circumstances of vulnerable Irish people living abroad.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	362	The Government is committed to continuing the fight against poverty in Africa and other parts of the world. Government spending on official development assistance has increased substantially in recent years. In 2004, Ireland's ODA is likely to amount to €475 million. Development Co-operation Ireland, the official overseas aid programme of the Government, has the reduction of poverty as its core objective. Over half of Ireland's ODA is channelled to the world's least developed countries, most of them in sub-Saharan Africa. This is the largest share of any of the OECD countries. Development Co-operation Ireland has a particularly close relationship with six countries in Africa, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Uganda, Lesotho, Mozambique and Zambia. These are known as "programme countries" and form the main focus of our bilateral long-term development activity. South Africa and Timor Leste are also significant partners. Sectors which benefit from assistance from Ireland include health, education, water and sanitation and AIDS-HIV.We are conscious of the important links between good governance and poverty reduction and priority is also given to programmes to enhance good governance, respect for human rights and the elimination of gender inequalities. The promotion of environmental sustainability is also another important priority for Development Co-operation Ireland. At international level, Ireland is strongly committed to the complete elimination of all debts for heavily-indebted countries and to improving access for developing countries to international trade, both of which are major concerns to countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Much of our assistance to cope with emergencies and recovery from natural or man-made disasters is also targeted at sub-Saharan Africa. To date this year, we have allocated over €36 million for the emergency and recovery programmes in countries such as Zimbabwe, Malawi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Kenya. The Government will continue to work closely in these countries, particularly with Irish NGOs and missionaries. In 2004, almost €30 million has been allocated to Irish NGOs through the multi-annual programmes scheme, MAPS, and most of these funds are targeted at sub-Saharan Africa. We also support the work of the Irish missionary community in Africa through the Irish Missionary Resource Service. So far this year, over €11 million has been allocated to Irish missionaries through this service, with the bulk of the assistance also going to sub-Saharan Africa.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	363	On 16 to 18 September, along with the Taoiseach and my colleagues, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Kitt, I met with Prime Minister Blair and the Assembly parties, for a three day intensive conference at Leeds Castle in Kent. The conference was focused on the resolution of four key outstanding issues, with a view to restoring the full and inclusive operation of the political institutions. These are an end to paramilitary activity; arms decommissioning; stability of the political institutions; and policing, including the devolution of policing and justice powers.As stated by the Taoiseach at Leeds Castle, it is our belief that the issues relating to the ending of paramilitary activity and decommissioning can now be resolved, as part of a comprehensive agreement. It was not possible at Leeds Castle, however, to achieve consensus on possible changes to the operation of the institutions in strands one, two and three of the Good Friday Agreement. Both Governments are agreed that any such changes must respect the fundamental principle of partnership enshrined in the agreement and its key power sharing provisions.Consultations on the institutional issues continued last week in Stormont between the Assembly parties and the two Governments. In the light of these discussions, both Governments are now considering how progress on these institutional issues can be advanced. The visit of a DUP delegation, led by Dr. Paisley, to Dublin on 30 September will provide an important opportunity to further address these issues. In addition to the talks in Stormont, I availed of the opportunity last week to brief the UN General Assembly on recent developments in Northern Ireland, as well as key Irish-American contacts in New York and Boston.We need now to build on the momentum of the discussions at Leeds Castle so that all of the outstanding issues are quickly finalised and a comprehensive agreement secured for the benefit of all of the people of Northern Ireland.

Ireland already has a comprehensive anti-discrimination protection legal code in place since the enactment of the employment equality and equal status Acts which prohibit discrimination on nine separate grounds. It has also put in place an equality infrastructure which offers procedures for individuals to pursue complaints in regard to discrimination experienced on any of these grounds. Ireland, has, therefore, already provided in national law for many of the provisions of Protocol 12. The question of the ratification of Protocol 12 is a matter for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.Ten ratifications are needed for this protocol to come into force; to date eight countries have ratified the protocol. The Netherlands and Cyprus are the only European Union member states to have ratified the protocol.

The implementation of the programme and budget and the management of the resources of the institute are matters for which the governing body and the management of the institute are responsible.The total recurrent funding allocated to DIT from 1997 to 2003 was €649.8 million. The provisional recurrent grant allocation to DIT for 2004 is €112.4 million.Since 1997 my Department has invested over €85 million in the development of capital facilities in the Dublin Institute of Technology.As regards future capital funding, I recently published the report of the capital review and prioritisation working group on the future capital needs in the third level sector. This report identifies an overall estimated Exchequer requirement of €1.9 billion capital funding in the third level sector over a ten year period.The report and its proposals in relation to the phasing of funding, including funding for the Dublin Institute of Technology, will have to be considered in the context of the ongoing Estimates process.

An additional 350 teacher posts are being provided to facilitate the introduction of the new system. This system will involve general weighted allocation for all primary schools to cater for pupils with higher incidence special educational needs, that is, those with borderline mild and mild general learning disability, specific learning disability, and also those with learning support needs. It will also allow for individual allocations in respect of pupils with lower incidence special educational needs.This new system will allow resources to be speedily allocated to pupils with disabilities on the basis of school based assessment.I wish to advise the Deputy that the needs of the pupils in the school in question can be accommodated within existing resources.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	371	The higher education grant schemes operate under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. These Acts define a mature student to mean a person "of not less than 23 years of age, or such other age as may stand specified for the time being in regulations made by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, who have secured places in approved institutions and have reached that age on the 1st day of January, or such other date as may be prescribed from time to time by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, in the year of entry to such institutions". The Acts further provide, inter alia, for the making of grants to mature students whose means and those of their parents, where the mature students are dependent on their parents do not exceed prescribed limits.Under the terms of the schemes, mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents. An independent mature student is defined to mean a mature candidate who was not ordinarily resident with his-her parents from 1 October of the year preceding the academic year in which s-he entered an approved course. Independent mature students are assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address.The higher education grant scheme is administered by the local authorities under the aegis of my Department. In order for a grant applicant to be assessed as an independent mature student, he or she must provide documentary evidence to the local authority of his or her independent residence from 1 October of the relevant year. My Department understands that sufficient evidence to establish that the candidate in this case has been living independently from the prescribed date has not, to date, been supplied to Kilkenny County Council, the relevant awarding body in this case.Until such time as satisfactory evidence is provided by the candidate to determine that he meets the definition of an independent mature student prescribed in the scheme, he cannot be assessed as such for the purpose of his grant application. He can, however, be assessed as a mature student dependent on parents with reference to his parents' income and address.

A similar condition exists in the other third level maintenance grant schemes.Under the terms of the free fees initiative, whereby the State meets the tuition costs of eligible students, an approved course is defined as a full-time undergraduate course of a minimum duration of two years in an approved third level institution.Part-time courses are therefore not approved courses under the terms of the maintenance grant schemes or the free fees initiative. As the person to whom the Deputy refers is pursuing a part-time course, he is ineligible for funding under the third level maintenance grants schemes, or the free fees initiative.There is no scheme operated under the aegis of my Department to meet the costs of tuition fees on part-time courses.The fund for students with disabilities, which is administered on behalf on my Department by the national office for equity for access to third level education, aims to assist students with disabilities in third level institutions and PLC colleges to participate in full-time further and higher education. The purpose of the fund is to provide students who have serious sensory, physical and-or communicative disabilities, with grant assistance towards the cost of special equipment, special materials and technological aids, targeted transport services, personal assistants and sign language interpreters. The scheme does not provide for the payment of tuition fees.

Section 4 of the Act enables additional institutions that are identified as reformatory schools, industrial schools, orphanages, children's homes and special schools, in which children were placed and resident and in respect of which a public body had a regulatory or inspection function, to be added to the Schedule.My Department has received correspondence from both individuals and survivor groups identifying a number of additional institutions that may be eligible for inclusion in the Schedule. It has been necessary for my Department to establish if in fact the institutions identified to it are eligible for inclusion in the Schedule and this process has proven to be time consuming and is continuing.However, while inquiries have not yet been completed in respect of all institutions, I can confirm that the Government has recently approved the addition of a further 13 institutions to the Schedule. In accordance with Section 4 of the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002, I am currently making arrangements to have a draft of the Order necessary to add these 13 institutions to the Schedule laid before each of the Houses of the Oireachtas in order to seek a resolution of approval.I do not consider that it would be appropriate to identify the 13 institutions until the draft Order is laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. It is possible that further institutions may be added to the Schedule in the future as a result of the inquiries being conducted by my Department.

It is a matter for the school authority to determine the timetabled hours of its teachers given its overall requirements-resources subject to the 18 hour minimum requirement. The terms and conditions of employment for teachers are a matter for the teachers' conciliation council, which comprises representatives of the teachers' unions, school management, the Department of Finance and the Department of Education and Science.These terms and conditions are of general application to all teachers and it would be inappropriate for me to intervene in individual cases.

On 13 November 2003 I announced, as part of the 2004 Estimates for my Department, that the student charge will increase from €670 to €750 for the 2004-05 academic year. It is not the case that this charge applies irrespective of means. All students who are eligible for means tested student support have the student charge paid on their behalf by the local authorities or the vocational educationcommittees, in addition to their other entitlements.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	376	Standardised tests are used to varying extents at local level and at national level across the EU states.According to information currently available, standardised testing of primary pupils in the early years of their primary schooling is a national requirement in England, Wales, Northern Ireland, the Netherlands and France.In England and Wales, pupils at ages seven and 11 must take standardised tests in reading and mathematics. In Northern Ireland, pupils take similar standardised tests at eight and 11. In Scotland, pupils aged eight and 12 take tests in English and mathematics. In the Netherlands, pupils are tested in language and mathematics at three points during their primary education including at seven to eight years of age.In France, national assessment tests in reading, writing and mathematics are administered at the beginning of the consolidation cycle of primary education, that is, at approximately nine years of age.In Ireland, the standardised testing of seven year olds has formed the basis for a number of national surveys. For example, as part of the 2004 national assessment of English reading, standardised tests were administered to pupils in both the first and fifth classes in a representative national sample of primary schools. Also, standardised tests of mathematics were administered to pupils in fourth class in a representative sample of schools in May 2004 as part of the national assessment of mathematics achievement.While the 2004 national assessment of English reading was the first in which a nationally representative sample of pupils in first class was involved, pupils in first class took a standardised test of reading as part of the 2003 survey of reading in designated disadvantaged schools.Separate from the national assessments, standardised tests have been developed for use by schools and evidence shows that they are used in more than 90% of primary schools in Ireland. Tests are available for English reading, English spelling, and mathematics for administration to pupils in the first to sixth classes, inclusive. In any consideration of the possible effects on pupils, it is worthwhile to note that the teachers of classes that participated in the standardisation studies for these tests carried out by the educational research centre did not report that pupils experienced any undue difficulties in attempting them. The tests at all class levels are designed so that all pupils can meet with some level of success on them.

The arrangement of classes is a matter for the school authorities, which should ensure that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and the smallest classes is kept to a minimum.The enrolment on 30 September 2003 of the school referred to by the Deputy was 369 pupils, which warrants a staffing of principal plus 13 mainstream posts for the 2004-05 school year.To ensure transparency and openness in the system, an independent appeals board is now in place to decide on any appeals on mainstream staffing.

Applications for such support are made to my Department by the relevant school authority. Each application is considered on the basis of the assessed needs of the pupils involved and the nature and level of support provided is determined on the advice of the psychological service.The school referred to by the Deputy has been allocated 11 hours 20 minutes per week additional teaching support to address the needs of pupils with special educational needs attending the school.The level of additional teaching support was determined after detailed consideration of the school's application, the supporting documentation provided, including the recommendations made by the national educational psychological service, NEPS, and having regard to the overall level of resources already available to the school.If the school is of the view that the prevailing level of assessed special needs within the school is such as to be incapable of being addressed from within its current allocation, my Department will be prepared to consider these concerns. Such consideration will require a clear demonstration by the school of the inadequacy of its allocation by reference to its current utilisation of its available resources.

There was a good response from County Kerry schools and of those who responded 53% had book loan-rental schemes in place. At primary level 79 schools operate book rental schemes.I am aware that costs associated with the purchase of schoolbooks place a financial burden on parents and am concerned to minimise these costs to the greatest extent possible.A consultancy report, which was submitted to my Department in May 1993, dealt with the factors which contribute to the cost of school textbooks. The main conclusion of the report was that book rental schemes are the most practical way of limiting the cost of schoolbooks to parents.The report, copies of which were sent to all schools, contains a number of useful suggestions, including a code of good practice for the successful operation of book rental schemes.My Department endorses the recommendations and urges school authorities at both primary and post-primary level to put in place book rental schemes to the greatest extent possible. The school book grant may be used by school authorities for the establishment of book loan-rental schemes. At primary level an enhanced rate of grant is paid to schools operating book rental schemes.At post-primary level, my Department also provides seed capital towards the costs of establishing book rental schemes in schools designated as disadvantaged and schools which participate in schemes designed to combat educationaldisadvantage, for example, school meal programmes.

To this end my Department in June invited schools to consider and submit computer networking proposals for funding. Based upon applications submitted in this regard schools will receive grants ofbetween €1,000 and €20,000, depending on school size.The initial closing date for receipt of applications in this regard was last Monday, 27 September and my Department is currently processing the proposals. It is envisaged that grant approvals will issue to schools in late October within the constraints of the funding available to me in 2004. Further approvals will be made in early 2005 in the light of ongoing applications from schools and having regard to the provision available to my Department in that year.

The position regarding the grants scheme for minor works is set out in the 2004 school building programme, which was published in January. The programme shows that €19 million has been provided for the payment of the full grant.In relation to post-primary schools, replacement furniture and equipment is provided where major refurbishment works, school extensions or new schools are being provided. It is also open to both primary and post-primary schools to use their capitation grant to replace furniture and equipment provided such funds are not required for more urgent and immediate needs.

In relation to facilities generally, the position is that many primary schools have a general purposes room and practically all schools have outdoor play areas which are utilised for teaching different aspects of the physical education programme. Many schools also use adjacent local facilities, including public parks, playing fields and swimming pools.A particular difficulty arose this year in relation to some schools in need of additional accommodation to facilitate extra teacher appointments. In the context of the available funding for temporary accommodation and the number of applications for that funding in the current year it was not possible to approve all applications received.As an interim measure some schools were advised to maximise the use of existing accommodation and my Department is considering these applications further with a view to including them as part of a multi-annual school building programme from 2005.

Apart from a small number of prescribed texts at second level, mainly in the case of language subjects, school books are not approved or prescribed by my Department at first or second level. Decisions on which books to use are taken at school level.School authorities have been advised that books should be changed only to the extent that is absolutely necessary. However, textbooks have to be changed periodically to enable teachers to keep their own and their students' work educationally stimulating and to ensure that content and methodology are kept up to date.My Department operates a grants scheme towards the cost of providing school textbooks for pupils from low-income families in schools at first and second level. For the purposes of these grants, a needy pupil is a pupil from a family where there is genuine hardship because of unemployment, prolonged illness of a parent, large family size with inadequate means, single parenthood or other family circumstances, such as substance abuse, which would indicate a similar degree of financial hardship. Principal teachers administer the book grant schemes in schools in a flexible way under the terms of the schemes based on their knowledge of particular circumstances in individual cases. Many schools operate book rental schemes and second-hand book exchanges.I have no plans to conduct an analysis of the financial impact on pupils, parents and schools of changes to school curricula and any associated changes to text books and materials used for new curricula.

The top income limit was increased from €36,897 to €40,000 as part of the €42 million package announced in May 2003. This year, in line with normal practice, I approved an increase of 5.9% in the reckonable income limits to be applied in respect of the 2004-05 academic year. In accordance with the commitment in the programme for Government to "increase the eligibility thresholds for maintenance grants for families with a number of students attending qualifying courses at the same time", I also increased by 5.9% the allowance by which the income limits may be increased in respect of other family members pursuing an approved course of study.The increase for the 2004-05 academic year brings the top income limit to €42,360, where there are less than four dependent children in a family. Higher income thresholds apply in cases where there are four or more dependent children in the family. I have set out below full details of the reckonable income limits for the 2004 schemes.In relation to the special rate of maintenance grant, known as the "top-up" grant, in line with increases in the relevant social welfare payments, I increased the annual income threshold by 6.8% to €14,693, ensuring that at least 10,000 students will benefit.I have no plans to depart, in the foreseeable future, from the current practice in relation to annual increases in the reckonable income limits under my Department's student maintenance grant schemes.(for the period 1st January, 2003 to 31st December 2003 (the tax year 2003)Number of Dependent ChildrenFull Maintenance and Full FeesPart Maintenance (75%) and Full FeesPart Maintenance (50%) and Full FeesPart Maintenance (25%) and Full FeesPart Fees (50%) only*€€€€€Less than 433,89036,00538,12540,24042,3604-737,24039,57041,89544,22546,5508 or more40,43542,96045,48548,01050,535*Full Student Service Charge is paid where income is at or below this level.† In the 2004/2005 academic year where 2 or more children (or the candidate's parent) are pursuing a course of study listed below the reckonable income limits may be increased by €4,100 where there are 2 such children, €8,200 where there are 3 such children and so on, by increments of €4,100.(i) attending full-time third level education(ii) attending a recognised PLC course, student nurse training or student Garda training(iii) participating in a CERT course of at least one years duration(iv) attending a full time Teagasc course in an agricultural college(v) attending a recognised full-time further education course, of at least one year's duration, in Northern Ireland.

A parallel benchmarking process has recently been concluded for the general operative grade in local authorities which provides for an increase of €70.09 per week subject to increased flexibility and mobility measures. The current national agreement, Sustaining Progress, provides that 25% of the increase will be paid on ratification of the agreement with the balance to be paid on a phased basis subject to satisfactory implementation of a modernisation agenda, co-operation with flexibility and ongoing change, absence of industrial action and maintenance of stable industrial relations. Payment is dependent on verification of satisfactory achievement of these provisions by the performance verification groups established in each sector.The first phase of the increase has been paid to caretakers employed in vocational schools, community and comprehensive schools and certain primary schools following ratification of the agreement. Payment of the next phase of 50% is dependent on verification by the education sector performance verification group of progress made in relation to the modernisation agenda agreed for the grade. The education sector performance verification group has approved the action plan for the schools concerned and has sought a progress report by 28 October when it will then consider the progress made.In the case of secondary schools and the majority of primary schools the arrangements are that each school receives a grant from my Department for the provision of caretaking and other ancillary services. It is a matter for each school to determine how best to meet its caretaking requirements. My Department has no direct role in the pay and conditions of service of caretakers employed directly by schools under these arrangements.

Among other things, this has involved a redesign of application forms, resulting in a delay in the issue of the revised forms. In addition, pending the outcome of the review, home tuition grants have been approved until the end of December 2004 only. It is proposed to notify arrangements for the remainder of the school year well in advance of that deadline. Parents-guardians have been asked to participate in this review by submitting comments or observations with regard to the operation of the scheme.

Depending on the assessed needs of the person, such provision may be made in special schools or special classes or in mainstream primary or post-primary schools. Teaching support, care and specialised equipment are provided as appropriate.The position is now underpinned by statute. The Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 states unequivocally that the special educational needs of children must be met as a matter of legal right. For the purposes of the Act, a child is defined as a person who is less than 18 years.

Second level schools should offer a physical education programme based on an approved syllabus with teaching hours registered on the school timetable. The focus of physical education in schools is on the young person's holistic development, stressing personal and social development, physical growth and motor development. Goal setting, within the curriculum, focuses on individual improvement and not on winning or being the best.At second level, the phasing in of a revised syllabus at junior cycle level for physical education — non-examination — commenced in September 2003. The revised junior cycle physical education syllabus, with its practical focus, provides young people with an opportunity to explore a range of intelligences and represents a balance in what has long been acknowledged as an academically dominated curriculum. The school's physical education programme can help raise educational standards, promote healthy lifestyles, cultivate social responsibility and citizenship, nurture socialisation skills and ultimately help students realise their individual potential.No timescale for implementation has been decided upon for introduction of physical education as an examination subject.

The focus of this initiative was to enhance the provision of guidance to young people at risk, to improve links between schools and the world of work and to improve the take-up of science subjects.In allocating resources for guidance and counselling under this initiative, my Department set out criteria which targets the resource at those most in need rather than allocating resources on the basis of student to guidance counsellor ratios. The preliminary findings of the review of guidance and counselling carried out by the ESRI confirms that this method of targeting resources for guidance is the best way to reach those students who are disadvantaged.I have recently announced an extension of the guidance enhancement initiative for a further two years and I have also created an additional 30 guidance posts under this initiative from the commencement of the current school year. This decision reflects the importance I attach to the area of guidance.

My officials are continuing to communicate with schools in respect of other new entrant cases as additional supporting information is provided.With regard to SNA support generally, the position is that it has been my intention for some time to carry out an overall review of support levels and deployment in mainstream national schools. Bearing in mind the view expressed by schools that any such review should have regard to the actual situation on the ground, I have decided that the process should involve a visit to each school which has SNA support. Arrangements are being made for this review to commence at an early date and a further communication will issue to schools in this regard. Decisions regarding the appropriate level of SNA support in individual schools, having regard to outstanding applications such as the one referred to by the Deputy, will be based on the outcome of this review. Pending notification of the outcome, schools have been advised by my Department that, if they have surplus SNA capacity, they may retain the excess up to the level of applications made to the Department for which a response is awaited.

An additional 350 teacher posts are being provided to facilitate the introduction of the new system. This system will involve general weighted allocation for all primary schools to cater for pupils with higher incidence special educational needs, that is, those with borderline mild and mild general learning disability, specific learning disability and also those with learning support needs. It will also allow for individual allocations in respect of pupils with lower incidence special educational needs.This new system will allow resources to be speedily allocated to pupils with disabilities on the basis of school based assessment. It is anticipated that the needs of the pupils in the school in question can be accommodated within existing resources.

The focus of this initiative was to enhance the provision of guidance to young people at risk, to improve links between schools and the world of work and to improve the take-up of science subjects.In allocating resources for guidance and counselling under this initiative, my Department set out criteria which targets the resource at those most in need rather than allocating resources on the basis of student to guidance counsellor ratios. The preliminary findings of the review of guidance and counselling carried out by the ESRI confirms that this method of targeting resources for guidance is the best way to reach those students who are disadvantaged.I recently announced an extension of the guidance enhancement initiative for a further two years and I have also created an additional 30 guidance posts under this initiative from the commencement of the current school year. This decision reflects the importance I attach to the area of guidance.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	432	There were some 126 students from the ten new EU countries in the third level sector in Ireland in the 2002-03 academic year, the latest year for which final figures are available. The majority of these are in the university sector. I do not have full details of the courses on which these students were enrolled and the associated fee costs.However, assuming a similar number of students are enrolled in the 2004-05 academic year, and taking average fee levels, the direct costs of allowing these students free tuition would be in the region of €350,000. However, the full financial cost to the individual third level institutions could be substantially greater as a result of foregone revenue, depending on the level of fees being paid. It has been estimated that the overall revenue foregone by these institutions could be in the region of €1.5 million per annum initially.In this regard, the question of whether these students qualify for payment of EU or non-EU level tuition fees is a matter for individual institutions, in line with the Universities Act.As the Deputy will be aware, all new entrants from the new EU member states in 2004-05 are eligible for consideration under the free fees initiative. Under the initiative, the designation of a student for fee purposes is determined on entry to their course of study and cannot change during the course of their studies. I have no plans at this time to amend this aspect of the free fees initiative criteria.

Boards of management must make every effort, including advertising in a national newspaper, to obtain the services of a qualified teacher for appointment to a temporary or permanent post. Unqualified teachers should only be employed in primary schools in exceptional circumstances.

The 340 posts have been sanctioned throughout the country to cater for pupils with lower incidence special educational needs. I will not be in a position to indicate the distribution of the assigned teachers until the clustering arrangements have been finalised and the remaining posts have been allocated.

Arising from the review, my Department's position remains that satisfactory facilities exist within the State to meet the person's educational needs. In the circumstances, it is not proposed to make funding available for the person in question to attend school abroad. In the other case referred to by the Deputy, my officials advised that no appropriate education provision existed within the State capable of meeting the needs of the individual concerned. For that reason, funding has been provided for a suitable educational placement abroad.

His terms of employment entitle him to 91 days sick leave in a 12 month period of service. Any sick leave in excess of this limit is unpaid and does not qualify for arrears in respect of salary. Following an agreement with SIPTU, a gross  pro rata arrears payment in respect of phase 1 of parallel benchmarking effective from 1 December 2001 and the final phase of Programme for Prosperity and Fairness effective from 1 October 2002 issued to caretakers employed under the 1978-79 scheme. The person in question had his actual salary arrears calculated and adjusted to reflect his period of unpaid sick leave.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	438	In the case of the majority of primary schools, the arrangements are that each school receives a grant from my Department for the provision of caretaking and other ancillary services. It is a matter for each school to determine how best to meet its caretaking requirements. My Department has no direct role in the pay and conditions of service of caretakers employed directly by schools under these arrangements.In the case of the other primary schools' caretakers employed under the 1978-79 scheme are linked for pay purposes to the general operative grade in local authorities. A parallel benchmarking process has recently been concluded for the general operative grade in local authorities which provides for an increase of €70.09 per week subject to increased flexibility and mobility measures. The current national agreement Sustaining Progress provides that 25% of the increase will be paid on ratification of the agreement with the balance to be paid on a phased basis subject to satisfactory implementation of a modernisation agenda, co-operation with flexibility and ongoing change, absence of industrial action and maintenance of stable industrial relations. Payment is dependent on verification of satisfactory achievement of these provisions by the performance verification groups established in each sector.The first phase of the increase has been paid to caretakers employed in these primary schools following ratification of the agreement. Payment of the next phase of 50% is dependent on verification by the education sector performance verification group of progress made on the modernisation agenda agreed for the grade. The education sector performance verification group has approved the action plan for the schools concerned and has sought a progress report by 28 October when it will then consider the progress made.

However, the test scores reported on did not meet the criteria specified by my Department and, therefore, additional individual resource hours have not been granted. The school was notified of this outcome in June 2004. However, the Deputy may be aware that my Department has developed a revised system for the allocation of teaching supports to pupils with special needs. An additional 350 teacher posts are being provided to facilitate the introduction of this system. The revised system will involve a general weighted allocation for all primary schools to cater for pupils with higher incidence special educational needs, including those with specific learning disability and also those with learning support needs. The school attended by this pupil will, therefore, be in a position to cater for his needs from within this weighted allocation.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	441	A working group was set up in autumn 1997 to examine the potential problems caused by the weight of heavy school bags. The terms of reference of the working group were to consider the issue of heavy school bags and, in particular, the extent of the problem, the factors that contribute to the problem and possible implications of the problem, particularly for the health of pupils. The group was also asked to formulate proposals to alleviate problems associated with the weight of schoolbags. The group presented its report in July 1998. The report acknowledged that many of the solutions belong at local school level and one of the main recommendations related to the need to heighten the awareness of the potential health hazards posed by excessively heavy schoolbags.My Department initiated an awareness raising campaign at primary and post-primary levels in this regard by disseminating the report, with an accompanying circular, to all primary and post primary schools. Furthermore, information leaflets and posters were also distributed to all schools, highlighting the potential health hazard of heavy schoolbags and outlining a range of local measures that could be adopted in order to alleviate the problem. It is a matter for each school to choose the measures most suited to its needs.Positive action has been taken by many schools. Actions taken by some schools at second level consist of a range of measures, including the provision of lockers, the arrangement of the timetable into double class periods, active liaison with parents and the co-ordination of homework by subject teachers.

The new system will also continue with the existing arrangement allowing for individual allocations of teacher support for of pupils with lower-incidence special educational needs. Being enrolment-based, the weighted system will provide an assured level of learning support to all schools.

In the context of the available funding and the number of applications for that funding, it was not possible to approve all applications received and only those with an absolute and demonstrated need for additional accommodation were approved. The need for additional accommodation at the school referred to by the Deputy is, however, being considered in the context of a review which is being undertaken of all projects that did not proceed as part of the 2004 school building programme, with a view to including them as part of a multi-annual school building programme from 2005. I expect to provide details of this multi-annual programme before the end of the year.

Since 2000, the Department has engaged an outside person to prepare legislation in only one instance. That related to the drafting of a set of regulations to give effect to an EU Directive. The person chosen was drawn from a panel of barristers approved by the Office of the Attorney General and was paid a fee of €5,700. Those regulations have not been amended or revoked. There are no pieces of primary or secondary education legislation being prepared or proposed to be prepared otherwise than by my officials and the Office of the Attorney General.

Where an appeal under section 29 is upheld, the Secretary General of my Department may direct a school to enrol a pupil. In the case of a school established or maintained by a vocational education committee, an appeal against the decision of the board of management of the school is made, in the first instance, to the vocational education committee. I understand an appeal under section 29 was made to County Kilkenny VEC and that this appeal was not upheld. The parents were advised by the VEC that, as the appeal to the VEC was not upheld, they had an entitlement to further their appeal to the Secretary General of my Department. However, no such appeal was received by my Department. The National Educational Welfare Board is aware of the person referred to by the Deputy and a placement has been secured for him in the Kilkenny individual learning programme.

The ratio has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 17.44:1 in the 2003-04 school year. Arising from these improvements, class sizes have reduced in the same period. I am committed to reducing class sizes still further. This, however, can only be done on a phased basis having regard to available resources and subject to spending priorities within the education sector. Priority will be given to pupils with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas. I have requested my Department's inspectorate to monitor the deployment of staff and class sizes, and where necessary, to discuss with school authorities the basis on which school policy decisions in this regard have been made and to report to my Department, where appropriate.

The institution referred to by the Deputies is not one of those institutions. Section 4 of the Act enables additional institutions that are identified as reformatory schools, industrial schools, orphanages, children's homes and special schools, in which children were placed and resident and in respect of which a public body had a regulatory or inspection function, to be added to the Schedule.My Department has requested the Department of Health and Children to ascertain if a public body had a regulatory or inspection function in relation to the institutions referred to by the Deputies, as required under section 4 of the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002. As no confirmation has been received to date, it would not be possible to consider including this institution in any revised Schedule of the Act at this time.I can confirm, however, that the Government has recently approved the addition of a further 13 institutions to the Schedule. In accordance with the provisions of the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002, I am making arrangements to have a draft of the order necessary to add these 13 institutions to the Schedule laid before each of the Houses of the Oireachtas to seek a resolution of approval.

With regard to the allocation for the higher education grants scheme in 1997, two factors contributed to a substantially higher allocation than in subsequent years — up to 1997, local authorities recouped payments in respect of the scheme one year in arrears. A Supplementary Estimate was provided in 1997 to change to a system of recoupment on a current year basis; and the free fees initiative was introduced on a phased basis in 1995-96. From 1996-97 full undergraduate tuition fees were payable in respect of eligible students. Students who received grant assistance towards tuition fees under the higher education grant scheme prior to the introduction of free fees continued under this arrangement for the duration of their undergraduate course.The figures for 2004 represent the allocations provided in the 2004 Estimates, whereas the data for 1997-2003 represents expenditure. My Department funds three student maintenance grant schemes for third level study — the higher education grants scheme; the vocational education committees' scholarships scheme; and the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees — and one maintenance grant scheme in respect of further education — the maintenance grants scheme for students attending post leaving certificate courses.The higher education grants scheme is administered by the local authorities under the aegis of my Department. The other three schemes are administered by the vocational education committees under the aegis of my Department. Generally, students who are entering approved courses at undergraduate or postgraduate level for the first time are eligible for maintenance grants where they satisfy the prescribed conditions, including those relating to age, residence, means, nationality and previous academic attainment.The awarding bodies — local authorities and VECs — assess candidates' eligibility with reference to the terms and conditions prescribed in my Department's schemes and award grant assistance where appropriate.The expenditure for the four maintenance grant schemes since 1997, and the allocations for 2004, are outlined in tabular form below.Scheme19971998199920002001200220032004€000€000€000€000€000€000€000€000Higher Education Grants164,68251,29660,50963,57760,17967,59878,95495,620 AllocationVEC Scholarships14,42512,23813,59212,98713,53216,93420,58624,900 AllocationThird Level Maintenance Grants Scheme for Trainees24,30227,12824,78328,29226,34328,62529,25934,000 AllocationMaintenance Grants for Students Attending PLC CoursesN/A (PLC Scheme was introduced in 1998/99)

Payment has issued in this case but I am not in a position to give details of the amount the person received, as it is of a confidential nature.Arising from the Rights Commissioner's recommendation, my Department decided to pay part-time special needs-assistants 83% of the full rate of salary if they are working in an infants class for the full duration of the infant school day. My Department will issue a circular to schools in the near future outlining the details of revised arrangements for the payment of part-time special needs assistants. To enable my Department process applications, the school managerial authority must verify that the special needs assistant is working in an infant's class for the full duration of the infant school day.The amount varies in each case but a special needs assistant working for 23 hours and 20 minutes per week while on the first point of the current salary scale would receive an additional gross payment of €39 per week.

I expect the review will be completed within the current school term. A decision on the filling of vacancies, including the vacancy in County Mayo, to which the Deputy refers, will be based on the outcome of the review. Vacancies in the visiting teacher service are initially offered to visiting teachers in other regions who may wish to transfer to the location where the vacancy exists. If no serving visiting teacher expresses an interest in the position, it is then advertised nationally.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	462	My Department does not collate data on the number of pupils who do not transfer from primary to second level. The latest information, published in the NESF report on early school leaving, 2002, estimated that between 700 and 1,000 primary school pupils do not make the transition to second level. My Department is working on the development of the first phase of a comprehensive primary pupil database, which will facilitate the collation of comprehensive data on transfer rates from primary to second level in the future. My Department operates a number of programmes which assist primary school students in making the transition to second level. These include the home school community liaison scheme and the school completion programme. I have allocated approximately €40 million to support these programmes in 2004.The National Educational Welfare Board was established under the Education (Welfare) Act 2000 as the single national body with responsibility for school attendance. The Act provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. The board is developing a nationwide service to provide welfare-focused services to children, families and schools to discharge its responsibilities.The aim of the NEWB currently is to provide a service to the most disadvantaged areas, including areas designated under the Government's RAPID programme and most at-risk groups. Five regional teams are in place and an intensive service is provided in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway and in 13 regional towns with significant school-going populations — Dundalk, Drogheda, Navan, Athlone, Carlow, Kilkenny, Wexford, Bray, Clonmel, Tralee, Ennis, Sligo and Letterkenny — 12 of which are designated under the Government's RAPID programme. In addition, the board follows up on urgent cases nationally, that is, where a child has no school place or he or she has been absent for 60 days or more or where there is a care or a court dimension.Under section 21 of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000, primary and post-primary schools are required to submit a report each year on the levels of attendance to the National Educational Welfare Board. Reports have been received from most schools for 2003-04 and the analysis of these is under way. Preliminary findings indicate that the average attendance at primary level was 93.5% with 12 days absence on average for each pupil. The corresponding figures were 91.3% and 15 days absence at post-primary level. The findings also indicate that absences over 20 days by pupils were 11% and almost 19% at primary and post-primary level respectively. The data collected from this analysis will assist the board in keeping the level of need for the new service in particular areas under review.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	463	The report of the action group on access to third level education made detailed recommendations concerning the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, usually referred to as top-up grants. To qualify for the special rate of maintenance grant a candidate must meet a number of conditions, one of which is that he or she must already qualify for one of my Department's ordinary maintenance grants. My Department funds three means-tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level institutions and one grant scheme in respect of post leaving certificate courses — the higher education grants scheme; the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme; the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees; and the maintenance grants scheme for students attending post leaving certificate, PLC, courses.Where a student is already in receipt of a grant under one of these schemes, he or she may apply to the relevant local authority or VEC for the special rate of grant. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies, based on the conditions and terms issued by my Department. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular condition is desired. No such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student referred to by the Deputy.If an individual applicant considers that he or she has been unjustly refused the special rate of maintenance grant, he or she may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC. Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the conditions correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. No appeal has been received in the student support unit of my Department from the student referred to by the Deputy. Alternatively, the local authority or VEC may, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department. It is not open to me, or my Department, to depart from the terms of the schemes in individual cases.

Where a pupil enrols in a post-primary school and requires additional resources to cater for his/her special educational needs, it is open to the school authority concerned to apply for these additional resources to my Department. Any such application will be considered in full.

The application did not meet the criteria for either resource teaching hours or for special needs assistant support in accordance with my Department's circulars. The application will be reconsidered if additional information in relation to the pupil's teaching or care support needs is received in my Department.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	466	The special education section of my Department received 5,856 applications for resource teaching and special needs assistant support since 1 September 2003. A total of 1,200 applications for resource teaching support, amounting to 215 wholetime equivalent teacher posts, and 452 applications for special needs assistant support, amounting to approximately 284 wholetime equivalent SNA posts, have been sanctioned. All applications in respect of resource teaching hours received by the closing date of 30 June 2004 have been processed and, where the application satisfied the relevant Department circulars, the resources were granted. Applications received since the 30 June 2004 closing date in respect of new entrant pupils continue to be processed. My Department prioritised applications for SNA support for new entrants and decisions on the majority of these were communicated to schools on 12 August 2004. My officials are continuing to communicate with schools in respect of other new entrant cases as additional supporting information is provided.With regard to SNA support for the 1,155 non-new entrant pupils for whom schools are awaiting a response, it has been my intention for some time to carry out a general review of support levels and deployment in mainstream national schools. Bearing in mind the view expressed by schools that any such review should have regard to the actual situation on the ground, I have decided that the process should involve a visit to each school which has SNA support. Arrangements are being made for this review to commence at an early date and a further communication will issue to schools in this regard. Decisions regarding the appropriate level of SNA support in individual schools will be based on the outcome of this review. Pending notification of the outcome, schools have been advised by my Department that, if they have surplus SNA capacity, they may retain the excess up to the level of applications made to the Department for which a response is awaited.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	467	As part of its evaluative role, my Department's inspectorate conducted a sample survey in late 2002 of 25 primary schools which had been allocated resource teacher and special needs assistant support. The objective of the review was to provide a detailed account of the additional allocation of resources for pupils with special educational needs with particular reference to the terms of the relevant Departmental circulars. The report expressed concern at the higher than expected incidence of significant disability identified in the survey, although it emphasised the need for caution in drawing firm conclusions because of the small sample involved. It also noted that increased access to psychological assessment services in recent years had led to increased numbers of pupils in mainstream schools being identified as having special needs. Nonetheless, the report expressed concern that the greater availability of resources in recent years may also have led to significant overidentification of special needs in schools and that such overidentification had serious long-term implications for the future funding and development of special education services.Arising from the findings in the report, subsequent applications for special educational resources have been subject to individual verification. In the case of teacher resources, the outcome for each applicant school will be based on a new weighted system of allocation which I announced recently. The new system will involve a general weighted allocation for all primary schools to cater for pupils with higher-incidence special educational needs, such as borderline mild and mild general learning disability and specific learning disability, dyslexia, and those with learning support needs. It will also allow for individual allocations in respect of pupils with lower incidence special educational needs.The weighted allocation will be made as follows: in the most disadvantaged schools, as per the urban dimension of Giving Children an Even Break, a teacher of pupils with special educational needs will be allocated for every 80 pupils to cater for the subset of pupils with higher incidence special needs; in all boys schools, the ratio will be one teacher for every 140 pupils; in mixed schools, or all girls schools with an enrolment of greater than 30% boys, one for every 150 pupils; and in all girls schools, including schools with mixed junior classes but with 30% or less boys overall, one for every 200 pupils. In addition, all schools will be able to apply for separate specific allocations in respect of pupils with lower-incidence disabilities.Unsuccessful applications in respect of pupils with lower-incidence disabilities will be reconsidered if additional information on the pupil's teaching needs are received in my Department.

Given the pattern of falling enrolments at the school, together with surplus capacity in the general area, my Department concurs with the trustees' decision. My Department's main role in a school closure is to ensure that the best interests of the pupils are looked after in the period up to the closure and that alternative provision is available to accommodate the pupils who would have ordinarily attended Greendale Community School.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	471	My Department has received representations from certain branches of the Dyslexia Association of Ireland expressing concern at the escalating costs of running workshops.The position is that annual funding of €63,500 has been provided by my Department to the Dyslexia Association of Ireland since 1999. This funding has helped the association to operate an information service for members and the public. In addition, it has assisted in meeting the costs associated with the attendance of some children from disadvantaged backgrounds at workshops and programmes organised by the association. No decision on the provision of further funding has as yet been taken.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	472	The new system to which the Deputy refers will involve a general weighted allocation of teaching support to all primary schools to cater for pupils with higher-incidence special educational needs, that is, borderline mild and mild general learning disability and specific learning disability, and those with learning support needs, that is, functioning at or below the 10th percentile on a standardised test of reading and-or mathematics. It will also allow for individual allocations in respect of pupils with lower-incidence special educational needs.The weighted allocation will be made as follows: in the most disadvantaged schools — as per the urban dimension of Giving Children an Even Break — a teacher of pupils with special educational needs will be allocated for every 80 pupils to cater for the subset of pupils with higher incidence special needs; in all boys schools, the ratio will be one teacher for every 140 pupils; in mixed schools, or all girls schools with an enrolment of greater than 30% boys, one for every 150 pupils; and in all girls schools, including schools with mixed junior classes but with 30% or less boys overall, one for every 200 pupils.In addition, all schools will be able to apply for separate specific allocations in respect of pupils with lower incidence disabilities. The revised system will allow schools to allocate resources in response to the specific needs of each individual child from within the resources automatically allocated to the school, while allowing for additional teaching hours to be sought in respect of pupils with lower incidence special educational needs.Applications for special needs assistant support will continue to be made on an individual basis in accordance with Department circulars 07/02. The needs of the individual pupil remain an integral part of the weighted model, while at the same time the new arrangements give greater flexibility to schools to allocate sanctioned resources in an effective and efficient manner. They also reduce the level of communication required between schools, my Department and the National Educational Psychological Service, since resources are allocated automatically in respect of higher-incidence disabilities. On the basis outlined, I believe the weighted model is fully consistent with all relevant legislation.

Among those bodies being considered for inclusion will be the Higher Education and Training Awards Council, HETAC.Given the very large number of bodies in the public sector — in all there are over 600 bodies — the extension of the Freedom of Information Acts must of necessity be carried out on a phased basis, having regard to training needs and the logistics involved in meeting fully the Act's requirements.

In this regard, trustees, parents, sponsors of prospective schools and all interested parties from a locality will have the opportunity to have their voices heard in the process.The main feature of the new model, being introduced initially on a pilot basis in five specific areas, is the publication of an area development plan which will set out a blueprint for education infrastructure in the particular area into the future. The components of the draft area development plan are as follows: details of existing primary and post-primary provision; examination of the demographics of the area; commentary on the data; and recommendations for the area into the future.Following publication of each draft area development plan, the Commission on School Accommodation will conduct a public engagement process to which all interested parties can make submissions. All of these submissions will be published. The process in each case will culminate in the publication of a final area development plan against which all capital funding decisions will be made over the next decade.The location of the proposed new school to which the Deputy refers forms part of one of the pilot area development plans and the proposal is being considered through the process outlined above.

The level of teaching support allocated was determined after detailed consideration of the school's application, the supporting documentation provided, including the recommendations made by NEPS, national educational psychological service, and having regard to the overall level of resources already available to the school.

Under the new arrangements, it would be expected that the needs of the child in question can be met from within the current resource-learning support teaching allocation available to the school.The application for SNA support did not meet the criteria for such support as there was insufficient evidence of care needs. However, the application will be reconsidered if additional information in that regard is received in my Department.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	483	The school referred to by the Deputy has been allocated a grant of €100,000 on a devolved basis to provide ancillary accommodation. My Department does not intend increasing the amount of the grant offered to the school. This provision is necessary because a central tenet of the devolved scheme is that a school authority, granted discretion and guaranteed funding to enable immediate progress on its accommodation needs, must equally accept responsibility for prioritisation, control of costs and ensuring value for money.If there is a shortfall in funding, the options open to the board of management are to reduce the scale of the works to stay within the limit of the grant; use funds allocated by the Department under the terms of the grant scheme for minor works to supplement the grant provided such funds are not required for more urgent and immediate works; and fund the balance of the works from their own resources.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	484	I propose to take Questions Nos. 470 and 471 together.Since the inception of the Higher Education Grants Scheme in 1968, students pursuing postgraduate courses at approved colleges in Northern Ireland can apply for grants in respect of their fees and maintenance under the higher education grants scheme.In 1996-97, my Department's student support schemes were extended to provide maintenance grants to eligible students pursuing approved full-time undergraduate courses of at least two years duration in other EU member states.The courses must be followed in a university or third level institution, which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds. The extension of the schemes at that time did not extend to courses at postgraduate level.Any extension of the current arrangements, to provide for students pursuing postgraduate courses in the UK generally would have to be considered within the context of all other EU member states.There are no plans at present to extend the current arrangements to provide for students pursuing postgraduate courses outside of Ireland. Such a proposal would have to be considered in light of existing resources and other competing demands in the education sector. However, section 21 of the Finance Act 2000, as amended by section 29 of the Finance Act 2001, provides for the introduction of tax relief for postgraduate tuition fees paid in colleges outside of Ireland. This relief, which is available from the tax year onwards, applies at the standard rate of tax. Further details and conditions in relation to this tax relief are available from local tax offices.

At present, there are approximately 2,600 resource teachers and 1,531 learning support teachers in the primary system.Where the condition is of a more serious nature, provision can be made in one of the four special schools or 23 special classes attached to ordinary primary schools and dedicated to the needs of children with dyslexia. All special schools and special classes for such children operate at a reduced pupil teacher ratio of 9:1.My Department also provides funding to schools for the purchase of specialised equipment such as computers to assist children with special needs, including children with dyslexia, with their education where such equipment is recommended by relevant professionals. Schools can apply to the special education section of my Department for this support. Supporting documentation should include reports of psychological and other relevant professional assessments.My Department has recently developed a weighted system of allocation of teaching support for special needs pupils, including those with dyslexia. The allocation of an additional 350 teaching posts to facilitate the introduction of the scheme has been approved. The new system will involve a general weighted allocation for all primary schools to cater for pupils with higher incidence special educational needs, such as borderline mild and mild general learning disability and dyslexia, and those with learning support needs. It will also allow for individual allocations in respect of pupils with lower incidence special educational needs.The weighted allocation will be made as follows: in the most disadvantaged schools — as per the urban dimension of Giving Children an Even Break — a teacher of pupils with special educational needs will be allocated for every 80 pupils to cater for the subset of pupils with higher incidence special needs; in all boys schools, the ratio will be one teacher for every 140 pupils; in mixed schools — or all girls schools with an enrolment of greater than 30% boys — one for every 150 pupils; and in all girls schools, including schools with mixed junior classes but with 30% or less boys overall, one for every 200 pupils. In addition, all schools will be able to apply for separate specific allocations in respect of pupils with lower incidence disabilities.My Department has provided annual funding of €63,500 to the Dyslexia Association of Ireland since 1999.

The free fees initiative provides that students who have pursued a course of third level study which has attracted exchequer funding, e.g. free fees, and who have not secured a terminal qualification, and who subsequently resume third level, studies are not eligible for free fees for the equivalent period of time spent on the first course of study. However, free fees can be provided to eligible students who, having attended but not completed approved courses, are returning following a break of at least five years in order to pursue approved courses at the same level.I understand the student in question commenced a National Certificate course in Dundalk Institute of Technology in 1998 but left in December 1998. She is now undertaking a degree course in a different institution. Under the free fees initiative she is not eligible for free tuition fees for the first half of the 2004-05 academic year. The free fees initiative is not regulated by statutory instrument. It is administered on the basis of criteria laid down by the Minister.

It would be expected that the needs referred to in two of these applications can be met from within the current resource-learning support teaching allocation available to the school. This is in accordance with the new weighted model of teacher allocation for pupils who fall within the high-incidence disability categories.The third application does not meet the criteria for resource teaching support under the terms of my Department's circulars. The school authorities have been notified accordingly. This application will be reconsidered if additional information on to the pupil's teaching needs is received in my Department.

This is in accordance with guidelines agreed between my Department and the education partners. The staffing schedule is structured to ensure that all primary schools will operate to an average mainstream class size of 29 pupils. School authorities should ensure that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and the smallest classes is kept to a minimum.The mainstream staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy for the current school year is a principal and 2 mainstream class teachers based on an enrolment of 77 pupils on 30 September, 2003. The board of management of the school applied for a developing schools post. However, as the projected enrolment did not meet with the criteria required for developing school status, the application was turned down.It is open to the board of management of a primary school to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent appeals board which has been established to adjudicate on appeals on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools. Details of the criteria and application date for appeal were issued to all primary schools in April, 2004.

These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired.Under the means test provisions of the maintenance grants schemes, the reckonable income of a candidate, other than an independent mature candidate, is his or her gross income from all sources, and the gross income of his/her parents or guardians where applicable, with certain specified social welfare and health board payments being exempt.Under the terms of the residency clause of the schemes, the candidate's parents or guardians, or, in the case of an independent mature candidate, the candidate herself/himself, must have been ordinarily resident in the administrative area of the vocational education committee, from 1 October previous to entry to the course in question. The VEC has discretion to waive this requirement in exceptional circumstances.The candidate, referred to by the Deputy, is under 23 years of age and must, therefore, be assessed by reference to parent(s) income and residency status. It is not open to me, or to my Department, to depart from the terms of the schemes in individual cases.

These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired.With regard to eligibility for financial assistance under the student support schemes, the position is that generally speaking, students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to age, residence, means, and nationality. An approved course for the purpose of the PLC scheme means a full-time course of at least one year duration, attended in an approved centre.My Department contacted County Mayo VEC and it confirmed that it is in the process of assessing the grant application for the candidate, referred to by the Deputy. Grant aid is payable at either adjacent or non-adjacent rates. The adjacent rate of the maintenance grant shall be payable in the case of a grant holder whose normal residence is 15 miles or less from the college which she or he is attending. The non-adjacent rate shall be payable in the case of a grant holder whose normal residence is more than 15 miles from the college. If the candidate to whom the Deputy refers is eligible for grant aid he should be entitled to the non-adjacent rate of the grant.

I do not have responsibility for arrangements between An Garda Síochána and the Police Service of Northern Ireland and cannot comment on them. However, the Minister of State at both my Department and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has recently announced a package of measures produced on foot of the recommendations of the Working Group on Garda Vetting.Separately to matters under consideration by the Minister for Justice Equality and Law Reform the establishment of the Teaching Council in accordance with the Teaching Council Act 2001 is imminent. The council will provide the teaching profession, both primary and post-primary, with the means to self-regulate and its functions will include maintaining a register of teachers and if necessary removing the names of those shown to be unfit to teach, including those unfit to teach by reason of the fact that they pose a threat to children.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	499	Physical education is part of the prescribed curriculum for primary schools. Second level schools should offer a physical education programme based on an approved syllabus with teaching hours registered on the school timetable. The focus of physical education in schools is on the young person's holistic development, stressing personal and social development, physical growth and motor development. Goal setting, within the curriculum, focuses on individual improvement and not on winning or being the best.At second level, the phasing in of a revised syllabus at junior cycle level for physical education (non-examination) commenced in September 2003. The revised junior cycle physical education syllabus, with its practical focus, provides young people with an opportunity to explore a range of intelligences and represents a balance in what has long been acknowledged as an academically dominated curriculum.The syllabuses in physical education have been developed on the basis of a time allocation of two hours per week. The school's physical education programme can help raise educational standards, promote healthy lifestyles, cultivate social responsibility and citizenship, nurture socialisation skills and ultimately help students realise their individual potential. No timescale for implementation has been decided upon for introduction of physical education as an examination subject.

Due to personnel and financial considerations, the trustees decided they were no longer in a position to fulfil their role. Following discussions between the trustees and my Department, it was agreed that a consultant would be appointed to meet the relevant parties and prepare a report on the options available for my consideration. The consultant's report was thoroughly examined in my Department and the options for the future of the college set out. Having carefully considered all of them and having taken into account other factors such as the national spatial strategy, relevant costs in a time of financial constraint, a Government decision to restrict public service numbers, the need to secure value for money and a better allocation of resources, I decided that these considerations are best served by the closure of the college and the designation of St. Angela's College, Sligo as the sole centre for the training of home economics teachers.The closure of the college will be phased over the next three academic years to facilitate students currently enrolled in completing their course of training. Officials from my Department have already met with the trustees and management authorities of the college to discuss making the necessary practical arrangements including those on the position of the staff of the college.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	516	Historically, key decisions on educational provision have tended to be taken without any reference to the public at large. My decision to publish an annual school building programme has reinforced my strongly held conviction that all key decisions relating to educational infrastructure should be made in an open and transparent manner. For this reason, earlier this year, I introduced a new planning model for educational infrastructure with the aim of ensuring that in future school provision will be decided only after a transparent consultation process. In this regard, trustees, parents, sponsors of prospective schools and all interested parties from a locality will have the opportunity to have their voices heard in the process.The main feature of the new planning model is the publication of area development plans which will set out a blueprint for school development in an area into the future. In June, I published the draft plan for the area around the N4-M4 route from Leixlip to Kilcock, including Celbridge and Maynooth and from Enfield through to Kilbeggan including Longwood, Edenderry and Killucan. Full details of the draft plan are available from my Department's website at www.education.ie. Integral components of draft area development plans are details of existing primary and post primary provision, a drawing together and examination of the demographics of the area and other relevant factors and commentary on the data, recommendations for educational infrastructural provision in an area into the future. The commission on school accommodation is currently conducting a public engagement process to which all interested parties can make submissions. All submissions will be published. The process will culminate in the publication of a final development plan for the area against which all capital funding decisions will be made over the next decade.I am confident that this ground breaking approach to school planning will provide a mechanism to ensure that capital funding is allocated in a structured and clearly identifiable manner into the future. Most importantly, all of the stakeholders in education will have the opportunity of having their voices heard to make the education of our children the all-inclusive process it should be.

This review will involve discussions with the relevant trade union representing the special needs assistant grade and will address all of the issues raised by the Deputy. A claim for payment for supervision duties by special needs assistants was lodged by the IMPACT trade union and was referred to the Labour Court in January 2004. The court recommended that there was no merit in the claim on the basis that a duty to assist teachers in the supervision of pupils forms part of the basic duties of special needs assistants. In the circumstances, no additional payments will be made.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	519	The higher education grant schemes operate under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts 1968 to 1992. These Acts define a mature student to mean a person "of not less than 23 years of age, or such other age as may stand specified for the time being in regulations made by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, who have secured places in approved institutions and have reached that age on the 1st day of January, or such other date as may be prescribed from time to time by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, in the year of entry to such institutions". The Acts further provide, inter alia, for the making of grants to mature students whose means and those of their parents, where the mature students are dependent on their parents, and the means of their spouses, if any, do not exceed prescribed limits. Under the terms of the higher education grants schemes, mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents.An independent mature student is defined to mean a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his or her parents from the October preceding their entry to an approved course. Independent mature students are assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address. When assessing the means of students, other than independent mature students, the Acts specify that the students' means and those of their parents or guardians must be below a prescribed limit. This provision requires that parental income be taken into account irrespective of the individual circumstances in any case where the student is not an independent mature student. There is, however, provision under the terms of the scheme for candidates who are re-entering as mature students, following a break in study of at least one year. Section 3.2 of the higher education grant scheme makes provision for mature candidates, who are re-entering in order to complete an approved course at undergraduate level for the first time, or re-entering in order to pursue or complete an approved course at postgraduate level for the first time, or with reference to Clause 7.7, mature candidates who already hold a postgraduate qualification and are re-entering to progress to a further postgraduate course at a higher level and which represents progression from the level at which any previous postgraduate qualification was attained.Such candidates may be assessed under the terms of the scheme appropriate to the year in which they re-enter. Under this provision, candidates who were not independent mature students at the time of entry to an approved course may be re-classified as independent mature students for the purpose of completing a course or commencing a subsequent course such as a postgraduate course. Similar provisions apply under the terms of the other third level student maintenance grant schemes.

It is updated daily. Every effort is made to ensure that the information is current and accurate while maintaining an archive of pre-2004 information. The website has a feedback section and an e-mail address for direct contact with the webmaster.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	523	The rights commissioner recommended that my Department issue payment amounting to 83% of the full rate of salary to a part-time special needs assistant for work which she undertook in an infants class. Arising from the rights commissioner's recommendation, my Department took the decision to pay part-time special needs assistants 83% of the full rate of salary if they are working in an infants class for the full duration of the infant school day. To enable my Department process applications, the school managerial authority must verify that the special needs assistant is working in an infants class for the full duration of the infant school day. As this process is ongoing, I am unable to give the Deputy details of the number of special needs assistants affected at this time.The effective date for the implementation of this recommendation is 20 December, 2001. The amount of money varies in each case but a special needs assistant working for 23 hours and 20 minutes per week, while on the first point of the current salary scale, receives an additional gross payment of €39 per week. My Department will issue a circular to schools in the near future outlining the details of revised arrangements for the payment of part-time special needs assistants.

It is agreed that these days — 12 in total — may be combined at the discretion of school management to be utilised flexibly throughout the year for work appropriate to the grade including training. The holiday arrangements for special needs assistants employed in second level schools are outlined in a circular issued by my Department. A copy of the circular will be forwarded to the Deputy.Discussions are taking place with unions regarding the leave arrangements for special needs assistants employed in second level schools.

The employment of special needs assistants is a matter for the vocational educational committee concerned. Queries regarding the employment and payment of the persons referred to should therefore be addressed to the relevant VEC.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	526	The compulsory school starting age in a national school is six years of age. Rule 64 (1) of the rules for national schools provides that a child must be at least four years of age before he or she may be enrolled in a national school. Children of compulsory school-going age must have a place in a national school and overall there are more than enough places available. Enrolment in an individual school is the responsibility of its managerial authority and my Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters. My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, among them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools which are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act. In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. Where a board of management refuses to enrol a student in a school the parent of the student or, where the student has reached 18 years of age, the student themselves, following the conclusion of any appeal procedures at school level, has a statutory entitlement under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science. Under the appeal process, a committee is established to hear the appeal. Oral hearings are conducted with a minimum of formality. In most cases appeals must be dealt with within 30 days. Where appropriate, the Secretary General may give whatever directions to the board of management that are considered necessary to remedy the matter complained of.

All such allocations are subject to review, although I can confirm that the resource teaching support approved in this case will remain in place for the 2004-05 school year.It has been my intention for some time to carry out a general review of special needs assistant support levels and deployment in mainstream national schools. Bearing in mind the view expressed by schools that any such review should have regard to the situation on the ground, I have decided that the process should involve a visit to each school which has SNA support. Arrangements are being made for this review to commence at an early date and a further communication will issue to schools in this regard. Decisions regarding the appropriate level of SNA support in individual schools will be based on the outcome of this review. Pending notification of the outcome, schools have been advised by my Department that if they have surplus SNA capacity, they may retain the excess up to the level of applications made to the Department for which a response is awaited.

Arising from this process, sites for primary school purposes have been reserved at Fortunestown and Saggart.A decision on the provision of new schools in these areas will involve further consultations with the local authority regarding the rate and likely timescale of housing developments, together with an ongoing assessment of the capacity of existing schools in the area to meet the anticipated demand. In this regard, it should be noted that the overall enrolment trend in schools in the Tallaght area is downward. However, in light of the proposed additional housing in the area, my Department will continue to monitor developments and any needs identified will be addressed by increasing existing school capacity, or through new school provision, as appropriate.

Details of the rate of such grant aid is as follows; 95% of rental costs for primary schools with permanent recognition and 75% of rental costs for primary schools with provisional recognition. School authorities pay a local contribution of the balance. Where the local contribution exceeds €3,175 for expenditure incurred in the financial year January to December rental payments are grant-aided by my Department at a rate of 100%.Rental of temporary accommodation at special needs primary schools is grant-aided at a rate of 100%, as are special needs units within mainstream primary schools. There is no distinction between the rental payment percentage breakdown between new schools and existing schools. In general, grant aid is not provided towards the cost of rented accommodation at secondary schools.

The level of additional teaching support was determined after detailed consideration of the school's application, the supporting documentation provided, including the recommendations made by NEPS, National Educational Psychological Service, and having regard to the overall level of resources already available to the school.If the school is of the view that the prevailing level of assessed special needs within the school is such as to be incapable of being addressed from within its current allocation, my Department will be prepared to consider these concerns. Such consideration will require a clear demonstration by the school of the inadequacy of its allocation by reference to its current utilisation of its available resources. In view of this procedure being available I do not consider that a meeting with principal and parents would be of assistance at this time.

This decision was a matter for the members in accordance with their memorandum and articles of association and relevant company law and was not related to financial considerations.I understand that a meeting of the executive committee of ITE on 5 December 2003 agreed a timetable for the appointment of a liquidator, who was subsequently appointed on 9 January 2004, and agreed to issue redundancy notices to staff in advance of this.My Department has given a commitment to provide every assistance to the company in giving effect to its decision, in partnership with the staff of the institute and has been working closely with the liquidator since his appointment in this regard. This includes exploring possible arrangements for the continuation of certain research activities previously carried out by the institute and, in the interests of assisting with an orderly wind-up, facilitating appropriate redeployment or other appropriate arrangements for staff in line with general public service policy in these matters and subject to agreement with the Department of Finance.A number of ITE staff have been redeployed at this stage and all options that may be available for remaining staff continue to be explored by my Department. The period of notice of redundancy for staff at ITE has been periodically extended by the liquidator to take account of the ongoing process of pursuing redeployment options and of the interim operational needs of the company during the wind-up period. I understand from the liquidator that he has extended the current period of notice of redundancy for remaining staff to 15 October 2004. Officials from my Department have met with all members of staff of ITE and my Department remains in ongoing contact with remaining ITE staff individually, through the liquidator, and through their union representatives in order to keep them appraised as developments occur. The entitlements of those employees for whom appropriate redeployment arrangements are not made will be determined in accordance with the terms of their contracts.

The scheme also provides that grants may not be paid to candidates who already hold a postgraduate qualification and are pursuing a second postgraduate qualification.However, clause 7.7 of the HEG scheme 2003 provides financial assistance to eligible candidates who already hold a postgraduate qualification and who wish to enter a further postgraduate course at a higher level which represents progression from the level at which the first qualification was attained.Notwithstanding the provision for progression at undergraduate and postgraduate level, the objective of the schemes of student support is to assist as many students as possible in obtaining at least one undergraduate and one postgraduate degree.In relation to students who hold a Masters in Law and are pursuing the Professional Practice Course 1 and 2, considering that the Masters held in such cases, is in discipline of law, and the students concerned are continuing to study law full-time and must complete the PPC 1 and 2 in order to practice as a solicitor, candidates may be considered under the HEG scheme subject to the usual terms and conditions of funding.Section 21 of the Finance Act 2000 provided for the introduction of tax relief for postgraduate fees paid in publicly funded colleges here and in other EU member states as well as in private colleges in the State. This tax relief is applied at the standard rate of tax and will be available to full time and part time postgraduate students.

These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student referred to by the Deputy.If an individual applicant considers that she or he has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, he or she may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC.Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his-her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, itself, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department.However, it is not open to me, or my Department, to depart from the terms of the maintenance grants schemes in individual cases. Apart from the funding provided through the student support maintenance grant schemes, financial assistance is also available from my Department through the student assistance fund. The objective of the fund is to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies. Further information on this fund is available from the student access officer at NUI Galway.

The purpose of the review is to enable and inform a multi annual approach to the school building programme.I expect to be providing details of this multi annual programme before the end of the current year. The application from the school referred to is being considered in this regard.

The allocation takes into account the complexity of each institute, the range of courses and facilities offered to students, the total number of students, both full-time and part-time, and the nature of the infrastructure. Decisions on the allocations also have regard to government policy and priorities.With regard to funding for the Waterford Institute of Technology, my Department's provisional budget to the institute for 2004 is €41.6 million. This compares with a budget of €39.6 million in 2003, an increase of 5.1%. This compares with an increase of 4.5% to the Dublin Institute of Technology and 4.4% to the Cork Institute of Technology.

The extensive consultation that took place with all of the key stakeholders and the expertise of the distinguished team assembled by the OECD Education Directorate to conduct the review, lend considerable weight to these recommendations.The analysis of the review team in relation to the strategic framework within which Irish higher education should develop and in relation to the roles of institutions within a unified higher education system is extremely welcome. The report emphasises the great strengths that the institute of technology sector have brought to the Irish system. The differentiated focus of the institute of technology and university sectors has been a key factor in successfully meeting the varying needs of students, the economy and society.The report advocates that this diversified approach should be maintained as part of a unified higher education system in which strong emphasis is laid on inter-institutional collaboration. It recommends a single funding and policy advisory authority for the university and institute of technology sectors to support this approach and recommends greater managerial autonomy for the institutes of technology in allowing them to develop their roles within this strategic framework. The emphasis in the report on defining the institute of technology sector as an equal partner with the university sector in a dynamic, binary, higher education system is important in this regard.The OECD review team has emphasised the integrated nature of the full set of recommendations of the report. In this regard, it would not be appropriate to focus on any single recommendation in isolation in advance of full consideration of the report, in its entirety, by my Department, the Government and wider stakeholders. I look forward to working constructively with the HEA, leadership in the university and institute of technology sectors, my Government colleagues and the various other agencies and interests in the sector in considering and taking forward the extremely important agenda that the OECD have presented.

This training allowance is paid in lieu of a person's unemployment benefit or assistance entitlement.Based on the information supplied by the deputy, the person in question does not appear to meet the VTOS eligibility criteria. However, I would suggest that he should contact the Adult Education Organiser, CDU, Sundrive Road, Crumlin, Dublin 12 (tel. 4565487) for advice on the adult education options that may be available to him.

In the case of schools in the free education scheme, the level of allocation ranges from eight hours per week in the case of schools with enrolments below 200 pupils to 44 hours per week — two whole-time posts — in the case of schools with an enrolment of 1,000 pupils or more.In addition to allocations based on enrolments, 50 whole-time equivalent guidance counselling posts were allocated in the 2001-02 school year under the guidance enhancement initiative. The focus of this initiative was to enhance the provision of guidance to young people at risk, to improve links between schools and the world of work and to improve the take-up of science subjects.In allocating resources for guidance and counselling under this initiative, my Department set out criteria which target the resource at those most in need rather than allocating resources on the basis of student to guidance counsellor ratios. The preliminary findings of the review of guidance and counselling carried out by the ESRI confirm that this method of targeting resources for guidance is the best way to reach those students who are disadvantaged.I have recently announced an extension of the guidance enhancement initiative for a further two years and I have also created an additional 30 guidance posts under this initiative from the commencement of the current school year. This decision reflects the importance which I attach to the area of guidance.

A dedicated forum, the Dublin School Planning Committee, chaired by the school planning section of my Department, interacts with the Dublin local authorities. This forum comprises representatives of the local authorities in Dublin and representatives of the patron bodies of primary schools. It meets twice a year.The Dublin School Planning Committee acts as an initial point of contact where the local authorities can signal to my Department and the patron bodies anticipated demand for school provision. Detailed discussions regarding reservation of sites, scale and timeframe for developments take place at this forum.Arising from these processes, sites for primary school purposes have been reserved at Fortunestown and Ballycullen. A decision on the provision of new schools in these areas will involve further consultations with the local authority regarding the rate and likely timescale of housing developments, together with an ongoing assessment of the capacity of existing schools in the area to meet the anticipated demand.

Items such as the replacement of windows, roof repairs, resurfacing of school yard, repainting and redecorating qualify as improvements to school building and grounds and come within the scope of the minor works covered by this grant. Details are available on my Department's website at www.education.gov.ie.The summer works scheme, SWS, provides capital grants for necessary small-scale works that can be planned and delivered during the summer months. Applications are considered under the terms and conditions of the scheme. The closing date for receipt of applications for the 2005 summer works scheme is 5 November 2004 and details of the 2005 summer works scheme are available on my Department's website at www.education.gov.ie.Where the scope of the works required is too extensive to be carried out under SWS it is open to schools to make application for inclusion in the school building programme. Application forms for grant aid for major capital works — form FLE and form SLE — are available on my Department's website at www.education.gov.ie.

Bearing in mind the view expressed by schools that any such review should have regard to the actual situation on the ground, I have decided that the process should involve a visit to each school which has SNA support. Arrangements are being made for this review to commence at an early date and a further communication will issue to schools in this regard.Decisions regarding the appropriate level of SNA support in individual schools will be based on the outcome of this review. Pending notification of the outcome, schools have been advised by my Department that, if they have surplus SNA capacity, they may retain the excess up to the level of applications made to the Department for which a response is awaited.

The report identifies an overall estimated Exchequer requirement of almost €1.9 billion capital funding for the third level sector over a ten year period. The report and its proposals for the phasing of funding, including funding for the Institute of Technology, Tallaght, will have to be considered in the context of the ongoing Estimates process.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	585	Significant improvements in the levels of direct funding of schools have been made in recent years. The standard rate of capitation grant for primary schools has been increased from €57 in 1997 to €121.58 per pupil from 1 January last, an increase of almost 113%. In the case of secondary schools, the standard per capita grant now amounts to €274 from 1 January last as against the rate of €224.74 that applied in 1997. In the case of disadvantaged schools this increase has brought the total per capita grant to €312. In addition, the support grant that was introduced under the school services support initiative was also increased from 1 January last and now stands at €131 per pupil. This increase is in addition to the range of equalisation grants of up to €15,554 per school per annum that was approved in December 2001.The manner in which voluntary contributions are sought from local communities for optional extras over and above what is provided for in the general primary school programme is a matter for school principals and managements. Voluntary contributions by parents and others are allowed under the free education scheme. The extent of such fund raising, by and on behalf of schools, is determined by a range of socio-economic factors, including the level of local initiative and the need for additional facilities and curriculum provision as perceived by parents and the wider community. In all circumstances the contributions must be voluntary. It is a fundamental principle of the free post-primary education scheme that no charge be made in respect of instruction in any subject of the Department's programme for secondary schools; recreation or study facilities where all the pupils are expected to avail themselves of them as part of the school programme; or any other activity in which all pupils are required to take part.Voluntary contributions by parents or charges for optional extras over and above what is provided for in the general school programme are permissible under the scheme provided it is made absolutely clear to parents that there is no question of compulsion to pay and that, in making a contribution, they are doing so of their own volition.

The school authorities have recently been informed of this decision.The Deputy may not be aware that when a pupil in receipt of special educational resources transfers to another school, an application to transfer the resources must be lodged with my Department. In effect, these resources are then reviewed as the child's needs may have changed since the support was originally sanctioned. In the case in question, an application was received and, as the pupil is a new entrant to this school, the application was given priority. However, the application does not meet the criteria for special needs assistant support, SNA, under the terms of my Department's circulars. The application for SNA support will be reconsidered if additional information on the pupil's care support needs is received in my Department.

This is in accordance with guidelines agreed between my Department and the education partners.The enrolment of the school referred to by the Deputy at 30 September 2003 was 233 pupils, which warrants a staffing of principal plus eight mainstream posts for the 2004-05 school year.School authorities should ensure that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and the smallest classes is kept to a minimum. To ensure transparency and openness in the system an independent appeals board is now in place to decide on any appeals on mainstream staffing.The staffing of St. Malachy's national school for the 2004-05 school year was considered by the appeals board on 3 June 2004. The board, having considered the appeal with regard to the criteria outlined in Department circular 19/02, was satisfied that a departure from the staffing schedule is not warranted in this case. The Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in the operation of the independent appeals board.

Agreement was reached on the offer of a school place to these 12 children. The NEWB is currently engaged with eight other young people who dropped out of the mainstream education system in previous years.

These areas were drawn up in the late 1960s in the context of the free education scheme. The catchment boundaries were determined following consultation with local educational interests and the intention was that certain primary schools would feed exclusively into each centre.The revision of catchment areas is addressed by my Department as the need arises. It is the practice in my Department to consult local educational interests, where any such adjustments are contemplated.Under the rules for the post-primary school transport scheme, pupils eligible for transport may be transported to the post-primary centre which caters for the catchment area in which they live. Where eligible pupils attend school at a centre other than the post-primary centre which caters for the catchment area in which they live, they may be allowed the concession of transport from the catchment boundary of the centre attended, provided there is room for them on a bus serving that centre.

I am committed to reducing class sizes still further. This, however, can only be done on a phased basis having regard to available resources and subject to spending priorities within the education sector. Priority will be given to pupils with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas.I have requested my Department's inspectorate to monitor the deployment of staff and class sizes, and where necessary, to discuss with school authorities the basis on which school policy decisions in this regard have been made, and to report to my Department, where appropriate.

Arrangements are being made for this review to commence at an early date and a further communication will issue to schools in this regard. Decisions regarding the appropriate level of SNA support in individual schools will be based on the outcome of this review. Pending notification of the outcome, schools have been advised by my Department that, if they have surplus SNA capacity, they may retain the excess up to the level of applications made to the Department for which a response is awaited.

A non-EEA national is not eligible under the free fees initiative.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	606	Under current arrangements, my Department makes a specific ex-quota allocation of teaching posts in respect of guidance to schools in the second level system. In the case of schools in the free education scheme, the level of allocation ranges from eight hours per week in the case of schools with enrolments below 200 pupils to 44 hours per week — that is, two whole-time posts — in the case of schools with an enrolment of 1,000 pupils or more.In addition to allocations based on enrolments, 50 whole-time equivalent guidance counselling posts were allocated in the 2001-02 school year under the guidance enhancement initiative. The focus of this initiative was to enhance the provision of guidance to young people at risk, to improve links between schools and the world of work and to improve the take-up of science subjects.In allocating resources for guidance and counselling under this initiative, my Department set out criteria which target the resource at those most in need rather than allocating resources on the basis of student to guidance counsellor ratios. The preliminary findings of the review of guidance and counselling carried out by the ESRI confirms that this method of targeting resources for guidance is the best way to reach those students who are disadvantaged.I have recently announced an extension of the guidance enhancement initiative for a further two years and I have also created an additional 30 guidance posts under this initiative from the commencement of the current school year. This decision reflects the importance which I attach to the area of guidance.

This fund is managed in such a way as to grant-aid requests for funding from schools for mainstream classroom accommodation where there is no alternative option available and address unforeseen problems such as leaking water pipes and replacement boilers. Generally the fund is spent on matters which, if left unattended, could result in the closure of a school. The proposals in respect of the schools in question do not come into this category.

My decision to publish an annual school building programme has re-enforced my strongly held conviction that all key decisions relating to educational infrastructure should be made in an open and transparent manner. For this reason, earlier this year, I introduced a new planning model for educational infrastructure with the aim of ensuring that in future school provision will be decided only after a transparent consultation process. In this regard, trustees, parents, sponsors of prospective schools and all interested parties from a locality will have the opportunity to have their voices heard in the process.The main feature of the new planning model is the publication of area development plans which will set out a blueprint for schools' development in an area into the future. In June, I published the draft plan for the area around the N4-M4 route from Leixlip to Kilcock, including Celbridge and Maynooth and from Enfield through to Kilbeggan including Longwood, Edenderry and Killucan. Full details of the draft plan are available from my Department's website at  www.education.ie.Integral components of draft area development plans are details of existing primary and post-primary provision, a drawing together and examination of the demographics of the area and other relevant factors, commentary on the data and recommendations for educational infrastructural provision in an area into the future.The commission on school accommodation is currently conducting a public engagement process to which all interested parties can make submissions. All of these submissions will be published. The process will culminate in the publication of a final development plan for the area against which all capital funding decisions will be made over the next decade.I am confident that this ground-breaking approach to school planning will provide a mechanism to ensure that capital funding is allocated in both a structured and a clearly identifiable manner into the future. Most importantly, all of the stakeholders in education will have the opportunity of having their voices heard to make the education of our children the all-inclusive process it should be.

Newly established schools are generally required to undergo a period of provisional recognition, during which the operation of the school and the growth of pupil numbers are monitored. During that period, it is the responsibility of the school patron to provide suitable accommodation. This accommodation should be capable of fully meeting the needs of the developing school until permanent recognition has been secured and my Department is in a position to provide permanent accommodation.An application for permanent recognition was recently been received for Gaelscoil Nás Na Ríogh. It is currently under consideration in the school planning section of my Department. As part of the examination, factors such as the long-term viability of the school, current and projected enrolments and suitability of accommodation will be considered.

My officials are nearing completion of a review of all projects in line with the revised prioritisation criteria that resulted from consultation with the partners. The purpose of the review is to enable and inform a multiannual approach to the school building programme. I expect to provide details of this multiannual programme before the end of the current year.

The project is at tender stage and the tender report is being assessed by officials in the school building unit.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	646	I propose to take Questions Nos. 650 and 672 together.Historically, key decisions on educational provision have tended to be taken without any reference to the public at large. My decision to publish an annual school building programme has reinforced my strongly held conviction that all key decisions relating to educational infrastructure should be made in an open and transparent manner. For this reason, earlier this year I introduced a new planning model for educational infrastructure with the aim of ensuring that in future school provision will be decided only after a transparent consultation process. In this regard, trustees, parents, sponsors of prospective schools and all interested parties from a locality will have the opportunity to have their voices heard in the process.The main feature of the new planning model is the publication of area development plans which will set out a blueprint for schools' development in an area into the future. In June, I published the draft plan for the area around the N4-M4 route from Leixlip to Kilcock, including Celbridge and Maynooth and from Enfield through to Kilbeggan, including Longwood, Edenderry and Killucan. Full details of the draft plan are available from my Department's website at www.education.ie.Integral components of draft area development plans are: details of existing primary and post primary provision; a drawing together and examination of the demographics of the area and other relevant factors; commentary on the data; and recommendations for educational infrastructural provision in an area into the future.The commission on school accommodation is conducting a public engagement process to which all interested parties can make submissions. All these submissions will be published and the process will culminate in the publication of a final development plan for the area against which all capital funding decisions will be made over the next decade.I am confident this ground-breaking approach to school planning will provide a mechanism to ensure that capital funding is allocated in both a structured and a clearly identifiable manner into the future. Most importantly, all the stakeholders in education will have the opportunity of having their voices heard to make the education of our children the all-inclusive process it should be.

Since 2000, the Department has engaged an outside person to prepare legislation in only one instance. The person chosen was drawn from a panel of barristers approved by the Office of the Attorney General.At present, there is no primary or secondary education legislation being prepared, or proposed to be prepared, otherwise than by my officials and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government.

Applications for SNA support for new entrant pupils were prioritised and decisions on the majority of these were communicated to schools on 12 August 2004. My Department continues to communicate with schools in respect of other new entrant cases as additional supporting information is provided. To date, 452 applications have been successful, resulting in approximately 290 wholetime equivalent SNA posts being sanctioned.Statistical information as requested by the Deputy in relation to the number of applications received in my Department at post-primary level for the provision of SNAs is not available. However, to date for the 2004-05 school year, a total of 386.65 wholetime equivalent SNAs have been allocated to the voluntary, secondary, community and comprehensive sectors.Information relating to the locations from which requests for SNAs have been made and at which they have been granted is not readily available. The Deputy may be interested to know that it has been my intention for some time to carry out a review of the deployment of SNAs in primary schools. I accept the view expressed by schools that any such review should have regard to the actual situation in schools. Accordingly, I have decided that the review should involve a visit to each school which has SNA support. Arrangements are being made to implement this review at an early date and a further communication will issue to schools in this regard.Decisions regarding the appropriate level of SNA support in individual schools will be based on the outcome of this review. Pending notification of the outcome, schools which have been advised by the Department that they have surplus SNA capacity or consider that they have such a surplus may retain the excess up to the level of applications made to the Department for which a response is awaited.

This initiative comprises 25 projects throughout the country with the aim of providing a quality educational guidance service for adults in VTOS, literacy, community education and other adult education courses. The decision to terminate funding for the PAGE project was taken by my Department following ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the service being provided for the designated target groups. My Department has no plans to reverse the decision.

Nationally, a total of 28,588 places have been approved for post-leaving certificate courses for 2004-05.Each vocational education committee has discretion to determine the distribution of the approved places between individual schools and colleges under its remit, within the constraint of the overall number of places allocated at VEC level. Where enrolments in PLC courses in a school or college exceed the number of approved places, the excess number will not be recognised for the purposes of teacher allocations or other resources.

That said, I have no funds at my disposal for grant assistance of the type envisaged nor any proposals at present to seek such funds.Government policy on the sustainable use of energy is directed through Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI, which was established in 2002 as an independent non-commercial State body. SEI has already commenced a challenging work programme focusing on the deployment of energy efficiency measures and the increased use of our renewable energy technologies.However, the market for "green" electricity has been fully liberalised for a few years now, allowing producers of such electricity to sell directly to all consumers. The Deputy is welcome to discuss the issues with officials of my Department.

As part of that watching brief, Ireland is a member of a number of relevant international bodies which collectively conduct and evaluate research into this area.My Department is unaware of any national or international health advisory authority which has declared or even suggested that the radio signals from phone mast antennae are a hazard to health.The World Health Organisation, WHO, states explicitly in its Phone Mast Fact Sheet No. 193 — http://www.who.int/docstore/peh-mf/publications/factspress/efact/efs193.html — that radiofrequency fields around such masts are not considered a health risk. This view is supported by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection, ICNIFP, and by the European Council of Health Ministers in its recommendation of July 1999 concerning limiting exposure to electromagnetic fields.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	666	I propose to take Questions Nos. 679 and 695 together.The tripartite agreement, which was signed in February 2000 between the Department, ESB management and the ESB group of unions, provided for the phased closure of all existing peat-fired power stations, including Bellacorick, and the construction of two new ESB-owned peat-fired power stations at Lanesboro and Shannonbridge.The timing and management of the closure of the Bellacorick power station and the shutdown of the related peat production are matters for ESB and Bord na Móna, respectively, and I do not propose to intervene.The Bord na Móna estimate of the peat reserves in its ownership at this north Mayo area is 3,945,000 extractable tonnes. However, I am advised that the amount of peat that can be recovered economically is much less than this. In addition, several areas of bog owned by Bord na Móna have been transferred to the National Parks and Wildlife Service for conservation. Other sections are no longer licensed for production and are now under a waste licence for the Corrib Gas project. I am advised, therefore, that the total amount available in the context of generation from peat is less than 2 million tonnes.Bord na Móna is not in a position to provide estimates of peat reserves in areas not owned by the company.

In its decision dated 30 October 2001, the EU Commission noted that the most economic option for peat generation was chosen, whilst maintaining compliance with environment and safety regulations, so as to allow ESB to fulfil its public service obligation.The PSO notification explicitly detailed the accelerated closure of the existing old inefficient peat fired generation stations, including the Bellacorick station, on a phased basis as an integral element of the package. It also provided for their replacement by the construction of two new environmentally friendly and more efficient peat plants at Lanesboro, County Longford and Shannonbridge, County Offaly. I do not believe there is an adequate basis to reopen the whole peat question with the EU Commission.Furthermore, the EU Commission noted that the ESB would meet its PSO obligation by also purchasing and using peat generated electricity from the independent Edenderry station, that power purchase agreement having been awarded by competitive tender.These PSO arrangements in respect of peat generation are underpinned by the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 (Public Service Obligations Order) 2002.

Just recently I received notification from the EU Commission that state aids clearance had been granted for the 50 MW and 28 MW in the offshore and biomass CHP categories respectively, and also for the additional 140 MW I announced due to the overwhelming interest in the competition. This capacity will be distributed in accordance with the AER VI terms and conditions.In May of this year I set up the renewable energy development group. This group is chaired by my Department and includes representatives from the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI, ESB National Grid and the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, among others. The renewable energy industry will also be represented in the group.The group is to focus on a number of key issues including appropriate market mechanism for renewables electricity generation; renewables directive target including cost implications; grid upgrade programme for renewables; net metering; renewable energy consultation process; and research demonstration and development of renewable energy technologies, including technologies other than wind.I have requested the group to report on an ongoing basis on its deliberations and not wait until the end of the process before acting on the issues raised. Any future programme to follow on from the AER VI competitions will be based on the recommendations of the group. The first report is due before the end of the year.

Traditionally, An Post has granted increases to serving staff in line with national pay agreements. Increases to pensioners have then subsequently been applied in line with increases granted to serving staff. I am also informed that the terms and conditions, including those regarding the matter of increases, as enshrined in the An Post Main Superannuation Scheme 1990, are based on those that prevailed in the former Department of Posts and Telegraphs.I am very sympathetic to the situation of An Post pensioners and have emphasised to all parties the desirability of an early resolution of outstanding IR issues to allow pensioners to be paid any increases due.

Responsibility for the protection and promotion of consumer interests rests with the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, under the Communications (Regulation) Act 2002 and the New Regulatory Framework for Electronic Communications, which came in to effect in July 2003. This legislation outlines ComReg's role in this regard.As a result of its obligation under the legislation, ComReg has recently given directions to Internet service providers and providers of telecommunications services to protect consumers from modem hijacking and autodiallers.ComReg's decision of 20 September 2004 in this matter provides further information on the issue.

Under my Department's regional broadband programme, 19 metropolitan area fibre networks, MANs, have already been built, and a further seven are under construction. These networks are being managed for the State on an open-access basis by E-Net, which has been awarded the services concession contract.Phase 2 of the programme, now under way, will see the roll-out of broadband infrastructure to over 90 towns with a population of 1,500 and more that are not being provided with broadband by the telecommunications companies. Calls for proposals have issued in respect of 41 of those towns, including Clones and Castleblayney, and it is expected that contracts will be in place before the end of this year. The call for the remaining towns will issue in the new year.Full details of the regional broadband programme can be found on my Department's website, www.dcmnr.gov.ie.

From the most up-to-date research it appears that there is no evidence that the alleged adverse health effects that the Deputy refers to are attributable to mobile phone usage. My Department will continue to monitor the scientific evidence and participate in the relevant international projects and committees.

A spend of €35 million each year from now until 2007 has been committed to the broadband action plan.In addition to this initiative, the group broadband scheme, which I launched in March last, will allow smaller communities to pool their requirements and obtain broadband connectivity from a range of service providers, with €25 million in funding assistance from Government. This initiative may be of particular interest to the people of Falduff.Full details of the broadband roll-out programme are on my Department's websites, www.dcmnr.ie and www.gbs.gov.ie.

The consortium of consultants is led by Farrell Grant Sparks Consulting and comprises the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science and the National Institute for Regional and Spatial Analysis, NUI, Maynooth.The review will deliver a root and branch examination of the State's role and objectives in the inland fisheries sector. The consultants are required to evaluate the adequacy of the current model for the governance of the inland fisheries sector; to define the current relationship between the Government, the Department(s) and the inland fisheries sector and suggest new and more effective models; and to recommend a structure which will contribute to the optimum development of the inland fisheries resource in Ireland.I am advised by the independent steering group, which I established to oversee the work of the consultants, that the complex review is not complete and the consultants are not yet in a position to forward their report on the first stage of the exercise.While I appreciate that previous indications were that I expected to receive this report earlier this year, I am sure that the Deputy will nevertheless agree that, given the size and complexity of the task assigned to them, it was important that the consultants be allowed the necessary time to deliver a report which fully and comprehensively addresses all the issues. I have asked the steering group to ensure however that there is no undue delay in the process.

The long-term future of the post office network can only be secured by meeting the needs of customers. In this regard I have asked the Postmasters Union and An Post to work in partnership with a view to securing existing business and to pursuing new business opportunities, as these arise in the future. To help secure the future of the network, the Government approved an equity injection of €12.7 million for An Post to facilitate the modernisation of the post office network. The equity injection was paid to the company in 2003.Finally, I understand that An Post is planning a review of the system of remuneration for post office agencies in order to address any issues relating to the attraction of suitable candidates to the network.

These rules apply to all fishing vessels engaged in commercial fishing, including small vessels under 20 feet. The rules provide that a member state wishing to provide grant aid towards vessel renewal or modernisation involving increases in capacity in terms of tonnage or power or increased effectiveness of fishing gear in the period from 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2004 would have to deliver a 3% reduction in the capacity limits for its overall national fleet. Such aid is completely precluded from 1 January 2005.The 3% penalty imposed for the continuation of grant aid to 31 December 2004 would involve, for the Irish fleet, the permanent removal of 2496 GTs and 6,478 KWs. The level of the reduction that would be required is very substantial. In these circumstances, it was decided that the State would not enter into any grant aid in relation to fleet renewal and modernisation after 1 January 2003. This policy is regarded as a cornerstone of the reform of the CFP by the Commission and it has not proposed any change in this policy in the proposals for aid for the fisheries sector for the period 2007-2013, which were published in July 2004.EU fisheries policy does provide for the grant aiding of fishing vessels for works that do not concern capacity in terms of tonnage or of power. A grant aid scheme to support the purchase of safety equipment for fishing vessels including vessels which have been granted a fishing boat licence offer under the special scheme for the licensing of small fishing boats which have a record of active commercial pot fishing, is being administered by Bord Iascaigh Mhara. This grant scheme covers essential equipment including lifesaving, fire fighting, navigation and occupational safety. Details of the grant scheme is available from BIM and can be downloaded together with application forms from the BIM website at www.bim.ie. I have asked BIM to work closely with the vessel owners concerned in order to ensure that they can avail fully of the scheme.

Some local authorities have already implemented restrictions relating to the use of jet skis, including speed limits and the provision of zones which exclude jet skis.However there have been some problems relating to local authorities making by-laws for areas not under their control or management. To address this matter I have published the Maritime Safety Bill 2004, which was presented to the Seanad on 30 June 2004. The primary purpose of this Bill is to enhance public safety and amenity, and protect natural and other heritage areas, by strengthening the law against the improper use of certain fast powered watercraft such as jet skis and speedboats in the waters off the coast and in lakes and rivers.The Bill confers clear by-law making powers to regulate and control the operation of craft of the types in question, on the following authorities: (a) County councils and city councils in respect of waters generally except waters under the control or management of Waterways Ireland or under the jurisdiction of other statutory authorities; (b) Harbour companies within the meaning of the Harbours Acts 1996 and 2000; (c) The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in so far as concerns the five fishery harbour centres — Howth, Dunmore East, Castletownbere, Rossaveel and Killybegs — and other harbours under the control or management of the Minister, and, (d) Iarnród Éireann in relation to Rosslare Harbour and any other harbour under its control or management.Fines of up to €2,000 on summary conviction for offences under the bye-laws are provided for in the Bill, as well as fixed payment notices, which are on-the-spot-fines. Provision is also made in the Bill for the seizure, detention and forfeiture of craft involved in offences and for the disqualification of serious offenders from operating craft of the types in question, in the interest of public safety etc. Section 14 provides for the appointment of authorised persons by the Minister, county and city councils and harbour companies to enforce the Bill. The Garda Síochána will also play a key role in enforcement. The issue of the safe use of jet skis and other such craft remains a priority and my objective is to have this legislation enacted as quickly as possible.

That section provides tax relief in respect of donations to specified national cultural institutions known as approved bodies of items determined by a selection committee in accordance with the section.The following is a list of the approved bodies under the legislation:— The National Archives,— The National Museum,— The National Library of Ireland,— The Irish Museum of Modern Art.The relief consists of a tax credit equal to the value of the heritage item(s) donated which can be credited against the donor's tax liabilities. To qualify, an item must be considered an outstanding example of the type of item involved, pre-eminent in its class, whose export from the State would constitute a diminution of the accumulated cultural heritage of Ireland, or whose import into the State would constitute a significant enhancement of the accumulated heritage of Ireland. It must be considered suitable for acquisition by the approved body to which the heritage item is being donated. In addition the open market value of the item/collection of items must be at least €150,000 and, in the case of a collection, at least one item in the collection must have a minimum value of €50,000.The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, has the authority to approve further bodies for the purposes of the relief. Such additional bodies must be funded wholly or partly by the State or a public or local authority. The Revenue Commissioners role in relation to the section 1003 scheme is confined to the valuation of items determined by the selection committee to be heritage items and to ensuring that credit against tax is given to the value of heritage items donated. In this particular case, the donation has already been made to a body not encompassed by the legislation and would appear, therefore, not eligible for consideration under the Act. However, I have asked my Department to look into the matter further and I will communicate with the Deputy as soon as possible.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	711	Consultation has taken place over the course of the last four years with the Irish Medical Organisation, including detailed discussions in the national joint steering group on the working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors, or NCHDs, the forum on medical manpower and the national task force on medical staffing. Officials from my Department and health services employers agency have been meeting in the Labour Relations Commission since August 2002 with the most recent discussions commencing in December, 2003.The report of the National Task Force on Medical Staffing, or Hanly report, set out a detailed implementation plan for reducing NCHD hours. This involved a detailed evaluation of on-call rotas, training requirements and of how medical cover is organised. A national coordinator and support team have been appointed; draft rosters and hours recording systems developed; significant work, involving all of the post-graduate medical training bodies and the Medical Council, has been undertaken to provide a set of training principles to be applied to rosters, and extensive work undertaken by health agencies at local level.The provisions of the European Working Time Directive as it applies to doctors in training were transposed into Irish law by means of the European Communities (Organisation of Working Time) (Activities of Doctors in Training) Regulations 2004, which came into force on 1 August 2004. A full and detailed briefing on the content of these regulations was given to the Irish Medical Organisation in advance of that date. The ability of the management of the health services to effectively implement the European Working Time Directive for the benefit of all NCHDs, is dependent on the full co-operation of the IMO at both national and local level. However, to date the IMO has refused to participate in local implementation groups countrywide.Discussions involving the HSEA and the IMO under the aegis of the LRC have remained stalled on the crucial issue of changes to rosters and the way in which overtime is paid. The Labour Relations Commission has requested that both parties refrain from engaging in any form of unilateral action for the duration of the negotiation process. As a result, as of 1 August, health employers have not acted unilaterally in order to achieve compliance with the EWTD. In many sites around the country, the introduction of new rosters would facilitate significant progress towards EWTD compliance while maintaining safe patient care and existing levels of service provision. Health employers, at the request of the LRC, are at present awaiting agreement between management and the IMO at national level before proceeding.A meeting took place in the LRC on Monday 20 September between officials from my Department, the HSEA and the IMO. Both the management and union sides presented further submissions which were discussed. The LRC made a number of suggestions, including the immediate establishment of eight pilot sites and further intensive negotiations. These negotiations will take place following the establishment of pilot sites. I am hopeful that early progress can be made on resolving the outstanding areas of disagreement.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	712	Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on residency and means. Under the Health Act 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board other than for persons aged seventy years and over, who are automatically eligible for a medical card. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship. As a matter of course, the medical card income guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. The last such increase was notified in January 2004.For those who do not qualify for a medical card there are a number of schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of medication, including the long-term illness scheme, and the drug payments scheme. Many allowances such as carer's allowance, child benefit, domiciliary care allowance, family income supplement and foster care allowance are all disregarded when determining a person's eligibility. Given these factors and the discretionary powers of the CEOs, having an income that exceeds the guidelines does not mean that a child, or other person, will not be eligible for a medical card, and a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that a person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.Persons aged 16 to 25 who are financially dependent on their parents are entitled to a medical card if their parents are medical card holders. Those who are dependants of non-medical card holders are not normally entitled to a medical card except where they have an entitlement under EU regulations or where they are in receipt of a disability allowance. Students who are financially independent of their parents are entitled to apply for a medical card in their own right and are assessed on the same criteria as all other applicants. The decision on whether or not a person is regarded as a dependant or as being financially independent is made by the chief executive officer of the health board on the basis of the circumstances of each individual case.It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship. In line with the health strategy Quality and Fairness — A Health System for You, the possibility of extending the medical card by statute to various groups, including children is under ongoing review in my Department in the context of the strategy's second goal. As the Deputy is aware the health strategy includes a commitment that significant improvements will be made in the medical card income guidelines in order to increase the number of persons on low income who are eligible for a medical card and to give priority to families with children and particularly children with a disability. This should be viewed in the broader context of the strategy's emphasis on fairness and its stated objective of reducing health inequalities in our society. While it has not been possible to meet this commitment to date, due to the budgetary situation, the Government remains committed to the introduction of the necessary changes within the lifetime of this Government. In addition, my Department is committed to the preparation of new legislation to update and codify the whole legal framework for eligibility and entitlements in regard to health services.

These were the E128 for students and posted workers, the E110 for international transport workers, and the health aspect of the E119 for jobseekers.Those member states that did not already have a national health insurance card were entitled to avail of a transitional period before the introduction of the European health insurance card. Although entitled to avail of a transitional period, Ireland was one of 11 EU member states that introduced the card from 1 June 2004. A health boards executive, or HeBE, project team was established in September 2003 to manage all aspects of the introduction of the card within this timescale. As part of its brief, the project team, which included representatives of all health boards and of my Department, developed a public communications campaign that involved nationwide radio, print and outdoor advertising; information leaflets and posters available at health board offices around the country; a website which provided information about the card as well as facilitating on-line applications at www.ehic.ie.On 23 September 2004, card registrations totalled 495,711. A further 114,707 provisional replacement certificates had been registered at that date. The certificate is issued in certain circumstances, in particular when the card cannot be issued in time before the departure of the individual on the temporary stay. Applications for the card may be made through local health board offices. The card may be applied for in person or by post and anyone wishing to apply for the card in this way is advised to contact his or her local health board for details of the nearest office to which application can be made. Helpline numbers for the card are available on www.ehic.ie as well as on information leaflets. The card may also be applied for on-line, at www.ehic.ie, in the case of individuals who already have either a drugs payment scheme card or a medical card.

My Department has, therefore, asked the regional chief executive of the authority to investigate the issue raised by the Deputy in relation to the neurophysiologist post and to reply to her directly.The Deputy will be aware that the Comhairle na nOspidéal report on neurology and neurophysiology services recommended significant enhancement of neurology and neurophysiology services, including increases in consultant manpower. The Comhairle report also recognises that there are aspects of a number of other specialities and services, such as rehabilitation medicine, geriatric medicine and old age psychiatry, which are related to and overlap with neurology services. Comhairle has recommended that a national multi-disciplinary review of rehabilitation services be undertaken to further inform the policy framework in relation to the development of neurology services. Consistent with this recommendation, and in line with commitments in the national health strategy, a national action plan for rehabilitation services is currently being prepared by my Department. The action plan will set out a programme to meet existing shortfalls in services and to integrate specialised facilities with locally based follow-up services. The rehabilitation action plan, together with the Comhairle report and the work undertaken by the Neurological Alliance of Ireland through its own publications will, in my view, offer a comprehensive policy framework for the future development of neurology and neurophysiology services in this country.My Department will continue to work closely with the alliance and with the Irish Consultant Neurologists Association in relation to the future development of services. The implementation of the Comhairle recommendations will be progressed having regard to the evolving policy framework in this area, competing funding priorities and the report of the national task force on medical staffing.

However, for a variety of reasons this may not always be possible. The contract also provides for a GMS contract holding GP to cease providing services to a patient and in cases where the patient experiences difficulties in securing the services of a GP health boards may appoint patients onto the panels of participating doctors. My Department has therefore asked the CEO of the South Eastern Health Board to investigate the matter raised by the Deputy and to reply to him directly.

Workplace locations traditionally visited by the Health and Safety Authority have to comply with the smoke-free measure as part of their general compliance with health and safety requirements. Monitoring compliance in the food, hospitality and health sectors is carried out by officers from health boards and the Office of Tobacco Control.I am advised by the Health and Safety Authority that it has carried out 4,114 inspections for compliance in enclosed workplaces since the introduction of the new measures and that there has been an average of 91% compliance. The response to date across all sectors is very positive with compliance at a very high level. The successful introduction of the new measure reflects the widespread public support and goodwill that exists for a clean smoke-free environment in the workplace.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	722	In November 2000 Comhairle na nOspidéal published a report on immunology services which recommended that there should be four supra-regional immunology centres in the country. Two centres were recommended for Leinster-Ulster, one centre based in north Dublin and one based in south Dublin. Supra-regional immunology centres for Munster and Connacht-Donegal were recommended to be based in Cork and Galway respectively.The report recommended that one of the consultant immunologists at the south Dublin centre should have a special interest in paediatric immunology and have substantial clinical commitments at the children's hospitals at Crumlin and Tallaght. I am advised that a submission for a consultant paediatric immunologist with sessional commitment in Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, and St. James's Hospital has been made to the Eastern Regional Health Authority and that implementation of this post will be reviewed in the light of competing demands for available resources and the prioritisation of the post by Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children and the Eastern Regional Health Authority.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	723	The EMEA, or European Medicines Evaluation Agency, recommendations referred to by the Deputy refer only to SSRI antidepressants containing paroxetine. The Committee for Human Medicinal Products, a scientific committee of the EMEA, is currently considering a review of all the other SSRIs and related antidepressants and I understand that a review of these issues is also ongoing in the US.The CHMP review of paroxetine concluded in April 2004 and the committee issued its opinion. The next step will be for the EU Commission to issue its decision, taking account of the CHMP opinion. The CHMP opinion concluded that the benefit-risk ratio remains positive for paroxetine containing medicines in the treatment of adults but recommends changes to the product information for paroxetine on an EU-wide basis. First, a warning to reflect that paroxetine should not be used in children and adolescents. In the EU paroxetine is not authorised for use in this population. Data from clinical trials raised concerns regarding suicidal behaviour and hostility. Second, data from clinical trials have not adequately demonstrated efficacy in these age groups. Although paroxetine is not authorised for use in children and adolescents, doctors can prescribe this product for an individual patient if they feel it may be of benefit. However, they are advised to exercise caution. Alternative treatments for childhood depression, such as cognitive behavioural therapy, may be prescribed by child psychiatrists. Second, a warning to prescribers recommending close monitoring of patients at high risk of suicidal behaviour. These include patients with a known history of suicidal behaviour or suicidal thoughts prior to starting treatment and, possibly, young adults. Third, a recommendation that prescribers and patients should be warned regarding the occurrence of withdrawal reactions on stopping treatment. Generally, these are mild to moderate and self-limiting; however in some patients they may be severe and-or prolonged.These recommendations were issued following a review of the existing data on paroxetine by medical experts from the member states. Ireland, via the IMB and its national experts, participated in this review and I am advised that these recommendations are considered appropriate on the basis of the data assessed. The CHMP will take further action on paroxetine if new data emerge which indicate that this is necessary. Health care professionals have been informed of the above issues by the relevant pharmaceutical companies and in the IMB's regular column in MIMS Ireland, a monthly publication which is designed as a prescribing guide for general practitioners.

This is being particularly facilitated by the national treatment purchase fund, NTPF.The NTPF has reported that waiting times have fallen significantly with 37% of patients now waiting between three and six months and 43% waiting between six and 12 months for surgery. Some 80% of patients now wait less than one year for surgical treatment. This represents a major reduction in the length of time patients have to wait. The NTPF has been successful in arranging treatments for approximately 18,000 patients up to the end of August 2004. It is now the case that, in most instances, anyone waiting more than three months will now be facilitated by the fund.According to the Comhairle na nOspidéal report on consultant staffing, on 1 January 2004 there were 1,824 consultant posts in the public sector in Ireland. This represents an increase of 41% in the last six years.Responsibility for the management and monitoring of outpatient waiting lists rests with the individual hospitals and health boards concerned. It is a matter for each hospital to prioritise its services based on patient need and use their available resources to best effect to ensure that patient services are delivered efficiently and effectively.

Therefore, in tackling the problems in emergency medicine departments it is necessary to take a whole-system approach involving primary care, acute care and sub-acute and community care.There are a number of initiatives under way at present in order to deal with pressures in emergency medicine departments throughout the country. These include the following:

This study was based on the conference transcript of the public conference of the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction. The contents of the study have been examined and noted by my Department and a copy of the report has been passed on to the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction for attention and information.When the commission was set up, I indicated that it would be required to seek submissions from the public and to consult appropriate interests. I should point out that the commission has engaged in an extensive consultation exercise in order to inform itself on the current state of public opinion in Ireland on assisted human reproduction. This has included the placing of advertisements in the national press seeking submissions from the public. It should be noted that over 1,600 submissions were received in response and carefully examined.The hosting of the public conference in 2003 by the commission represents another example of efforts made to encourage interested parties to engage in discussion and debate on the issues involved. The commission has also engaged in a number of information gathering exercises that included the following:(i) Survey of assisted human reproduction services provided in specialised clinics. A survey instrument was drafted by the commission with a view to establishing the extent of the provision of assisted human reproduction services in Ireland.(ii) Survey of GPs. The commission issued a survey instrument to a random sample to 50% of GPs in all health board areas. I understand that a high proportion of those surveyed responded.(iii) Survey of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. The commission also issued a survey instrument to obstetricians and gynaecologists to elicit information on their level of involvement in assisted human reproduction services.(iv) Survey of Public Attitudes and Opinions. The commission has also surveyed public attitudes and opinions on a range of questions related to assisted human reproduction.I understand that the commission is nearing completion of its work, but given the complex ethical, social and legal implications that arise, it is not possible to say when it will be in a position to finalise its report.

However, the matter is one of clinical decision for the doctor involved.In the case of the private general practitioner, the arrangements in place for the provision of out of hours cover for patients are a matter between the patient and the doctor concerned. Difficulties and concerns should be addressed with the doctor. The Department of Health and Children has no role in this relationship.

The directive must be transposed in member states by 6 April 2006 and this will give Ireland a framework on which to build the legislative base for all such activities. Work has commenced on the drafting of legislation to transpose the directive and on identifying the other steps to be taken to ensure compliance with the directive.The European Commission is currently considering the question of a directive in respect of organ transplantation, including the issue of consent, and proposes to conduct a thorough scientific evaluation of the situation. It will present a report on its analysis to the Council of the European Union as soon as possible. It is hoped that this will provide the framework for the development of legislation in this area.In the meantime, the Minister will be establishing an expert group to review organ donation, procurement and utilisation policy in Ireland. The work of this group will inform Ireland's contribution to the discussions in relation to the proposed directive on organs.

In order to meet this increased demand, additional cumulative funding of €11 million has been provided by my Department since 2002 to enhance the laboratory and colposcopy services. This funding has enabled the laboratories to employ additional personnel, to purchase new equipment and to introduce new technology and thereby increase the volume of activity and improve turnaround times for results. In addition, a number of hospitals have contracted out smear test analysis to external laboratories to reduce waiting times.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	747	The drug payment scheme, DPS, significantly benefits families and individuals who, regularly or occasionally, are faced with large drug bills. No individual or family has to pay more than €78 per month for prescribed, approved drugs and medicines. Any costs over €78 are paid by the State. The cost of the scheme has risen from €140 million in 2000, the first full year of operation, to €204 million in 2003. I consider it reasonable that the contribution by people benefiting from the scheme should reflect the very high increase in spending.Where people cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants, they may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility, the CEO has regard to the applicant's financial circumstances. Health boards use income guidelines to assist in determining eligibility. However, where a person's income exceeds that stipulated in the guidelines, a medical card may be awarded if the CEO considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.People suffering from any of the following conditions, who are not already medical card holders, may obtain drugs and medicines without charge for the treatment of that condition under the long-term illness scheme: mental handicap, mental illness, under 16 years only, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism and acute leukemia.

My Department has, therefore, asked the chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board to reply directly to the Deputy with the information requested.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	749	As the Deputy is aware, responsibility for the provision of orthodontic treatment to patients in County Kerry rests with the Southern Health Board in the first instance. I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I have taken a number of measures to improve orthodontic services in the Southern Health Board area and on a national basis.The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. In 2003, my Department and the health boards funded 13 dentists from various health boards for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at three separate universities in the United Kingdom. These 13 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training in 2001. Thus, there is an aggregate of 19 dentists in specialist training for orthodontics. These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area.Furthermore, the commitment of the Department to training development is manifested in the funding provided to both the training of specialist clinical staff and the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics for the Cork Dental School. This appointment at the school will facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualification in orthodontics. The chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board has reported that the professor commenced duty on 1 December 2003. In recognition of the importance of this post at Cork Dental School my Department has given approval in principle to a proposal from the school to further substantially improve the training facilities there for orthodontics. This project should see the construction of a large orthodontic unit and support facilities; it will ultimately support an enhanced teaching and treatment service to the wider region under the leadership of the professor of orthodontics.In June 2002, my Department provided additional funding of €5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health boards/authority specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. This funding is enabling boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners. The Southern Health Board was allocated an additional €0.720 million from this fund for the treatment of cases in this way.The orthodontic service in the Southern Health Board is centrally located in St. Finbarr's Hospital Cork with outreach clinics in Tralee three days per week, Mallow 2.5 days on average per week and Bantry two days per week. The chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board has informed my Department that on 15 September last, there was no category A waiting list for orthodontic treatment in Kerry and there were 875 patients on the category B waiting list, with some 25% of these patients waiting less than one year. The chief executive officer also informed my Department that the average waiting time for orthodontic treatment in County Kerry is currently three and a half to four years. The board has experienced difficulty in recruiting specialist staff, with two consultant orthodontist posts being unsuccessfully advertised in 2002. A post of specialist orthodontist was also advertised for Cork and will be re-advertised again early next year.Furthermore, the chief executive officers of the health boards/authority have informed my Department that at the end of the June quarter 2004, there were 20,236 children receiving orthodontic treatment from health boards/authority; of these, 3,400 children were receiving treatment from the Southern Health Board.

The Southern Health Board included a proposal to develop a 14 bed extension to Kenmare Community Hospital as part of its National Development Plan 2000-2006. This was scheduled to commence during the latter part of the plan. The board completed a draft accommodation brief for the project which has been submitted to my Department.My Department is at present examining the health capital programme to ascertain what new projects can be progressed through either planning or construction stages, taking account of existing commitments and overall funding resources available. It is in this context that my Department will continue to liaise with the Southern Health Board regarding the proposed development at Kenmare Community Hospital in the light of the board's overall capital funding priorities.

Accordingly, the appointment of contractors for the building of the proposed new Dingle Hospital is a matter for the Southern Health Board.My Department has received submissions in relation to stages four and five of the project. An advertisement was placed in the EU Journal from which a list of suitable contractors has been selected for the development of a new hospital in Dingle and these are being examined in my Department at present with a view to allowing the scheme to proceed.The next step of progressing the Dingle project to construction is to arrange for the submission of tenders. This is being considered by my Department in conjunction with the Southern Health Board and in line with the board's priorities and funding resources available.

The board included a proposal to develop a 50-bed community nursing unit in Tralee as part of its National Development Plan 2000-2006 which was submitted to my Department.A project team was established in May 2001 to progress this development. The project team has identified the preferred site for this development on land attached to Tralee General Hospital. The selected site is a three acre site, accessible from the Killerisk Road, which will allow for the community nursing unit to be developed independently from the general hospital campus.The design team completed the stage three report, which was submitted by the Southern Health Board on 23 December 2003 and was approved by my Department in February 2004. My Department will continue to work with the board in progressing this project in line with the board's priorities and funding resources available. The SHB has informed my Department that the development is subject to a third party planning appeal and a decision is expected from An Bord Pleanála in October 2004.

This is the next stage of the roll-out to ensure that all women in the 50 to 64 age group throughout the country will have access to breast screening and follow up treatment where required. I also approved the appointment of a design team to progress the implementation of the expansion programme in the south and west The design team will work up detailed plans for the construction of both BreastCheck clinical units. The BreastCheck clinical unit for the southern area will be at the South Infirmary-Victoria Hospital, Cork with three associated mobile units. The area of coverage will be Counties Cork, Kerry, Waterford, Limerick and Tipperary SR.The South Infirmary-Victoria Hospital and my Department and BreastCheck, are fully committed to a fast track approach to the roll-out of the programme and representatives are meeting this week to commence the design process.

As part of this work, a multi-disciplinary sub-group of the National Cancer Forum has reviewed all issues relating to screening, including examining specific diseases such as prostate and colorectal cancer. In relation to screening for prostate cancer, the group recommended that there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend the introduction of a population-based prostate screening programme in this country. The group also recommended that this issue should be reassessed when the results are available from randomised trials currently being conducted. The group's recommendation will inform the development of the new national cancer strategy.This position is consistent with recent recommendations adopted by the European Union. This advocates the introduction of cancer screening programmes which have demonstrated their efficacy having regard to professional expertise and priority setting for healthcare resources. The proposals do not provide for specific recommendations in respect of screening for prostate cancer.

The board has advised my Department that it does not operate a waiting list for nursing home subvention. Nursing home subvention is paid to those who qualify on both financial and medical grounds and is paid from the date of application provided an application form has been submitted to the board and the applicant is resident in the nursing home.The board has further advised my Department that the average waiting time for enhanced nursing home subvention is now five months, compared to an average waiting time of 20 months in 2003.

Reflecting this legal position, adult mental health services have traditionally dealt with patients from the age of 16. As a consequence, mental health services for children, where they developed, cared for patients up to their 16th birthday. However, the Mental Health Act 2001 defines a child as a person under 18 years of age. Therefore the legal age of adulthood for mental health services will become 18 when the provisions of that Act are fully commenced. It is expected that the Act will be commenced in 2005.

The car must be essential for him/her to obtain or retain employment. The applicant must have a severe disability and the disability must impede him/her from using public transport.Applications may also be considered in the cases of persons with severe disabilities, who are incapable of managing the controls of a car, or where on medical opinion it is inadvisable for them to drive, and therefore they must be driven to and from work. Consideration might be given for the purpose of the scheme to award a grant for the purchase of a car in the name of the person with the disability subject to the understanding that he/she will be driven by another person, whose name will be notified to the health board, to and from his/her place of employment.The assessment of and entitlement to the motorised transport grant including an appeal in any individual case is a matter for the relevant health board. Therefore, applications for this grant should be made directly to the relevant health board. The applicant may also be eligible for assistance through the aids and appliances budget. In this regard, they should contact the East Coast Area Health Board for details.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	771	The Irish Medicines Board, IMB, has received a total of 324 suspected adverse drug reaction, ADR, reports associated with the use of DTP vaccines since 1972, 87 of which are classified as serious in accordance with agreed international criteria.A serious ADR is defined as one that is fatal, life threatening, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or prolongs hospitalisation. This definition also includes serious adverse clinical consequences. Accordingly, some of the cases listed below are classified as serious because the children concerned were admitted to hospital for observation, or received treatment, which is classified as an intervention. The serious ADR reports received are consistent with those known to occur with the use of DTP vaccines.The breakdown of these reports for the respective years is as follows:YearCases19731 case19741 case19752 cases19761 case19802 cases19811 case19822 cases19842 cases19851 case19862 cases19871 case19883 cases19913 cases19924 cases19931 case19942 cases19957 cases19968 cases19973 cases19983 cases19992 cases20001 case20013 casesSince 2001, there is increasing use of combined vaccines, for example, Tetravac, Infanrix IPV Hib, Pentavac etc., which have replaced the DTP vaccines.As the Deputy did not specify a particular brand of DTP vaccine, the IMB, when collating this information, included all ADRs for all DTP vaccines. Therefore, the total number of ADRs is different than that given in response to previous parliamentary questions, as those questions related to the use of one specific vaccine brand, for example, the question on Trivax answered on 18 October 2000.

Under the programme, cervical screening is being offered, free of charge, to approximately 74,000 women in the 25 to 60 age group, at five year intervals.The Health Board Executive, HeBE, has commissioned an examination of the feasibility and implications of a national roll-out of a cervical screening programme. This is a major undertaking with significant logistical and resource implications. The examination includes an evaluation of the pilot programme, policy development and the establishment of national governance arrangements. The evaluation of the pilot programme is a key element in informing the development of a high quality cervical screening model for Ireland and will be considered by my Department as a matter of priority.There are approximately 200,000 tests for cervical cancer undertaken annually outside of the current pilot programme. Any woman who is concerned about cervical cancer should contact her general practitioner in this connection.

As the infecting prion protein associated with vCJD is detectable in tonsil tissue prior to the onset of clinical disease, one option considered was to undertake an analysis of tonsil samples from patients age ten to 30 years of age following a routine tonsillectomy.Issues related to the feasibility of such a study in Ireland were considered in detail by the group. In addition to serious ethical concerns, the group concluded that, for logistical reasons, such a study would be impracticable in this country as, given the relatively low number of tonsillectomies in Ireland and the expected much lower prevalence of vCJD than in the UK population, there would not be sufficient tonsil samples available to provide meaningful results from such a study. The group, therefore, advised that a tonsil study should not take place.

The board assessed the technical data about a particular product and if it considered that a product authorisation should issue, it made a recommendation to that effect to my Department which issued product authorisations on behalf of the Minister.Under the procedures then in place, the documentation that the board furnished to the Department was an extract from the product authorisation application that contained certain administrative information relating to the product. In the case of medicinal products for the treatment of growth disorders, the documentation furnished to the Department would not have indicated the source of the hormone concerned, whether by country or otherwise.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	780	The provision of orthodontic services is a matter for the health boards/authority in the first instance. I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I have taken a number of measures to improve orthodontic services on a national basis.The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. In 2003, my Department and the health boards funded 13 dentists from various health boards for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at three separate universities in the United Kingdom. These 13 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training in 2001. Thus, there is an aggregate of 19 dentists in specialist training for orthodontics. These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area.Furthermore, the commitment of the Department to training development is manifested in the funding provided to both the training of specialist clinical staff and the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics for the Cork Dental School. This appointment at the school will facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualification in orthodontics. The chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board has reported that the professor commenced duty on the 1 December 2003. In recognition of the importance of this post at Cork Dental School my Department has given approval in principle to a proposal from the school to further substantially improve the training facilities there for orthodontics. This project should see the construction of a large orthodontic unit and support facilities; it will ultimately support an enhanced teaching and treatment service to the wider region under the leadership of the professor of orthodontics.Orthodontic Initiative funding of €4.698 million was provided to the health boards/authority in 2001 and is enabling health boards to recruit additional staff, and where necessary to engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients and to build additional orthodontic facilities.In June 2002, my Department provided additional funding of €5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health boards/authority specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. This funding is enabling boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners.The chief executive officers of the boards/authority have informed my Department of the following information on their orthodontic assessment and treatment waiting lists as at the end of June 2004:Assessment Waiting ListTreatment Waiting ListHealth BoardAverage waiting time (months)Category A average waiting time (months)Category B average waiting time (months)SWAHB3-6< 10< 12ECAHB< 3< 6< 18NAHB3-6< 12< 24MHB4No Waiting Time12MWHB24-36No Waiting Time24-36NEHBNo waiting time1.5-212-18NWHB5.51432.6SEHB1.5No Waiting Time20SHBAccording to Date of Birth.

Patients in category B have less severe problems than category A patients.The chief executive officers of the health boards-authority have informed my Department that at the end of the June quarter 2004 there were 20,236 children receiving orthodontic treatment in the public orthodontic service. This means that there are nearly twice as many children getting orthodontic treatment as there are children waiting to be treated.

I can, however, give the Deputy information on the number of discharges from hospital from the hospital in-patient enquiry, HIPE, system, which records information on each in-patient and day-case discharge from all publicly-funded acute hospitals. According to this source, the number of discharges in 2003 with a principal diagnosis of Parkinson's disease where county of residence is given as Cork is 77, while the corresponding figure for Kerry is 23.The Central Statistics Office compiles figures on causes of death. The number of deaths registered due to Parkinson's disease in 2002 for residents of counties Cork and Kerry was 15 and five respectively.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	785	The all Ireland cancer statistics second report examines the incidence of cancer among county and council districts throughout Ireland during the period 1998 to 2000. The report shows variations in cancer incidence and mortality for different regions of the country.The variation in the incidences of lung cancer is strongly influenced by smoking which tends to be most prevalent in urban and particularly deprived urban areas. While lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death in Ireland, there has been a significant decline in rates among men. However, the incidence rates among women are increasing. Smoking is a causative factor in the majority of lung cancer deaths and my Department continues to tackle this problem through legislative, environmental and health promotion measures. The prohibition of smoking in all places of work, which I introduced earlier this year, will help protect the health and safety of workers and the public from the toxic affect of tobacco smoke and is expected to have a significant impact on the incidences of lung cancer in the coming years.The information in the report is based on 1998 to 2000 data. Significant developments in cancer services have taken place in recent years. The overall additional cumulative funding allocated to cancer services in this country since 1997 is in excess of €550 million including an additional €15 million revenue which I allocated this year. An additional 104 consultant posts in key areas of cancer treatment and 245 clinical nurse specialists across all health board areas have been funded. There has also been approximately €95 million in capital funding allocated specifically for the development of cancer related initiatives, including an investment of €60 million in radiation oncology.As regards investment in services located in the North Eastern Health Board, additional cumulative funding of approximately €28 million has been made available since 1997 for the development of treatment and care services for patients suffering from cancer. This funding has enabled the appointment of an additional ten consultants, together with support staff in key areas such as medical oncology, haematology, breast surgery and palliative care. The funding has also enabled the appointment of an additional 20 cancer care nurse specialists across the region.The new national cancer strategy will target investment for cancer services over the next number of years and will make recommendations in relation to the development and organisation of services nationally. The strategy will also provide a mechanism for the development, implementation, monitoring and updating of clinical guidelines for the treatment of cancer.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	815	The Government decision of 17 June 2003 provided, inter alia, for the establishment of a health service executive incorporating a national hospitals office, primary community and continuing care directorate and national shared services centre; four regional health offices of the health service executive for the delivery of primary, community and continuing care services, retaining the existing community care structures at local level; and the abolition of the existing health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority and transfer of their functions to the health service executive. I will be bringing a new health Bill to the House in the near future that will provide the legislative framework for this division of responsibilities. The Health (Amendment) Act 2004, which came into effect on 15 June, provided for the abolition of the membership of the seven health boards, the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the area health boards and the assignment of functions reserved to members of the boards to the chief executive officers of the boards and the ERHA.We are currently in a period of transition to the new system. At this juncture, the ERHA, area boards and the health boards continue to be responsible for the provision of health and personal social services within their functional areas. Persons seeking information on such services should contact the chief executive of the ERHA or chief executive officer of the relevant health board/area board or the relevant ERHA-board staff member with any queries which they might have.The interim health service executive has been established and is making preparations to establish the health service executive, which will be a single executive authority to manage the health system as a national service. A new CEO has been appointed to the executive and is due to take up this position in Spring 2005.Yesterday, I announced the four regional areas of the Health Service Executive which are the western region, the southern region, Dublin-north east and Dublin-mid-Leinster. I will forward a copy of the map setting out these new regional boundaries to the Deputy under separate cover. These regional centres are not health boards, but rather units which will assist in the co-ordination of services delivered through the local health offices. This structure will improve patient services and minimise disruption for staff working in existing locations, although functions, roles and responsibilities and lines of accountability may change.The regional offices will be responsible for performance management, translating national policies through the local areas and gathering and relaying information on a regional basis. Interaction with local communities and their elected representatives through regional fora will also be a key function. Hospitals and local structures for primary, community and continuing care will report to the national directorates in the health service executive. This model of service delivery will bring service decision making closer to the client-patient through the local health offices and will enable the delivery of a flexible and responsive service.Customer services and public information are among the various elements of planning the transition and integration of services which the interim health service executive is addressing.

Consequently, my Department must conduct an evaluation of this project in terms of the criteria applicable to health capital developments. The Deputy will appreciate that a detailed examination of this development is a fundamental requirement for those who are accountable for approving it. Clarifications over scope, procurement procedures and funding must be resolved in this case.My Department will continue to work closely with the ERHA to resolve the outstanding issues as quickly as possible.

This list ensures equity between the schemes in relation to the range of medicines paid for by the State. The list is reviewed and amended monthly, as new products become available and deletions are notified.For an item to be included on the common list, it must comply with a published list of criteria. These include authorisation status where appropriate, price and, in certain cases, the intended use of the product. In addition, the product should ordinarily be supplied to the public only by medical prescription and should not be advertised or promoted to the public. It is a matter for the manufacturer of a particular drug or medicine to apply to my Department to have its product included in the common list.A medical cardholder who experiences financial difficulty in obtaining items not on the common list should approach the health board for assistance.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	821	My Department and the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, Belfast, DHSSPS, commissioned a feasibility study and report on the costs and benefits associated with the introduction of a dedicated helicopter emergency medical services, HEMS, for the island of Ireland. The decision to commission the study followed a recommendation by a cross-Border working group on pre-hospital emergency care, one of a number of groups established under the North-South Ministerial Council to examine areas of North-South co-operation in the health field.The report of the consultants appointed to undertake the study was published on 30 April 2004 and is available on my Department's website. The study identifies possible roles for a helicopter emergency medical service, HEMS:"Primary Response" — travelling directly to the scene of an incident to take the patient to hospital and "Inter-hospital Response" — the planned, rapid transfer between hospital of patients requiring specialist care, escorted by skilled professionals.The study concludes that an inter-hospital transfer service would be the most appropriate in an all-island context. The study indicates that this would involve significant capital investment and annual operating costs. The estimated cost is €12 million capital and €4 million annual operating costs for a single helicopter. Additional helicopters could be added with an additional annual cost for each aircraft of over €3 million.An air ambulance service is currently provided to the health boards by the Air Corps on a request and availability basis. The Air Corps provides this service subject to the nature of the mission, available aircraft and other operational commitments. Air Corps helicopters operate from airports and, where available and deemed safe, hospital helipads. Most transfers are airport to airport with onward transfer by land ambulance. The service is well regarded and appreciated by those in the health service who avail of it.My Department is exploring options in relation to HEMS development in the light of the recent study. As part of this exercise, it has initiated discussions with the Department of Defence and the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources-Irish Coastguard.

This is the next stage of the roll out to ensure that all women in the 50 to 64 age group throughout the country will have access to breast screening and follow up treatment where required. I also approved the appointment of a design team to progress the implementation of the expansion programme in the south and west. The design team will work up detailed plans for the construction of both BreastCheck clinical units.The BreastCheck clinical unit for the western area will be at the University College Hospital, Galway, with two associated mobile units. The area of coverage will be Counties Galway, Sligo, Roscommon, Donegal, Mayo, Leitrim, Clare and Tipperary NR. The BreastCheck clinical unit for the southern area will be at the South Infirmary/Victoria Hospital, Cork with three associated mobile units. The area of coverage will be Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Tipperary SR. and Waterford.The South Infirmary-Victoria Hospital, the Western Health Board and my Department and BreastCheck, are fully committed to a fast track approach to the roll-out of the programme and representatives are meeting this week to commence the design process.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	823	The civil registration service has been engaged in a major modernisation programme in recent years which includes conversion of all historic registration data to electronic format, development and implementation, on a countrywide basis, of a new computerised registration system. This work, which is key to the implementation of the Civil Registration Act 2004, is nearing completion. The Civil Registration Act 2004 provides for the commencement of the various provisions of the Act on a phased basis. It is anticipated that Parts 1,2, 3, 5 and 8 of the Act, which relate to the restructuring of the service and the registration of births, stillbirths and deaths will have been commenced by the end of 2004.The new procedures for marriage are set out in Part 6 of the Civil Registration Act and include universal procedures for notification, solemnisation and registration of marriages. Before these provisions can be commenced, a substantial body of work needs to be completed, including, regulations, guidelines and detailed procedures; establishment of a register of solemnisers, and the further development of the computer system to incorporate the new marriage provisions introduced by the Civil Registration Act.In addition, the General Register Office is decentralising to Roscommon at the end of 2004, and this involves considerable effort to ensure the transfer of skills and corporate knowledge to the new team. For these reasons An tArd Chláraitheoir is unable to give a specific date for implementation of the new marriage procedures, but it is unlikely to be before the middle of 2005. It is intended to give as much notice to the public as possible and a comprehensive public information campaign will be undertaken at the appropriate time.An tArd-Chláraitheoir is in touch with the Adoption Board in relation to the implementation of Part 4 of the Act, establishment of an electronic register of adoptions, and with the Courts Service in relation to the implementation of Part 7 of the Act, establishment of a register of decrees of divorce and decrees of nullity. However, it is not possible at the present time to give specific dates when these provisions of the Act can be implemented.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	824	As the Deputy is aware, the provision of orthodontic services is a matter for the health boards-authority in the first instance. I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I have taken a number of measures to increase the treatment capacity of the orthodontic service.The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. In 2003, my Department and the health boards funded 13 dentists from various health boards, including two from the Western Health Board, WHB, for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at three separate universities in the United Kingdom. These 13 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training in 2001. Thus, there is an aggregate of 19 dentists in specialist training for orthodontics. These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area.Furthermore, the commitment of the Department to training development is manifested in the funding provided to both the training of specialist clinical staff and the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics for the Cork Dental School. This appointment at the school will facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualification in orthodontics. The chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board has reported that the professor commenced duty on 1 December 2003. In recognition of the importance of this post at Cork Dental School my Department has given approval in principle to a proposal from the school to further substantially improve the training facilities there for orthodontics. This project should see the construction of a large orthodontic unit and support facilities; it will ultimately support an enhanced teaching and treatment service to the wider region under the leadership of the professor of orthodontics.In June 2002, my Department provided additional funding of €5 million from the treatment purchase fund towards the treatment of persons on the orthodontic waiting lists; the WHB received €465,000 from this fund. My Department instructed the health boards/authority that the funding was to be allocated on the basis of the following principles: treatment of clients longest on the waiting list in accordance with the severity of their treatment need; allocation to provide additional treatments over and above what was provided in the normal way; efficiency and value for money; and equitable delivery across health board populations.The allocation of additional funds will be considered in light of funding availability and the capacity of the health boards to strengthen the level of orthodontic services provided.The chief executive officers of the health boards-authority have informed my Department that at the end of the June quarter 2004, there were 20,236 children receiving orthodontic treatment in the public orthodontic service. This means that there are nearly twice as many children getting orthodontic treatment as there are children waiting to be treated.

The Department's letter of approval requested the preparation, by the board, of a management plan for all remaining planning stages up to tender stage. This management plan will allow the preparation of a timeframe for completion of the project.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	859	The Deputy is aware that the Comhairle na nOspidéal report on neurology and neurophysiology services recommended significant enhancement of neurology and neurophysiology services, including increases in consultant manpower. The comhairle report recommended the development of a consultant-staffed neurology unit at Limerick Regional Hospital to provide services for the mid-western region with links to the neuroscience centre in Cork.The implementation of the comhairle recommendations will be progressed having regard to the evolving policy framework in this area, competing funding priorities and the implementation of the report of the national task force on medical staffing, Hanly report.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	860	The report of the national task force on medical staffing — Hanly report — emphasised the need for 3,000 additional acute hospital beds and stressed the need to appoint more consultants. An assessment of the need for additional acute beds in Ennis will be a key element of the implementation of the Hanly's recommendations in the Mid-Western Health Board area.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	861	Up to the end of August 2004, a total of 887 patients from the mid-west region have been offered treatment under the national treatment purchase fund, NTPF, with 446 patients accepting an offer of treatment. My Department has been informed by the NTPF that the patient uptake of the NTPF option from the mid-west region is out of line with the position nationally. The NTPF and the Mid-Western Health Board are conducting an analysis of the take-up rate.The NTPF is confident that further opportunities exist to increase the take-up of referrals from the mid-west region. To assist this process, the NTPF has agreed to reduce the eligible time for patients from the mid-west to three months for all specialities.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	862	Work on the preparation of an outline development control plan, ODCP, for Ennis General Hospital has commenced and is now well underway. This work is being directed by a project team, which includes representatives of my Department, the Mid-Western Health Board, and the hospital. The design team has proposed alternative design options for consideration by the project team. These are now being examined and considered in the normal way. I understand that design work on the outline development control plan is nearing completion.The proposed priority areas for development include the accident and emergency department, out-patients department, radiology and in-patient ward areas. The ODCP will help to define the scope and content of the first phase of redevelopment for Ennis General Hospital and to confirm final decisions in relation to the sequence of construction work in due course. Funding will be made available by my Department, under the national development plan, to progress this project in 2005.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	863	I propose to take Questions Nos. 887 and 889 together.The provision of orthodontic services is a matter for the health boards in the first instance.I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I have taken a number of measures to improve orthodontic services in the North Western Health Board, NWHB, area and on a national basis. The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. In 2003, my Department and the health boards funded 13 dentists from various health boards, including one from the NWHB, for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at three separate universities in the United Kingdom. These 13 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training in 2001. Thus, there is an aggregate of 19 dentists in specialist training for orthodontics. These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area.Furthermore, the commitment of the Department to training development is manifested in the funding provided to both the training of specialist clinical staff and the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics for the Cork Dental School. This appointment at the school will facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualification in orthodontics. The chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board has reported that the professor commenced duty on 1 December 2003. In recognition of the importance of this post at Cork Dental School, my Department has given approval in principle to a proposal from the school to further substantially improve the training facilities there for orthodontics. This project should see the construction of a large orthodontic unit and support facilities; it will ultimately support an enhanced teaching and treatment service to the wider region under the leadership of the professor of orthodontics.Orthodontic initiative funding of €4.698 million was provided to the health boards-authority in 2001 and this has enabled health boards to recruit additional staff, engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients and build additional orthodontic facilities. The NWHB was allocated an additional €0.273 million in 2001 for orthodontic services of which €0.178 million was for the orthodontic initiative.In June 2002, my Department provided additional funding of €5 million from the national treatment purchase fund towards the treatment of persons on the orthodontic waiting lists; the NWHB received €285,000 from this fund. My Department instructed the health boards-authority that the funding was to be allocated on the basis of the following principles: treatment of clients longest on the waiting list in accordance with the severity of their treatment need; allocation to provide additional treatments over and above what was provided in the normal way; efficiency and value for money; and equitable delivery across health board populations.The allocation of additional funds will be considered in light of funding availability and the capacity of the health boards to strengthen the level of orthodontic services provided.The management of orthodontic staff in the NWHB is the statutory responsibility of the chief executive officer. Therefore, my Department has asked the chief executive officer of the NWHB to provide the Deputy with the information requested.Finally, the chief executive officers of the health boards-authority have informed my Department that at the end of the June quarter 2004, there were 20,236 children receiving orthodontic treatment in the public orthodontic service. This means that there are nearly twice as many children getting orthodontic treatment as there are children waiting to be treated.

Given the potential level of demand for orthodontic services, the provision of those services will continue to be based on prioritisation of cases based on treatment need, as happens under the existing orthodontic guidelines.The guidelines were issued in 1985. They are intended to enable health boards to identify in a consistent way those in greatest need and to commence timely treatment for them. Patients in category A require immediate treatment and include those with congenital abnormalities of the jaws such as cleft lip and palate, and patients with major skeletal discrepancies between the sizes of the jaws. Patients in category B have less severe problems than category A patients and are placed on the orthodontic treatment waiting list. Patients in category C have less severe problems than in category B. The number of cases treated is dependent on the level of resources available, in terms of qualified staff, in the area, and this is reflected in the treatment waiting list.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	885	Following the Medical Council's investigation into the conduct of Dr. Michael Neary, which found him guilty of professional misconduct in relation to ten patients, the Government established a non-statutory inquiry chaired by Judge Maureen Harding Clark. As will be appreciated, the information that can be divulged while its investigations are ongoing is limited. However, I am advised by the inquiry that it has conducted almost 100 interviews to date with patients, Medical Missionaries of Mary sisters, both consultant and non-consultant doctors, midwives, nurses, theatre staff and non-medical personnel from the hospital.The inquiry still desires to hear from any person who believes that he or she can supply information of relevance to its terms of reference. This includes any women who underwent peripartum hysterectomy in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, as well as midwives, doctors and other healthcare professionals working in the hospital during the period 1973 to 1998.

The majority of admissions to the Central Mental Hospital come from within the prison service. Accordingly, ease of access between the main Dublin prisons and the hospital would be of importance and I understand that the location of the hospital adjacent to a prison would have operational benefits for the prison service. On the other hand, it must be borne in mind that the Central Mental Hospital is a therapeutic, healthcare facility. I fully agree with families and carers who feel that it would not be desirable that the hospital be perceived as, or closely identified with, a prison complex.I understand that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has advanced proposals to develop a new prison complex replacing Mountjoy. I recognise the potential benefits of close co-operation between that project and the re-development of the Central Mental Hospital and I will be asking my officials to consider how the matter might be progressed to the mutual benefit of both services.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	889	Under EU regulations 1408/71, persons taking up permanent residence in Ireland who are in receipt of a social security pension from another EU member state, who are not in receipt of an Irish Department of Social and Family Affairs pension, as either a recipient or dependant and who cannot be regarded as employed or self-employed in Ireland, are entitled to receive health services free of charge and are issued with a medical card.For UK pensioners retiring to Ireland it is necessary to produce proof of their social security pension and in addition the health board must be satisfied that they are not employed or self-employed, that is, subject to PRSI and have an income above a certain ceiling, in Ireland or in receipt of a payment from the Irish Department of Social and Family Affairs.Where the EC regulations do not apply, persons with social security pensions from another EC member state are entitled to be assessed for medical cards by the chief executive officers of the health board on the normal eligibility criteria.With regard to the instance cited by the Deputy, when a pensioner under 70 from another member state takes up employment in Ireland, they cease to have automatic entitlement to a medical card. Such entitlement could be assessed again based on EU health regulations, or in the normal way, on the basis of means and residency, or by age if over 70, by the health board in the light of the factors outlined above.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	891	The health boards have statutory responsibility for the implementation of the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations 1996 and (Amendment) Regulations 1997, which give effect to the provisions of Part VII of the Child Care Act 1991 and provide for notification to, and inspection by, health boards of pre-school services. Under the legislation the boards appoint authorised officers to inspect the pre-school services in their area.The purpose of the regulations is to secure the health, safety and welfare of pre-school children and to promote the development of children attending pre-school services. The regulations are accompanied by an explanatory guide which makes recommendations in relation to the interpretation of certain terms in the regulations such as ‘adequate' and ‘sufficient'.My Department cannot require the health boards to interpret the regulations in a certain way. Health boards, using the guidance given in the explanatory guide and taking into account the various attributes of the services being inspected, must exercise their discretion reasonably in the course of an inspection. Given the wide range of notifiable pre-school services, it is not always possible or appropriate for health boards to be completely uniform in their implementation of the regulations. I understand from the health boards that they do, however, endeavour to implement the regulations in a uniform way where appropriate. I understand from information received from the boards that this may be done by having a regional management structure for pre-school services in place with responsibility for ensuring that the regulations are implemented in a uniform and transparent manner in each community care area, by addressing issues of uniformity at regional meetings where all staff participate and by having standard inspection forms for use by all inspection teams within a board. In addition, some boards share training courses and standards documents with other boards. A national forum of pre-school inspection staff is also in place which facilities sharing of information on implementation of the regulations.In the early years of the implementation of the regulations a monitoring group chaired by my Department was in place to assist the health boards in interpreting the regulations and in arriving at a uniform approach to inspections.A review of the regulations has been completed and a report on the review is being finalised. I understand that training issues for pre-school inspection staff which may arise as a result of the requirements of the revised regulations will be considered. I expect that the health services executive will have a role in relation to such matters, which will impact on uniformity of implementation.

I was very appreciative of the major effort which had gone into producing the report and identified it as a significant contribution to the debate on the future of diabetes services in this country. I decided to set up a working group to progress the issue further and asked the chief medical officer to act as chairman.The terms of reference were to examine: the current and predicted epidemiology of diabetes in Ireland; health promotion and preventive activities including screening; current service provision including the need to achieve better integration of care using current resources and the expansion of shares care services and; future needs in terms of service provision and staffing.The diabetes federation agreed to participate in the group and the chief executive officers of the health boards also nominated a number of professionals in relevant disciplines. The membership is completed by a number of senior officials from relevant policy divisions in the Department.The group held its first meeting in January 2004 and set out a work programme with a view to having a report as quickly as possible. However, the Diabetes Federation subsequently felt unable to continue to be represented at the group and a number of months passed without a meeting. In July, notwithstanding the continued absence of the federation representatives, the chairman recommenced the meetings of the group and meetings have been held in July and September. Progress has been made on a number of issues and the chairman has informed me that a further meeting is planned for early November. In the meantime, work will continue on progressing this important area of policy development.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	904	As the competent authority for the regulation of medicinal products in Ireland, the Irish Medicines Board assesses the quality, safety and efficacy of medicinal products. A product authorisation is only issued where the appropriate criteria are met in all three areas. The IMB also has responsibility for ensuring the ongoing quality and safety of medicinal products on the Irish market. These activities are carried out in conjunction with the European Medicines Evaluation Agency and international regulatory authorities.If the Deputy wishes to send me further information in regard to the studies to which he refers I will arrange to have them examined but I am advised that it is generally the case that a significant number of new drugs coming on the market are developments of existing products. While not all new drugs provide breakthrough treatments, benefits might be expected in terms of reduced dosage frequencies or reduced side effect profiles. Where similar products are available on the market, the introduction of an alternative new product may also have price competitive benefits. Currently, the choice between related or similar treatments for individuals is a matter for clinical judgment.Initiatives have been taken at EU level to develop products for rare conditions where the number of breakthrough medicines developed has been small due to the significant costs involved in bringing a new product to the market. It is hoped that these initiatives will stimulate research and development in this area, leading in turn to the development of genuine "breakthrough" products for rare conditions.With regard to the supply of medicinal products on the Irish market, an agreement is in place between the Department of Health and Children, the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, IPHA, and the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers of Ireland, APMI, which sets out the supply terms and prices of medicines supplied to the health services. The agreement covers all reimbursable prescription medicines in the general medical services and community drug schemes and all medicines supplied to hospitals and health boards.The current agreement expires in mid-2005 and the Department will shortly be entering into negotiation with IPHA-APMI. Any new agreement entered into must: be sensitive to the needs of stakeholders; ensure security of supply of medicines; meet the needs of patients; and achieve value for money for the taxpayer. In so far as the issues referred to by the Deputy relate to the supply of medicinal products to the Irish market, these matters will be considered in the context of the negotiations on the new agreement.

All the money, a total of €7.124 million between 2000 and 2003 and €3.492 million in the base funding for the board in 2004, is allocated to the South Eastern Health Board for these services and not subdivided into the different counties involved.Decisions about the geographical areas to be covered by co-operatives and the order in which developments occur are matters for the relevant health board, which must have regard to the range of financial and other issues involved in any such developments. Further expansion will be considered in the context of service requirements, health board proposals and funding availability.

This will focus on people on low incomes and will give priority to families with children, particularly those with a disability. The timing of the introduction of the extension will be decided having regard to the prevailing budgetary position.Income guidelines are drawn up each year by the health board/authority chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility for a medical card and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index, CPI. The last such increase was notified in January 2004. Health board chief executive officers have discretion in issuing medical cards and a range of income sources are excluded by the health boards when assessing medical card eligibility. Despite someone having an income that exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that a person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.The health strategy includes a series of initiatives to clarify and expand the existing arrangements for eligibility for health services, including recommendations arising from the review of the medical card scheme carried out by the health board CEOs under the PPF. These include streamlining applications and improving the standardisation of the medical card applications process to ensure better fairness and transparency; providing clearer information to people about how and where to apply for medical cards; proactively seeking out those who should have medical cards to ensure they have access to the services that are available.In addition, my Department is committed to the preparation of new legislation to update and codify the legal framework for eligibility and entitlements in regard to health services.

When completed, the commission's report will provide the basis for informing public debate prior to the finalisation of any policy proposals.Given the complexity of the issues under examination, it is difficult to be definitive about when the work of the commission will be completed.

Arrangements for the provision of the service are between the chiropodists and the authority.The Department was made aware of this action by the chiropodists and wrote to the authority advising of the inappropriateness of the charging of levies to medical card holders. A series of meetings have taken place between the authority and the Department in an attempt to assist the authority to resolve its difficulties with the chiropody scheme.Health boards are not statutorily obliged to provide chiropody services. It is not one of the attendant benefits of being a medical card holder. However, where they are provided, it is normally to people aged over 65 years and those with particular medical conditions.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	914	At a meeting which I had with the Survivors of Symphysiotomy — SOS — group late last year, I agreed that a range of measures would be put in place by the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, and the health boards to support the group. My Department is advised that the current position is as follows.The health boards and the relevant voluntary hospitals in the eastern region have appointed liaison officers, who have met and continue to meet with patients who have undergone symphysiotomy to discuss their health care needs. An exercise was conducted, in conjunction with the SOS group to profile patients in order to assist in formulating a needs assessment for each individual. The possible provision of a one-stop assessment centre at Cappagh Hospital, Dublin, and of a similar facility in the southern part of the country has recently been discussed with SOS members. This service would be provided by a multidisciplinary team which would assess interested patients within a short period of time. Following assessment, recommendations for care pathways would be discussed with individual patients.Independent clinical advice is available, on request, to patients who have undergone symphysiotomy. This has already been availed of by a number of members of SOS and appropriate follow up has been arranged. Independent counselling services are made available and have been provided to patients where requested. Information packs have been made available to general practitioners and relevant health care personnel. The ERHA and the health boards are also trying to ascertain the number of symphysiotomies carried out in hospitals throughout the country. This process is proving difficult to complete as the procedures were carried out some years ago and may have been undertaken in maternity units or in hospitals that no longer exist.The chief executive officers of the health boards and the ERHA have agreed to grant GMS eligibility, based on medical grounds, to SOS patients who do not have such eligibility. Arrangements are being made, in association with the GMS Payments Board, to issue a special patient identifier card that will allow for the fast tracking of patients requiring hospital appointments and treatments, together with the provision of certain non-GMS items recommended for patients by their GP and/or consultant.My Department is advised that, following a number of meetings with the SOS group, it was agreed to defer the establishment of a helpline. The provision of an information line will be the subject of further discussion with the group in the near future. The chief medical officer of my Department has tried to source an external reviewer to examine the practice of symphysiotomy as a tool of obstetrical practice in Ireland in past decades, taking into account the availability and safety of alternative procedures. The chief medical officer is continuing to seek a suitable international expert to perform this review.

This will focus on people on low incomes and will give priority to families with children, particularly those with a disability.

Despite someone having an income that exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that a person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.For those who do not qualify for a medical card, there are a number of schemes that provide assistance towards the cost of medication. Under the long-term illness scheme, persons suffering from a number of conditions can obtain the drugs and medicines required for the treatment of that condition free of charge. The conditions in question include intellectual disability such as Down's syndrome. Non-medical card holders and people with conditions not covered under the long-term illness scheme can avail of the drugs payment scheme. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than €78 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.The target in the lifetime of the Government is to further extend the medical card scheme to people on low incomes and to give priority to families with children, particularly those with a disability.

The CEO, in managing the workforce of the region, is responsible for determining the appropriate staffing mix and the precise grades of staff to be employed, including the prioritisation of front line service delivery posts, subject to overall employment remaining within the approved regional employment ceiling.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	918	My Department has issued approximately 75 individual letters of approval for capital projects to the North Eastern Health Board for the years 1998 to 2004 inclusive. These relate to all health care programmes and range from individual project investment to minor capital works approved on a regional funding basis for the board. While it would not be realistic for my Department to extract the proportions of total investment over the period in question made available for individual counties within the board, a significant proportion of this was in respect of counties Cavan and Monaghan. Details of such overall investment would be available from the board.The larger projects approved in recent times included new theatre facilities and ward upgrades at Monaghan General Hospital, significant re-equipping undertaken at Cavan General Hospital and new community nursing units provided at Virginia and Ballyconnell. Also, in 2000 for example, my Department approved under the national development plan a minor capital grant of just over €10 million for a special re-equipping and refurbishment initiative in both the acute and non-acute sectors in the board. A similar minor capital provision of €4 million in 2003 related to more than 100 individual items of works across the region and a further €5 million for minor capital developments was approved for the current year.The position with the new facility for older persons in Cootehill is that the North Eastern Health Board is in continuing discussions with the local voluntary group concerned about operating the new unit. The board hopes to satisfactorily conclude these discussions as soon as possible.

Accordingly, the Deputy's question has been forwarded to the chief executive officer of the South Eastern Health Board with a request that he examine the matter raised and reply directly to him, as a matter of urgency.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	920	The bursary model of supporting post-graduate clinical psychology training was adopted to underpin the implementation of a key recommendation of the joint review group on psychological services in the health services to substantially increase the number of training places in clinical psychology and support the establishment of new courses at the National University of Ireland, Galway, and the University of Limerick. The bursary model is intended to meet human resource requirements for the health service while securing the best return on the significant resources currently invested in the training of clinical psychologists.The terms of the model were agreed jointly by my Department with the health boards' directors of human resources group in August 2003. It is designed to assist students in undertaking post-graduate training in clinical psychology and provides each student with a bursary payment of €18,000 per annum, along with an annual contribution towards fees of €6,000 for the three years of the course. The Deputy may wish to note that the Health Service Employers Agency has recently requested the assistance of the Labour Relations Commission in addressing the industrial relations issues which have been raised by the national vocational group regarding this matter.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	921	The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has overall responsibility for the National Drugs Strategy 2001-08. This Department published a critical implementation path, CIP, earlier this year which acts as a road map outlining how the 100 actions contained in the strategy are being delivered.My Department is specifically responsible for implementing actions 38, 39, 40 and 41, with joint responsibility with the Department of Education and Science for action 42. Actions 44 to 66 are the responsibility of the regional health boards. Significant progress has been made on these actions. Action 38, for example, calls for an ongoing national drugs awareness campaign. This campaign was launched in May 2003 with the aim to increase awareness amongst the general population about problem drug use and its consequences across society. To date, phases one and two of the campaign have targeted the general population and parents respectively. Phase three will focus on the increasing use of cocaine among the 18 to 35 year old age cohort and will be launched in October 2004.With regard to action 39, my Department is consulting with health care and other representatives on the adequacy of present training programmes with a view to producing a report with recommendations to address any gaps. My Department has consulted with the health boards to develop performance indicators in line with action 40. The most relevant indicators have been identified and a common minimum set has been devised. These indicators have been used in service plans. During 2004, indicators are being reviewed with the relevant agencies to establish if the necessary information is being captured. Key performance indicators will continue to be developed.The report of the benzodiazepine committee was finalised and published in December 2002, as called for in action 41. A number of the recommendations of this report have been implemented, including the publication of good practice guidelines for clinicians, and work has commenced on the development of good practice guidelines for pharmacists. My Department and the Department of Education and Science have joint responsibility in conjunction with the health boards for actions 42 and 43.With regard to action 42, there is regular contact between my Department and the Department of Education and Science to ensure that the SPHE programme in primary and post-primary schools is informed by ongoing research. The health promotion unit is represented on the national advisory prevention sub-committee which has commissioned research into various aspects of drug use prevention. Also, my Department continues to link with the review of parenting support currently under way within the context of best health for children.With regard to action 43, guidelines to assist schools in the formation of a drugs policy were developed in conjunction with the Department of Education and Science and the health boards and issued to schools in 2002. Ongoing support is provided to schools to assist them in the development of substance abuse policies. All health and education personnel have been provided with training to support them in their work with schools. Many schools have developed policies and more are going through the development process. The Department of Education and Science is monitoring this process on an ongoing basis.Health boards are at various stages in the implementation of the actions of the national drugs strategy. With regard to action 44, counselling and assessment is available quickly in all health boards. Treatment in a large number of boards is available within one month. However, some boards have not yet reached this target and waiting lists have developed. Health boards continue to work to address this situation. The target set for action 45 was achieved in January 2003 with 6672 people receiving methadone treatment. At the end of August 2004, there were 7091 people receiving methadone treatment. Service user charters have been developed for all health boards in line with action 46.Work within health boards on developing plans for treatment services on a continuum of care model approach, in line with action 47, is ongoing. In the ERHA, where the services are most developed, a large amount of progress has been made on this action. The area health boards are continuing to develop their services around a continuum of care model. There is no specific grade of "key worker". Where the key worker system has been adopted, an individual worker who is part of the multidisciplinary team, such as nurse, counsellor or the like, takes responsibility as the key person for working with the client.With regard to action 48, health boards provide a range of residential and day treatment and rehabilitation programmes both directly and through section 65 and mainstreamed local drug task force projects. In the ERHA region, rehabilitation co-ordinators have been appointed and are working to ensure that service users are assisted in developing a planning programme of progression through the addiction services. Work on the continued development of this action will continue throughout the lifetime of the strategy.Action 49 called for the development of a protocol for the treatment of under 18 year olds presenting with serious drug problems. The Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, established a working group, chaired by an official from my Department and comprising a broad range of statutory and non-statutory service providers and community representatives, in October 2001. This report has been finalised and arrangements for its publication are being made. In anticipation of the group's findings, my Department has this year allocated funding of €500,000 to the ERHA to fund the development of services for this age cohort.The process of developing quality standards is ongoing in conjunction between the health boards and the national advisory committee on drugs, NACD. A joint seminar on quality standards was hosted by the ERHA and the NACD at the end of 2003. Development of this action — 50 — will continue during 2004 in order to have guidelines in place in each health board from 2005.With regard to action 51, the three area health boards in the ERHA have drawn up a planned programme for the development of addiction services, including treatment and rehabilitation services, on a yearly basis as part of their planning process. Work will be ongoing during 2004-05 to implement plans in all health boards outside the ERHA. The under 18 report will also influence this action with regard to treatment of young people. Each health board, in line with action 52, has produced and widely distributed a short, easy to read guide to the drug services available within their region with contact numbers for further information and assistance.In line with action 53, the area health boards in the eastern region have established a management plan and monitoring committees with local communities in the establishment of new treatment and rehabilitation facilities and are continuing the consultation with monitoring committees where they are already in existence. This issue has not arisen in most non-ERHA boards but will be taken on board in the context of the development of any centres in the future. The integration of child care facilities is being taken into account with the development of new services as called for in action 54. Existing facilities present limited possibilities for on-site child care options. A number of health boards have raised issues as regards the appropriateness of on-site integration and are examining other options.With regard to action 55, the three area health boards of the ERHA and the drug treatment centre board, DTCB, offer a range of alternative medical and non-medical treatment options within their service at various locations. In addition, health boards provide section 65 grants and mainstream funding to some voluntary and community groups to provide alternative therapies within their area. A pilot programme with lofexidine is operating in the Northern Area Health Board and a pilot programme with buprenorphine is taking place in the DTCB.With regard to action 56, health boards are liaising with general practitioners and pharmacists in order to increase their engagement in the provision of services for drug misusers. At the end of August 2004, there were 219 GPs and 317 pharmacists involved in the methadone treatment protocol nationally. This compares with 164 GPs and 220 pharmacists in December 2000. With regard to action 57, health boards provide a range of residential and day treatment and rehabilitation programmes both directly and through section 65 and mainstreamed local drug task force projects. Work on this action will continue throughout the lifetime of the strategy.All health boards continually liaise with the national advisory committee on drugs, NACD, in line with action 58. The NACD is currently conducting an ongoing longitudinal study on treatment outcomes, ROSIE report, which will give better information on the most effective forms of treatment for drug users.With regard to actions 59 and 60, under 18 year olds are prioritised throughout the addiction services in all health boards. Emergency assessment and immediate access to counselling is available to this age cohort. The drug treatment centre board established a dedicated young persons programme in 2001 to meet the needs of young drug misusers. Health boards have appointed suicide resource officers.Drop-in centres and after care services are provided by health boards and agencies funded under section 65 grants, in line with action 61. The development of these services will continue throughout the lifetime of the strategy within the context of available resources. Actions 62 and 63 call for the development of needle exchange facilities. Since the launch of the national drugs strategy in 2001 additional harm reduction facilities have been developed by the three area health boards of the ERHA directly and in partnership with voluntary and community sectors in Tallaght, Celbridge, Athy, Inchicore, Killinarden, Dundrum, Coolmine, Darndale, Coolock and Corduff. These services will continue to be developed by the ERHA taking into account the recent NACD report on harm reduction.It is important to note that annual additional funding of €52 million has been provided to health boards to address the problem of drug misuse. This has allowed for the employment of more than 730 people in the delivery of drug addiction services which include: outreach — making contact with drug users not currently accessing services, advising on services, on safer injecting and sex practices, providing needle exchange; education — helping to implement the education component of the national drugs strategy and providing services to drug users, schools, families, local communities and professional groups on drug related issues; treatment — a range of interventions including assessment, stabilisation, harm reduction measures, care planning, methadone maintenance, counselling and detoxification within specialist clinics, residential settings and within community settings; rehabilitation — the provision of a range of options including residential and day programmes and a planning and brokerage service designed to equip drug users with the skills and tools for progression and reintegration; community welfare — a service to assist clients with accommodation and income maintenance needs.Services provided by a range of voluntary and community sector organisations which are funded and co-ordinated by the health boards include: drop-in services; peer support services; family support; education services; counselling services; rehabilitation and after care services; HIV/AIDS support; training services; personal development training.Much progress has already been made, although it must also be recognised that there are areas that require development and this must be achieved in the context of available resources. This is an eight year strategy up to 2008 and much more will be achieved in this time frame. As part of the strategy a mid-term review is currently being undertaken by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. My Department is actively involved in this review, which aims to examine progress so far and refocus efforts where identified and required.

It is an issue which is receiving attention within my Department.My Department has been actively involved in the national steering committee on violence against women, under the chairpersonship of our colleague, Deputy O'Dea, Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. My Department also plays an active role in the "Raising the Standards" group, a body representing the UK, Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Republic of Ireland, which looks at best practice in the treatment of victims of domestic and sexual violence.There are currently four sexual assault treatment units. These are based in Dublin, Cork, Letterkenny and Waterford. Today, 29 September, my Department will propose to the national steering committee on violence against women that it establish a sub-committee to exclusively look at the treatment services for victims of alleged sexual crime. This proposal names the bodies which, because of their expertise, should be included in this sub-committee. The terms of reference, as proposed by my Department, ask that this sub-committee present its findings and recommendations, complete with verifiable costings, by the end of June 2005. I hope the work of this group will result in a model for optimum delivery of services to victims of alleged sexual assault.

The approved, paypath, salary scale for home helps employed in the health service, based on a 39 hour working week, ranges from €24,268 to €25,368 per annum. The Deputy may wish to note that home helps employed in the health service benefit from standard terms and conditions of employment available to all grades of health service staff. These include pension and sick pay entitlements available to part-time staff under the relevant employment legislation.

Vehicle in-service standards are specified in the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations 1963 which requires vehicles to be fitted with a silencer or other device that is suitable and sufficient for reducing to a reasonable level the noise caused by the escape of exhaust gases from the engine. An examination of the silencer to assess its effectiveness in reducing noise is part of the NCT and the roadworthiness test carried out on commercial vehicles. It is an offence to use in a public place a vehicle which causes excessive noise. Enforcement of the law in this regard is a matter for the Garda Síochána.

They were requested to review a range of options for increasing the operational height of the tunnel, their feasibility, having regard to the state of implementation of the current design and build contract and the likely additional costs and impact on the project completion date.Having reviewed the findings of the report further information was sought from the NRA pertaining to its conclusions in particular in relation to the costs should the tunnel height be increased. As a result, the contractors were requested to provide a fixed price cost for the work involved. A quotation was received from the contractors and is currently under consideration with a view to making a final decision as soon as possible. When this matter has been brought to a conclusion I will place the relevant documentation in the public arena.The contract for the port tunnel, which is a design and build contract, was awarded in December 2000 in the sum of €448 million. At that time when land acquisition, construction supervision etc. were included it was anticipated that the all-in cost including construction, would be in the region of €580 million. The construction period will extend to quarter three or quarter four 2005, and allowing for the operation of the price variation clause over that five year period, it is currently estimated that the final outturn cost, including price variation, will be in the region of €715 million, current prices. The cost increase between the all-in cost at 2001 prices and the all-in cost prices in 2004 is attributable to the price variation clause which takes account of construction cost inflation over the period concerned including both the costs of labour and materials.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	934	I propose to take Questions Nos. 970, 978, 979, 1000 and 1016 together.The board of Aer Lingus approved the Aer Lingus business plan for the period 2004-07 at its meeting on 26 July 2004 and it is now in the process of implementation.This business plan is seen as an essential follow-on to the survival plan taking account of the overall business environment and the particular vulnerability of the aviation sector. The ongoing financial difficulties of many airlines across Europe and the US, coupled with experience domestically over the years, demonstrate the highly competitive and constantly challenging nature of the aviation sector. The sector's problems are compounded at the present time by the increased capacity coming on stream, particularly in the low cost sector and by increasing fuel costs.In this turbulent climate, Aer Lingus cannot be complacent about its future performance and must remain constantly vigilant to changing market conditions in order to maintain competitiveness. Experience over the years has shown that it is not sufficient merely to react to events — the airline must anticipate and plan for difficulties and challenges.While Aer Lingus is currently profitable, the best judgment of the board and management is that it can only sustain this performance by becoming operationally more efficient and more flexible. This is the aim of the business plan. Its implementation is seen as crucial so that the airline can position itself to respond in a timely manner to changing market conditions and can take advantage of future growth opportunities. Moreover, management must also seek to ensure that Aer Lingus is strong enough financially to weather market downturns, including those caused by external shocks such as the impact of terrorist attacks, wars, etc. and has funds to replace and expand its fleet. Failure to take account of these matters in planning for the future would inevitably lead to another crisis scenario and, indeed, would be reckless given the history of the sector.The plan involves redundancies of around 1,300 over the next three years. To achieve this target, the company recently announced details of a voluntary severance scheme comprising attractive options for staff of all ages, service and salary categories in the airline. I hope the redundancies will be achieved voluntarily. I welcome the recent agreement by management and staff to engage in discussions with the assistance of an independent facilitator on staff related issues arising from implementation of the business plan. Those discussions are to conclude by mid-October 2004.On the future of Aer Lingus, at the end of June 2004 senior management in Aer Lingus requested permission to develop an investment proposal for the company. Consent was not given. Following the request, I briefed the Government fully on the matter at its meeting on 6 July 2004 and as a result the Government decided to establish a Cabinet sub-committee to examine all the issues relating to the future of Aer Lingus and report back to Government as soon as possible. Goldman Sachs has been engaged to provide advice and assistance to my Department regarding this issue. The Goldman Sachs report, which is due shortly, will form an input into my deliberations and those of the Cabinet sub-committee prior to any decision by Government on the future of Aer Lingus. It may be complemented by further advice on the strategic and policy issues as deemed necessary by the Government.In accordance with the terms of Sustaining Progress, there will be engagement between the Department and the social partners on the future of Aer Lingus before the Government finalises its consideration of this matter.

The situation since then is unchanged. The location of stations on the rail network is a matter for the board of Irish Rail.The company informs me it has no plan, at present, to build a second railway in Drogheda. While I understand that Irish Rail has had some representations regarding a second station at the north side of the town, there are some concerns from a technical perspective about the close proximity of the two stations. In any event, a new station would have to be supported by high-density development within its immediate area.

The location of stations on the rail network is a matter for Irish Rail.The company informs me that it has examined the case for re-opening Dunleer station on a number of occasions in the past. A review of the Dublin suburban rail strategy conducted on behalf of the company, concluded that the station would only have very modest daily boardings given the population of the area. However, I understand that a new development plan has been approved for Dunleer, which involves significant population growth. While I understand that Irish Rail has not yet seen the revised development plan, the company has indicated that it is prepared to re-examine its position regarding the re-opening of the station if the plan is adopted and funding can be provided from developers.

The directive, which replaces EU Directive 71/127/EEC, as amended, harmonises the rules relating to the type-approval of devices for indirect vision, including mirrors and cameras-monitors, on motor vehicles and vehicles equipped with these devices. The directive provides that from 26 January 2005 member states may not prohibit the sale, registration or entry into service of a vehicle that meets the requirements laid down in the directive. New heavy goods vehicles and buses entering into service from 26 January 2007 will be required to meet the standards in the directive.While the directive applies to new vehicles only, the feasibility of applying its standards to vehicles currently in service is being examined by my Department. Subject to any practical engineering constraints, it is my intention to require retrofitting of the necessary mirrors and/or cameras and monitors to existing vehicles of the types covered by the directive.

To assist the public consultation process, I will be making available with the draft regulations a background paper which will outline the considerations of the various interests involved in this matter. The significant pertinent issues, such as the business context, rail safety, road safety, infrastructure protection, environmental considerations and the European context together with the transitional arrangements to apply, will be addressed in the background paper. The consultation period will provide an opportunity for all interested parties to make their views known to me before a final decision on this matter.I have not had discussions with other member states in relation to this matter. This aspect will be addressed in the context of the EU-wide consultations which the European Commission will undertake when I notify it of my intention to make the regulations. This notification will be by way of a submission of a copy of the final draft of the regulations. I expect that the EU consultations will take some three to four months to complete.

It is an offence to operate without such a licence and any persons found to be doing so can be prosecuted through the courts if they do not cease operations or immediately comply with licensing requirements.The most effective way of uncovering illegal operations has proven to be the confidential freefone complaints line and the confidential written complaints system, both of which provide my Department with information on alleged illegal haulage. Already this year, my Department has taken action on 117 complaints regarding illegal haulage operations and consignor companies which engaged illegal hauliers.I have also taken action where operators have failed to respond to requests for relevant documentation to prove they still comply with the EU licensing criteria of good repute, appropriate financial standing and professional competence.To date, I have informed 50 licensees of my intention to suspend or revoke their licences, of which 29 now stand revoked or suspended and a further 21 are going through the appeals procedure. There are a further 50 licences in the process of being reviewed and I will be writing to these operators in due course. All the above measures will help to tighten the net of sanctions against those who operate haulage services illegally and those companies which contract their services.

A road haulage review implementation group consisting of representatives of IBEC, the IRHA and the Department, was established in June 1999 to implement the recommendations of the strategy.No definitive implementation timescales were laid down in the strategy but the following progress has been made: the Department, in consultation with the IRHA on behalf of the industry and also IBEC, has taken initiatives to strengthen the regulation of the road haulage sector; the enforcement resources of the Department were increased with the addition of three transport officers and support staff; a strategic development plan for the IRHA has been put in place and Government funding totalling €635,000 over five years has been provided; the Department maintains close contact and co-operation with the Gárda Siochána and other enforcement agencies in the enforcement of road transport legislation; training courses for hauliers aimed at improving profitability and management of the sector have been provided by the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport in Ireland in association with FÁS. This training is ongoing.A programme of action for the road haulage Industry was published in January 2001. The programme builds on the Government's 1999 strategy and a steering group, formed to implement the programme of action, has subsumed the work of the road haulage review implementation group.Most recently, the work of the steering group has been focusing specifically on the problem of illegal haulage. It is estimated that about 15% of haulage vehicles on the road are operating illegally. A structured system for submitting information on instances of illegal haulage to my Department is in operation and has recently been enhanced by the introduction of a freefone service for reporting complaints against illegal operators.All information received is investigated by my Department's transport officers, often in co-operation with the Garda. The increased co-operation and intelligence sharing between my Department, the IRHA, the Garda and other enforcement agencies has resulted in increased levels of detection and prosecution of illegal operators. It has also facilitated the identification and prosecution of those companies which are illegally employing them.

I propose to progress the passage of this Bill through the Houses of the Oireachtas in the immediate future.When relevant sections of the proposed new statute are subsequently commenced, the default speed limit of 80 km/h will automatically apply, through operation of the statute, to the rural non-national road network. In essence therefore the reduction of the present speed limit of 60 mph to 80 km/h, just under 50 mph, will be made as part of the metrication changeover process with effect from a commencement date that I will prescribe in regulations after the Bill has been enacted.I announced earlier this month that it is my intention that the metric speed limits will be in place on 20 January 2005 and I have established a metrication changeover board to oversee the delivery of this task.

Under these regulations, a licence may only be granted following presentation of a vehicle test certificate and certificate of suitability issued by the National Car Testing Service, NCTS, which confirms that the vehicle is suitable for the purpose of being licensed as a taxi, wheelchair accessible taxi, hackney or limousine, as appropriate. The testing of a vehicle for taxi licensing purposes is undertaken by NCTS in accordance with the relevant regulatory requirements, including the requirements for wheelchair accessible taxis contained in the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) (Amendment) Regulations 1998 (SI No. 47 of 1998), in the case of such a licence application. There is no financial assistance available to assist vehicle owners to convert vehicles to comply with the requirements of the wheelchair accessible taxi specification.The Taxi Regulation Act 2003 specifically provides that an objective of the Commission for Taxi Regulation is to promote access to small public service vehicles by persons with disabilities. In this regard, the commission will be tasked with the determination of the future policy in relation to accessible taxis, including the consideration of possible revisions or improvements to the existing wheelchair accessible taxi specification. It is envisaged that this will necessitate specific discussions with both disability and taxi representative groups.Under the public service vehicle regulations the granting and renewal of wheelchair accessible taxi licences is the responsibility of individual local licensing authorities to whom applications for licences are made. Accordingly, information regarding the total number of wheelchair accessible taxis licensed currently is not available in my Department.

Among other things I will point out to the group that Area Development Management Limited is administering the rural transport initiative on behalf of my Department. ADM alone is responsible for making the decisions on specific allocations for individual rural transport initiative projects from funding provided by my Department. Neither the Department nor I have any function with regard to this aspect of the rural transport initiative. However, in addition to the original 2004 allocation ADM has recently made a supplementary allocation to the project concerned in view of its emerging financial difficulties. The project benefits each year from funding being provided by the Department of Social and Family Affairs under the application of the free travel scheme to the rural transport initiative.ADM has informed me that in some cases, rural transport initiative projects have also been able to generate additional funds from providing services to health boards and from other sources. From the outset rural transport initiative projects have been encouraged to source such funding. The degree of co-financing and additional resources secured from non-Exchequer sources were among the operational criteria used to assess the original applications for funding under the rural transport initiative.There has been no reduction in the funding provided by my Department for the rural transport initiative this year. On the contrary, the funding for this initiative has been more than doubled from that originally planned for it. By the end of this year my Department will have spent €9 million on the initiative compared to the €4.4 million earmarked for it in the National Development Plan 2000-2006. The rural transport initiative was originally due to conclude at the end of 2003. However, I extended this pilot initiative for a further year to the end of 2004 to facilitate a proper evaluation of the scheme. ADM recently concluded that evaluation and I will now consider the future of the initiative in the light of its findings.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	959	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1001 and 1021 together.The issues raised are a matter for the contractor, Dublin City Council, and the National Roads Authority. I understand from the NRA that a safety audit of the project confirms that the Dublin Port tunnel complies in all respects with the requirements of the proposed EU directive on safety on road tunnels. The NRA also informs me that the operating system for the tunnel and the ventilation and safety systems have been designed with safety as a paramount parameter. This ventilation system, along with a package of further safety measures including emergency telephones, lay-bys, pedestrian and vehicular cross passages, continuous CCTV coverage of the tunnels, a 24 hour manned control room, fire detection equipment, incident detection equipment, to mention just some, represents a comprehensive approach to ensuring the safe passage of vehicles through the port tunnel.The NRA advises that the operating system for the Dublin Port tunnel is in line with the best international practice. Dublin City Council says that in ongoing monitoring of the contractor's designs by the construction supervisors appointed by the council, some concerns regarding the design of floor slabs in the cut and cover tunnel sections were identified. A detailed review of this design issue is ongoing. If remedial measures are called for at any stage the contractor is required to implement them at its expense. These measures would be relatively straightforward and uncomplicated to carry out and by their nature would not lead to delays. Contrary to the impression that may have been created, the tunnel structures are safe and stable. Where small problems arise as they inevitably and routinely do with projects of this size, Dublin City Council and its construction supervisors ensure that they are detected and rectified. The tunnel's construction work has been monitored in detail since the project commenced in 2001. This monitoring of the design and construction processes detects and rectifies deficiencies, if they arise. The quality control exercised in the port tunnel project is effective and working.The contract for the port tunnel, which is a design and build contract, was awarded in December 2000 in the sum of €448 million. At that time when land acquisition, construction supervision etc. were included it was anticipated that the all-in cost, including construction, would be in the region of €580 million. The construction period will extend to quarter 3 or quarter 4 of 2005 and allowing for the operation of the price variation clause over that five year period, the NRA estimates that the final outturn cost, including price variation, will be in the region of €715 million at current prices. The cost increase between the all-in cost at 2001 prices and the all-in cost prices in 2004 is attributable to the price variation clause which takes account of construction cost inflation over the period concerned including the costs of labour and materials. I am not aware of any staffing issues that will impact on the port tunnel project.

There will be six free travel days, with paid passenger services commencing on Monday 4 October. The red line is 15 kilometres in length, five kilometres of which are on-street, with 23 stops and 34 road crossings along its alignment. The scheduled journey time from Tallaght to Connolly Station is 43 minutes and it is hoped to achieve this journey time in the coming weeks as road traffic becomes more familiar with the presence of Luas on the various intersections where Luas and road traffic share road space. After an initial running-in period, trams will operate at five minute intervals at peak times with 12 trams in each direction each hour. Expected daily patronage is approximately 40,000. The red line will enhance the integration of transport services in the Dublin area, as it links Heuston Station to Connolly Station and Bus Áras, in addition to providing a vital rail link to the rapidly expanding Tallaght area.

Since passenger services commenced on the green line, there have been five incidents. Of those two involved collision with cars, two were derailments and one involved collision between two trams. There has been no incident reported since yesterday's opening of the red line. However, during the testing and commissioning phase for the red line, there were six incidents, all involving cars driving into the path of trams. None of the incidents to date have resulted in a fatality or serious injury.Other light rail systems worldwide have had experience of similar incidents in the early days of operation. There is an onus on motorists, cyclists and pedestrians to take care for their own safety along the Luas lines, particularly in the early period of its operation, when people are getting used to sharing road space with trams. Anecdotal evidence suggests that motorists are not properly respecting yellow box junctions, traffic signals and stop signs at Luas intersections. Driver behaviour must change for the safety of the motorists themselves and for the safety of Luas passengers.

An inspector from the interim Railway Safety Commission visited the crossing on the day of the incident and inspected the signalling and other infrastructure in the vicinity of the crossing. The inspector followed up his visit to the site by putting a detailed set of questions to Iarnród Éireann which is conducting an inquiry into the incident and as part of this inquiry is examining all the issues raised by the inspector. Preliminary indications are that a fault in the signalling equipment at the location may have been the cause of the incident but it would be premature to take a definitive view on this until the Iarnród Éireann inquiry is completed. Iarnród Éireann has examined all signalling equipment on its network which is similar to that at Ballymahon and is satisfied that it is operating satisfactorily.

Section 75 of the Roads Act 1993 provides that a road authority may by order close a public road to traffic. The Road Regulations 1994 (SI 119 of 1994) set out the procedure to be followed by a road authority in making such an order. Section 75(2)(d) of the Roads Act 1993 provides that a person who closes a public road without lawful authority, that is, except in accordance with an order by the relevant road authority, is guilty of an offence.Dublin City Council, which is the relevant road authority in this instance, informs me that a film production company was filming over several nights in adjacent streets with permission, but that no permission was granted or requested for the closure of Upper Buckingham Street by the production company. The council is following up the incident with the production company and considering what further action to take.

The cost benefit and multi-criteria analyses carried out as part of the review showed that the proposal did not perform very well in terms of net economic benefit and therefore it was not included by the consultants in the recommended investment strategy of the review. However, the review was conducted at a strategic level rather than as a feasibility exercise and it has been made clear to me that many interests in the Shannon region see this proposed rail link as bringing strong economic benefits to the region. Accordingly, I am asking Iarnród Éireann to undertake a feasibility study on the viability of this proposal in consultation with various local interests, similar to the study previously undertaken by Iarnród Éireann on the Cork-Middleton line.

It is likely, therefore, that the application of the person concerned will be finalised around the end of this year. As I have previously stated, there are more than 650 staff members employed by my Department in the provision of services for or in respect of non-nationals. Unfortunately, it has been the case that over 70% of those staff are engaged full-time in activities associated with the actual processing of asylum claims or in the provision of support for asylum applicants. However, the significant reduction in the numbers of asylum applicants is now giving me an opportunity to re-focus those resources on areas of service provision for non-nationals which are under-resourced at this point in time. The citizenship area is one of the areas which will benefit from that process.

No documentation was submitted to show they had ever met, nor were the details of the wedding she was proposing to attend enclosed. The application was refused because the visa officer was unable to conclude, on the basis of the documentation supplied to my Department, that the applicant would observe the conditions of the visa.In February 2004, some five months following the refusal of the visa, the applicant's Irish sponsor submitted an appeal on her behalf.

A number of submissions have been made to the dedicated address on my Department's website which was set up to facilitate a consultation process. However, I am conscious, in particular, of the overriding necessity to ensure that public safety and security are given priority in any review of policy and legislation regarding firearms. With this in mind, and taking into account a recent increase in violent crime involving firearms, I decided to bring forward at an early stage certain proposals for inclusion in the Criminal Justice Bill 2004. The Bill as published contains one of those proposals, to provide for the secure custody of firearms, at section 30. Other provisions will be brought forward in the form of amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage. In addition, any relevant recommendations arising from the tribunal of inquiry into the fatal shooting of Mr. JohnCarthy at Abbeylara, County Longford, on 20 April 2000 — the Barr tribunal — will be considered for inclusion in legislation either in the Criminal Justice Bill or a future firearms Bill, depending on the timing of the conclusion of the tribunal.

The progress of the programme was commented upon very favourably by the mid-term evaluators of both the regional operational programmes and the National Development Plan 2000-2006 and, following the mid-term review, additional funding of approximately €12 million was made available for the child care measures. This brings the total funding available for the programme to €449.3 million.There has been considerable demand from community based groups for capital grant assistance under the programme and every county has benefited significantly from grants to provide new and enhanced community based child care facilities and to support capital developments in the private child care sector. ADM, on behalf of my Department, is currently carrying out an extensive review of the programme's capital commitments to date, numbering over 1,100 and at a value of €114 million, to ensure that all the grant commitments previously entered into will be realised. Projects may be awaiting planning permission or the completion of tender processes before reasonable assurance can be taken that they will proceed and, if they do not, the funding set aside can be decommitted and made available to another project. Expenditure under the programme covers the period to the end of 2007 and must take place in a planned manner as must grant approvals to ensure that the programme can meet its financial commitments at all times.In addition, my Department has recently reviewed the different budget lines under the EOCP, including the capital programme, to ensure that the most effective use is made of all remaining funding in accordance with the programme's objectives and this has brought to €157 million the total allocation for the capital development of child care under the present programme. At the same time, an extensive review of child care provision on the ground has taken place to identify obvious service gaps, the filling of which will be a priority using the remaining capital funding which currently amounts to about €35 million, of which about €25 million is being earmarked for community based not for profit child care groups that provide services for young children to support their parents who may be in employment, education and training.I intend to allocate the remaining capital funding under this strand of the Government's commitment to child care to address the most immediate service gaps. As a result, all the projects in the pipeline on 30 April 2004 have been reviewed again by ADM Limited on the basis of geographical need, the range of services being offered, value for money and the capacity of the groups to complete a project before the end of the programme in 2007. Those projects which best meet the criteria will receive priority funding from the capital funding which remains unallocated at this point.I have made inquiries and I understand that an application for capital grant assistance was received from this group on 18 June 2004. This application has been forwarded to Area Development Management Limited, which has been engaged by my Department to carry out a thorough assessment against the programme's criteria for grant assistance, on my behalf. Given the relatively recent submission of the project, it will not be considered for funding under the current review process I have outlined above but it will be considered for funding should additional capital resources come available.The allocation of any additional funding which might come available to me will also be allocated on the basis of local need, levels of service being offered and value for money. In the interim, it would be premature of me to comment further on this capital grant application.

One of the aims of the pilot was to test the relevant technology with a view to extending it on a nationwide basis. Following the successful completion of the pilot project, the Garda Síochána prepared a business case for the extension of the system and this was submitted to me by the Garda Commissioner for consideration.I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda medical director, in conjunction with an independent engineering company, was tasked with formulating a report on the possible adverse effects on human health when using TETRA technology. Having sourced and examined numerous worldwide studies on the subject, the conclusion was that measured levels of exposure from TETRA base stations, hand portables and mobile units are well below the guidelines recommended by the International Commissioner on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection, ICNIRP. I have also been informed by the Garda authorities that there is no reason to believe that TETRA systems interfere with other properly installed broadcast or television systems.

The Deputy should note that support towards staffing costs under the equal opportunities child care programme 2000-2006 is only made available to those projects which can demonstrate they are providing child care in areas of significant disadvantage and are supporting parents to access employment, education or training.Subsequently, this community group was awarded a capital grant of €64,420 in July 2002. In November 2003, the group was awarded staffing continuation funding of €30,000 to cover the period up to the end of 2004. At that point, the programme appraisal committee was advised that the level of funding recommended was sufficient to provide the service being offered by the group and the level of disadvantage in the area. There are no plans at present to review the level of funding being made available to this particular group until the end of the current year.As a large number of projects are now beginning to come to the end of their original funding cycle, the priorities of the staffing measure of the programme are being re-examined in light of the available resources. Staffing grant assistance was intended to offer support for a limited number of years to community based child care projects which focus on disadvantage during the period when their services developed and as they moved towards sustainability. Proposals in respect of ongoing staffing supports to groups whose original funding or continuation funding elapses shortly are currently being developed in my Department. In this context, it is expected that only those groups which clearly provide child care services for families with significant levels of disadvantage and where the parents are in employment, education or training will receive ongoing staffing supports under the equal opportunities child care programme 2000-2006.

However, the courts do exercise wardship jurisdiction in respect of mentally incapacitated persons and of minors. Individuals who are mentally incapacitated and are brought into wardship before reaching the age of majority, namely, 18 years of age, are taken in as minors.Prisoners with mental health problems have access to medical, nursing, psychiatric, and psychology services within the prison system. Where a prisoner develops a short term mental illness and happens to be located in a prison where the incidence of such problems is insufficient to justify the provision of dedicated services, arrangements may be made for temporary transfer of the prisoner concerned to an alternative prison location where care can be provided. Where in-patient treatment is indicated, prisoners may be transferred to the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum.As regards the provision of mental health services to people within prison, the priority is on seeking to ensure the availability of any service deemed necessary within the resource constraints applying. It is, of course, the principle to apply similar regulations and norms, in as much as these apply to this age category, as apply elsewhere in the general community.

The programme, announced on 28 September 2004 by the Government Chief Whip for the autumn session, is also absent of any such proposal. However, the area continues to be kept under review by my Department taking into account the work of the money advice and budgeting service.

Since the commencement of the Immigration Act 1999 in November of that year, a total of 9,982 deportation orders have been made to date. Details for the past three years are as follows:YearOrders MadeOrders Enforced20022,31552120032,0365902004 (up to 31/8/04)2,001390Deportation orders are served on the individuals concerned at their last given address with a requirement on them to present themselves to the Garda national immigration bureau so that arrangements can be made for their removal from the State. Of the 9,982 persons who were notified of their deportation orders since November 1999, over 2,000 have been deported to date. The vast majority of the remainder failed to present themselves to the Garda national immigration bureau as required and are classified as evaders who are subject to arrest and detention for the purposes of ensuring their deportation. It is not known how many of these are still in the State. The Department of Social and Family Affairs is notified of all deportations effected and persons evading deportation orders so that their social welfare benefits may be suspended.

The number of outstanding appeals in the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, RAT, was 1,637. Only some 1,589 of these applications are over six months old, as compared with 6,500 at the end of September 2001.I am pleased to inform the Deputy that processing is moving strongly in both the ORAC and RAT with the number of cases on hand in the ORAC at the end of August 2004 down by some 48% since September 2003. As regards the RAT, the number of cases on hand at the end of August 2004 has deceased by 43% since September 2003.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1002	An illegal immigrant is a person whose presence in the State is otherwise than in accordance with our immigration laws. Obviously the term covers persons who entered the State in breach of those laws — either covertly or using false documentation. However, it would also cover persons who entered lawfully but remain beyond the duration of the permission given, or who, although required to adhere to certain conditions — for example, prohibited from working — are in breach of those conditions.It is never easy to quantify persons engaging in this type of illegal activity because, by definition, such persons are motivated to ensure either that they remain hidden or at least to ensure that the illegal aspect of their presence in the State remains hidden. Their physical presence in the State is characterised by the absence of a permission or by the misuse of a permission which has been granted — matters which do not lend themselves easily to objective statistical analysis. As a result very few modern democratic countries are able to produce reliable statistics on the numbers of illegal immigrants who are present within their territories.Notwithstanding the foregoing, the level of enforcement related activity by the immigration authorities is higher than ever. For example, over 9,000 persons were refused entry to the State and returned to their countries of departure in 2002 and 2003. In addition to preventing such illegal immigration, we have increased the numbers of removals from the State of persons found to be illegally in the country — deporting over 1,000 persons and supervising approximately 1,200 voluntary departures in the same period. However, it is largely a matter of speculation to extrapolate from these figures the numbers that may have gone undetected. What can be said with certainty is that the figures reflect a greater than ever level of enforcement related activity by the immigration authorities.

The vast majority of the removals involved persons who were refused refugee status in the State.Set out below are the number of deportation orders effected since the commencement of the Immigration Act 1999 and the associated cost of flights for the deportees and their Garda escorts:YearNo. of Deportation Orders EffectedCost (Euros)1999627,3492000187431,45520013651,169,57420025211,816,31420035901,569,7822004390 (up to 31/08/04)1,338,295**Amount paid up to 31/08/04The figures above do not include the cost of overtime or subsistence payments for Garda escorts but include the cost of ten charter flights since 2002 at a total cost of €1,099,482.The deportation of illegal immigrants and refused asylum seekers is costly, particularly to distant countries such as Nigeria, China etc. In most cases, removals are carried out using commercial flights which usually involves transit through other European airports as Ireland does not have direct flights to most of the countries of return. In addition, most flights have to be booked at short notice very near the date of departure which involves higher costs than if booked well in advance.In addition, in considering the costs of deportations, the continued presence in the State of persons who are the subject of deportation orders has to be taken into account. These costs include social welfare costs, direct provision costs and detention costs in certain cases. While it is important to keep deportation costs to a minimum, not to remove persons refused permission to remain in the State would call into question the integrity of the entire immigration system. This would leave this country open to further illegal immigration and even more expense to taxpayers.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1004	While the costs arising from the provision of services to asylum seekers are primarily a matter for the individual Departments and agencies with responsibility for such services, the most recent information available to me indicates that the amount spent on asylum seeker services for 2003, which also includes immigration functions such as the operation of the deportation process, was in the region of €353 million spread between a number of Government Departments and agencies.In 2003 the total cost to my Department and the asylum agencies of asylum and immigration services was in the region of €120 million. This included costs directly associated with the processing of asylum applications and also expenditure on, for example, the provision of accommodation for asylum seekers and the operation of the deportation process. A further €120 million has been provided for this purpose in my Department's Vote in 2004. The accommodation element of the latter figures accounted for some €77 million in 2003 and has been estimated at €69 million for the year ending December 2004.The successful implementation of the Government's asylum strategy including the operation of the wide ranging amendments to the Refugee Act 1996 contained in the Immigration Act 2003 which were aimed at, inter alia, streamlining the asylum decision making process, has had a positive impact in terms of processing times and partly resulted in the second highest reduction in asylum applications in any EU state in 2003. While any continued reduction in asylum applications can be expected to have an impact on the level of resources allocated to services for asylum seekers in the future, expenditure in this area will have to be maintained at an appropriate level so as to ensure the efficient and effective processing of applications in particular.In addition, the provision of immigration related services generally will continue to require an adequate level of resources so as to ensure that these also continue to be provided in an efficient and effective manner. This will include resources, for example, for the operation of the deportation process and for the processing of applications for visas and citizenship all of which have been on the increase in recent years.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1005	The Deputy will be aware that there have been significant developments in respect of the provision of supports for the development of child care over the last number of years. Child care was identified as a priority area for investment in the National Development Plan 2000-2006. As a result of this, the equal opportunities child care programme 2000-06, EOCP, was launched by my Department in April 2000 in order to support the development of a range of child care facilities to enable parents to remain in or return to employment, education and training.The current EOCP runs for seven years and aims to maintain and increase the number of child care facilities and places, improve the quality of child care services and introduce a co-ordinated approach to the delivery of child care services in order to meet the diverse child care needs of parents in employment, education or training. The total funding allocated to my Department for these purposes during the seven-year programme amounts to €449.3 million for a diverse but strategically focused range of measures including capital grants, staffing supports for community facilities in disadvantaged areas and projects designed to improve the quality of child care.The total funding committed under the equal opportunities child care programme 2000-06, in the period up to the end of July 2004, is over €264 million. Over 2,199 grants have been awarded to date to child care providers and community groups which will, when fully drawn down, lead to the creation of 29,722 new child care places and will also support over 27,567 existing places. Much of the unallocated funding is already earmarked for second phases of existing projects, particularly as a contribution to the staffing costs of community based child care facilities, which offer services to disadvantaged families.In the year 2000 there were about 56,000 centre based child care places in Ireland. When all the EOCP funding is drawn down, I expect that we will have created nearly 30,000 additional places, benefiting every county. It is anticipated that the extra child care places created by the programme will lead to greater choice in child care nationwide.The Deputy will also be aware that child benefit supports made available by my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, have been increased significantly in recent years to provide financial support to parents with regard to the care of their children.

However, the section operates against a background of significant increases in the number of visa applications received and limited resources available to process them. As an indication of the unprecedented escalation in the numbers of applications for Irish visas in recent years, the number of applications determined by the visa officers increased from 12,201 in 1997 to 24,334 in 2000 and 47,666 in 2003 — an increase of 290% over the last six years.In June 2002 my Department took the unprecedented step of seconding a number of visa officers to the Irish Embassies in Beijing and Moscow. A primary objective of this initiative was to enable the provision of a better and more timely customer service by making decisions locally rather than having large numbers of visa applications sent to Dublin for decision. Extra resources were also allocated to the visa section in the Department to cater for the increasing volume of visa applications and it is hoped to allocate more resources as these become available.

More recently, the group submitted further recommendations. The in camera rule has been relaxed by way of provision in the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004.

An appeal relating to both of the visa applications in question was received in my Department on 5 July 2004. The visa appeals officer having re-considered the applications afresh, including the additional documentation lodged, was not satisfied that the concerns of the visa officer had been fully addressed and upheld the original decision to refuse the applications. It is open to the applicants to make fresh applications with up to date supporting documentation and the matter will be considered anew.

A worker employed under the work permit scheme may be joined by their spouse and minor children after the worker has been in the State for one year and has been offered a contract for a further year. The worker must also be able to fully support the family members in question without the need to have recourse to public funds. The applications in question were refused as the supporting documentation did not show that the workers in question were in a position to fully support their spouses.An appeal was made against the decisions. The visa appeals officer, having re-examined the applications, upheld the original decisions. It is open to the applicants to make fresh applications and the matter will be considered anew. Any such applications should be supported with copies of the workers' P60 and current payslips.

Additional supporting patrols are provided by divisional units and the detective branch. I understand that community police assigned to the area in question have an excellent rapport with the local community. I am further informed that the Garda authorities have received no specific complaint in respect of any specific threat to residents.Current policing plans in the area are predicated on the prevention of crimes, including crimes of violence against persons and crimes against property and the maintenance of an environment conducive to improving the quality of life of the residents. This strategy will continue to be central to the delivery of an effective policing service to the areas in question.

This latter aspect is planned to be completed within an eight to 12-week timeframe. Its commencement will also require the enactment of the Road Traffic Bill 2004 which is being progressed by the Minister for Transport. I assure the Deputy that every effort is being made to ensure that the system is rolled out nationwide as a matter of priority.

In June 2002 the wife gave birth. They withdrew their asylum applications and applied for residency on the basis of parentage of the Irish born child. Following the decision of the Supreme Court in the cases of L and O, the separate procedure which then existed to enable persons to apply to reside in the State on the sole basis of parentage of an Irish-born child ended on 19 February 2003. The Government decided that the separate procedure would not apply to cases which were outstanding on that date. There are a large number of such cases outstanding at present, including that to which the Deputy refers.Since the persons in question do not have an alternative legal basis for remaining in this jurisdiction the issue of permission to remain will be considered but only in the context of a ministerial proposal to deport them. In that context, a notification of a proposal to make a deportation order issued to the persons in question on 13 August 2004 and they were given an opportunity to make representations in respect of it. If, in the light of representations received and the range of factors set out in section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, the Minister decides not to make a deportation order they will be given leave to remain on a humanitarian basis. Due to the large number of such cases on hand, I am unable to say at this stage when the file will be examined.

Recruitment competitions for entrance to the Garda Síochána are advertised in the national newspapers and on the Garda website, www.garda.ie.

He was, in accordance with the Act, given the following options: making representations within 15 working days setting out the reasons why he should not be deported and be allowed to remain temporarily in the State; leaving the State before the order was made; or consenting to the making of the deportation order. Representations setting out the reasons why he should not be deported were received.I expect the case file in this matter to be submitted to me shortly for decision, after consideration of a number of factors which are specified in section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended. These factors include considerations relating to the common good, the person's individual family and domestic circumstances and humanitarian consideration. Consideration will also be given to the prohibition on refoulement, which is contained in section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended.

The installation of the systems in Bray, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire and Limerick has been completed and these systems are now fully operational.The second phase of Garda CCTV systems will be installed in Athlone, Clondalkin, Tallaght and Waterford. The Garda authorities have given careful consideration to a restructuring of the manner in which these Garda CCTV systems go to tender with a view to delivering the implementation of these CCTV systems in a faster, more efficient and cost effective manner. Significant progress has been made in this regard and I am advised that the pre-tender process to engage the appropriate services to commence the implementation of the proposed second phase of CCTV systems is almost complete. This tender competition will be advertised on the Government website, www.etenders.ie, and the Official Journal of the European Communities, OJEC.I am informed by the Garda authorities that planning for the installation of the CCTV systems in phase 3, including Kilkenny, is scheduled to commence later this year. This planning process includes, but is not confined to: identifying the proposed camera locations which are based on the policing requirement for each area; and identifying the structural and electrical works which will be required at the Garda station where the cameras will be monitored.In addition, consideration will also be given to the experience gained in the new approach to be adopted for the implementation of phase 2 of the programme with a view to delivering the implementation of the Kilkenny CCTV system in a faster, more efficient and cost effective manner. Until the planning for the CCTV system has been completed it is not possible to ascertain how much the system in Kilkenny will cost. However, it has been the experience of the Garda authorities that the cost of an efficient and effective CCTV system is, on average, €25,000 to €30,000 per camera excluding associated civil works.

The applications were refused because it had not been established, on the basis of the documentation supplied to my Department, that the applicants would observe the conditions of the visa. The applications were not supported by any documentary evidence of how the applicants intended to maintain themselves during their proposed visit. It was also noted that no documentation indicated the legal status of the reference in the State.It is open to the applicants to appeal against the refusal by writing to the visa appeals officer in my Department. Any such appeal should be accompanied by a full copy of the relative's passport along with a full copy of the applicant's passports.

The Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner recommended that he should not be declared as a refugee and he was notified of this recommendation on 23 October 2003. He then appealed this recommendation to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. Following an oral hearing, the original recommendation was affirmed and he was informed of this decision on 29 April 2004.In accordance with section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, the person concerned was informed on 26 August 2004 that it was proposed to make a deportation order in his case. He was given the options of making representations within 15 working days setting out the reasons as to why he should not be deported; leaving the State voluntarily before an order was made; or consenting to the making of a deportation order. On 17 September 2004 representations were received on behalf of the person concerned.This person's case file must now be considered taking account of section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, and section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 concerning prohibition of refoulement. The file will be submitted to me for decision in due course and the person concerned will then be informed of the outcome.

This expansion is being implemented on a phased basis as follows:LocationPhase 1Bray, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway and LimerickPhase 2Athlone, Clondalkin, Tallaght and WaterfordPhase 3Ballyfermot, Carlow, Castlebar, Clonmel, Ennis, Kilkenny and SligoInstallation of the CCTV systems is of necessity a detailed, complex and lengthy process. The installation of the systems in Bray, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire and Limerick has been completed and these systems are now fully operational. The second phase of Garda CCTV systems will be installed in Athlone, Clondalkin, Tallaght and Waterford. The Garda authorities have given careful consideration to a restructuring of the manner in which these Garda CCTV systems go to tender with a view to delivering the implementation of these CCTV systems in a faster, more efficient and cost effective manner. Significant progress has been made in this regard. The pre-tender process to engage the appropriate services to commence the implementation of the proposed second phase of CCTV systems is almost complete. This tender competition will be advertised on the Government website www.etenders.ie and the Official Journal of the European Communities, OJEC.I am informed by the Garda authorities that planning for the installation of the CCTV systems in phase 3, including Ennis, is scheduled to commence later this year. This planning process includes, but is not confined to identifying the proposed camera locations, which are based on the policing requirement for each area; and identifying the structural and electrical works which will be required at the Garda station where the cameras will be monitored.In addition, consideration will also be given to the experience gained in the new approach to be adopted for the implementation of phase 2 of the programme with a view to delivering the implementation of the Ennis CCTV system in a faster, more efficient and cost effective manner.

On the 5 July 2004 a letter was received requesting renewal of the permission to remain. However, there has been a major change in circumstances, which requires consideration. It has been decided to grant a renewal of the permission to remain for a further period pending consideration of all the circumstances peculiar to this case. The person in question will receive notification of this shortly.

In December 2001 she gave birth. Both withdrew their asylum applications and applied for residency in the State on the basis of parentage of that Irish-born child.Following the decision of the Supreme Court in the cases of L and O, the separate procedure which then existed to enable persons to apply to reside in the State on the sole basis of parentage of an Irish born child ended on 19 February 2003. The Government decided that the separate procedure would not apply to cases, which were outstanding on that date. The case to which the Deputy refers was one of the large number of such cases outstanding at that time.The person in question, along with her husband, re-applied for asylum on 1 September 2003. Since this gave them an alternative legal basis for remaining in this jurisdiction the application for residency based on parentage of an Irish-born child was simply returned on 20 July 2004. The issue of permission to remain can be considered, but only in the context of a ministerial proposal to deport her in the event that her asylum application is refused. If, in the light of representations received and the range of factors set out in section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, I decide not to make a deportation order she will be given leave to remain on a humanitarian basis.

The personnel strength of Tallaght Garda station as at 1 January 1998 was 133 across all ranks. This represents an increase of 38, or 29%, in the number of personnel allocated to Tallaght Garda station since the 1 January 1998.I am further informed by the Garda authorities that one Garda sergeant and four Garda juvenile liaison officers are working with children who offend in the Tallaght area. Three Garda youth diversion projects operate in the Tallaght district, two of which operate in the general Jobstown area, the KEY, key to engaging youth, which encompasses both the Killinarden and Fettercairn projects and the JAY, Jobstown action for youth, project in Jobstown.In addition an active local drugs task force endeavours to co-ordinate the efforts of the Garda, the various other agencies and the community in the ongoing fight against drugs. The Jobstown area receives regular attention from all the units attached to Tallaght. Two dedicated community gardaí are allocated to patrol this area.The situation will be kept under review and when additional personnel next become available the needs of the Tallaght area will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda stations throughout the country.

The area receives regular patrolling by uniformed car and van units with a view to ensuring a concentrated and visible Garda presence in the area. A community police unit is assigned to the area. Patrols are backed up by foot patrols and mountain bike patrols in addition to the divisional crime task force, divisional traffic unit and detective units. I am also informed that ongoing liaison takes place between the community police unit and residents of Ballymun to assist and resolve residents complaints as they arise.I am informed by the Garda authorities that two juvenile liaison officers work full time with children who offend in the Ballymun area. In addition an active local drugs task force co-ordinates the effort of the Garda, the various other agencies and the community in the ongoing fight against drugs.I am assured that local Garda management is satisfied that adequate resources exist to meet the policing needs of the area. The current personnel strength at Ballymun Garda station across all ranks is 66. The situation will be kept under review and when additional personnel next become available the needs of Ballymun will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda stations throughout the country.The current policing strategies for the area are predicated on the policy of reducing and preventing incidents of public order offending, the prevention of crimes of violence against persons and property and the maintenance of an environment where the quality of life of the residents can be assured and consolidated. These strategies are and will continue to be the core value in policing plans for the area for the future.

The area receives regular patrolling by uniformed car and van units with a view to ensuring a concentrated and visible Garda presence in the area. A community police unit is assigned to the area. Patrols are backed up by foot patrols and mountain bike patrols in addition to the divisional crime task force, divisional traffic unit and detective units.I am also informed that the Garda, in association with neighbourhood watch groups, resident associations and Dublin City Council, co-ordinates and designs initiatives to target high incident areas. I understand one juvenile liaison officer works full time with children who offend in the Finglas area. In addition an active local drugs task force co-ordinates the efforts of the Garda, the various other agencies and the community in the ongoing fight against drugs.There is also one Garda youth diversion project in the area, the FAN, Finglas Action Now, project. This project is a community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiative which seeks to divert young persons from becoming involved — or further involved — in anti-social and/or criminal behaviour by providing suitable activities to facilitate personal development, promote civic responsibility and improve long-term employability prospects. By doing so, the project also contributes to improving the quality of life within communities and enhancing Garda community relations.I am assured that local Garda management is satisfied that adequate resources exist to meet the policing needs of the area. The current personnel strength at Finglas Garda station across all ranks is 73. The situation will be kept under review and when additional personnel next become available the needs of Finglas will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda stations throughout the country.

My officials are continuing work on this project in conjunction with the Office of Public Works.The aim of such facilities would be to address the overcrowding difficulties that arise from time to time and they would in addition offer significant improvements in the areas of work training, education and medical services as well as providing predominantly single cell accommodation with proper in-cell sanitation facilities.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1045	I understand that a capital grant application for €1.1 million for the child care element of a much larger project was submitted to my Department some time ago. The Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 is a seven-year development programme which aims to increase the availability and quality of child care to support parents in employment, education and training. The progress of the programme was commented upon very favourably by the mid-term evaluators of both the regional operational programmes and the National Development Plan 2000-2006 and following the mid-term review additional funding of approximately €12 million was made available for the child care measures. This brings the total funding available for the programme to €449.3 million.Considerable demand has come from community based groups for capital grant assistance under the programme and every county has benefited significantly from grants to provide new and enhanced community based child care facilities and indeed to support capital developments in the private child care sector. ADM, on behalf of my Department, is currently carrying out an extensive review of the programme's capital commitments to date, numbering more than 1,100 and at a value of €114 million, to ensure that all the grant commitments previously entered into will be realised.Projects may be awaiting planning permission or the completion of tender processes before reasonable assurance can be taken that they will proceed and, if they do not, the funding set aside can be decommitted and made available to another project. Expenditure under the programme covers the period to the end of 2007 and must take place in a planned manner as must grant approvals to ensure that the programme can meet its financial commitments at all times.In addition, my Department has recently reviewed the different budget lines under the EOCP including the capital programme to ensure the most effective use of all remaining funding in accordance with the programme's objectives and this has brought to €157 million the total allocation for the capital development of child care under the present programme. At the same time, an extensive review of child care provision on the ground has taken place to identify obvious service gaps, the filling of which will be a priority using the remaining capital funding which currently exceeds €30 million, of which approximately €25 million is earmarked for community-based not for profit child care groups which provide services for young children to support their parents who may be in employment, education and training.I intend to allocate the remaining capital funding under this strand of the Government's commitment to child care to address the most immediate service gaps. As a result, all the projects in the pipeline on 30 April 2004 have been reviewed again by ADM Limited on the basis of geographical need, the range of services being offered, value for money and the capacity of the groups to complete a project before the end of the programme in 2007. Those projects which best meet the criteria will receive priority funding from the capital funding which remains unallocated at this point.I have made enquiries and I understand that the application for capital grant assistance in respect of this project has been reviewed as part of the review process to which I have just referred. I understand that the recommendations on the allocation of the remaining funding are currently in preparation. If a project is recommended for funding as part of this process, its recommendation will be conditional upon its being able to establish that it can be completed within a fixed budget and a tight time frame. If a project is not recommended for priority funding at this time, it will be considered again should additional capital resources come available. The allocation of any additional funding which might come available to me will also be allocated on the basis of local need, levels of service being offered and value for money.I do not doubt but that the success of the present strand of the programme and the need to continue to make child care available to support the child care needs of our still growing work force will support my case for ongoing capital and current funding from Government for this key sector. Should any additional funding become available before the end of the present national development plan, I would expect that the programme would again benefit from transfers. In the interim, it would be premature of me to comment further on this capital grant application.

I am further informed that, depending on the urgency, nature and purpose of the information, the transfer of information occurs speedily, involving, for example, police-to-police transfer between the Garda National Criminal Intelligence Unit and the PSNI's force intelligence bureau, transmission via Interpol Dublin to Interpol London; and transfer between the Garda Communications Centre and the PSNI. I understand that the two police services have an excellent relationship and co-operate with each other on a daily basis.

Accordingly, the working group recommended that the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science should consider the development of non-Garda, employment-related vetting registers to provide information on those previously dismissed, suspended, moved or made redundant from posts for harming children or vulnerable adults in the health and education sectors. The Deputy will appreciate that further consideration of such matters would be a matter, in the first instance, for my colleagues, the Ministers for Health and Children and Education and Science.

A number of people in the press office and IT divisions have the capacity to publish this material directly. I am not aware of any inaccurate or outdated information on the site, but I would take steps to rectify such issues if they were brought to my attention.The site has recently been redesigned and went live earlier in the year. The new site is a content management solution. It adopts a more structured approach towards information retrieval for the end user. I believe that we have divided the services offered by my Department in the most meaningful way possible for easy access to the site's large amount of information.

He is not entitled to an Irish passport or travel document. He was facilitated with an emergency temporary Irish travel document in May 2001, however, to enable him to travel to obtain a passport from his country of nationality. As he had not obtained his own passport during this period and as an exceptional measure, he was further facilitated with the renewal of this temporary travel document to 30 July 2004 which would allow him travel to obtain a passport. An application received in July 2004 for a further renewal of the temporary travel document has been refused and the person in question has been advised to contact the embassy of his country of nationality to obtain his own passport. If it is necessary for him to travel outside the State to collect his passport then we will consider facilitating him, on the production of the appropriate documentation from the embassy or relevant authority.

The Department's approach in such matters is informed by past experience, including experience of abuse of the system. In this instance, the visa appeals officer formed the opinion that it would not be reasonable to conclude that the applicants would observe the conditions attached to the visa and the decision to refuse the application was upheld.

The equal opportunities child care programme was established by my Department in April 2000 as a seven-year programme to increase the number of child care facilities and places in Ireland; to improve the quality of child care services and to put new structures in place for the co-ordination of activity in the development of child care. The total funding allocated to my Department for these purposes during the seven-year period of the programme has now increased to €449.3 million.Funding provision for the quality measure which includes the administration of the city and county child care committees has increased significantly. Over €7 million is available annually for the implementation of the action plans drawn up by the city and county child care committees. The committees receive additional funding for the national childminding initiative and will also be invited shortly to submit proposals for collaborative actions with other committees and the national voluntary child care organisations.Donegal County Childcare Committee is one of the 33 city or county childcare committees that were established as part of the equal opportunities child care programme. Donegal County Childcare Committee has received funding of €894,514 since the start of the programme. In 2004, Donegal County Childcare Committee received its maximum funding allowance of €241,500 for its action plan. In light of the excellent work being carried out by all 33 county child care committees, I have already indicated to them that the maximum funding available to them in 2005 will be increased by 5%. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is reviewing all the budget lines under the quality sub-measure of the programme to determine whether any small additional increase in funding can be provided in the coming year.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1085	The equal opportunities child care programme 2000 to 2006 is a seven year development programme which aims to increase the availability and quality of child care to support parents in employment, education and training. The progress of the programme was commented upon very favourably by the mid-term evaluators of both the regional operational programmes and the National Development Plan 2000-2006, and following the mid-term review additional funding of approximately €12 million was made available for the child care measures. That brings the total funding available for the programme to €449.3 million.There has been considerable demand from community-based groups for capital grant assistance under the programme, and every county has benefited significantly from grants to provide new and enhanced community-based child care facilities and, indeed, to support capital developments in the private child care sector. ADM, on behalf of my Department, is currently carrying out an extensive review of the programme's capital commitments to date, numbering over 1,100 and at a value of €114 million, to ensure that all the grant commitments previously entered into will be realised. Projects may be awaiting planning permission or the completion of tender processes before reasonable assurance can be taken that they will proceed, and if they do not, the funding set aside can be decommitted and made available to another project. Expenditure under the programme covers the period to the end of 2007 and must take place in a planned manner, as must grant approvals to ensure that the programme can meet its financial commitments at all times.In addition, my Department has recently reviewed the different budget lines under the EOCP, including the capital programme, to ensure that the most effective use is made of all remaining funding in accordance with the programme's objectives, and that has brought to €157 million the total allocation for the capital development of child care under the present programme. At the same time, an extensive review of child care provision on the ground has taken place to identify obvious service gaps, the filling of which will be a priority using the remaining capital funding, which currently exceeds €30 million, of which about €25 million is being earmarked for community-based, not-for-profit child care groups which provide services for young children to support their parents, who may be in employment, education or training.I intend to allocate the remaining capital funding under this strand of the Government's commitment to child care to address the most immediate service gaps. As a result, all the projects in the pipeline on 30 April 2004 have been reviewed again by ADM Limited on the basis of geographical need, the range of services being offered, value for money and the capacity of the groups to complete a project before the end of the programme in 2007. This includes a number of projects in Limerick city and county located in RAPID areas. Those projects which best meet the criteria will receive priority funding from the capital funding which remains unallocated at this point.I have made inquiries and I understand that the applications for capital grant assistance in respect of these projects have been reviewed as part of the review process I have just referred to. I understand that the recommendations regarding the allocation of the remaining funding are currently in preparation. If a project is recommended for funding as part of this process, its recommendation will be conditional upon its being able to establish that it can be completed within a fixed budget and a tight time frame. If a project is not recommended for priority funding at this time, it will be considered again should additional capital resources become available. The allocation of any additional funding which might become available to me will also be allocated on the basis of local need, levels of service being offered and value for money.I do not doubt but that the success of the present strand of the programme and the need to continue to make child care available to support the child care needs of our still growing work force will support my case for ongoing capital and current funding from Government for this key sector. Indeed, should any additional funding become available before the end of the present national development plan, I would expect that the programme would again benefit from transfers.In the interim, it would be premature of me to comment further on these capital grant applications.

This brings the total funding available for the programme to €449.3 million.There has been considerable demand from community based groups for capital grant assistance under the programme, and every county has benefited significantly from grants to provide new and enhanced community-based child care facilities and, indeed, to support capital developments in the private child care sector. ADM, on behalf of my Department, is currently carrying out an extensive review of the programme's capital commitments to date, numbering over 1,100 and at a value of €14 million, to ensure that all the grant commitments previously entered into will be realised. Projects may be awaiting planning permission or the completion of tender processes before reasonable assurance can be taken that they will proceed, and if they do not, the funding set aside can be decommitted and made available to another project. Expenditure under the programme covers the period to the end of 2007 and must take place in a planned manner, as must grant approvals to ensure that the programme can meet its financial commitments at all times.In addition, my Department has recently reviewed the different budget lines under the EOCP, including the capital programme, to ensure that the most effective use is made of all remaining funding in accordance with the programme's objectives, and this has brought to €157 million the total allocation for the capital development of child care under the present programme. At the same time, an extensive review of child care provision on the ground has taken place to identify obvious service gaps, the filling of which will be a priority using the remaining capital funding, which currently exceeds €30 million, of which about €25 million is being earmarked for community-based, not-for-profit child care groups which provide services for young children to support their parents who may be in employment, education and training.I intend to allocate the remaining capital funding under this strand of the Government's commitment to child care to address the most immediate service gaps. As a result, all the projects in the pipeline on 30 April 2004 have been reviewed again by ADM Limited on the basis of geographical need, the range of services being offered, value for money and the capacity of the groups to complete a project before the end of the programme in 2007. Those projects which best meet the criteria will receive priority funding from the capital funding, which remains unallocated at this point.I have made inquiries and understand that the application for capital grant assistance in respect of this project has been reviewed as part of the review process that I have just referred to. I understand that the recommendations regarding the allocation of the remaining funding are currently in preparation. If a project is recommended for funding as part of this process, its recommendation will be conditional upon its being able to establish that it can be completed within a fixed budget and a tight time frame. If a project is not recommended for priority funding at this time, it will be considered again should additional capital resources become available. The allocation of any additional funding which might become available to me will also be allocated on the basis of local need, levels of service being offered and value for money.I do not doubt but that the success of the present strand of the programme and the need to continue to make child care available to support the child care needs of our still growing work force will support my case for ongoing capital and current funding from Government for this key sector. Indeed, should any additional funding become available before the end of the present national development plan, I would expect that the programme would again benefit from transfers.In the interim, it would be premature of me to comment further on this capital grant application.

The following are the procedures as set out in the charter.1. The Garda will outline the investigation process to victims and ensure that they are kept informed of the progress of the investigation, including whether a suspect is charged or cautioned.  A follow up letter is sent to a victim of crime from the district officer superintendent advising them of the name, telephone number and station of the investigating garda as well as the unique PULSE crime number for the crime.2. The Garda will inform Victims of crime about the services available from Victim Support.  The Gardaí nationally provide a designated Garda Liaison Officer to ensure effective co-operation between Victim Support and the Garda.  Locally the investigating Garda will be the victim's designated Garda.3. The Gardaí will inform victims, where a suspect is charged: whether the accused is in custody or on bail and the conditions attached to the bail; time, date and location of the court hearing of the charges against the accused; the prosecution process involved and, if the victim is likely to be called as a witness, the help available from Victim Support; the circumstances where the judge may ask for a victim impact statement (in sexual and violent offences) and arrange for its completion; victim's entitlement to court expenses at the conclusion of the trial.4. Where the crime involved caused serious trauma to victims or their family, the Garda will, when notified of the imminent release from custody of the offender, pass this information on to the victim of crime.  In addition, they will make whatever policing arrangements they consider appropriate for the victim's safety.

The scheme is fourth in the list of sewerage schemes submitted by the council in response to my Department's request to local authorities in 2003 to produce updated assessments of the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments. The assessments were taken into account in the framing of the water services investment programme for 2004 to 2006, which was published last May. Given the priority ranking afforded to the scheme by the council, it has not been possible to include it in the programme.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1118	Following an examination of the carbon tax proposal, including an extensive public consultation, the Government concluded that such a tax was not an appropriate policy option for the purpose of achieving greenhouse gas emissions reductions. A carbon tax was one option only in the Government's overall response to Ireland's commitment under the Kyoto Protocol to limit emissions of greenhouse gases to 13% above 1990 levels. It was estimated that a carbon tax would have contributed just over 0.5 million tonnes of emissions reductions towards a total reduction requirement of 9.2 million tonnes per annum during the first commitment period under the protocol of 2008 to 2012. Alternative policy options, focusing on non-tax measures in the national climate change strategy, are being examined with a view to achieving the necessary emissions reductions and ensuring compliance with the Kyoto Protocol.Preliminary figures released by the Environmental Protection Agency in July 2004 indicate that emissions in 2003 were 24.7% above 1990 levels, down from approximately 29% in 2002 and 31% in 2001. Those figures indicate that significant progress is being made towards the target of 13% above 1990 levels. The national climate change strategy will continue to underpin the Government's approach to achieving the further reductions required.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1119	The compilation and publication of the register is a matter for each registration authority in accordance with electoral law and involves the carrying out of house-to-house or other local inquiries, including in many cases delivering registration forms to households for completion. The draft register is published on 1 November each year and is made available for examination at post offices, public libraries, Garda stations, courthouses and local authority offices up to 25 November. The public are invited, through national and local advertising campaigns, to check the draft during the period to make sure that they are correctly registered and to bring errors or omissions in the draft to the attention of the registration authority. The final register is published on 1 February and comes into force for a year on 15 February.There have been several changes in recent years which serve to improve the accuracy of the register. The Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001 includes provisions to allow persons who have moved residence to another constituency or to another electoral area in a constituency during the currency of a register, or who will reach 18 years on or before polling day, to apply for entry in the supplement to the register. It also provides that persons who are unable to vote in their constituency because of their employment by a returning officer in another constituency on polling day are eligible to apply for entry in the supplement to the postal voters list.Regarding personation, there are extensive measures in place under existing electoral law. The returning officer or the presiding officer may of his or her own volition, or if so requested by a personation agent present in the polling station, request any person applying for a ballot paper to produce a specified identification document. If a person fails to produce such a document, or if the returning officer or the presiding officer is not satisfied that the person is the person to whom the document relates, he or she is not permitted to vote. Returning officers or presiding officers may also, or, if so requested by a personation agent, shall, put certain questions or administer an oath or affirmation to persons applying for a ballot paper. Electoral law also sets out a range of offences and penalties regarding personation, including a new offence provided for under the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2004 for the unlawful possession of a polling information card.In the final analysis, the preparation of an accurate register relies to a significant extent on the co-operation of the public in completing registration forms, examining the draft register and bringing any errors to notice. Similarly, the prevention of personation relies on the vigilance of polling staff and personation agents present in the polling station and the deterrent effect of committing an electoral offence.I am concerned to ensure that the legislative and administrative arrangements in place regarding those issues are as flexible as possible while maintaining the security and integrity of the electoral process. I will continue to keep current practice, including the scope for further improvements, under review.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1120	My Department has received a joint proposal from the Irish Rural Dwellers' Association and the Royal Institute of Architects in Ireland regarding the establishment of a national planning monitoring committee. The functions of the proposed committee would be to advise on matters relating to planning and to monitor the implementation of Government policies and guidelines; to advise on generic problems and issues on identification by users of the system; to monitor the implementation of the development control guidelines and a proposed planning charter which it is also proposed to draft; to monitor performance standards of planning authorities as identified in their annual reports; and to advise on good planning practice. Officials in my Department will meet with representatives of the Irish Rural Dwellers' Association and the Royal Institute of Architects in Ireland in the coming weeks to discuss their proposal.My Department is already working on several initiatives to improve the performance of planning authorities in implementing the planning code. My Department has issued planning guidelines on a wide range of policy issues, including in 2004, guidelines on quarries and ancillary activities and draft wind energy development guidelines.Consultation is also underway on proposed planning and development regulations. Those amend certain provisions of the 2001 planning regulations to provide for greater streamlining of the planning service and to introduce a standard planning application form. That should help to ensure a consistent level of service across planning authorities as well as underpinning the delivery of electronic planning. My Department is also in the process of drafting new development management guidelines which will offer guidance on best practice in processing planning applications. Performance indicators for planning authorities are also being drawn up to build on the success of the local government service indicators published earlier this year. Those initiatives should help to ensure that planning authorities deliver an efficient and customer-orientated planning system.

It was as a result of these inquiries regarding the grant that officials of my Department ascertained in April this year that the €63,500 contribution towards car parking facilities at Trim Castle was used towards the provision of a temporary car park and that the area of the temporary car park has since been sold to a private developer.Since then my Department has sought further information in correspondence with the town council through which it is intended that a resolution of this matter will be achieved. The local government auditor will make his report on the matter in due course and this report will be duly considered by my Department.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1124	My Department's outline sectoral plan under the Disability Bill, which was published with the Bill last week, provides that each local authority will, within six months of the approval of the plan by the Oireachtas, carry out an accessibility audit of all public buildings, public parks, amenities and open spaces, roads and streets, pavements and pedestrian crossings, heritage sites, public libraries, polling stations and harbours within its control and identify what remedial action is necessary to make these buildings, etc. accessible for people with disabilities.In relation to roads, streets and footpaths, as stated in the outline sectoral plan, my Department's revised memorandum on grants for non-national roads of 5 February 2001 urges local authorities to pay particular attention to the needs of the mobility-impaired, including the visually impaired, when planning and executing road works and particularly the planning and designing of pedestrian facilities. The traffic management guidelines jointly published in May 2003 by my Department, the Department of Transport and the Dublin Transportation Office, contain guidelines on bus stop design and on the design of crossing facilities for mobility and sensory impaired people. My Department will, when amending and updating the memorandum on grants for non-national roads, ask local authorities to ensure that bus stops and pedestrian crossing facilities in all future non-national road schemes being planned or executed by local authorities adhere to the layouts contained in the traffic management guidelines.Section 254 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, which restated section 89 of the 1963 Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, provides for a licensing system for the placing of various structures and appliances on, under, over or along a public road. Tables and chairs outside a hotel, restaurant, public house or other establishment where food is sold for consumption on the premises are prescribed as requiring a licence under this section. The decision as to whether to grant a licence is a matter for the relevant planning authority, and such a licence may include conditions in relation to location and design.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1126	A tax on virgin paper is not under consideration. A range of alternative measures to promote the recycling of paper are already in place and the available data show that these are having a significant impact. These measures include the progressive roll-out of segregated household collection of dry recyclables, or kerbside green bin collection services, to over 560,000 households, or some 42% of all households in the State — it is estimated that newsprint and other paper waste accounts for over 50% of the material being collected from households via the green bin collection service; a public service waste management programme which is currently being prepared and which will ensure that all public authorities will routinely use recycled paper; a producer responsibility initiative, PRI, which is currently being developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders to facilitate increased recovery of newsprint; a feasibility study under the auspices of the North South Market Development Group, NSMDG, on the development and assessment of paper mill options for the island of Ireland.National waste statistics are published at three-yearly intervals by the EPA. The most recent national waste database report in respect of 2001, which was published in July 2003, estimated that out of total paper waste arisings of 804,411 tonnes in that year, 166,305 tonnes, 21%, were recycled. This is an increase from 94,302 tonnes, or15%, in 1998. These figures indicate that significant progress is being made in paper recycling. All the indications are that the recycling position has improved even further since 2001 arising from the implementation of the local and regional waste management plans.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1132	Following public consultation in 2003, I intend to seek Government approval later this year for a draft strategy to reduce emissions of transboundary air pollution by 2010, and to publish this finalised strategy. In the context of the strategy preparations, I made the national emission ceiling regulations 2004 on 13 January 2004. These specify national emission ceilings for sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds and ammonia to be achieved by 2010. A number of other relevant measures are already being actively pursued under existing and planned legislation and policies, including cleaner fuels and vehicles, integrated pollution control licensing, organic solvent emissions reduction and a voluntary agreement with the solid fuel industry. I have also submitted a national emission reduction plan for large combustion plant to the European Commission for assessment. The plan, under Directive 2001/80/EC on the limitation of emissions of certain pollutants from large combustion plant with a rated thermal input greater than 50 Mw, requires significant reductions of emissions of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from older ESB power plants and boilers in Aughinish Alumina from 2008.

The first implementation deadline occurred on 22 December 2003 and related to the transposition of the WFD into national law, the establishment of river basin districts and the identification of the competent authorities. These tasks were completed by the specified date.Work is under way by my Department, the Environmental Protection Agency, local authorities and other bodies, in association with the appropriate authorities in Northern Ireland, for the timely delivery of all tasks specified for completion in 2004, and subsequently in relation to all river basin districts, RBDs, including the adoption of river basin management plans as required by 2009.The WFD has been transposed into national law by the European Communities (Water Policy) Regulations 2003 which were made on 22 December 2003. The regulations assign responsibilities to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Environmental Protection Agency, local authorities and other public authorities for carrying out the main tasks required by the WFD in accordance with the timescales laid down by the directive. Similar regulations were made by the relevant authorities in Northern Ireland on the same day.The regulations specify the following tasks for completion in 2004: the protection of the status of all waters — that is, no deterioration to be allowed; the establishment of RBDs as the administrative areas for implementation of the directive, including international RBDs in relation to cross-Border river basins; the co-ordination of actions by all relevant public authorities for water quality management in an RBD including cross-Border RBDs; the characterisation of each RBD; the establishment of environmental objectives for each RBD and the development of a programme of measures to achieve those objectives; the development and adoption in each RBD of a river basin management plan; provision of reports to the European Commission as required; identification of pressures and impacts; carrying out of an economic analysis of water use; definition of reference conditions for good water status; identification of locations and boundaries of water bodies; establishment of a register of protected areas.Work is in hand by my Department, the Environmental Protection Agency, local authorities and a range of other bodies to complete the specified tasks by the prescribed deadlines. The work is being progressed in a wide range of initiatives and activities including river basin district projects; research projects; inter-authority working groups and technical advisory committees operating at the following levels: river basin district, national level, North-South, Ireland-United Kingdom, European Union.Financial support at a rate of 100% is being provided by my Department in relation to expenditure incurred by local authorities in establishing river basin district projects. Overall WFD implementation costs up to the end of 2006 to be funded by my Department are estimated at €55 million. River basin district projects have been established for the south-eastern region — Barrow, Nore, Suir, Slaney river basins and others — approved March 2002, operational since September 2002; Shannon river basin, approved November 2002, operational since January 2003; eastern region — Avoca-Vartry, Boyne, Nanny, Dartry, Dodder and Liffey — approved April 2003, operational since June 2003; western region — Loughs Arrow, Carrowmore, Conn, Corrib and Mask, river systems such as the Bonet, Clare, Robe, Moy and Owenmore — approved March 2004, operational since April 2004.In January 2004 a project was approved in principle for the establishment of a river basin district project in relation to the south western region — Bandon; Blackwater, Munster; Lee and Laune and the Lakes of Killarney. Formal approval of this project is expected to be granted in the near future.The North-South shared aquatic resource, NS-SHARE, now forms an important element for implementation of the WFD in cross-Border areas and for North-South co-operation in the international river basin districts, IRBDs, designated under the WFD. The project is intended to develop and implement working tools for water management in relation to shared waters in the Neagh Bann IRBD, the north western IRBD and the north eastern RBD and to make recommendations for their use in support of improved inter-regional capacity for environmental monitoring and management. Donegal County Council acting as the lead agency submitted a proposal for funding of the NS-SHARE project under the EU INTERREG IIIA programme. The project was given final approval by the INTERREG IIIA steering committee in April 2004. Consultants have now been appointed and the project commenced on 1 August 2004.In total there are eight river basin districts on the island of Ireland, four of which are wholly in the Republic, one wholly in Northern Ireland and three shared cross-Border districts. The whole picture will be completed shortly by the commencement of additional projects specifically in relation to coastal and marine waters.The transposing regulations require the establishment by local authorities of an advisory council in each river basin district. These councils are intended to provide a permanent, structured framework for dialogue between the relevant authorities and interested parties. The membership of the councils will comprise local authority members and representatives of sectors such as agriculture, industry, and environmental NGOs. Guidelines for the establishment of the advisory councils are being prepared in my Department and draft guidelines were issued for public consultation on 30 June 2004 with comments requested by end-August 2004.My Department presented a seminar on 30 June 2004 in relation to implementation of the water framework directive. The seminar provided a forum for consultation, exchange of information and dialogue with all interested parties in relation to the measures being pursued for implementation of the directive. In addition, a website, www.wfdireland.ie, has been developed to facilitate public access to information on the implementation of the directive and measures are being taken to promote and facilitate participation by all interested persons.

These transpose into Irish law the requirements of Directive 2001/42/EC of 27 June 2001 on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment commonly known as the strategic environmental assessment, SEA, directive.The making of these regulations ensured that Ireland met the directive's transposition deadline of 21 July 2004. I had already issued draft guidelines for regional and planning authorities in March 2004 to assist them in implementing the requirements of the directive. The draft guidelines are currently being revised to take account of the submissions received during the consultation phase. I intend to publish the final guidelines shortly. A number of seminars have been held, and further seminars are planned, to assist competent authorities in implementing the requirements of the directive.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1141	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1197 and 1218 to 1221, inclusive, together.The planning and development regulations 2001 provide for the payment of a €20 fee for making a submission on a planning application made after 11 March 2002. The amount received nationally in 2002 was €252,197 and in 2003, €542,938. The following table shows the amount received by county and city councils in fees for submissions in 2002 and 2003, based on returns made by each authority. Fees received by town councils are included in the overall county area.The primary purpose of the fee is to contribute towards the enhanced service now required to be provided by planning authorities for persons who make submissions. The 2000 Act made a number of important changes to increase the rights of third parties in the planning process, for example, planning authorities are for the first time statutorily obliged to consider submissions made in relation to planning applications, including applications accompanied by an environmental impact statement. A person who lodges a submission or observation on a planning application also has a legal entitlement to lodge a third party appeal to An Bord Pleanála.On 23 January 2003, the European Commission issued Ireland with a reasoned opinion to the effect that the €20 fee for the making of a submission on a planning application which requires environmental impact assessment is contrary to the public participation provisions of Directive 85/337/EEC on environmental impact assessment, EIA. A reply issued to the European Commission on 16 May 2003, responding to each of the points raised in the reasoned opinion and setting out our contention that the imposition of a €20 participation fee is not in conflict with the provisions of the directive.On 22 July 2003, the European Commission issued a press release in which it stated its intention to refer the case to the European Court of Justice. No official communication has been received from the Commission to date. I have no plans to amend the relevant regulations which reflect an approach endorsed by the Oireachtas in the context of the Planning and Development Act 2000.20022003

However, as an exceptional measure, covering a limited period of time, I have agreed that the new rates will be applied retrospectively by means of an additional ex gratia payment in respect of any earlier purchases of raised bogs included in the December 2002 designation proposals.For bogs designated prior to 2002 the new additional incentive payment of up to €6,000 will be available retrospectively to those who have sold bogs-turbary to the Department. However, the IR£1,000, €1,270, incentive payment agreed in 1999, where already paid, will be deducted from the new additional payment.

The framework for the operation of the schemes is laid down in statutory regulations and, as far as practicable, is designed to give an appropriate degree of flexibility to local authorities. It is a matter for the authorities to decide on the level of funding to be provided for the schemes in their areas from within the allocations notified to them by my Department for this purpose and to manage the operation of the schemes within these allocations.My Department recoups to authorities two thirds of their expenditure on the payment of individual grants. It is the responsibility of the authorities to fund the remaining one third from their own resources from amounts provided for that purpose in their annual estimates of expenditure.A review of the disabled person's grant scheme is being finalised in my Department at present. On its completion, I will be in a position to determine the changes, if any, required to the regulations governing the scheme to ensure that the funding available is directed at those persons in greatest need of such assistance. Due to the interrelated nature of the disabled persons, essential repairs and the special housing aid for the elderly grant schemes, all three are being considered in the context of the review.

Local authorities and voluntary housing bodies actively co-operate to meet their objectives under housing legislation. A central element of housing management reform has been the acceptance of the principle of tenant participation in housing estate management. My Department is supporting the efforts of local authorities and voluntary housing bodies in this area through the housing management initiatives grants scheme, the allocation for which in the current year is €1.84 million.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1155	There is no provision in my Department's voluntary housing capital assistance and capital loan and subsidy schemes for the purchase of individual houses by tenants and there are no plans to introduce such a provision. A tenant purchase scheme is not considered desirable at this stage of the development of the voluntary housing sector in this country, as the sale of individual housing units would undermine the capacity and resources of voluntary housing bodies to manage and maintain their estates and continue to provide further housing projects to meet pressing needs.However, residents of more than one year's duration of houses provided under the scheme who wish to become owner occupiers may, on surrendering their house to the approved voluntary housing body, qualify for the following benefits: special mortgage allowance of €11,450 over five years for mortgages created on or after 1 January 2002 to assist with mortgage repayments; the shared ownership scheme without having to satisfy the income eligibility criteria; improvement works in lieu scheme in respect of the dwelling they are acquiring; low cost housing sites scheme and exemption from the income limits for local authority loans. Full details of these options are available from local authorities.

In response and in subsequent discussions, the council has been informed that the overall allocation for local authority borrowing for office accommodation in 2004 is already committed to existing projects. In the circumstances, the council was requested not to enter into any financial commitments on the proposed development.Subject to the proposed borrowing being formally adopted by the council and meeting certain financial and other criteria, any application made will be considered within the framework of the overall borrowing limit for the local authority sector in 2005.

The scheme is applicable primarily to any person who wishes to sell to my Department their freehold, fee simple or turbary rights in designated raised bogs. My Department will consider purchases in designated blanket bogs, which are in mountain areas and in western counties, only in exceptional circumstances where it is found necessary to restrict cutting of turf. It should be noted that this is a voluntary scheme and there will be no compulsory purchases.My Department will purchase designated raised bog at the following rates: freehold — €3,500 for the first acre or part thereof and €3,000 for each subsequent acre; turbary rights — €2,975 for the first acre or part thereof and €2,550 for each subsequent acre; and fee simple — €525 for the first acre or part thereof and €450 for each subsequent acre. Only where it is necessary to prohibit turf cutting will my Department purchase blanket bog, at the rate of €1,000 per acre or part thereof.As well as the above new rates my Department will also make an additional incentive payment to those who are foregoing cutting for domestic purposes in these areas. Anyone who sells full title or turbary rights to my Department between July 2004 and December 2005 will get an additional once-off payment of €6000. This payment will decline by €600 per annum for sales in later years. This payment is applicable to bogs proposed for designation in or after 2002. It will also be applied on an adjusted basis and timescale to bogs proposed for designation in earlier years.Alternatively, an annual payment of €600, for a maximum of 10 years, will be available to a landowner who does not wish to sell title to bog or turbary rights but who commits to cease cutting and allow drain blocking or other essential restoration works. This is conditional on satisfactory evidence of title being produced and consent by the landowner to a legal agreement. Anyone wishing to avail of these new arrangements should apply in writing to my Department at Site Protection Section, National Parks &  Wildlife Service, 7 Ely Place, Dublin 2.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1182	Government policy on housing has the overarching aim of enabling every household to have available an affordable dwelling of good quality, suited to its needs, in a good environment and, as far as possible, at the tenure of its choice. The general strategy for realising the overall policy aim is that those who can afford to do so should provide housing for themselves, with the aid of the fiscal incentives available, and that those unable to do so from their own resources would have access to social housing or income support to rent private housing. Existing legislation and funding programmes support this strategy.Consequently, the Government considers that it would be inappropriate to legislate for a specific right to housing, as suggested by the campaign, on the basis that the funding commitment to the various housing programmes is leading to increased outputs and that decisions in relation to the allocation of financial resources are a matter for the democratically accountable government.Within the current legislative framework the Government have been able to place a strong focus on assisting homeless households in recent years. According to the assessment of housing need carried out by local authorities in March 2002, there were a total of 3,773 homeless households in the country at the time of assessment compared to 3,743 households in 1999. The vast majority of these were in homeless accommodation ranging from emergency to long-term supported housing rather than on the streets.As part of the Government's homeless strategy, local authorities, together with health boards and other statutory and voluntary bodies, are required to draw up local action plans to tackle homelessness. These plans are now being implemented under the aegis of the local homeless for a and significant progress is being made in meeting the accommodation and care needs of homeless persons. A wide range of additional accommodation has been provided, ranging from emergency night shelter to long-term sheltered accommodation to enable homeless persons move out of emergency accommodation into long-term accommodation that is more suited to their needs. Increased levels of day care facilities as well as specific provisions to meet the needs of people with addiction problems or who are sleeping rough as well as homeless offenders have been put in place. Further facilities will be provided as part of the full implementation of the homeless action plans.Substantial additional funding has been made available to support the implementation of the homeless strategies. Capital funding for the direct provision by local authorities of accommodation for homeless persons is being doubled from €25.4 million to €50.8 million over the period 2001-2005. Current funding for accommodation related homeless services by local authorities has increased substantially from €12.6 million in 2000 to €51 million this year. Funding continues to be made available to the voluntary sector for the provision of accommodation for homeless persons under the Department's capital assistance scheme.With a view to ensuring that progress is sustained, the cross-departmental team on homelessness continues to monitor the implementation of the homeless strategies and will oversee the independent review of the strategies which is due to commence before the end of 2004.The Government is bringing about real and positive changes in the provision of social and affordable housing. We have responded actively to the increased level of housing need by expanding social and affordable housing output very significantly. Last year saw the delivery of the highest level of output under the range of social and affordable housing measures for over 15 years when the social and affordable housing needs of in excess of 13,600 households were met.In relation to the provision of local authority housing the Government has been very conscious of the increased level of social housing need. The last comprehensive assessment of housing needs carried out in March 2002 indicated that there were 48,413 households listed as being in need of long-term social housing. This level of need is of considerable concern to the Government. This year I expect that local authorities on their own will secure the completion of some 5,000 housing units and this is an indication of how local authorities have successfully accelerated their own programmes in order to meeting existing demand more quickly. The Government also recognises the important role of voluntary and co-operative housing bodies and will continue to support them in their valuable work.

The document was produced taking into account an external report on persons evicted for anti-social behaviour under the Housing Acts. In addition, the housing unit produced, Good Practice Guidelines on Preventing and Combating Anti-Social Behaviour, in December 2003, in conjunction with my Department and the City and County Managers Association, which have issued to all local authorities.In relation to action 70, my Department and the local authorities continue to promote the need to eliminate anti-social behaviour in the design of new social housing and in remedial and regeneration projects for existing estates. The Department's social housing design guidelines indicate that the discouragement of anti-social behaviour, vandalism and crimes should be a specific design objective in the design of new local authority developments. In addition, the good practice guidelines mentioned above provide advice and guidance to local authorities on security and anti-crime design features in the design of housing and accommodation units.

The council therefore is principally responsible for the protection of the medieval fireplace. Officials of my Department have worked very closely with and provided advice to Limerick City Council on the drafting of a development brief for the property in question. This development brief provides for the preservation and safeguarding of the medieval fireplace in situ and the preservation of all other medieval materials on the site. My Department has not been made aware of proposals for the actual development of this site and when consulted on any such proposals or on any planning application will of course address its statutory responsibilities.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1191	In July 1996 my Department issued guidelines for planning authorities on telecommunications antennae and support structures. The guidelines advise that "in the vicinity of larger towns and city suburbs operators should endeavour to locate in industrial areas or in industrially zoned land". It also advises that "only as a last resort should free standing masts be located in a residential area or beside schools". The purpose of those guidelines was to assist planning authorities, An Bord Pleanála, operators of mobile telecommunications services and the general public by providing guidance on dealing with telecommunications masts and base stations within the planning system.Prior to the erection of a communication mast a developer is required to seek planning permission. Section 30 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000 precludes the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government from exercising power or control in relation to any particular case with which a planning authority or An Bord Pleanála may be concerned. It is not therefore open to my Department to issue orders overruling the decisions of a planning authority or An Bord Pleanála, or exempting developments from safety criteria, or to become involved in any enforcement matters.

I also understand that the authority is now prepared to make available copies of the agenda and minutes of any further meeting of the council to any parliamentary representative who expresses an interest in receiving these documents. Other documents submitted to the council may contain confidential information within the meaning of section 40 of the 1997 Act and, accordingly, the release of any such documents would be decided upon by the authority on a case-by-case basis.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1195	The unprecedented demand for housing, fuelled mainly by rapid economic growth and demographic changes, has been the major driver of house price increases in recent years. The Government's strategy is to increase housing supply to meet demand and to improve affordability, particularly for first-time buyers, and in this way to seek to bring moderation to house price increases.The measures introduced by this Government to boost supply, including significant investment in infrastructure, improving planning capacity and promoting increased residential densities, are having effect. The year 2003 was the ninth record year for house completions, with 68,819 units completed, an increase in output of 19.3% on 2002 and an increase of 10.5% in output in the greater Dublin area during the same period.Output continues to remain high in 2004 with 35,957 units completed in the first six months of this year. Ireland is building at the fastest rate in Europe — 17 houses per 1,000 population — which is an outstanding achievement.While the rate of house price increases is still problematic, this has moderated considerably since the late 1990s when price increases peaked at 40% per annum in 1998. A number of market commentators, including the Central Bank, are now predicting greater balance in the housing market over the next few years, as increased supply has a restraining effect on house prices. Indicative data available to the Department shows that first time buyers continue to have a significant presence in the housing market.The Government will continue to focus on measures to maintain a high level of housing supply in keeping with demand and ensuring that the demand for housing is met in a sustainable manner, and we will continue to monitor and review housing developments and policies as necessary.At the same time, the Government is concerned to ensure that the broad spectrum of housing needs is met. Almost €5.17 billion has been spent in the first four years of the national development plan on social and affordable housing measures, over 7% ahead of the forecast for that period, reflecting the strong commitment of the Government to continue to meet the needs of low income groups and those with social and special housing needs.The total amount of funding available for social and affordable housing measures in 2004 of €1.884 billion is more than four times that amount provided in 1997 and represents an increase of 5.4% on the 2003 provision. It is anticipated that the needs of over 13,000 households will be met through these measures in 2004, compared to almost 8,500 in 1998.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1196	Statistics on the payment of development contributions for all types of development contributions are collected by my Department on an annual basis. However, due to the lead-in time between the grant of planning permission for a development and the start of construction it is likely that the full impact of new development contribution schemes will not be measurable until 2006/2007.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1197	The public consultation procedures under section 179 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000 and Part 8 of the Planning and Development Regulations, 2001 are used where a local authority proposes to carry out development itself. Under section 179(1)(d) of the 2000 Act they may also be used where development is proposed to be carried out on behalf of, or in partnership with, the local authority in its own functional area, pursuant to a contract with the local authority, for example, by way of public private partnership. Private developments, save for developments on behalf of, or in partnership with, local authorities, must go through the normal planning process. My Department is not aware of cases of concern as referred to in the question.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1198	I refer to the replies to Question No. 557 of 23 March and Question No. 145 of 1 April 2004. In the intervening period Cork County Council has selected a firm of consultants to progress the investigation of the site, and work on the procurement process for this investigation has commenced.It is difficult to undertake major decontamination works on the site pending the site investigation, but some works have been ongoing. Further hazardous materials have been removed from the site and a contract awarded for the removal of about 300 tonnes of bagged dust resulting from the steel making process.Certain further decontamination works are under consideration at present, but these are constrained by the need to ensure that the intrusive site investigation is not obstructed. I stress, however, that while there is a large amount of unsightly waste at the site it is predominantly inert slags which do not pose a danger to the local area. Most hazardous materials which could be removed independently of the decontamination and dismantling of the industrial buildings have already been removed, or contracts have been awarded for their removal.

My Department is not involved in such operational matters.Waterways Ireland advises me that it ensures that the weir and sluice gates are kept free from debris; and all gates are inspected weekly, and in some instances, daily. Any debris hindering the flow of water is removed thereafter. Currently there is no debris at Meelick Weir and the sluice gates have been opened since 21 September 2004.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1200	I refer the Deputy to earlier questions on this matter, in particular to my reply to Question No. 151 and related questions on 4 February 2004, Questions Nos. 100 and 102 on 9 March 2004, and Question No. 127 on 27 April 2004.In implementing the Government decision detailed in those replies, local and community development groups were invited to make proposals for improved alignment of structures in their respective areas. City and county development boards were asked to co-ordinate this process. As indicated in the earlier replies, funding of €3.09 million had been earmarked to support specific co-ordinated measures arising from this process.Proposals have been received from all CDBs and have been assessed by an external consultant engaged by my Department. As a result of this process, I have approved proposals from Fingal CDB for funding. These proposals were very focused on improving current arrangements with regard to resources, staffing and geographic coverage. There were many other good ideas put forward by the other CDBs. However, they were asked to take a more focused look at their proposals and to resubmit these by 1 October. I intend to have these proposals assessed very quickly with early decisions on funding support.I hope to be able to build on the ideas put forward as part of this process with a view to including the review of local and community development structures in the first half of 2005.As I indicated last April, the first step in the process of restructuring ADM was the nomination of new board members by Government. In the interim the Government nominees have been appointed to the board. It is my intention that my Department will work closely with ADM to develop the changes to the memorandum and articles of association of ADM necessary for the implementation of the Government decision with regard to restructuring the company.In addition, I have made some changes to the community development programme. This programme supports locally-based groups involved in anti-poverty and social inclusion initiatives in their communities so that they can have a role in decisions which affect them, contribute to a process of change in their areas and improve their quality of life. To this end, financial assistance is provided to projects towards the staffing and equipping of local resource centres which provide a focal point for community development activities in the area and to other specialised projects and initiatives.A sum of €20,604,000 has been allocated to the programme for 2004. There are 190 projects included in the programme, of which 175 are in receipt of funding, including five projects on offshore islands. A further 15 pre-development projects have been approved in principle for inclusion in the community development programme. A sum of €500,000 has been set aside to fund these projects later this year. Arising from the review of local and community development structures, the Government has decided that public bodies and Departments should look to existing structures for delivery of new local or community development initiatives. In this regard, the Government also decided that any further community development projects established will be on the basis of maximising recourse to existing structures. Of the 15 pre-development projects included in the programme, 14 have submitted work plans. My Department is meeting with those groups to determine how their projects can be brought on stream in 2004, in a way which maximises recourse to existing structures.In line with the Government decision arising from the review of local and community development structures, the process of significantly reducing the funding available for intermediaries, such as regional support agencies, has continued. This serves to maximise resources available for community benefit. The number of such agencies with which my Department has a contract under the programme has been reduced from 13 to six. The six successful tenders commenced their contracts from 1 July 2004.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1201	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1266, 1268 and 1273, together.The purpose of the scheme of community support for older people is to encourage and assist the community's support for older people by means of a community based grant scheme to improve the security of its older members. Funding under the scheme can be provided for small scale security equipment designed to strengthen points of entry to the dwelling, for security lighting and for the once-off cost of installing socially monitored personal alarm systems. This year the scheme has been extended to include smoke alarms. Burglar alarm systems are not covered by the scheme.Following a review of the 2003 scheme by my Department a number of important changes were made to the scheme. The funding to any individual participant voluntary organisation was set at €30,000. In previous years a small number of organisations received sums in excess of this amount. However, the vast majority, 97%, of applicants were small community based voluntary groups which received sums less than €30,000. The average amount paid to groups in 2003 was less than €10,000. The purpose of this change is to re-focus the scheme on community groups and to re-direct resources towards smaller groups which have direct personal links with older people in their area and who are therefore better placed to understand and appreciate their needs. This change has no implications for the overall funding available for the scheme.The 2004 scheme was advertised nationwide on 29 July 2004 with a closing date of 13 September 2004. I have indicated that given the nature of this scheme my Department will be flexible and understanding in relation to applications received after the official closing date. My Department is currently engaged in processing applications for the 2004 scheme and grants will issue to community groups at the earliest possible date.In 1997-2004 some €30.88 million has been provided under this scheme to improve the security needs of older people. It is a measure of its success that a gradual fall-off in demand has been experienced as more people had their security needs met by the scheme. It is anticipated that the 2005 scheme will be advertised before June 2005, in order to allow greater time for groups to complete applications.

However, my Department continued to provide funding to the project on an interim basis until a decision was made in relation to any further funding contract. Due to ongoing difficulties within the project, my Department has advised the project that it is not in a position to renew its contract and that funding to the project will cease with effect from 30 September 2004. At this present time, officials from my Department are looking at ways in which all the assets and funding can be more appropriately directed towards community development in the west Clare area.

Rather it was anticipated that partnerships and community groups throughout the country would offer practical assistance and support to such students in finding temporary summer employment in the labour market as required.Such supports are by their nature local and informal and therefore it would not be feasible to accurately quantify the extent to which these supports have contributed to students finding summer employment.

Disability benefit is a short-term, contribution-based, payment and for that reason recipients are not eligible for the scheme.To be eligible to participate on the rural social scheme an individual must be in receipt of farm assist or have been allocated a valid herd-flock number from the Department of Agriculture and Food and be in receipt of one of the following payments from the Department of Social and Family Affairs: unemployment assistance, or unemployment benefit if entitled to the benefit because of a previous period on community employment, or disability allowance. Low-income fishermen are also eligible to participate on the scheme.The eligibility criteria, together with other aspects of the scheme, will be reviewed in the light of the operation of the scheme.

Many small-scale proposals from RAPID plans are now being dealt with more effectively at local level. To support this approach I have put in place a dedicated fund of €4.5 million in 2004, to help progress these proposals. These proposals are being co-funded by the relevant Department or local agency under a number of categories, with broad levels of funding agreed at national level.A total of €2 million is being provided for the local authority housing estate enhancement scheme. This scheme is being operated by the local authorities and is being funded on a euro for euro basis; €1 million from my Department and €1 million from the local authorities through the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Each of the three RAPID areas in Tallaght received an allocation of €60,000 under this scheme and the locations of the works to be undertaken are as follows:Rapid AreaLocation of worksFettercairnDrumcairn Ave, Drumcairn Drive, Kilcarraig Ave, Kilcarraig Close, Rossfield Green, Brookview EstateJobstownGlenshane Estate, Bawnlea, Cloonmire, Kilclare, DromcorraKillinardenDonmoreFunding of €3 million is being provided for the current year to support the development of playgrounds in RAPID areas; €1.5 million from my Department and €1.5 million from the Department of Health and Children.

All successful projects that were endorsed by the AIT were considered for top-up funding, with up to 30% additional funding being provided by my Department, subject to the total grant not exceeding 80% of project cost or the amount requested by the applicant. Details of allocations of top-up funding made by my Department to projects in Tallaght are as follows:ApplicantTop-Up Funding€Croí Ró Naofa GAA Club42,000Sacred Heart Football Club39,000SDCC — McGee Soccer Pitch6,000The roll-out of this programme is continuing and it is hoped to make further announcements regarding same in the near future.As regards the larger projects from RAPID plans that have already been submitted to Departments, these will, of course, continue to be considered for funding within existing funding streams in each Department. However, I expect that Departments will now be dealing with a smaller number of projects and will therefore be in a better position to prioritise projects and set out time scales for further actions.Finally, work on improving integration and co-ordination of service delivery at local level will continue, as this is a key component of the RAPID programme.

Fifteen of these priority areas were funded in 2003. A further 15 pre-development projects have been approved in principle for inclusion in the community development programme. €500,000 has been set aside to fund these projects this year.The Government recognises that local and community development measures are contributing significantly to tackling a range of challenges at local and community level. However, the number and complexity of structures involved in the delivery of these programmes is very extensive. With this in mind, a review of the structures employed in the delivery of local and community development programmes has been undertaken. Arising from the review, the Government has decided that public bodies and Departments should look to existing structures for delivery of new local or community development initiatives. In this regard, the Government also decided that any further community development projects established will be on the basis of maximising recourse to existing structures. Of the 15 pre-development projects included in the programme, 12 have submitted work plans. My Department is currently working with these projects to determine how best they can be brought on stream in 2004, in a way which maximises recourse to existing structures.With regard to the funding provided for the administration of the programme, some €20.6 million was allocated to the community development programme in 2004. The amount to be allocated to the programme in 2005 is a matter to be determined in the context of Estimates decisions.

Following a decision in that Department that the project no longer met the criteria for funding through area development management under the equal opportunities child care programme, my Department agreed to fund the project through its community development unit in recognition of the need to maintain the after schools services in the Amiens Street area. Short-term funding until the end of 2004 has been agreed. Subject to continued satisfactory progress within the project, I anticipate that funding will be made available to this project in 2005 from the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.However, I understand that the community after schools project has also applied for funding to the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursement Board. The board has decided to engage area development management to administer the initial round of funding on its behalf. This application is being evaluated by area development management against the criteria set out in the published guidelines. Following this evaluation process, a recommendation will be made to the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursement Board for decision. The community after schools project will be advised of the board's decision in due course.

In this context, the interdepartmental group on drugs, which I chair, meets regularly to assess progress by Departments and agencies in achieving the targets set for them. Any obstacles to the implementation of any of the actions are brought to light at these meetings. To date, approximately one third of the 100 actions have already been completed or are on-going tasks for the life of the strategy. With the exception of a few actions where work has yet to commence, work is in progress on the remainder.In the context of action 2 of the strategy, as the Minister with responsibility for the co-ordination of the National Drugs Strategy and chair of the interdepartmental group on drugs, I present regular progress reports on the implementation of the strategy to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion. The committee reviews and assesses the progress of the strategy with specific reference to its targets and performance indicators. A progress report on achievements in the strategy will be published before the end of the year. The mid-term review of the strategy is underway and I expect that it will be completed in late 2004 or early 2005.With regard to action 3, the young people's facilities and services fund supports in the region of 450 projects in the 14 local drugs task forces areas and four other urban centres. To date, approximately €75 million has been allocated under the two rounds of allocations under the fund. The sports capital programme gives extra weighting to areas of disadvantage and, from 2003, the programme has been prioritising local drugs task forces in RAPID and CLÁR areas in particular.With regard to action 77, I have been in correspondence and had discussions with the Chairperson of the Oireachtas Committee for Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs on the matter of establishing a sub-committee dedicated to the issue of drug misuse. As yet the terms of reference and the membership of the sub-committee have not been finalised. However, I should point out that I have met with members of the committee earlier in the year to discuss drugs in a special session.Over €80 million has been allocated to the local drugs task forces to implement their two rounds of local action plans. In addition, a further €12.8 million has been allocated to capital projects under the local drugs task forces premises initiative, which is designed to meet the accommodation needs of community-based drugs projects.

To qualify for participation in the third level option of the scheme an applicant must,  inter alia, be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for at least 15 months, 390 days, immediately prior to commencing an approved course of study. The person concerned does not meet this requirement and does not, therefore, satisfy the eligibility criteria for participation in the scheme.

Unemployment benefit is not affected by this measure. The disqualification does not apply in all cases. For instance, it does not apply to mature students, or people aged 21 years or over who were in receipt of an unemployment payment for at least six months immediately prior to commencing an approved course of education, training or development. In such cases, unemployment assistance may be paid during summer holidays, subject to the usual conditions being fulfilled regarding means, availability for work and genuinely seeking work. A mature student is defined as a person over 23 years of age on or before 1 January in the year in which the course of study commenced. There are no plans to change existing arrangements in this regard.

She does not therefore qualify for a supplement. She has been advised of her right to appeal against this decision but to date there is no record of an appeal.

It is also available to carers and to people with disabilities who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments. It applies to travel within the State and cross-Border journeys between the State and Northern Ireland. The Deputy's proposal to make free travel available to persons in receipt of Irish pensions but living abroad would have to be examined in a future budgetary context taking account of the other demands for extension of the free travel scheme and the cost and administrative implications involved.

The pension is based on 260 paid contributions, which can be a mixture of pre and post 1953 contributions, and is paid at half the full standard rate. Social insurance contributions made prior to 1953 are different to those made under the unified system introduced at that time. Such contributions do not contain any element towards the cost of contributory pensions. I consider that the structure of the pre-53 pension is a reasonable response to the position in which those eligible found themselves. Accordingly, I have no plans to amend the scheme along the lines suggested.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1224	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1293 and 1297 together.The income limit to which the Deputies refer applies to people who take up employment under the back to work scheme and similar approved employment schemes. Such people are entitled to retain certain social welfare and other benefits known as secondary benefits, for the duration of the scheme. For most people the most significant secondary benefit is rent or mortgage interest supplement which is paid under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. Supplementary welfare allowance is not normally payable to people in full-time employment. However, arrangements have been in place for a number of years which allow people to retain a portion of their rent supplement where they take up employment through approved schemes, subject to a weekly household income limit of €317.43.While the €317.43 income limit has not changed in recent years, significant changes have been made to the means test. Back to work allowance and family income supplement, in cases where one or both of these are in payment, are now disregarded in the assessment of the €317.43 weekly income limit. PRSI and reasonable travelling expenses are also disregarded in the means test. This means that people who had been unemployed and who commence employment through the back to work scheme can have a weekly household income significantly in excess of the €317.43 limit in question and still qualify to retain 75% of their rent or mortgage interest supplement.In the first year of their participation in the back to work scheme, a single person can have combined income from the back to work allowance and wages of €418.50, while a couple with two children can have an income of €510.75. Other improvements have also been made. The period for which rent supplement may be retained has been extended to four years on a tapered basis, i.e. 75% in year one, 50% in year two and 25% in years three and four. In addition, the maximum payment limit of €317.43 per month on the amount of supplement payable was abolished for people on the approved schemes. As a consequence many families retain more of their rent or mortgage interest supplement than had been the case prior to these changes taking place.As a participant in the back to work scheme a person can opt to be assessed under either standard rules or under retention rules, and will be entitled to receive payment under the more favourable option. Under standard assessment rules, rent or mortgage interest supplements are calculated to ensure that an eligible person, after the payment of rent or mortgage interest, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to his or her family circumstances, less a minimum contribution of €13 which each recipient is required to pay from his or her own resources.Family income supplement is now also disregarded in the standard means test. In addition, where the employment is part-time at less than 30 hours per week, up to €50 is disregarded in the means test. This ensures that a person is better off as a result of taking up such an opportunity. Other secondary benefits include retention of entitlement to back to school clothing and footwear allowance subject to the €317.43 income limit. Income from the back to work allowance scheme is now also disregarded in the assessment for this payment which means that the level of household income can be significantly in excess of the €317.43 limit in certain cases.The arrangements I have outlined are designed to encourage and assist people in the transition from reliance on welfare payments to full-time employment. One impact of the changes means that more people qualify for support under the standard rules of the schemes in question and are not subject to the thresholds that apply to the special rules governing retention of secondary benefits. Any further changes in the qualification criteria for retention of secondary benefits would have to be considered in a budgetary context.

Over that period, weekly payment rates to carers have been greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer's allowance have been significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer's benefit and the respite care grant have been introduced. The report of the joint committee, which I have examined, makes a range of recommendations, many of which relate to my Department and a number of which concern the Department of Health and Children.One of the recommendations relating to my Department is to pay 50% of the carer's allowance to recipients of widow's and widower's pensions who are providing care for an older person or a person with a disability. The primary objective of the social welfare system is to provide income support and, as a general rule, only one social welfare payment is payable to an individual. The cost of the committee's proposal in this regard is estimated to be in the region of €10 million annually. If the proposal was also to apply to recipients of the one parent family payment, which is an analogous payment, there would be an additional cost. The committee's report also recommends the abolition of the means test for the carer's allowance. It is questionable whether it would be the best use of such resources in the light of other competing demands and I am aware that there are differing views on this issue.The committee also recommended improvements in the information available to carers. I am pleased to have been able to provide funding of €18,000 to the Carers Association towards the publication and distribution of a new information pack which will provide information about services and supports for carers and their families. The information pack is being compiled by the association and will be distributed throughout the country in libraries, health board offices, clinics, citizen information centres and social welfare offices by the end of the year. It will contain important information for carers on the services and supports available to them and their families. In addition, my Department is finalising plans for a nationwide campaign to increase awareness of carer's benefit and carer's leave. This is planned to take place during October.I am always prepared to consider changes to existing arrangements where these are for the benefit of recipients and financially sustainable within the resources available to me. Those recommendations involving additional expenditure can only be considered in a budgetary context. I shall bear the committee's recommendations in mind in that context.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1227	The Department of Social and Family Affairs provides a range of income support services, including PRSI-based payments, social assistance, means tested, payments, associated secondary benefits and child benefit to a range of people, including people with mental health difficulties. Child dependant allowances are paid to claimants with qualifying dependants under the age of 18 years or, in certain circumstances, up to 22 years. Child benefit is a benefit paid every month for each qualified child normally living with and being supported by the claimant. A qualified child is aged under 16 years or if aged 16, 17 or 18 years in full-time education, or is attending a FÁS Youthreach course, or is physically or mentally disabled and dependent on a parent. Child benefit ceases when the child reaches age 19 years.My Department does not operate an income support scheme specifically for persons with mental health difficulties. It does operate an insurance-based payment for persons unable to work through illness in disability benefit and an assistance-based scheme for persons who are substantially handicapped from doing work otherwise suitable for a person of that age, experience and qualifications because of, inter alia, a physical or mental disability. Insurance-based payments such as unemployment benefit, and disability benefit can be made to people aged 16 years who meet the PRSI contribution conditions. Most means tested payments, including unemployment assistance are made only to people over the age of 18 years. The exception to this is the disability allowance which is payable from the age of 16 years.A recently completed review of the income maintenance payments for people who are ill and people with disabilities recommended that no change be made to the minimum age for payment of disability allowance at this stage as it would create a significant gap in the current range of supports for young people with disabilities. There are no plans at this stage to change the age at which disability allowance is payable.

Similarly, people who live in Northern Ireland and who hold a concessionary travel pass can travel free within that jurisdiction. Under the special cross-Border arrangements, in place since 1995, both pass holders can undertake cross-Border journeys free of charge. The introduction of free travel on an all-Ireland basis would enhance the existing arrangements by enabling pass holders in the Republic to make free onward journeys within Northern Ireland. Similarly, Northern Ireland pass holders would be able to make internal journeys within the Republic free of charge to them.There are a number of technical and financial issues to be resolved in order to implement an enhanced all-Ireland free travel system on these lines. These issues will require co-operation between my Department and the Department for Regional Development in Northern Ireland, as well as the participation of the relevant northern and southern transport operator companies. I met recently with the Minister of State at the Department for Regional Development in Northern Ireland, to discuss enhancements to the cross-Border free travel scheme and to explore the potential for co-operation between our Departments. Our discussions addressed options for co-funding the scheme, and certain technical issues. I hope to be in a better position to make further progress on this matter at an early date.

The maximum rate for the old age non-contributory pension is €154.00 per week. Additional allowances are paid to those with dependants, those who are living alone and those over 80 years of age. The payment of higher rates to recipients of social insurance payments is common practise in social welfare schemes where there is an equivalent social assistance scheme available. The commission on Social Welfare examined this issue in its report in 1986 and suggested that a differential of 10% should be maintained between insurance and assistance schemes. The Commission considered that the higher rates are required to preserve the acceptability of the social insurance concept, particularly from the viewpoint of those who contribute to the social insurance fund. The Pensions Board, in its report on the national pensions policy initiative, published in 1998, supported the conclusions of the commission.At the end of August 2004, there were 204,565 people receiving an old age contributory or retirement pension and 85,504 receiving an old age non-contributory pension. The numbers receiving non-contributory pensions have declined by over 20% in the last ten years which reflects improved social insurance coverage and increased labour force participation, particularly amongst women. It is also an indication of the Government's commitment to extending contributory based pensions to as many people as possible through easing the qualifying conditions and catering for special groups who marginally fail to qualify for a pension.

The deciding officer disallowed her claim for non-disclosure of means. She appealed this decision to the social welfare appeals office. The necessary papers for the appeal are being prepared and, when ready, the case will be referred to an appeals officer for early consideration. Under social welfare legislation, decisions on claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.

Arrangements are being made to have his payable order book issued to his designated post office. The applicant was not resident with the care recipient so his case was forwarded to an investigative officer of the Department to establish whether the conditions for the allowance were met and to establish his means. As there was no direct system of communication between the carer and the care recipient until 16 September 2004 there was a delay in determining his entitlement. Under social welfare legislation decisions on claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1245	With effect from 1 May 2004 the requirement to be habitually resident in Ireland was introduced as a qualifying condition for a range of social assistance and child benefit schemes operated by my Department. The old age non-contributory pension scheme is included among these schemes. The Government introduced the new rules to restrict access to unemployment assistance, supplementary welfare allowance, carer's allowance, one-parent family payment, old age pension and certain other social welfare payments in the case of people newly arrived in Ireland.The basis for the restriction contained in the new rules is the applicant's habitual residence. The restriction is not based on citizenship, nationality, immigration status or any other factor. The effect of the restriction is that a person whose habitual residence is in the United States, Europe, Africa or elsewhere is not paid certain social welfare payments including non-contributory old age pension on arrival in Ireland. The question of what is a person's habitual residence is decided in accordance with European Court of Justice case law, which sets out the grounds for assessing individual claims. The habitual residence condition is being operated in a careful manner to ensure that Ireland's social welfare system is no longer open to people who are not normally resident in Ireland, while at the same time ensuring that people whose cases are appropriate to the Irish social welfare system get access to social assistance when they need it. Every effort is made to find grounds for making a positive decision when cases are being considered. These grounds, however, have to be compatible with EU law and other international and national legal obligations and it is not possible to discriminate in favour of any particular group or nationality.The changes do not affect missionaries returning to Ireland on a permanent basis, for example to retire. They still qualify for an old age pension on the same basis as heretofore. Each case received for a determination on habitual residence condition is dealt with in its own right and a decision is based on application of the guidelines to the particular individual circumstances of each case. Any applicant who disagrees with the decision of the deciding officer has the right to appeal to the social welfare appeals office, which operates independently of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.The habitual residence condition is a major new development in the Irish social welfare system. Now that it has been in place for almost five months, I have asked my officials to carry out a review of its efficiency and effectiveness. This will include an examination of the implications for various groups, whose cases have come up for decision, including elderly missionaries returning to Ireland on a temporary basis on holiday.I am also anxious to promote comprehensive pensions provision for all individuals and groups into the future. In that context as I have previously indicated I am happy to enter into discussions with representatives of missionary orders and other groups to discuss their concerns over pensions and any other social welfare payments. I am committed to ensuring that no person whose circumstances are appropriate to the Irish social welfare system is disadvantaged by the introduction of the new condition.

Since the formation of the 29th Dáil in 2002, no legislation, governing functions for which I have responsibility, has been drafted by agents outside my Department.However, due to the technical and specialist nature of pensions legislation, there is an on-going agreement between my Department and the Office of the Attorney General to the out-sourcing of certain work in this area. This was the approach taken in the preparation of the Pensions (Amendment) Act 2002. As part of that process, outline draft legislation was produced and was submitted in the normal way to the Office of the Attorney General for drafting.At this time I have no intention to use external bodies to draft future legislation. However, should the need arise to engage external expertise where the legislation required is of a particularly technical and specialist nature, I will seek the most effective and efficient means of doing so.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1247	Pro rata pensions based on partial contribution records are already a feature of the social insurance pension system. Under present arrangements a person can qualify for pensions on the basis of a yearly average of ten contributions paid or credited on their social insurance record from 1953, when the unified system of social insurance came into effect, or the date of entry into insurance, if later; they must also have paid at least 260 contributions in total at the appropriate rate; and have entered insurance ten years before reaching pension age.In recent years, a number of measures have been introduced to make qualification for old age pensions easier for people with reduced or broken insurance records. In 1997, the average yearly number of contributions required for a minimum pension was reduced from 20 contributions to ten. Other measures introduced include pro rata pensions for people with insurance contributions at different rates or contributions from other countries, and special pensions such as the pre-53 payment and the special self employed pension. The concessions introduced are designed to ensure the widest possible coverage for contributory pensions while, at the same time, ensuring that persons qualifying for pensions have had a reasonable attachment to the social insurance fund. Where people fail to qualify for contributory pension on the basis of the present conditions it is open to them to apply for non-contributory means tested pension.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1248	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1318, 1319 and 1326 together.My Department has received 5,655 applications for carer's allowance this year. A total of 5,241 claims have been determined and another 469 claims were withdrawn so far this year, including some claims received towards the end of 2003. A total of 3,220 persons were awarded carer's allowance in the first instance. There were 89 carer's allowance appeals allowed and the applicants concerned were subsequently awarded carer's allowance. Entitlement to carer's allowance is based on an applicant satisfying medical, means and residency conditions. In some cases there is an unavoidable timelag involved in making the necessary investigations and inquiries to enable decisions to be made. For example, there is an onus on applicants to furnish all necessary documentation. Time can elapse through delays by applicants not supplying all the necessary information in support of their claim. The average time taken to award carer's allowance is 14 weeks in the year to date. The target is to decide 70% of all claims within 13 weeks.My Department is committed to providing a quality service to all its customers. This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are issued as expeditiously as possible having regard to the eligibility conditions which apply. A number of improvements have recently been introduced by my Department to directly address the efficiency of claim processing for the allowance.A review of all existing processes and procedures has been undertaken with the explicit objective of reducing delays in claim processing. In this regard, applicants who are refused on medical eligibility grounds are provided with an interim decision. Such decisions are concluded within five weeks rather than the applicant waiting until all other aspects of their claim are decided. This allows the applicant to submit additional medical evidence if he or she so wishes at an earlier stage rather than waiting until all investigations are completed. All applications which can, on the medical evidence, be automatically medically approved, are fast-tracked. Priority is being given to claims where a decision on entitlement has been outstanding more than eight weeks.Additional staff resources have been recently assigned specifically to improve the delivery of service. The impact of these measures will over time, lead to more efficient processing and reduce the number of claims on hand. The position will be closely monitored and kept under review by my Department.

In addition, many households also qualify for electricity and gas allowances. The estimated cost of the fuel allowances in 2004 is €84 million. The estimated additional cost in 2005 terms of extending the fuel allowances to a full year would be approximately €66 million giving a total cost of some €150 million. The extension would benefit some 270,000 households.The duration of payment was increased from 26 weeks to 29 weeks in April 2001. The means test was eased with effect from October of that year and the rate of fuel allowance was increased by 42% in January 2002.Significant increases in recent years in primary social welfare payment rates, such as the old age pension, have improved the income position for people dependent on the social welfare system. Primary payment rates are payable for the full 52 weeks of the year and hence increases in these rates are of greater benefit to social welfare recipients.The question of further changes in the fuel allowance scheme, including changes to income disregards, is a matter for consideration in a budgetary context.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1250	The figures in question refer to those in employment who have private or occupational pensions coverage and relate to the first quarter of 2002. A limited update of these figures for the first quarter of 2004, recently released by the CSO, show coverage at 52.4%.People may not have private or occupational pensions coverage for a number of reasons. Their employer may not provide a pensions scheme, they may be eligible to join a scheme but have opted not to do so or they may not be willing to avail of the various options which are available to take out a private pension.Improvements in social insurance coverage implemented since 1979 mean that almost all those in employment are now, subject to satisfying the qualifying conditions, eligible for an old age contributory pension at age 66. However, the Government is committed to increasing the numbers who are supplementing the social welfare pension with an occupational or private pension. The national pensions policy initiative, published in 1998, suggested that up to 70% of workers over 30 years of age need such coverage to maintain their pre-retirement standard of living. The most recent figures released by the CSO show 59.1% of workers in this group with supplementary pensions coverage.The Government introduced personal retirement savings accounts, PRSAs, in 2003 and these are low cost portable pension products aimed at those without access to occupational pensions. Indeed, employers who do not provide such access are required to facilitate employees who wish to avail of a PRSA by entering into an arrangement with a PRSA provider and deducting and remitting contributions. At the same time, a Government awareness campaign is being run by the Pensions Board on my behalf to encourage people to consider their financial needs in retirement and to make the appropriate arrangements. So far, a total of €1 million has been provided to support this campaign.The current strategy will be reviewed, in accordance with legislation, in 2006. At that stage, progress towards Government targets will be considered and further action decided on, as appropriate.

Exceptions to this general rule apply in the case of certain family employments which are not covered for social insurance — for example, employment as an employee by one's spouse who is a self-employed sole trader or businessperson. However, if the business does not operate on a sole trader basis — for example, if it is a limited company or a partnership — it is not family employment.Accordingly, two or more family members who operate a business as a partnership and share the profits may be insurable as self-employed contributors at PRSI class S, provided each has a reckonable income of at least €3,174 per year from all sources.The partnership must be genuine and be supported by appropriate documentary evidence. Joint ownership of a property does not in itself constitute a partnership agreement. Applications for the backdating of partnership status are not accepted.According to the information given the person concerned will reach age 66 in 2009.

The location of Comhairle alongside the IT division will have advantages in the context of progressing the wider eGovernment agenda.Comhairle has a statutory commitment to assist and support people, especially those with disabilities, in identifying and understanding their needs and options and in accessing their entitlements to social and civil services. In discharging their duties, Comhairle staff have occasion to meet representatives of the disabled community, many of whom rely on public transport to attend these meetings. In this context, it was also considered that Drogheda, would facilitate easier access to Comhairle services for those concerned.There is no change to the announcement in relation to Monaghan. The commitment of 85 posts for Carrickmacross will be fulfilled by relocating 85 posts from my Department to that location. A decision on the sections that will relocate to Carrickmacross will be finalised in the near future.

The programme is for the long-term unemployed and certain others such as lone-parents and people receiving disability payments.The conditions for entitlement to the third level option of the back to education allowance were revised with effect from 1 September 2004. From that date, the qualifying period was increased from six months to 15 months for new applicants intending to commence third level courses of study.The scheme was always intended for the benefit of people who had difficulty finding employment as the scheme provided an opportunity which might enable them to improve their qualifications and thus their prospects of obtaining work. It was never intended to be an alternative form of support for people entering the third level education system.One of the factors that influenced me in changing the qualification conditions is the concern that some people go on the live register for short periods specifically to qualify for the back to education allowance. In the 2003-04 academic year, the majority of participants in the third level option of the scheme were in receipt of an unemployment payment for 12 months or less when they accessed the scheme.The scheme is intended to assist people with a history of long-term dependence on social welfare and in many circumstances situations where persons who have not completed second level education are held back in their efforts to obtain employment. Therefore, I decided that the qualifying condition should remain at six months for people who wish to pursue a second level qualification.In deciding to restructure the back to education allowance, I am ensuring that this support retains its focus on the more vulnerable groups in our community, particularly people who do not have a second level education qualification and who are at risk of becoming dependent on social welfare payments on a long-term basis.I want to ensure that available resources are aimed at those in greatest need of an intervention to prevent them from drifting into long-term unemployment. This change recognises the more urgent need for intervention in the case of people who have not completed formal second level education. Time spent pursuing a second level course with the assistance of the back to education scheme will count towards meeting the 15 month qualification condition for the third level option.I have ensured, in a situation where priorities had to be set and choices made, that those in the greatest need of assistance under the BTEA scheme have been protected.

His late spouse, who has been deceased for a number of years, did not have a social insurance contribution record.On the basis of her late father's social insurance contribution record, the qualifying conditions for receipt of bereavement grant have not been met and the application has been disallowed. She has been notified of this decision and of her right of appeal.

Following an investigation of her circumstances by a social welfare inspector, her initial application was disallowed on the basis that her income from self-employment exceeded the maximum statutory limit for entitlement to pension. Her second application for pension was disallowed on the basis that she had failed to disclose her means fully to the Department. She was formally notified of these decisions in writing. It remains open to her to appeal to the social welfare appeals office.As old age non-contributory pension is a means-tested payment, it is necessary for pension applicants to be interviewed by a social welfare inspector in order to determine their financial circumstances. There is an obligation on applicants to disclose their means fully to the Department.The Department operates a customer service charter and aims to deal with all of its customers in a fair, courteous and timely way. If the person concerned has a complaint to make about the manner in which she was interviewed, she should bring this to the attention of my Department through her nearest social welfare local office and it will be investigated through the formal customer complaints service.

The principal conditions for receipt of the allowance are that the medical eligibility criteria are met and that the means test which applies is satisfied.While the medical eligibility criteria were met, the application was disallowed by a deciding officer on the grounds that his means, derived from his spouse's employment and the letting of land, exceeded the statutory limit.He appealed this decision to the social welfare appeals office. Following an examination of his case, the appeals officer disallowed his appeal. He was directly notified of the outcome of his appeal on 25 May 2004. An appeals officer's decision is final in the absence of new facts or fresh evidence.A further application for disability allowance was received on 16 September 2004. This is being referred to the local investigative officer of the Department to ascertain his current means and whether there has been any change in circumstances since the last assessment.His entitlement to disability allowance will be further considered in light of the officer's report and a formal decision will issue to him directly.

In a number of social assistance schemes where each one of a couple has an entitlement to a personal rate of payment, the overall amount payable is limited to the relevant family rate. This arrangement applies equally to unmarried and cohabiting couples. There are currently no plans to change these arrangements.

In relation to interview boards, the policy on gender equality states that there should be a gender mix on boards and my Department complies with this requirement. This includes meeting the requirements on the composition of interview boards and, in addition, ensuring that interview board members are aware of their responsibilities under equality policies and equality legislation generally.

In the case of carer's allowance, approximately 25% of claims are desk assessed. This means that means are determined on the basis of the information supplied on the claim form or by subsequent correspondence. The remainder of claims are referred to a social welfare inspector who visits the customer at his or her home. These latter cases usually involve more complex means issues or where the information supplied on the claim form is incomplete. Cases may also be referred to an inspector for a home visit where there are issues, other than means, which require clarification before a decision can be made. Similar procedures apply in the case of other schemes such as one parent family payment and disability allowance.The existing arrangements take into account the Department's obligations to ensure that an effective control programme is in place. The control programme is multi-faceted involving checks at time of claiming, where appropriate, as well as reviews of means and the continued fulfilment of other statutory conditions for receipt of the relevant payment.The arrangements for the processing of social assistance payments will continue to be developed in the context of providing an enhanced service to all our customers and stakeholders and to ensuring that the resources of the Department are used in the most efficient and effective manner.

In July 2004, this location was also selected as the base for my Department's IT division.I have also decided that Comhairle, which it was intended to locate to Carrickmacross, will also be located to Drogheda with the requirement for Carrickmacross being met by departmental staff.There are in total six locations to which my Department will be relocating under the programme. A preliminary implementation plan setting out, inter alia, the staff breakdown for each location was submitted to the decentralisation implementation group. The plan will now be reviewed in the light of the recent results from the central applications facility.My Department is also in regular contact with the Office of Public Works, OPW, which will be responsible for securing suitable accommodation for all my Department's decentralised locations, including Drogheda.

He will be advised of the date and venue for the hearing when the necessary arrangements have been made.Under social welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.

A spouse is regarded as wholly or mainly maintained where she-he does not have income in his-her own right above €88.88 per week. Where the income is between €88.88 per week and €210 per week a reduced rate of allowance is payable. Once his-her weekly income exceeds €210 per week no allowance is payable.On foot of a notification received from the wife of the person concerned indicating that she commenced employment on 18 June 2004 with earnings of €234.73 per week, a revised decision was made disallowing the increase that was in payment in her respect. A payable order book containing payment at the maximum single rate was re-issued on 20 September 2004 pending further inquiries. The position was explained to the person concerned and he was requested to submit further information in relation to his wife's earnings.As it would now appear that the wife of the person concerned has also been self-employed during a period for which an increase was in payment in respect of her, a social welfare inspector has been requested to review the case and determine her earnings for the period in question. On receipt of the inspectors report, the appropriate action will be taken without delay.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1277	Where earnings as an employee are received at monthly intervals, the weekly average over the previous two months is taken to determine means in deciding entitlement to the payment of an increase in respect of a qualified adult for old age contributory pension purposes. Where earnings are received weekly or fortnightly, the weekly average over the previous six weeks is taken. Regulations allow, however, for a deciding officer to use discretion in selecting an appropriate period of time in order to determine the amount of average weekly income. In the case of persons who are self-employed, weekly income is normally estimated by reference to the income received in the last complete tax year.
