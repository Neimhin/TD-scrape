#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I thank the Leader for agreeing to change the starting time for No. 3. The change was required because our spokesperson could not be in two places at the one time.Some weeks ago the Leader organised a debate following the abduction of Margaret Hassan. We have learned only in the past 24 hours that it seems Margaret Hassan is dead. This is a shocking and bloody murder and I want to extend our sympathy to her family and her husband, in particular, following the news that has come from Iraq in the past day or so. This woman was against the war and sanctions. She stood shoulder to shoulder with the Iraqi people for most of her adult life and has been destroyed in the most appalling way. In her memory and the memory of countless other people who have been kidnapped and murdered in this way, there is a responsibility on civilised society and governments throughout the world to bring some stability to Iraq to ensure elections can proceed and that some normality is brought to that war-torn land. Our sympathies are with her family today.The Leader, as a former Minister for Public Enterprise, knows well that there seem to be sharp differences between both Government parties regarding the future of Aer Lingus. I am not sure what happened to the notion of collective Cabinet responsibility. It seems to have gone very much outside the door. Will the Leader organise a debate with the Minister for Transport on this issue? He indicated this morning that he has a short period in which to make up his mind about the future of Aer Lingus. The Government should publish the Goldman Sachs report as soon as possible and circulate the information in the public domain. I have no great hang-ups regarding public or private funding for the airline going forward. It is important that it remain competitive, profitable and focused on its customers. If this means a flotation in the marketplace or the investment of substantial private funding in the airline, so be it. It is important that the Government make a decision and not continue with its procrastination, which led to the resignation of Mr. Walsh and his colleagues over the past 48 hours.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	3	While I agree with the words of Senator Brian Hayes on Margaret Hassan, I would prefer to wait until we are absolutely sure she is dead before I comment. It would be appropriate to speak at that time.On reading this morning's newspapers, one would believe there were only three people working in Aer Lingus. People have forgotten that, over the past 12 or 13 years, Aer Lingus has reduced its workforce by thousands, increased its productivity, co-operated with Cahill plans, recovery plans, Willie Walsh's plans and those of everyone else. I would like a balanced debate on this issue without politicking. I would also like to see the publication of the Goldman Sachs plans so that I could say in the House that they have suggested selling off the airline or part of it. To paraphrase Mandy Rice-Davies's statement of some years ago, "They would, wouldn't they?". That is what their business is about and that is how they would get their money.Yesterday we all received a guide for board members of State bodies. It is worthwhile looking at page 17, which states that a board and a CEO of a board are required to have clear channels of communication with the stakeholders and to make sure these channels are working. In a previous esteemed job, our esteemed Leader, in the course of her daily ablutions one morning, heard of a major change in one of the State companies. We have seen three young men in a hurry doing a very good job but, without any discussion with the stakeholder, they put forward a proposal for an MBO and a new recovery plan. They have done a good job and should be praised for it, and I have supported them in what they have had to do and am sorry to see them go, but the reality is that when those young men in a hurry were made, the mould was not broken. There are many others who can do the job. The view in this morning's business pages that the company is dead because three people have left it is questionable. It is a pity they have done so, they have done a great job and I ask them to reconsider their positions. However, if they go, they go, and we should move on to the next step. I would like a representative of the Government to explain to the House what the Government is doing and how it will proceed.

It took him until his mid-50s to discover it. Perhaps he will show the zeal of a recent convert. We could have a debate before Christmas on the pre-budget submission of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the response to which would be a good test of anybody's socialism. It should not be a question of the Government's feeling bad because others feel bad but of doing something about poverty, which is what socialism is about.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	15	I compliment Senator Maurice Hayes on a fine piece he wrote in The Sunday Tribune last Sunday about the apparent act of vandalism about to be perpetrated by the National Roads Authority. A former member of this House and former professor of archaeology, George Eogan, also subscribes to that view. I am not sure I would want this House to discuss the routing of motorways in the normal course of events. However, our heritage is of fundamental importance and we cannot allow an agency of the State to use trite arguments that do not stand up to any serious scientific analysis to pursue this issue any further.I do not subscribe to the view that Aer Lingus has been such a great success. It is making money but the process by which it has made money has involved the effective disconnection of our national airline from most of the country outside Dublin. I intended flying up here this morning and it would have cost me €200 return with Aer Lingus's replacement, Aer Arann. Since Aer Lingus serves just six routes out of Cork in the winter, if I were to use the airline to fly anywhere other than the six routes, I would pay €200 to Aer Arann, plus whatever Aer Lingus would charge. I do not call that a national success, therefore, I do not have the same level of adulation for the three people who left.

#TomMorrissey	unknown-#TomMorrissey-party	unknown-#TomMorrissey-dob	unknown-#TomMorrissey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	20	The management team will no longer be there to kick around. The position of the Progressive Democrats is that a decision must be made on the future of Aer Lingus. Some people, including the unions, believe that the job is over because Aer Lingus was saved from bankruptcy. The job is just beginning in terms of driving the airline forward in order to continue to compete. This House must ensure that Aer Lingus remains strong and competitive.

#TomMorrissey	unknown-#TomMorrissey-party	unknown-#TomMorrissey-dob	unknown-#TomMorrissey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	22	There was more discussion at the transport committee about the shamrock than about Aer Lingus customers and how the airline was selling itself. The Irish people are flying much more than they have ever done. As an island nation, Ireland has not lost out in the European and world context, and we must move on from this hang-up with a national airline.
#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	23	I respect Senator Morrissey for his straight talking on this issue. I recently heard him speak on the issue. Sacrifices made by workers, as well as management, have been responsible for the success of Aer Lingus in recent times. In the past two years, the airline made a profit of almost €200 million. The resignation of the management team will cause much uncertainty in the marketplace, therefore, the last thing one needs is dither and fudge. One should take cognisance of any reports, which have been commissioned, including the Goldman Sachs report. I would like the Government to make a decision in the near future on the future of Aer Lingus.I agree with Senator Ryan that it is very expensive to fly to Dublin from regional airports, whether with Aer Arann or Aer Lingus, and regardless of whether one travels from Shannon or Cork. This is in direct contradiction of the marketing policies advocated by Ryanair and Aer Lingus offering packages to all foreign destinations at very reduced rates while the Irish customer who wants to stay in this country and fly within it is ripped off. I would like the issue to be seriously examined.In Inchydoney, the Taoiseach said he did not care any more for left or right. Not too long ago he described himself as a social democrat. In the past week he described himself as a socialist. In the animal kingdom he would be described as a chameleon. The Taoiseach is very skilful in adapting according to the marketplace.

I will leave that to my esteemed colleague, the Fianna Fáil spokesperson in that area, Senator Dooley, who, I am sure, will have something to say on it. As somebody who supports Aer Lingus, we should think about the staff at this time and the uncertainty surrounding their futures. I hope the issue will be resolved.I also agree with the comments expressed regarding the unfortunate Ms Margaret Hassan. Like my colleagues, I too believe that, where there is even a modicum of hope that the video report is not totally accurate, we should reserve comment. I understand an expert analysis of that video is being done as we speak.Will the Leader consider debating, in the context of tourism, an issue which was raised over the weekend by The Observer columnist, Henry McDonald, namely, funding for the Linenhall Library in Belfast? I was shocked to discover that one of the most important collections of memorabilia relating to the conflict in the North is being closed down in the Linenhall Library because of lack of funding and that, until such time as funding is received from Belfast City Council, it will remain closed. This is one of the most important collections of its type on the island and attracts large numbers of tourists into Belfast. I support the point Mr. McDonald made and ask the Leader to convey it to the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism. Tourism Ireland, an all-island body in the business of attracting tourism, should immediately consider unlocking sufficient funds to ensure this important collection is reopened to the public.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	26	I join my colleagues in expressing revulsion at the apparent murder of Ms Margaret Hassan and in extending my sympathy to her family. She is a very remarkable, good, courageous, decent woman and a friend of the Iraqi people. The House should also note that even some of the most extreme groups in Iraq which have been involved in beheadings appealed to the people holding Ms Hassan not to kill her. Let us not use this to engage in Islam-bashing, not that anybody in the House has done so. It is remarkable that, although the Al Jazeera television station had this footage for a week and people obviously knew about it, it was released when it was. It effectively blew off the front pages the other story of an unarmed wounded Iraqi man being blasted to death inside a mosque by an American soldier, in defiance of every code of decency. I hope that issue does not die.I am not sure whether I should address this to the Cathaoirleach or to the Leader. I have had a communication from an Irish citizen who made a suggestion we might take up, namely, that because of the increasing cycle of horror and death both Houses of the Oireachtas should hold a minute's silence. We held a minute's silence last week, which was futile because the two wars are over and there is nothing we can do about them. If our Government could organise a minute's silence in every parliament throughout Europe simultaneously, perhaps people would stand back a little and ask themselves how we got into this.I have asked many times for information on the Gulfstream jet at Shannon but have not received a reply. I hope the Leader can get one. How will we feel if it transpires that we must face the family of somebody who was flown through Irish airspace and the excuse is given that the aeroplane landed but nobody got on or off? That is peculiar in itself. I understand that aeroplane has landed approximately 16 times. It should not land again without an explanation to the people regarding its activities.I ask for a debate on the extremely serious situation in Iraq. Such a debate is essential. Mr. Tom Clonan has said in The Irish Times that “as the cycle of violence continues, it is essential to know and to hope that Presidents Bush’s Cabinet reshuffle will bring about wiser counsel as to the manner in which military power is used as an instrument of United States foreign policy”. What has President Bush done, however? He has removed Mr. Colin Powell from office and installed Ms Condoleeza Rice as his successor. He has brought in Mr. John Bolton, who in the 1990s proposed the abolition of the United Nations. He is one of the architects of the war in Iraq and is more extreme even than Mr. Donald Rumsfeld.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	27	The Senator's comments would be more appropriate in a debate on the war in Iraq.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	28	I am giving the reasons that such a debate is essential. We must think of the civilian population in places such as Falluja. The so-called health Minister in the interim Iraqi administration claims that there is not a significant problem regarding civilian casualties, as does the United States army. Members and instruments of the press in Iraq are instructed, under threat of legal sanctions, to write about nothing but the victory in Falluja. What about Iraqi civilians? We in Ireland must stand up for them.

#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	31	I again ask the Leader if there can be a debate on the western rail corridor. I am hopeful that when Mr. Pat McCann, chairman of the working group, reports next month, he will be able to recommend the re-opening of the line from Claremorris through Tuam and on to Galway. I am disappointed that Iarnród Éireann has not been positive about this issue. The company is talking in terms of improving the lines from Galway to Dublin and from Mayo to Dublin. We would all welcome such improvements but there is now the suggestion of an hourly service from Galway to Dublin. There are currently seven trains each way on this route and it is now time to consider the western rail corridor. I hope the success of the Limerick-Ennis line will set a precedent to allow Iarnród Éireann to make an early decision on the matter.Yesterday, I met representatives of the NRA and other groups in County Galway. We were told it would take six years to bypass Claregalway, and the same length of time to build a new road from Tuam to Galway. We could have a new commuter rail link in six months if the go-ahead were given by the Government and CIE. I hope this action is taken and that the House will have the opportunity to debate the issue before the report is presented in December.

I sympathise with her sister, Ms Geraldine Riney, and her family in Kenmare, with all members of the Fitzsimons family, in Dublin and elsewhere, and with Ms Hassan's husband.I agree with Senator Brian Hayes and other colleagues that a clear-cut Government decision is urgently required with regard to Aer Lingus. Everyone would like to know the contents of the Goldman Sachs report and that information should be put in the public domain. I support the calls for a debate on this matter.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	33	I join with other Senators in calling for a debate on Aer Lingus at the earliest possible opportunity. There is much misinformation abroad. As Senator O'Toole said, one would be forgiven for believing that the airline is in some level of turmoil in terms of its economic situation, if one takes notice of some of the headlines in today's newspapers. The company will this year turn in a profit in excess of €95 million. It is important to recognise, however, that there is a strategic role for Aer Lingus and that it is not merely a question of maximising profits. There are other interests which must be maintained, particularly with regard to tourism, economic development and regional development. The latter is a critical issue, especially in the mid-west and Shannon regions.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	34	Many Senators are offering and I ask Senator Dooley to conclude.

I am delighted that the attempted corporate hijack by the management team has been averted and that the Government rejected the proposed buy-out. I too wish to be associated with the good wishes extended to the management team. Members of that team have done a good job and I hope they find satisfaction in their future careers. As Senator O'Toole observed, however, the success enjoyed by the management team at Aer Lingus was secured in conjunction with the unions, workers and the Government. It is not just three people who have created this situation.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	36	The criticism is often made of newspapers that they only carry bad news. Perhaps criticisms could be made of this House and politicians in general that we concentrate on bad news. A survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit reported in today's newspapers states that we have the best quality of life of any country in the world. We should proclaim that and be happy about it. Of course we have problems and face challenges and we should have a determination to solve them, but we should not be shy about holding our heads up in pride on occasions when we hear such news. This survey is included in a well-respected journal that sells more in the United States than in Asia or Britain.The survey takes into account measures such as political freedom, family and community life, gender equality——

Of course we must do something about them, but can we be determined to proclaim such good news from the top?The city of Melbourne in Australia was found for two years in a row to be the best city in the world in which to live.

The current situation is most unacceptable for her poor family. Those of us who have been following her plight over the past month know there are no words for it. We were sickened when word came through yesterday that there was a 90% probability that she was the victim of the horrific murder. To quote a much used phrase, she was more of an Iraqi than any Iraqi person. She has been living there for 30 years, looking after the underprivileged and the down and out. As Irish people we owe it to one of our own to get clarification so that her family can grieve in the way they deserve.

It is important that the Leader invite the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to the House to debate the widespread problem of illegal dumping in our countryside and the failure of the Government to clamp down on or stamp out this problem which affects our tourism industry and ourselves as a people and a nation.

#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	50	I do not see much point in having debates on Aer Lingus unless the Taoiseach comes to the House. Senator O'Toole referred to the lack of a need for politicking. I sympathise with that but Aer Lingus is all about politics. That is the trouble with it. The person who is pulling the strings on Aer Lingus is not Mr. Walsh, the management or the Minister; it is the Taoiseach. We only had to listen to the Minister, Deputy Cullen, speak today on "Morning Ireland" and other programmes and hear how he managed to say absolutely nothing for about three quarters of an hour. We need a debate and we need the Taoiseach to come to the House because he is the man who has been saying he does not want an MBO or many other formulae. In the meantime, the Taoiseach and Ministers have been sitting on this issue for far too long. There is a sub-committee, which, for some reason, has not met. Unless Senator Morrissey and others put greater pressure on the Taoiseach no decision will be made on Aer Lingus until the next general election or the next crisis.

The Taoiseach is, clearly, pulling the strings. Perhaps he should be in the House when we debate this issue.I raise the issue of the direct marketing of credit in the run-up to Christmas. Yesterday, I received a letter from a leading financial institution offering me a substantial personal loan. I know others have received similar letters from other institutions. The letter invites me to, "Say yes to the things you really want", and offered a personal loan of €25,000.

I also ask that she organise a debate with the Minister for Education and Science to ask her why only €100 million of the €200 million allocated for the primary schools building programme has been spent so far, and the implications of that.I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator Ross. It is time we had a real debate about Aer Lingus. It is clear that Aer Lingus needs the option of further investment. If one compares the investment made by Aer Lingus in aircraft with that of Ryanair, it is clear Aer Lingus is very far behind. Aer Lingus is now profitable but that can be eroded very quickly by outside forces.
#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	75	The Leader will recall that a number of suggestions were made in the aftermath of the Government reshuffle. The Leader agreed to invite all the Cabinet Ministers to the House to outline their priorities for their terms of office and to have a degree of dialogue with the Seanad.

The management team in Aer Lingus has been successful but, let us be honest, the successful formula was created by Ryanair because competition is the spice of trade. It is a disgrace that the Government has not moved on the creation of a second terminal at Dublin Airport. Look at what is happening today. There are many routes out of Stansted and other airports, but Ryanair is only operating two routes directly from Dublin to Europe. Unless the Government and its sub-committee takes action we will be facing another downturn in tourism. Ryanair has provided a successful formula to rejuvenate the airline industry.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	78	I concur with Senator Brian Hayes and have no doubt that Margaret Hassan has been murdered. Her sisters were on television and said that if they knew Margaret was dead they would feel relieved. One can imagine the trauma of their daily lives, wondering what she was going through. It is quite horrific.Senator Brian Hayes also raised the issue of Aer Lingus and spoke of the sharp difference in policy between the Government parties. He sought a debate on the matter. We should publish the Goldman Sachs report, seize the day and move on with it.Senator O'Toole also sought a debate on Aer Lingus and I agree with him that there are not only three people concerned. A discussion with the stakeholders is needed. We have all been speaking in a roundabout way but nobody has referred to the board and its chairman who has the responsibility to approach the major stakeholder, namely, the Minister, and tell him what is happening at board level. There has been a remarkable lacuna on the part of the current acting chairman of the Aer Lingus board. The chairman, rather than the chief executive, has the responsibility to act as a conduit between the board and the Minister. The two previous chairmen were most punctilious in that regard.Senator Ryan referred to Senator O'Toole as a former socialist but I would stand up for Senator O'Toole in this regard because he was always a socialist.

We would all welcome that approach.Senator Mooney spoke about the staff at Aer Lingus. He also spoke about the article by Mr. Henry McDonald in The Observer, which stated that, since it is an all-Ireland body, Tourism Ireland should turn its mind to the question of funding for the Linenhall Library in Belfast. I will pass that matter on to the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O’Donoghue.Senator Norris spoke about Ms Margaret Hassan. The news of her alleged death took the emphasis away from the killing of the wounded soldier. The Senator believes the two Houses should have a minute's silence in opposition to violence. He also spoke about the Gulfstream jet. I have asked for a debate on Iraq every week and will try again this week. Having seen the exultation of the soldiers over how many they have killed and what they have done in Falluja, this is certainly not the bright dawn that was presaged for Iraq.Senator Kitt brought us all down to earth in discussing the need to debate the western rail corridor before the report is published.Senator Coghlan spoke of a clear-cut decision on Aer Lingus and Senator Dooley referred to the strategic importance of the airline. He again echoed the words of Senator O'Toole in saying it was not down to just three people. I am sure Aer Lingus has many talented people at managerial level.While Senator Quinn wants us to be "clappy-happy" all the time, I am not so sure. A colleague of mine said here that someone stuck on the M50 for an hour and a quarter in the morning does not feel like talking about the best quality of life. I must read the article in The Economist. Since Melbourne was labelled as one of the best cities, it has adopted a “clappy-happy” policy. It would be hard to keep it up.Senator Feeney felt it was important for the husband and family of Ms Margaret Hassan to get firm news of her.Senator Bannon spoke about illegal dumping and said the hugging with the Progressive Democrats was over. It depends on whom one wants to hug.

#TomParlonPD	unknown-#TomParlonPD-party	unknown-#TomParlonPD-dob	unknown-#TomParlonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	104	I welcome this opportunity to reiterate my personal commitment and that of the Government to the public private partnership model as a procurement option. This debate is timely given that the Government approved a programme of pilot PPP projects in 1999, a number of which have a now been completed. We are building on the experience to date in the context of the Government's commitment to invest significantly in public infrastructure in the years ahead.While the private sector has often undertaken work with the public sector, PPPs are a new form of partnership, which focus on a whole life and integrated approach to the procurement of large-scale public assets or services which would otherwise have been provided by the public sector. A national framework agreement on PPPs was agreed in 2001 between the public sector, including the main Departments and agencies engaged in the PPP programme, and the relevant social partners — IBEC, ICTU and the ClF. PPPs were defined as an arrangement between the public and private sectors with clear agreement on shared objectives for the delivery of public infrastructure and-or public services by the private sector that would otherwise have been provided through traditional public sector procurement.PPPs in Ireland take a number of forms, such as design, build, operate and finance, DBOF, or design, build and operate, DBO. Under the DBOF model, the private sector generally constructs and makes available the asset or service before any public money changes hands and the State then remunerates the private sector — subject to satisfactory performance — for the costs incurred in the design, build, operation, maintenance or financing of the asset. The payment mechanism is regular unitary payments to the PPP company over the term of the contract, typically a period of up to 25 years. The payments may be suspended for non-performance.In the case of PPPs funded by user charges — such as toll roads — the arrangements are different. In these cases, a concession is given to the private sector to levy an agreed charge on the public for the use of the asset for the period of the concession, typically for periods up to 30 years. Such PPPs are self-financing to the extent that they are funded by user charges.We have invested time in developing the PPP procurement model in Ireland because the PPP approach in appropriate projects offers the potential for the timely delivery of a project and value for money. The early pilot projects in the education area, a bundle of five secondary schools and a third level facility, the National Maritime College in Cork, were each procured and built within three and a half years — an impressive delivery time overall. Of course, there were other aspects to the schools project, to which I will return.PPPs have also been successfully rolled out in the roads and local authority areas and have made good progress. However, there are new technical and policy issues raised by this new complex procurement approach. We are doing our best to learn by doing. The disciplined thinking required of both public and private sector in entering into this model has crystallised a number of factors which are of benefit to the procurement process generally, especially the importance of being clear about output specifications up-front and looking at the whole-life costs. The potential of the PPP model as a procurement tool to contribute to addressing Ireland's infrastructural needs was recognised in the multi-annual capital investment framework announced in the 2004 budget. The framework, also known as the multi-annual capital envelopes, was broken down into estimates for capital investment, including PPPs funded by unitary charges from departmental votes, in addition to those funded other than by the Exchequer. The capital provisions will be reviewed in each budget in the light of priorities and the prevailing economic and budgetary situation.There is an emerging issue in regard to the short-term outlook under the envelopes. Based on the latest information available from Departments in respect of PPPs funded by unitary payments, there may be a shortfall in PPP projects at construction stage in 2005 relative to the Estimates announced in 2004. There are a number of reasons for this including the lead time of 18 months to two years involved in bringing PPP projects to construction. A new multi-annual capital envelope for the period 2005-09 will be announced on budget day and new capital envelopes will take account of the PPP shortfall in 2005, overall investment priorities and the wider expenditure and budgetary position. This is all part of the learning process and will be built upon to ensure that PPPs continue to play their part in helping to meet Ireland's infrastructure needs in the years ahead.Senators will he aware that the Comptroller and Auditor General recently published a value for money study of the bundled schools project, which was the first pilot completed on a design, build, operate, finance basis, without user charges. This is a helpful report which will assist the development of PPPs into the future.Among his conclusions the Comptroller and Auditor General indicated that the cost of the final PPP deal on the schools was likely to prove 8% to 13% higher than the projected cost of procuring and running the schools using the conventional approach. I stress that this relates to the Comptroller and Auditor General's assessment of the position up to financial close and not over the whole life of the project. The Minister for Finance has noted the Comptroller and Auditor General's conclusions as regards the value for money outcomes of the project to date. He also notes the observation by the Comptroller and Auditor General that ultimately, the full value for money represented by the group schools project will be determined over the 25-year cycle of the scheme, as well as his recommendation that the bundled schools be compared after five years against a comparable group of schools traditionally procured.The Comptroller and Auditor General acknowledged that the schools pilot protect was a learning exercise and lessons learned in the education, transport and environment sectors, including the bundled schools project, have been incorporated into guidelines issued by the central PPP unit of the Department of Finance, for use by Departments and agencies. This is an ongoing process.Moving to the roads area, the Kilcock-Kinnegad contract has received international awards which cited the level of risk transfer achieved by the public sector. The PPP guidelines are designed to help ensure that the best value for money solution is used in each instance. The Department of Finance issued guidelines on the procedures for the assessment, approval, audit and procurement of PPP projects in July 2003. These set out checks and balances to be applied in PPP procurement to achieve value for money. Two significant aspects, which draw on our experience to date, include the early setting of a clear budget for a project and the appointment of a process auditor in large projects to ensure that all required regulatory and administrative steps have been taken prior to contract signing. More detailed guidance is in the process of development and will be issued in the weeks and months ahead.In general, PPP procurement has the potential to offer better value for money through the allocation of risk to the party that can manage it best; performance based payments; capturing private sector innovation; commercial and management expertise by involving the private sector more centrally in the provision of assets and services; use of long-term contracts whereby bidders and Departments and agencies focus on the whole lifecycle cost of projects and not just on the up-front capital costs, which can lead to more innovative designs with lower life-cycle costs and improved maintenance and operational standards; and fast project delivery.Two key Bills were enacted in 2002 to facilitate the PPP process. The State Authorities (Public Private Partnerships) Act 2002 clarified the powers of State authorities to use PPPs and ensures they have the power to undertake such projects as well as joint ventures. The National Development Finance Agency Act, enacted at the end of 2002, established the National Development Finance Agency to advise Departments and State agencies on the optimal means for financing public investment projects in order to achieve value for money and to advise on all aspects of financing PPPs. The National Development Finance Agency was established on 1 January 2003.Public private partnership activity in Ireland to date has involved three broad categories of project. These are public private partnerships funded by user charges such as roads projects, partnerships funded through a stream of unitary payments from individual Votes, such as educational accommodation projects, and other public private partnerships in the environment and local authority areas. Urban development and social housing projects tend to be funded primarily from local authority resources, including land swaps, and adopt the design, build and finance model. Environmental projects to provide water and waste treatment have used the design, build and operate model and, so far, have not availed of private finance.While time does not permit me explore in great detail all sectors and projects, which are in any case matters for the Ministers concerned, I will mention some examples in which public private partnerships are delivering key infrastructure investments. I am advised that four concession contracts with user charges have been signed to date in the roads area. These are the Kilcock-Kinnegad motorway, the Dundalk bypass, the Fermoy bypass and the second Westlink bridge. Already, a number of additional roads projects are at procurement stage including the N25 Waterford city bypass, the N3 Clonee-Kells scheme, phase 2 of the Limerick southern ring road and the M50 public private partnership upgrade scheme. The two further major projects at planning stage are the N6 Oranmore-Ballinasloe east scheme and, in my own county, the N8 Portlaoise-Cullahill-Castletown project.

The Fatima Mansions refurbishment project in Dublin which the private sector is to design, build and finance, is under way. Operational design, build and operate contracts include the Ringsend and Wexford waste-water treatment facilities. There have been two design, build, operate and finance projects to date in the education sector. These are the bundle of five schools in Ballincollig, Clones, Dunmanway, Shannon and Tubbercurry and the National Maritime College in Haulbowline, County Cork. Furthermore, the Department of Education and Science is in negotiations to reach financial and commercial closure on the Cork School of Music project.The slow establishment of public private partnerships in some departmental areas is due to a number of factors including skills and capacity issues. Public private partnerships are acknowledged to be complex and can entail financial arrangements extending to up to 30 years. Partnerships may require the public sector to deliver a detailed initial output specification and consider the whole-life costs of a project including operation and maintenance. The process places new demands on the public and private sectors. More effort is required up front in scoping, procuring, and negotiating projects. It is important to ensure proper evaluations and scoping of public private partnership projects through proportionate processes.Guidelines require that the National Development Finance Agency is consulted by State authorities at a very early stage of the procurement process in all public private partnership to ensure there is maximum opportunity to avail of its expertise. State authorities must refer all major or grouped projects involving more than €20 million to the National Development Finance Agency for advice. There is also a facility to refer projects of lesser value to the agency.The agency has the function of advising on the optimal method of financing public investment projects to achieve value for money. In certain cases, the use of private finance may not be justified and the agency has the power to fund projects itself where this represents the optimal approach. Ultimately, whether or not to pursue an approach advised by the National Development Finance Agency is a decision for the relevant Department's Accounting Officer.As is the case with all procurement processes, public private partnership projects can experience delays. This can be seen in the case of some projects envisaged for 2005 and announced in the Estimates for 2004. It is important to note that delays can arise from factors unrelated to the public private partnership process itself. Delays may result from the complexity of procurement and the process of identification of suitable projects which place skills and capacity demands on procuring authorities. The Department of Finance is aware of these issues and works in partnership with the relevant Departments, agencies and other stakeholders to minimise the degree to which they impact negatively on progress on public private partnership projects and the public private partnership process in general. While the time required to undertake up-front preparation can be onerous, the benefits are evident in the early delivery of services. The private partner must deliver to secure payment.Public private partnerships have a continuing role to play in addressing our infrastructural needs. The public private partnership process can be employed where it offers potential for the timely delivery of a project on a value-for-money basis involving, inter alia, optimal risk transfer to the private sector over the lifetime of a project. The steps set out in the guidelines issued by the Department of Finance are designed to achieve this objective. The central public private partnership unit continues to identify ways to streamline processes as it develops the necessary guidance on procedures to be followed.Public private partnerships must be considered within the overall context of public investment in infrastructure and public services. Partnerships represent a procurement tool to be used alongside traditional approaches and are certainly not intended to replace other more mainstream options entirely. In appropriate areas and given the appropriate level of skills, public private partnership is a real and viable option. We have learned from our experience to date and draw on it to drive the process in light of the demands public private partnership makes on the public and private sectors if it is to achieve its potential in the Irish context.I thank the Cathaoirleach for providing me with this opportunity to speak to the House about public private partnership. I look forward to hearing the views of Members.

As a member of Fine Gael and as a private individual, I am in broad agreement with the pursuit of public private partnerships to engage private money to complete much-needed public sector infrastructural projects. Fine Gael considers public private partnerships to have the potential to provide value for money to the State and on-time infrastructural projects to the country. While the Minister of State outlined a number of projects in his statement, Fine Gael's lack of confidence is in the transparency of the decision-making process and the potential for cosiness in the evaluation of the merits of public private partnerships on a case-by-case basis.The Minister of State referred specifically to examples of public private partnerships in the education sector. The grouped schools project was a pilot public private partnership involving the construction and operation of five large schools, the contract for which was won by Jarvis. As the Minister of State said, the Comptroller and Auditor General reported on the project. He found that while the Department estimated the partnership would result in a saving to the State of around 6% over the traditional approach, it is likely the final deal with Jarvis will cost between 8% and 13% more than a conventional procurement operation. I found the Minister of State's response to the Comptroller and Auditor General's statement wishy washy to say the least. Given the significant overrun in place of what traditional methods would have delivered, the Minister of State's response is simply not good enough. Public private partnerships were supposed to represent the watchword for value for money in infrastructural delivery. The idea that a project adopting the partnership approach would cost 13% more than traditional methods is not what was sold to the Houses of the Oireachtas when this approach was first discussed.The Minister of State also referred to the construction through a public private partnership of the Cork School of Music, the contract for which was also awarded to Jarvis. It has now been brought to people's attention that Jarvis is experiencing financial difficulties resulting in considerable concern about the delivery of the accommodation for the school. Can the Minister of State refer to the matter in his closing remarks? The public private partnership experience in the education sector is nothing to be very excited about.The Minister of State also referred to ten national roads projects being implemented on a public private partnership basis. These are the Kilcock-Kinnegad motorway, the Dundalk western bypass, the Fermoy bypass, the second Westlink bridge, the N25 Waterford city bypass, the N3 Clonee-Kells scheme, phase 2 of the Limerick southern ring road the M50 upgrade scheme, the N6 Oranmore-Ballinasloe scheme and the Portlaoise-Cullahill-Castletown sections of the N7 and N8.I am concerned at the notion of placing tolls on town bypasses. One can make a case for bypassing a completely new section of motorway which links two urban areas but the placing of a toll on a town bypass could defeat the purpose if people use the existing road structure through the town rather than the new bypass. The example I would use is the developing Waterford bypass where in the city of Waterford there is only one river crossing. While traffic is heavy at critical times during the day, the new bypass involves the construction of a second bridge further down stream. The original idea was that many from my area in south Kilkenny who work in Waterford city and travel to the industrial estates on the Cork side of the city would use the new bypass to access work. If they have to pay €3 or €4 each time to cross the new bridge I can see many using the existing road structure. It is fair enough to take those travelling from Rosslare to Cork out of the city centre and that will be a good thing. The second benefit of the proposed second river crossing will be nullified if a large toll is placed on that bridge.We all agree that the road projects outlined are vitally important and that they need to succeed for the future economic development of the country. There are undoubtedly circumstances where a project under PPP can achieve a more market and custom orientated management of revenue combined with a more efficient design, build and operate project, harbours being a good example. However, we must be careful in the selection of such projects. The National Development Finance Agency Act offers no public policy guidelines to the proposed agency as to how these selections should be made. Projects that might superficially appear to be good candidates for PPPs may not be so. Commercial pricing will not always provide the optimal use of an asset. I mentioned town bypasses as a good example. Unless the bypass is constrained by capacity, pricing of its use will divert users back into the town centre and sacrifice the gains the project was supposed to achieve.Pricing is a matter that is important to public policy. Low off-peak pricing may be attractive from a public policy point of view but not from a commercial operator's point of view. We must be careful as to whether the risk is genuinely being transferred to the private sector or whether the State remains the risk bearer of last resort. This is a crucial issue, which the Minister of State did not address.If the State allows part of the money to fund a prison or a hospital, the private financier may demand control over the asset and its revenue. However, if the project fails, the private operator may well decide that the optimal course of action is to close down the operation. We are all familiar with the current situation in hospitals. It would not be acceptable if the Government were to stand over a position where a hospital or a prison built under such a scheme was allowed close. In the last analysis the Government will be the risk taker of last resort and will have to step in to undertake an expensive buy-out of the private interests.Good public policy means one does not have to shore up the funding of a project with the implied lean on the assets for the private sector with the management of different elements of the project where there may well be private sector efficiencies to be achieved. There is the option of using management contracts for areas where private sector efficiency can be achieved. It is not clear that the new agency is to be given either the remit or the expertise to make these sophisticated project by project choices. Generally, in the public sector the problem has been poor efficiency in design, building and operation. Any or all of these elements can be contracted out. It is important that the Minister of State at the Department of Finance can give a full evaluation of the experience with public private partnerships to date.Another issue of concern is that of charges. The Government, as we pointed out in Private Members' business on Wednesday last, in its two years has implemented 31 or 32 stealth charges, by relying on PPPs, about which I have no ideological hang-up. We must be careful that we do not simply unburden the State and shift the burden on to the service user.Road tolls are becoming more common and while they do the job they can pose a difficulty for those who rely on them, especially those on modest incomes. It is not possible to know if this is borne in mind when the decision to run with the PPP is made because we are in the dark on the criteria used. Our call for greater transparency is not an end in itself; it seeks to ensure that criteria such as this are taken into account.Two years ago in the Dáil, Deputy Richard Bruton, the Fine Gael spokesperson on finance, asked the former Minister for Finance, during a debate on the National Development Finance Agency Bill, a number of questions on this particular area that were not answered. I hope the Minister of State will be able to shed some light on them in his closing remarks today. Does the Minister of State believe that the school projects built by the PPP have offered good value for money and is the Department happy to stand over the figures we have seen from the Comptroller and Auditor General? What premium was deemed worth paying for the risk transfer? What are the value for money tests applied by Departments? Are potential private investors justified in complaining that the value for money hurdles are not made sufficiently clear to them to make it worth their while competing? Will the National Development Finance Agency bypass the value for money tests being applied, not least by the Department of Finance? Is there a strong flow of good projects for public private partnerships and, if not, why not?On the question of whether enough private investment is being attracted to fund schemes designated as PPPs, clearly the answer is "No". For the first time in living memory a Minister for Finance cannot present a full Book of Estimates because he said he needs to find alternative revenue streams to fund infrastructural projects that did not attract sufficient investment. To put it bluntly the Government is losing it in the whole are of public private partnerships. Such is its lack of control. I urge the Minister of State to clear up the outstanding issues in the questions raised two years ago, which were legitimate at the time. They were not answered then but the answers are badly needed now.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	110	I welcome the Minister of State to the House and welcome this debate. In a general sense it could be said the entire economy is a public private partnership. There are very few private sector activities that do not receive State or EU support in some shape or form. Equally there are few State sector activities that do not involve a fair degree of interaction and co-operation with the private sector. I do not have an ideological preconception either that the private sector is inherently more efficient than the public sector or vice versa and, of course, both are equally capable of being highly inefficient.I wish to put on record the commitments made both politically and by the social partners to the whole concept of public private partnerships. For example, the Fianna Fáil manifesto issued before the 2002 election stated that Fianna Fáil would:Encourage PPPs where this can speed up investment, increase competition and keep down prices to the benefit of the public; where it will result in greater efficiency in the delivery of services; and where it can draw on expertise and manpower resources from home and abroad not currently available in sufficient strength.With the help of our PD partners, this translated into An Agreed Programme for Governmentwhich stated: "We believe that new methods of financing major capital requirements are required." Reference was made to the need to maximise efficiency, delivery, value for money and appropriate risk transfer. The Government has also made reference to opening up new opportunities for private companies to invest in public infrastructure through PPP projects.Sustaining Progress 2003-2005 also had a chapter on this subject and made reference to comprehensive framework negotiations between the Government and the social partners in terms of the provision of detailed guidance to the State in this area. In addition, the National Development Finance Agency was given an advisory and potentially financial role. In last year's budget, the Minister announced a five-year envelope and stated that public investment undertaken by the private sector would rise from 3% of total spending in 2004 to 15% by 2008. The actual figures were €150 million, plus another €150 million pertaining to PPPs funded by user charges — this essentially pertains to roads. The total was to rise to over €1 billion. Targets of €150 million for 2004 and €300 million for each year up to 2008 have been set aside for PPP projects to be financed by user charges. The areas identified were the OPW, justice, environment and local government, education, public transport and arts, sport and tourism.There is no doubt about the Government's commitment or the social partnership commitment to the process. The necessary statutory framework has been established, as has a social partnership framework. As we know, there is a relevant unit in the Department of Finance. The framework exists but it is a question of how the process will work in practice.The primary purpose of PPPs is to assist and accelerate infrastructural investment. In the House last week I stated that the IMF regards Ireland's major economic priority in the next few years as improving its infrastructure, not only roads and transport, but also its educational and social infrastructure.There is one consideration that does not apply in this country to the same extent as it does in others where this model has been developed. We may have been watching very closely what happened in the UK, whose borrowing is close to the ceiling established in the Maastricht guidelines. PPPs are not needed to solve the problem of how one invests in infrastructure without breaking the Maastricht guidelines. We are operating so comfortably within those guidelines that this is not the primary consideration, especially not since EUROSTAT changed, within the past year, the rules as to how one accounts for PPP projects. Previously there was an inclination to put all the long term costs into one year's budget, which clearly made the whole process otiose. One must always consider, particularly in a country like ours which has a credit rating near the top of the scale, that the public sector can almost always borrow more cheaply than the private sector. In a sense, there must be compensating virtues.Having spoken to colleagues in Government, I have sensed that there is a certain frustration over the fact that developments are not proceeding faster. This was reflected in the Minister of State's speech. Reading between the lines, one noted that the target for PPP take-up would not be met in this financial year. On the other hand, if we go headlong in all directions without considering matters critically, we will risk having, or will have, many more reports by the Comptroller and Auditor General criticising the costs we incur. I support the notion that we need to proceed carefully if the process is to retain credibility.Let me touch on two or three of the areas that have been chosen for PPPs. One such area is transport, as referred to by Senator John Phelan. I thought immediately of the Drogheda town bypass, but this is way outside Drogheda, and I therefore suspect the Senator was not referring to it. Being pragmatic, I feel that the benefits of tolls on long stretches of road far outweigh the costs, and therefore I do not have a difficulty with them.I have many more reservations about phenomena such as the Westlink toll bridge. It is in a city area and we only have to listen to AA Roadwatch every morning to know that there are queues on the approach road. If, with a magic wand, one were to remove this toll bridge or have an electronic tolling process, congestion might simply occur at some other point and the net effect might not be very different. Given the volume of traffic at the Westlink toll bridge, I hope the State is getting a reasonable take therefrom. It must be a great cash cow. I hope the moneys collected are not going entirely into private pockets.The M7 and M8 were mentioned, as was the proposed bypass between Portlaoise and Cullahill. There is a problem regarding the connection of the M7 and M8. I am a little concerned that the National Roads Authority is lopping off bits and pieces of projects in order to get its budget to stretch further. It has done so in Cashel, to which there are no links coming from the south. I was made aware of this and went as part of a deputation to the Minister for Transport. The northern links converge at a central intersection. The southern links were in the original plans and were removed. I gather this is also happening at the point where the M7 and M8 join. The point could be made that nothing can be done about this now and that one would hold everything up but we will incur greater costs than those originally envisaged if one were to re-include the links in the plans. However, given that we are not under considerable financial constraints, the National Roads Authority should be discouraged from cutting corners on projects such as those I have mentioned.Schools have been mentioned. A report was issued in the past year on the PFI in Britain in a supplement to Private Eye. Unfortunately the report was not dated but it has some relevance to school projects here. An audit commission report on 17 PFI projects for local authority schools was issued in the past year or so. The same firm, Jarvis, was involved in five projects here. The commission found that in every single project there was no improvement on the traditional method of procurement. In some cases the traditional method would have been preferable. The schools were not cheaper, the contracts were not completed any quicker and there was no transfer of risk.I am not attacking PPPs, but I am underlining why there should be a certain degree of caution. We are in a learning process, therefore, we will not always do everything right in the beginning. One can learn from experience. There is no doubt that, like ten years ago, financiers were hoping there would be a massive programme of privatisation. Companies thought loose money was available from the Exchequer on easy risk-free terms for an assurance that projects would be delivered. Later, when someone else was in office it would be discovered, on counting the cost and on the question of accountability and so on that a bad deal had been made.I am not trying to attack the PPP process, but I am underlining why it is necessary, while trying to push ahead, to have a degree of caution in order to ensure the State gets value for money. Given the significant increase in wealth and Exchequer resources in the late 1990s, there was perhaps a temptation across all sections of political opinion that, regardless of whether the method used was straightforward public procurement or PPP, we could throw money at the problem because there was plenty more from where it came. The new Minister wants to emphasise that, even though we are anxious to get things done, we must get value for money in order to justify to taxpayers how the money is spent. I have no doubt that involving the private sector can result in more efficiency, quicker delivery and so on, but it cannot be taken as axiomatic. One must examine the details and proposals in each case. There must also be competitive tendering to produce the best results.There needs to be a balanced approach to this issue. We must accept that it is a positive innovative addition to the means of providing infrastructure compared with what we had in the past. We must also realise that there are dangers and pitfalls which must be avoided. I support the Government's commitment to PPP while also supporting the degree of caution being applied by the Department of Finance as guardians of the taxpayers.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	111	I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I am pleased time was made available to debate the issue. I asked for the debate because I wanted to kill a few myths about public private partnership. Public private partnerships as established in the UK and Northern Ireland bear no relation to public private partnerships in the Republic of Ireland. They are different arrangements. There is very little to be learned by examining the mistakes made in England. The debate on public private partnerships has been dogged by the fact that one company, Jarvis, has been involved in both jurisdictions. It ran into difficulties in the UK and people point to the difficulties here. The two issues should be kept separate, and any discussion should be informed by this fact.The Department of Finance has been less than enthusiastic about public private partnerships. It said one thing and did very little. It has been very slow, as is always the case, to be flexible in regard to funding arrangements. The Minister of State referred earlier to the importance of new methods of financing while Senator Mansergh referred to an arrangement under the last national agreement, which supported public private partnerships. The trade union movement looked very long and hard at this and, after a long period of discussion involving the trade unions, IBEC, the Department of Finance and a few other Departments, we finally came to an agreed position on public private partnerships. These are the role models of best practice for Europe. If the UK considered what we are doing it could learn much. There are also things we can learn from our own experience.The importance of securitisation was included in the national agreement. This is another way of raising money, which is allowed for under local authority legislation. It is a matter on which I would like to have a long discussion in the future. A crucial point, raised earlier, is that until a couple of years ago, the eurocrats took the view that public private partnerships did not transfer risk, which was completely wrong. When I tried to ascertain where they got their information, they told me it was from the Central Statistics Office. I telephoned the CSO and asked where it got the information to tell Brussels that public private partnerships did not transfer risk and, therefore, were part of Government borrowing. It said it came from the Department of Finance. This is the reality of the problem. The previous Minister, Deputy McCreevy, worked hard at the time to fight against the interpretation. This is now changed and public private partnerships are not seen as part of Government borrowing.In his speech the Minister of State pointed out that these projects are usually design, build, finance and operate but sometimes they are simply design, build and operate. We must have learned that people who are good at building are rarely good at raising finance. In most, but not all cases, the financing of these projects should be separated. Finance should be the first part of the project and design, build and operate should be the second part. We should seek to carry out both projects outside of Government borrowing.The Minister of State referred to the State providing finance. That is not the only option. Let us suppose a public authority wants to get involved in a project under a public private partnership. Having costed the project, it can raise funds in a number of ways, including securitisation, loans and the cheapest money it can find. It can then put out to tender the cost of building, financing and operating the project. That will make it possible to take on good contractors to do the job while getting the best value for money and the best kind of building specification. This aspect has not been explored and those involved in projects invariably raise it. In the modern world, in particular, the various methods of financing are so complex and obscure to ordinary people, including those involved in contracting jobs, that it is better to separate the two issues.Returning to the area of education, not all public private partnership projects need to be huge. They are not all roads or bridges or colleges of music. Single primary schools could be considered for public private partnership. The reason it cannot be done at the moment is the extraordinary costs of tendering, bidding and bonding that apply to public private partnerships.The Government is facing a major problem regarding the building programme for primary and post-primary schools in terms of the cost of the building programme and the availability of money. In every town in this country there are successful building contractors who, no matter how steeped they are in the private sector and in making profit, would like to have their name on the building of the local school and would be delighted to build it. They would do it just to achieve the associated feel-good factor. I have asked small builders about this and they have told me they would love to do it. However, they can never do it because of the early costs.Many of the jobs that have been sent out to public tender end up being done by small local contractors who are paid by the big tenderer to do the small jobs. We could get around this. Senator Scanlon is the next speaker in this debate. He and I have discussed this issue on many occasions. We could have a situation where designs would be available as part of the specification for a school project. Then all that would be necessary would be to obtain financing and get somebody to build and operate it, meaning to maintain it for a specified number of years. I would appreciate if the Minister would set somebody to work on that in his Department. I could do it. It is not rocket science. However, there must be a political drive behind it. The Department would state what design it wanted for a school, provide a specification and make it easy for people to get bonding and arrange for financing. If that were done, smaller operators could become involved in public private partnerships, there would be greater competition, more local involvement, more local commitment and a hugely successful outcome. It would also help the Government cashflow.Let me turn now to the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General. The Comptroller and Auditor General missed the point completely. It bothers me that this was not taken up by the Government. The Comptroller and Auditor General does a great job for all of us but, no less than a bishop, he should sometimes have to answer questions. The Minister rightly stated that the Comptroller and Auditor General examined the costs only to the point of delivery. I would like to send him down to some of the schools that were built, where the principal and the board of management do not have to worry about the maintenance of the school, where they do not have to worry about the cleaning of the school or the heating of it, where all that is done as part of the contract, where the school has a higher level of maintenance specification than any other school in the surrounding area and one finds a happy school community of management, parents, pupils and teachers and no maintenance costs for the State over a period of 20, 25 or 30 years.I cannot believe the Comptroller and Auditor General did not factor that into his calculations. Consequently, having spent two years trying to sell the concept of the positive potential of public private partnerships, he has given out a negative message regarding them so that we are now on the back foot trying to defend the concept and must start all over again to persuade people that this is something worth doing. I am not saying every project is a good one. What I am saying is that this can save money and deliver a better project with local involvement if we set our minds to doing it correctly. It is value for money and that is how we should look at it.In this context the Minister could consider smaller projects, for example a local two, three or four teacher primary school, which would not interest the Jarvises of this world. Public private partnerships are currently exclusive of small contractors because of the cost of the bond and of the tendering process. We could eliminate these costs without breaking any European rules. It would be a simple matter to provide designs with specifications. We could then also provide a much cheaper bonding system.There is another point which the Minister of State may have made in his speech — I was not here for it because I had an engagement I could not get out of. I scanned through his script and will read it in more detail later. There would be no risk to Government. If the State owned the land on which the school is built, and the building is there and the Government has not put any money into it, the worst that could happen is that the contractors will walk away and the State will have a school for nothing. We need to drive home the possibilities and what could be done.Bureaucracy is the cause of the problems. The biggest negativity arising from public private partnerships relates to the School of Music in Cork. It attracted bad publicity because in the middle of the process, EUROSTAT stated that the finance involved was part of Government borrowing and would therefore have to be included within the Maastricht guidelines and all the other requirements regarding monetary funds and so on. Consequently the Government had to pull back. Then Jarvis UK ran into trouble and everybody presumed we would have the same trouble here.We need a debate to point out these problems and they need to be taken on publicly. This is the only country in western Europe where the trade union movement is fully supportive of public private partnerships because there are enough inbuilt safeguards. Moreover, the trade union movement is progressive in its approach and can see the value of public private partnerships because money can be released by Government to do other things and we get the value locally, specifications are up to standard and the State can be a net winner.Am I missing something somewhere along the way? Is there something about this we do not know? I assure the Minister that, wearing another hat at another time, I fought very hard to get support for this in the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. I know every argument against the concept. They were all dealt with and we came up with a system that was attractive to all the partners, a Chinese bargain, attractive to business, to the trade union movement, to Government and to the people. The only experience we have had of this is in Sligo. I would defy any of the critics of PPPs to visit the schools in Sligo, about which I am sure Senator Scanlon will shortly make us aware, and try to find any unhappy campers. There are none. They are very happy. They must be the people to which the economists spoke. They are very happy about the delivery of the project there. If we are talking about moving this forward, we can certainly get things done.Let me turn from education to the issue of tolls. Senator Mansergh stated that he hoped not too much of the money was going to the private sector. Unfortunately, huge amounts of money are going to the private sector. The toll bridges in Dublin are the result of very successful public private partnerships under the older system but despite the fact that they are making wheelbarrow loads of money and are earning far more than they ever expected, they are now talking about putting up the price. The Dublin toll bridges, which were built years ago, are a good example of everything that is wrong about public private partnership — the taxpayer builds 20 km of road, National Toll Roads builds 100 m, and it gets not quite all the money but everything that is collected. That is madness. Surely no PD in the world would go along with that. It is giving money away. It should never have been allowed to happen.

#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	113	I understand it is a bridge. I am not taking from the fact that it was a complicated work of engineering to build both bridges, particularly the Westlink. There can be no argument on the business side that the toll should be increased. It is completely wrong. Driving to any city in Europe on a tolled motorway, whether it be Paris, Lyon or any other city, as soon as one reaches the environs of the city, the motorway is toll-free. We did the opposite in Ireland. In order to complicate traffic matters further, the only place in which tolls were originally established was in the centre of Dublin city. Who thought up such a scheme?This is the type of situation that is giving a bad name to the idea of public private partnerships. Such schemes merely represent cash cows for private sector operators who are not buying into the system. This is far removed from the issues about which Senator Scanlon and I have expressed concern on a number of occasions. We want to see local schools built in local areas, and indeed a school of music at third level. These objectives can be achieved in a proper way. The Minister of State should come back to us at a later stage on the question of a more flexible approach to the design of schemes, a separating out of financing, a clearer view on securitisation and a method for selling the positive aspects of public private partnerships to a wider public.
#EamonScanlon	unknown-#EamonScanlon-party	unknown-#EamonScanlon-dob	unknown-#EamonScanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	114	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, and am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on the issue of public private partnerships. I have experience of such schemes with regard to a school in my constituency. This project, which had its critics initially, was part of a European-wide competition for a company to build five schools. The successful company was Jarvis and it built one school in County Sligo, two in County Cork, one in County Monaghan and another in Shannon. I serve on the board of the school in County Sligo. The Department of Education and Science purchased a site and the school was then constructed by Jarvis.This school is a fine complex, consisting of 35 classrooms as well as auxiliary offices, teacher accommodation, all-weather pitches and so on. The building work was completed in 15 months and within budget, a phenomenal achievement in any business. With departmental funding, the school has been fitted out to the highest standard by Jarvis. It is a wonderful facility, involving the amalgamation of two very old schools, Banada Abbey and the Marist Convent in Tubbercurry. As a member of the school board, I occasionally meet some of the 540 students and they are delighted with the facilities and the quality of education they are receiving.The contract for this project states that Jarvis is fully responsible for the maintenance of the school for 25 years. At the end of that period, the school will be handed back to the Department of Education and Science. As Senator O'Toole observed, there is no risk to the State in such schemes. The principal of the school has told me that major problems are dealt with within 24 hours, while less significant problems, such as heating or some other issue which affects the holding of classes in a particular room, are handled within two hours. The back-up service is fantastic. If a classroom is not available for teaching, a reduction is made in the payment to the company at the end of the month. The principal previously served in the same post in a school with a large student body in County Mayo, where he claims two thirds of his time was spent trying to locate people to service or repair various facilities. Now, his time is dedicated entirely to the educational needs of the students and teachers for whom he is responsible.I cannot say enough in favour of public private partnerships in the context of my experience with this school. Furthermore, the school complex is available to the local community in the evenings and at weekends. Some local functions, such as musical shows, have been held in the school and, by 9 a.m. the next morning, it is ready for occupation by the teachers and students. This is a fantastic achievement. Although the Comptroller and Auditor General has not been complimentary regarding public partnerships, my experience indicates that perhaps he did not give such schemes enough time before evaluating them. I believe he did not consider issues such as maintenance, of which there is little required when a school is new. After five or ten years, however, a school of 540 pupils will require significant maintenance. A scheme such as this represents value for money in the long term.I agree with Senator O'Toole that roads represent a separate issue. Unlike a school, the value of which will probably depreciate, the value of a road or toll bridge will appreciate. One must factor in the finance from such facilities, particularly when one is considering a period of ten or 15 years. We all received letters from the Irish Road Haulage Association which indicated the significant amount of money to be paid to operators which provided the Eastlink Bridge and other similar facilities. It is a staggering figure and, although there are significant costs involved in providing that bridge, this is an issue, which may need to be examined. I have no doubt the Government will learn from its experience with Jarvis in the provision of those five schools. Everybody has lessons to learn, particularly in politics.I agree with Senator O'Toole when he spoke about the significant number of projects under way, such as small national schools in certain areas. Since our experience in Sligo, a number of builders have approached me to inquire about the possibility of a similar approach being taken regarding smaller schools. We need to consider such possibilities and move in this direction because it represents value for money in the long term. The work is usually done very quickly and there is no cost to the State in terms of maintenance. My experience of a public private partnership was a successful one and it has been of significant benefit to Sligo.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	115	There was some jousting during the Order of Business about ideologies and "isms" of various kinds. I have no objection to public private partnerships. Any concerns I have are based on a feeling that perhaps the driving force behind such schemes is ideological. Where they work properly, however, nobody could object to them. Who could object to the introduction of additional finance into public capital expenditure, finance which might not otherwise be available? There can be no objection to the use of public private partnerships for providing up-front funding for projects which might otherwise be delayed for ten years. However, concerns could be raised if one were to adopt the proper hard-headed approach of a competent accountant or economist. In Ballincollig and Dunmanway in Cork, I have seen the quality of the schools about which Senator Scanlon spoke. They exist, are superb and look wonderful. I am pleased for the people of those areas whose children have a place in such fine schools, which provide such fine service.However, two legitimate questions must be raised and were raised by the Comptroller and Auditor General, perhaps in badly chosen language. One question is whether the money being spent by the State is proportionate or excessive to the quality of what is being delivered. It is difficult to compare the full cost of the Cork School of Music, which the Comptroller and Auditor General in one report put at approximately €300 million, with the ongoing costs required over a period. He raised the question of how a project originally estimated to cost €45 million would end up costing €300 million. I am reluctant to be critical of him because he fulfils an extraordinarily important role. Nevertheless, that was a less than intellectually satisfying response by him to the complexities of trying to compare how that project would be funded now with how it would be funded over 25 years, covering routine maintenance, refurbishment, etc.I am reasonably knowledgeable about project economics, which was part of my original profession as an engineer. Everyone who knows anything about project economics or project costing knows that once one gets into the time value of money, there is an element of subjective judgment. Questions about internal rates of return and about the discount rate used are all a matter of judgment. Different companies in the chemical industry, with which I am familiar, use different indices for those measures and, therefore, come up with different answers. That is why some companies, for example in the chemical industry, expect a pay-back time of two years on an investment, some expect three years and some will tolerate four years, but that will also depend on the project. If we go the route of having useful public private partnerships, we must begin to put together dispassionate cost analysis and cost evaluations of such projects. We should always welcome new ways of doing things, new ideas and thinking.My party's position on roads is to oppose tolls, with which I do not agree. I want to make that clear. My only problem with tolling roads — Senator O'Toole also referred to this — is that some of the tolling is in the wrong place. In other words, it the last place one would want it. For example, tolling a bypass around the town of Fermoy seems not to be the way to proceed, although tolling could be done on a road which incorporated that bypass without landing the people of Fermoy with the possible short-term, if not long-term, consequences of traffic diversion because of a toll.I do not have great sympathy for the Irish Road Haulage Association. If its members are still insisting on going through Drogheda instead of paying the tolls on the motorway, it would be no harm if the Department of Transport and the Garda began to carry out fairly detailed checks on every road haulage vehicle that goes through Drogheda to see whether it meets all the requirements of the various regulations. It is time the drivers of those vehicles went where they are supposed to go. I do not have much sympathy with individual hauliers.I have two problems with the tolling of the Westlink bridge. First, it has caused the most incredible traffic jams because it was badly designed, planned and laid out. Second, the toll company does not have the courtesy to tell a culchie like myself the toll I must pay until I get to the plaza.
#MaryMWhite	unknown-#MaryMWhite-party	unknown-#MaryMWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryMWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	116	That is correct.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	117	I have raised this point previously in the House. One comes off a roundabout on the M50 and sees a sign, "toll ahead", but there is no sign indicating the toll one is required to pay or which lane one should be in. By the time one knows which lane one should be in, one is irretrievably committed to the lane one is in. An extraordinary profitable company should be able to put together proper indications. I have no interest in getting involved in an ideological debate about public private partnerships, which can work very well.In order for public money to be used efficiently, we must have dispassionate analysis. I am disappointed with the Comptroller and Auditor General because some of his analysis was not dispassionate. I thought it was quite trivial. One cannot compare €300 million spent over 25 years with €45 million spent today and pretend there is no difference. I need only reflect on how much my house cost me in terms of paying a mortgage over 20 years. I bought the house for €35,000. I do not even want to think about how much it cost me.
#EamonScanlon	unknown-#EamonScanlon-party	unknown-#EamonScanlon-dob	unknown-#EamonScanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	118	More than €100,000.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	119	That and much more I would say. That does not prove I was inefficient. It was simply the way it was done.I will return to the subject. The answer to the question of whether we are getting extra funding is "Yes". Are we getting a sharing of risk? In some cases the answer is undoubtedly "Yes" and in the case of schools the answer is "Yes". Are we getting good value for money? In terms of educational infrastructure, the jury is out. We do not know enough. I have no doubt that the quality of what people have to work with is excellent, but it is questionable whether that quality could be delivered by other mechanisms, including that of giving poor unfortunate school principals a reasonable budget for maintenance and reasonable secretarial support so that they would not have to spend most of their expensive time chasing after routine minor matters. It is also questionable whether the procedures the Department of Education and Science uses for evaluating major capital projects, the five stages, could be improved. In the case of a number of building projects in my place of employment in the Cork Institute of Technology, I took the liberty of making a freedom of information request to consider them. Whatever the Department of Education and Science achieves in terms of avoiding extravagant expenditure or perhaps in eliminating fraud is swallowed up in costing increases arising from delays. If one takes five years to complete a project that could have been completed in a year, at 5% or 6% construction inflation, such delay will add, in crude terms, 30% to the price. If one ends up saving 5% of the ultimate price by putting up the overall price by 25% instead of 30%, that is not a contribution to efficiency, although it might be a contribution to probity and rectitude and to keeping people honest.This raises questions about, for example, bond issues where the State agrees to pay back a bond. That is called borrowing. I am not overly impressed with the efficiency of the Irish private sector and I never have been. The cost overruns in the early days of the NRA were not all its fault. They were to do with the capacity of those in the construction industry to fairly well trowel on the expenses when they were perhaps not being watched as carefully as they should have been. There was not much sign of competitive efficiency there.It would be improper of me to talk about public private partnerships in general terms and not mention the Cork School of Music. It is not the greatest advertisement for the principle underlying such partnerships. I accept fully that once a public private partnership contract is signed and delivered, there is remarkable efficiency in the construction of a project. That happened in my place of work in the National Maritime College. As in the case of the Cork School of Music, if it takes four or five years to get to the stage of signing the contract and one ends up with a very efficiently and rapidly constructed school of music, which is being delivered six years late because it took five years to start the building project, there is a legitimate argument that we would have been better off to proceed the old way if work could have been started five years ago. Such delay has incurred a major cost which does not show up in the assessments of the Comptroller and Auditor General.Our public sector is not good at project management. Good project management means that one is properly prepared before one starts. Clearly, we are not good at that, given the nearly €500 million worth of hospitals around the country that were built without any proper planning as to how they would be staffed and run once they were completed. That is the antithesis of what one would hope would come out of a public private partnership, which means that whoever provides the facility must deliver everything, including all the ancillary and support services apart from the teachers who will work in the school.We are not yet beginning to do a proper evaluation of public private partnerships. I do not have a brief one way or the other, except that I believe it is a good thing if we can get extra funding to do things now which would otherwise be postponed for four or five years. If we get that extra funding we must accept that those who provide it are entitled to a reasonable return on their investment. We must also be sure that the return on their investment is reasonable. Furthermore, the fact that they provide a good service which turns out to cost three times as much as the old way — I do not say it does but if it does — we should be told that in terms that make sense to all of us.If a wonderful toll road, such as the one in the Minister of State's constituency from Portlaoise to beyond Cullahill, which it is hoped will start in the next year or so, produces a mile long queue of people waiting to pay their tolls at any busy time during the day, it is a failure. On the Sunday of last year's All-Ireland Football Final, gardaí had to instruct the toll operators on the M1 to raise the barriers because there was a four or five mile tailback north of the toll plaza. If a company cannot operate tolling on roads in a way which does not seriously impinge on the free movement of traffic, good transport infrastructure will not be achieved. That is what has happened on the Westlink on the M50. It is time this problem was dealt with.I am at a loss to know how the Cork School of Music has got into its present situation. My colleagues in the school have worked hard. Everything that was ever asked of them was delivered properly, on time and in the manner required. We ran into an extraordinary confusion in which the Department of Education and Science was left holding a baby which was the property of the Department of Finance because that Department had run into some statistical issue which had nothing to do with the Cork School of Music. It had to do with borrowing for much bigger projects, which would have added significantly to the level of national debt and would have been perceived as such in terms of the Stability and Growth Pact. I accept there was a problem. However, the Department of Finance never came out in public to say the problem was of its making, while the poor Department of Education and Science got stuck with attempting to explain why something which was not of its making had to be dealt with by it. I never saw the Department of Finance explaining in public what was the problem.That is a very good example of how a basically good idea can be undermined. Public private partnership is a good idea provided we have effective cost criteria, effective performance evaluation criteria and effective sharing or transfer of risk from the State to the private sector. We are only beginning to learn. I invite the Minister of State and the Department to work at developing criteria which are objective and independent and which evaluate how well these things work.

The extra toll booths and laneways have improved the flow of traffic but a problem persists at the Lucan exit south of the toll bridge. The congestion on this exit road blocks one of the extra routes. The flow of traffic has been improved by the addition of extra toll booths but the congestion on the exit for Lucan and Blanchardstown is extraordinary. This is a major traffic problem.Deputy Parlon's first public appearance as Minister of State was in the Alexander Hotel when he spoke about the communication strategy for public private partnerships. I congratulate the Minister of State on the progress he has made since his appointment. At that meeting I heard firsthand for the first time what is involved in public private partnerships. The series of meetings held throughout the country were a great help in explaining public private partnerships to people. The meeting in the Alexander Hotel was attended by union members, representatives of IBEC and of the construction industry and members of local authorities and health boards. All of these groups could be involved in building major Government projects.On 11 October last, a €52 million state-of-the-art national maritime college opened its doors to students in Ringaskiddy, County Cork. The project is the first third level college to be built under the Government's public private partnership scheme. It will serve the maritime education needs of the Cork Institute of Technology and the non-military needs of the Naval Service.The National Maritime College in Ringaskiddy is a shining example of the success of the public private partnership model and is a dream come true for tutors from the Cork Institute of Technology and from the Naval Service at nearby Haulbowline and for anyone who is interested in a naval career. Focus Education Limited is made up of 50% Bovis Lend Lease and 50% Halifax Bank of Scotland.The features of the National Maritime College are remarkable and unique. It includes two bridge simulators with 360° screens which can replicate every type of sea and weather condition, including engine shut down and man overboard, on 32 different vessel types, including merchant, liner, ferry, naval and fishing.

There is also a survival training facility with a 5 m deep pool, diving tank, hoist, life raft and a helicopter underwater evacuation trainer. Total darkness, high waves and hurricane-like winds can be generated within the pool giving total reality to emergency and rescue operations. There is an outside jetty and pontoon, including a freefall lifeboat and other maritime equipment.In addition to eventually providing training for 750 full-time students, the new college will be a major attraction for international trainees, thereby reinforcing Ireland's position as a centre of excellence in maritime training.The project was managed by, Focus Education Limited. The contract was advertised in the EU Journal in April 2001. It was signed in February 2003 and work commenced that spring. Particularly impressive was the fact that within 18 months a €51 million state-of-the-art facility was ready. Focus Education Ireland will maintain the lease for 25 years.This morning I spoke to Mr. Pat Mitchell who is the facilities manager for the Bovis Lend Lease. He told me about a fascinating aspect of the college, which is the way of the future for such buildings. The college is available for maritime personnel from 8 a.m. to 5.30 p.m., while the library is available to students until 10 p.m. After 5.30 p.m., however, the college is available to third parties, the income from which will be divided between the college and Focus Education Ireland, which is Bovis Lend Lease and the Halifax Bank. This is a case of using structures and facilities when they are not fully needed, including computers. Currently, the gymnasium is being hired out to local sports groups that can avail of its state of the art facilities.Teachers employed by the college can provide training in the evenings to people who wish to attend, for example, a yacht master's course. Such courses would be in addition to the full master's degree. I am glad to be able to relate this positive story to the House. There is no question but that the development of this college will increase thenumbers of young Irish people who wish to develop naval careers.I wish the Minister of State continued good luck. I was always a supporter of his. I saw him operating with the board of Bord Bia and he was well able to get the board's agreement to deal with his number one issue.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	124	I concur with Senator White that it is good to highlight a success story such as that whereby a public private partnership was sorted out within 18 months. Fine Gael believes the public private partnership system is the way forward. The Senator referred to a figure of €51 million but the former Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, beat that record by spending €50 million in less than 18 months. That is a story for another day, however.In the past six or seven years, a combination of buzz words has been used in the debate on public private partnerships. Before that, the letters PPP would have been understood to stand for parish pump politics. Public private partnerships have provided the way forward in recent years and have proved that this manageable system can work within a shorter time period than heretofore. If we were to separate public expenditure from public private partnership expenditure and ask taxpayers if they were getting value for money from the expenditure of their taxes, the answer would be a resounding "No". The public does not have confidence in the way the Government spends its money. Value for money is not obtained from public expenditure.Taking private investment in isolation, people have confidence in the private sector, including builders and designers, and generally believe the sector does a good job. Where there is a strong demand for housing, there can be murmurings of discontent over problems with snag lists but, in general, people are happy with the private sector. It is, therefore, an ambitious project to amalgamate the public and private sectors in PPP projects. Fine Gael believes PPPs are the way forward and the unions do not have a problem with them. Senator O'Toole mentioned that this was in deference to the rest of Europe.Since the initiation of the public private partnerships there has been a creation of wealth within a significant breadth of sectors, including accountancy and legal firms, all of which have done well. Through creating wealth, PPPs have sustained businesses in various industrial sectors. The ultimate ethos behind public private partnerships is that of the common good. It is not to help companies or private individuals through a fundamentally profit-driven partnership, rather it is community focused for the common good. It is about efficiency, competence and timing.There have been problems with the design and build operations for the Westlink and Eastlink projects. Members of the public are having difficulty with certain aspects of these public private partnerships, including user charges. A thorough evaluation and examination is required for all such projects but that is not being undertaken currently.An interest rate of 2% provides a great incentive for private companies to become involved in the public sector. It is cheap money but that should not be the focus for such companies. The common good and value for money are the aspects that matter.Transparency issues have arisen as regards obtaining information, feedback, reviews and evaluation. In principle, the National Development Finance Agency is a good idea but the capacity is not there to evaluate PPP projects that have been delivered to date. Perhaps a rethink is required on having one umbrella group as a conduit for feeding information back to the public. Perhaps also there should be a singular focus whereby each Department is responsible, rather than having an umbrella group.The Minister of State referred to success stories behind public private partnerships for schools. That is a great idea but there are also problems. Issues have arisen concerning private involvement in some of these schools, including the operation of soft drinks machines. These issues need to be teased out so the Minister of State should reflect on the common good. The common good principle applies to serious issues, such as obesity among schoolchildren, which have often been highlighted in the House.For the past two or three years, design, build and operate, or DBO, plans have been the buzz words flying around the desks of local authority service directors. DBO projects can be leased back to local councils and, in principle, they are a good idea but it is theoretical at present. Simple solutions are being proposed for simple problems in many rural areas, including waste water treatment or pumping water supplies for rural communities. Private companies can play a part in providing such solutions.A few very successful affordable housing schemes have been built by private developers in County Donegal but the preparations should be made in the beginning. It should not be about developers building houses and the local authority purchasing them. There would be more transparency if the homework was done in the beginning, as it should be. That principle should underpin any public private partnership.Senators O'Toole and Scanlan referred to school building projects. That area needs to be addressed. The review should consider the tendering, bidding, bonding, design and specification, and financing. We have serious problems with the building of new schools and extensions to schools. Senator Fitzgerald, who is his party's spokesperson on education, knows of the problems to which I refer.The building work at St. Eunan's College is deemed necessary, as opposed to urgent, and has been stuck at stage 1 since 1999. This is a problem for Letterkenny, which has been designated as a town that should receive priority status in facilitating children in primary and post-primary school. The post-primary school is not receiving priority status. The morale among the teaching staff, board of management and parents is low and their frustration is palpable. Stating that a project is necessary rather than urgent is the language of procrastination to keep a project at a stage nowhere near completion.Ballyraine national school in Letterkenny is being asked to redesign a comprehensive brief for a school extension, which was originally accepted by the Department of Education and Science in 2000. This again shows procrastination. It is a case where a PPP programme could be operated. The proposal for the extension to Ballyraine national school was first submitted in 1984, when I was in my first year in secondary school. While I am not saying I am that old, I am getting there. One can understand the frustration if an extension first proposed in 1984 has yet to start, when simple solutions could be implemented.In June 1999, Mr. Cheevers asked the Ballyraine national school to submit requirements to the Department of Education and Science and to refer to the Celtic tiger. Prefabs were offered, but were declined as money could be invested in a proper building. In 2000 the inspector visited and made a list of requests and recommendations etc. The application and inspector's report is with the planners. Jonathan Bliss, the Department of Education and Science architect, visited, making an urgent case. Now, in 2004, the school is being asked to review and offer a comprehensive reappraisal of its application. It is not good enough for schools to experience such frustration and bottlenecks.It is time for the Department of Education and Science to seriously consider public private partnerships for the schools building programme at primary and post-primary level. Public private partnerships have worked in other areas and for the general welfare of future generations of students this process should be expedited. We need to build an economy around trust and the public is part of the trust process. No member of the community in Donegal believes taxpayers are getting value for the money they pay. We have no train service and it takes us six hours on a Friday evening to get from Dublin to Letterkenny. Considering it is only possible to drive at an average speed of 40 mph, including on the A5 through the North, which is only a donkey track, Donegal taxpayers are not getting value for money.

The €50 million, which the former Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, spent in such a short time, would have been better spent if it had been given to the Northern Ireland authorities to invest on the A5 route between Aughnacloy and Strabane. People do not have confidence in the return from the tax they pay. We believe public private partnerships may represent a way forward and should be explored further.
#LiamFitzgerald	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-party	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	127	I welcome the Minister of State and also welcome the positive note on which Senator McHugh ended his contribution. I too believe public private partnerships represent the way forward as they adhere to one of the fundamental principles, value for money. As we develop, refine, re-evaluate and constantly monitor the efficiency and effectiveness of PPPs, we will come to acknowledge that fact. I warmly welcome the application of PPPs in the past 20 years. In some shape or form PPPs have been used as a method of bringing forward the delivery of public services, which lies at the heart of the matter. The skills of the private sector can be harnessed to bring faster delivery of facilities and services and provide value for money for the taxpayer. We are all agreed on that matter. In that context I welcome the positive expressions of support for PPPs across the House. Using a PPP spreads the risk involved in undertaking a project.The general aim of any Government is to improve the delivery of public services every year. Maintaining the status quo is not an option. We need to continually find ways and means to improve the delivery, including fast tracking it and making it of better quality and greater durability, etc. Surrounding all these aspects is quality and value for money. Reviewing different ways and means of doing things can be challenging, particularly if they are new, as are PPPs. There are problems and these will continue into the future.We must cast aside naiveté regarding this issue. We are dealing with a new methodology which, by and large, is being operated on a pilot basis, just as there are pilot projects to try to take on the huge challenge of special needs education and in various other areas of community development and child support. In recent years some PPPs have been viewed as ongoing pilot projects. While this has some negatives, it also has significant positives. It is up to the expertise of Government and the public service in partnership with the private partners to evaluate and bring them to greater efficiency and effectiveness.PPPs contrast with the conventional way of doing things, which was for the public sector to manage projects and deliver the building, facilities, etc. The new approach has been used to varying degrees over the past 20 years, including the buildings provided for Government decentralisation in the late 1980s, and the Eastlink and Westlink toll bridges. We have problems with these and, as they are being addressed, will continue to have some problems to a lesser extent in the future. This does not take away from the principle of the overall merit of the approach.The quality and extent of communication within this approach is important. The Government has communicated with the social partners on the PPP system and it was heartening to hear Senator O'Toole say that the unions have no difficulty with it. It is important that there is communication with the social partners to help each constituent of the partnership to deal with difficulties as they arise with this new concept and the challenges it presents. The social partners will then be prepared to take on the challenge because of the benefits that accrue in the delivery of public services. PPPs, if properly managed, will deliver improved public services more quickly, as has been done in the five schools, and at a lower long-term cost than the conventional approach.Every PPP is compared on a cost benefit basis with the conventional method in accordance with strict rules of evaluation. Many people spoke about the quality and extent of evaluation and the need for it to be constantly re-appraised because this is an evolving situation. Where a PPP does not deliver these benefits, it will not be used.The Government has decided that hundreds of beds will be delivered in community nursing homes to allow older patients who are now in acute hospital beds to get the level of focused care they need and deserve. This will be achieved as a result of the commitment of the Government to PPPs, with the support of the social partners and taxpayers' money. Urgent changes needed within the health service can, be facilitated through PPPs. The Minister for Health and Children recently expressed the view that she has other new initiatives in mind and anticipates that they will be reflected in the Estimates.PPPs will speed up the delivery of quality motorways, roads, bridges and schools. Years ago the moaning on "Liveline" was about the state of the roads, but that has changed to moaning about road safety, and rightly so. We have moved on and progress has been made.Everyone has referred to the Comptroller and Auditor General's comments on the project involving the five schools. Those comments set a realistic note for reviewing PPPs. These schools were built in three and a half years when the traditional approach would have taken five years and the time between signing the contracts and completion of the schools was under two years. That is an impressive achievement by any standards, irrespective of the criticisms made by the Comptroller and Auditor General, when one considers how much work is needed to deliver new schools to growing communities and to replace derelict schools that are beyond repair, of which there are many in the school building stock. Senator McHugh mentioned the potential for the use of PPPs on an accelerated basis, bearing in mind the lessons we have learned from the five  school projects, a sentiment I support. I urge the Government to look at accelerating the PPP approach throughout the schools building programme. We must renew and provide new school building stock.A major benefit for anyone interested in education is the manner in which the PPP model removes from principals and schools the drudgery of running the buildings. Their sole function now is the delivery of high-quality education for our children. The PPP model enables them to do that in a focused way and that is one of the system's major benefits.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	128	I welcome the Minister of State to the House and the opportunity to debate this topic. Some time ago I raised the PPP pilot scheme for school building. Within the Department of Education and Science, the person with responsibility for PPPs outlined that there was an unacceptable overspend of between 8% and 13% when compared with the traditional construction method. The criticism of the pilot project as it bore fruit in the case of the five schools indicates that the Department has done something wrong. I welcome the PPP idea but when individual Departments cannot monitor and evaluate them, the idea must be re-examined.The Department of Education and Science is not the only Department in this situation. Senator Fitzgerald mentioned the lower long-term costs but I do not see how they can be assessed for the building and running of the schools when there was no prior evaluation. The valuation now stands at €283 million over the 25-year period and the Comptroller and Auditor General has clearly stated that is not value for money. It is time to re-assess the situation.What is happening with the Cork School of Music? Will the Minister of State indicate if the original company can sell on the contract to others? The original company got into difficulties and it was supposed to sell the contract to a French company but it is now with a German company. If we are going that way, the initial contracting process is at fault. Many aspects of the PPP system must be tightened up.If we want to identify an area of excessive profiteering we need look no further than the roads. One example, often cited, is the Westlink toll bridge. In saying this I do not refer to traffic delays at certain hours. The bridge opened in 1990 at an estimated cost of £38 million and to date €300 million has been collected in tolls, a return of 790% to the investor. This is proven fact. How can that be justified? What went wrong or who is at fault? It is excessive profiteering in the extreme and it is ongoing for a period of 35 years.It is proposed that the planned new motorway between Ballinasloe and Galway city will be tolled under a PPP agreement. The Government is again imposing an additional penalty on an already overstretched motoring public. If that is what the Government wants to do, it should be clearly stated. If additional costs are to be added to the motorist, let this be said. The Government should not just introduce another tax by stealth, as it has in the past.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	129	I thank Senator Ulick Burke for sharing his time with me and I am sorry not to have more time to speak on this issue. While I welcome the Minister of State to the House, I am disappointed with his speech. He should have outlined in greater detail where we stand and what can be done with PPPs. There is great confusion in the public mind between public private partnerships and design, build and operate projects. As regards the latter, the majority if not all of the funding is borne by the taxpayer.Several Members have outlined the situation in regard to school projects carried out under design, build and operate projects, as distinct from PPPs. In this regard the Comptroller and Auditor General's report outlines the position correctly. Until now, the majority of schools throughout the country were not getting the maintenance funds they needed to carry out the necessary upkeep of their buildings. With regard to design, build and operate projects, the Government enters a contract with the developer for a 20 or 25-year period to give him or her an amount annually, indexed to inflation, to cover the maintenance throughout this period. As was said by Senator Ulick Burke, some of those projects have come in at a cost, which is 13% higher than the conventional method. In view of this, much of the detail regarding these projects has to be investigated, particularly on the operation and maintenance fronts. There is a role here for local authorities, especially as regards public water and sewerage.I am disappointed that the Minister of State has not provided details of the Ringsend plant. The former Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, explained to the House that the plant was something of a prototype as regards future public sewerage projects, yet there was not even a reference to this in the Minister of State's speech. The plant is the example being championed throughout the country, yet the Minister of State has not mentioned how it will affect businesses in the capital and greater Dublin area feeding into it. The former Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, went on the record in the House in insisting that this was the way local authorities would have to go, describing it as "the number one route". However, there has been no reference to how it will affect the business community and those who will have to pay for it under public private partnership. This is a PPP and also a design, build, operate and finance project, yet we do not know how much it will cost.With regard to some of the roads built under public private partnerships, for example the Kinnegad route, I would have liked the Minister of State to have spelt out how much they will cost and what the projected returns are from the tolls to be put in place. Where are the benefits for the taxpayer and the road user? At this stage, we are at least entitled to some figures on that aspect. I am disappointed the Minister of State did not provide them. This matter should be further debated.

We all recognise the importance of investing in Ireland's infrastructure for our future social and economic well-being. Experience across Europe would indicate that based on the pilot process, the PPPs have a role to play in delivering that investment. It is also clear that PPPs are just one instrument that may be used. That is clear from some of the instances that were outlined. A key to the success is to employ appropriate procurement options in the optimal way for the right types of projects.Senator O'Toole asserted that PPPs were almost exclusively for the bigger contractors. He said that in terms of small school projects it was important to have competition involving local operators and so on. In terms of design, build, operate and finance projects, there are options available. The best way to ensure PPPs are used appropriately is to pay attention to how projects work on the ground in the various sectors. In that respect it is useful to hear Senators' comments.I was heartened by the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, to which most speakers referred. Most reports are critical in terms of cost, but the Senator from Sligo talked about the fabulous school in Tubbercurry where he is a member of the board of management. Likewise, Senator Ryan from Cork and Senator White spoke about the school in Haulbowline-——

#TomParlonPD	unknown-#TomParlonPD-party	unknown-#TomParlonPD-dob	unknown-#TomParlonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	135	In terms of the specifications laid down, if a builder has an obligation to maintain the school over the next 25 years, it is clear that he or she will have a much higher stake in the project and that will be reflected in the long term.No Senator referred to the Comptroller and Auditor General's point that over the 25 year cycle, the value of PPPs would have to be compared with the other more conventional methods. Most Senators would refer to local experience in this regard and Senator McHugh gave a full rundown on the educational deficits in Donegal. In my local area, Birr community school, which has been in place less than 20 years, now requires a new roof. If that project had been a PPP it would not require such a massive expenditure. I have no doubt as regards the issue of value for money over 25 years, nor do I doubt that some of the extra costs, red tape and bureaucracy that deter people from becoming involved are inhibiting the process.Given the experience gleaned from the pilot project, I believe we can put PPPs to better use. The success of PPPs based on the roads projects in Ireland has been internationally acclaimed. While these projects have been rolled out on a massive scale, the task now is to apply the lessons we have learned to ensure continued use of PPPs in the most effective way going forward with a view to getting the value for money required.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	137	It is an old chorus of mine, and a general commentary on our public administration to ask why we cannot have deadlines for the enforcement of legislation. It appears we are expected to write legislation for the convenience of Government rather than the other way around. I do not care if the Minister sets a timeframe of six months, nine months or 12 months, but to insert the standard provision in the legislation with which we deal to the effect that an Act may come into operation on the day the Minister may by order appoint is wrong. Different dates may be appointed. If the Houses of the Oireachtas pass legislation, it is a reasonable expectation that it will come into force at a reasonable time. While I do not care if it is three months or six months, there should be a time limit. We are entitled to expect the same efficiency from Government that Government increasingly expects from the public service generally.

#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	140	Section 2(2) provides the Minister with flexibility on the commencement of different sections of the Act as some may require a longer lead-in time than others. There is no reason the Government would wish to delay the enactment of the Bill. It is not unusual to make the provision outlined.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	143	It might be irrelevant, but it is a nice thing to say. This is not a contentious issue. A Government, which rightly tells us about the disciplines of the marketplace and the need for efficiency reserves to itself the right to delay implementation. I do not say there is a conspiracy, but the Government holds up the process and lengthens the timescale of decision, making as it fails to impose on itself the time constraints and efficiency demands it increasingly imposes on everybody else.

This is the basis of Senator Ryan's objection. The amendments relate to two different professions and it would be preferable to take them separately as the arguments are not the same on both. I propose we group amendments Nos. 1, 6 and 28 on podiatry.Amendment No. 24 is composed of two amendments, which I submitted separately and thought would be taken that way. One part of the amendment relates to physiotherapy and the other to podiatry. Can they be separated?
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	149	We should take amendment No. 24 separately.

#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	152	I move amendment No. 1:
In page 9, subsection (1)(a), line 3, to delete “chiropodist” and substitute “podiatrist”."Podiatrist" is better recognised internationally as the nomenclature for a person who deals with diseases of the foot. While "chiropody" has been in common parlance here, it would be better to use the more internationally recognised term. I did not have the good fortune to learn Greek at school, but I gather that "podiatrist" means physician of the foot whereas the practice of chiropody includes the hand and the foot. While it has been suggested that one could include a reference to "podiatrist-chiropodist" in the Bill, I was reluctant to suggest this usage as I have not seen it used in legislation previously. I do not know what the Parliamentary Counsel would think of that.We can solve the issue of those who call themselves chiropodists in my amendment No. 24 which, inter alia, states: “In this Act, the titles Podiatrist and Chiropodist are synonymous and both titles use are restricted exclusively to those professionals who are registered as Podiatrists.” The qualification for a person to be on the professional register is bachelor of science in podiatry. We have many problems with this in Ireland as we do not have any school of podiatry that awards a bachelor of science degree and it is difficult to know when one will be set up. That is why some of my later amendments on podiatry have to be taken into account. Given that we want to proceed with the legislation, it would be advisable to ensure that the terminology used is accepted internationally and that chiropodists are included by stating that the title is synonymous if they have the relevant degree.
#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	153	I support Senator Henry. The term "podiatry" is now more generally used internationally while the term "chiropody" is somewhat passé.  In the University of Ulster the qualification is in podiatry. It is very important to use terms which have the modern valency but also enable the comparable recognition of qualifications obtained in other places. One can deal with the chiropody issue by the definition of the transition arrangements for existing practitioners in that if they are registered as chiropodists they come under the Act. It seems preferable to use the term “podiatry” in this section.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	154	This is an important issue on a number of levels. Senator Henry outlined the change in the title which is the view of the profession and on which we should reflect. In some cases, even the unions do not include the title "chiropodist". Given that the Good Friday Agreement requires us to have parallel legislation North and South, we need to ensure that legislation in the South reflects the situation in Northern Ireland. In Northern Ireland the term "chiropodist" is almost gone. In addition, the amendments in the name of Senator Henry are of an international nature.On Second Stage I spoke of the importance of mutual recognition of third level qualifications and professional qualifications throughout Europe, which is an EU directive of almost 20 years standing and on which we have made little progress. Part of the reason we have not made progress is that what we are doing in legislation is putting us backwards. There are many instances where this has happened and we are about to do it again. If we do not cover this we make it difficult to get international recognition of qualifications. That is useful in two ways. First, because we do not have enough medical schools for people at various stages of therapy or branches of medicine. This means that people are being drawn in from other jurisdictions who will travel to and from this country.Second, a compelling case has been made for having both terms covered because, ultimately, we are concerned here with a qualification. The qualification is clear and the work the people are doing is clear. One has only to listen to any of the daily phone-in chat shows where every month there will be an argument about somebody who has put themselves forward. The reason behind the legislation is to stop people putting themselves forward as something they are not and to ensure that members of the public are clear about those with whom they do business and that they are properly qualified in the area in which they are to involve themselves medically. There is no argument against this. I appeal to the Minister of State to accept the amendment and to view it as a progressive and positive step forward.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	155	I am in agreement with the majority of speakers on the amendment. My understanding, which is based on discussions I have had with members of the profession, is that there is a desire to have both titles, chiropodist and podiatrist, included and that the issue arises from the qualifications. I understand that until the mid-1980s the entry requirement to the profession was a diploma in chiropody and since then the entry requirement has been a degree in podiatry. However, a person who qualified with a diploma in chiropody in the mid-1980s and is practising would have the capacity to work for 30 to 40 years in the profession before reaching the standard retirement age. In view of this it would be unfair that the title associated with their profession is not in line with their qualification at the time. The fairest and most reasonable way of dealing with those in the profession would be that both titles be recognised.It is widely recognised there is a difference in regard to the meaning of the terms. Nowadays there is a greater level of scrutiny of those who deliver a service and understanding, from a consumer point of view, of the service provided by the practitioner. We need to ensure that a person who has a qualification in chiropody is not disenfranchised at a later stage by the use of the word "podiatry" only. As consumers consider the CVs of those they expect to work on their behalf — it is part of the way they operate — both titles should be recognised. While the amendment seeks to change the term from "chiropody" to "podiatry" I am in favour of including the two terms. I am not sure if that is possible but if it cannot be considered in this House perhaps it can be debated in the other House.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	156	I take up Senator Dooley's point. I discussed the matter with Senator Henry this morning. I would prefer an amendment which would retain the two titles, chiropodist and podiatrist. I understand the Senator has tabled a later amendment on that issue.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	157	Yes.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	158	In a matter such as this we cannot attempt to lay down the rules. The profession is the one that should know best. I and other Members have been contacted by the Society of Chiropodists and Podiatrists. We should not drop the word "chiropodist" because it is well understood by many people. The word "podiatrist" is beginning to be understood in a more general sense but, I presume, those involved in both have their qualifications. I do not know why we cannot us the term "chiropodist-podiatrist" and I ask to Minister of State to consider that aspect.
#GeraldineFeeney	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-party	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-dob	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	159	I agree with the previous speakers. I wonder whether section 90 could be brought into play here in the grandparenting section where if we change the name to "podiatrist", could chiropody be brought into line by upgrading the qualification? Having listened to my colleague, Senator Dooley, I can understand that those who have been practising for many years may not want to do that and I do not know how they would fit in. Younger chiropodists might welcome an opportunity to come in under a different umbrella of podiatry by upgrading their skills. The grandparenting provisions under section 90 might just come into play in that regard, bearing in mind that the Minister stated the following in the House last week:Section 90 sets out grandparenting arrangements for those practitioners currently in practice. It is intended that all persons currently qualified to work in the public health service will meet the standard required for registration. Where practitioners do not possess the required qualification, they will be given an opportunity to undergo an assessment to demonstrate competence.
#FeargalBrowne	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-party	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-dob	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	160	I find myself agreeing with the Opposition on this issue. I accept the points made by Senators Henry and O'Toole but I believe it would be best to keep both titles for thereasons outlined. My amendment concerning "physiotherapists-physical therapists" highlights exactly the same point as that made by Senator O'Rourke. I imagine that something similar could be done for chiropodists and podiatrists. Perhaps the Minister of State will enlighten us on whether it is technically possible.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	161	The grandparenting section is very useful. It would be covered by the second part of amendment No. 24 which states, "In this Act, the titles Podiatrist and Chiropodist are synonymous and both titles use are restricted exclusively to those professionals who are registered as Podiatrists." If all of those people who have been in practice for a long time come forward and are considered to be suitably qualified and trained, they will of course be in a position to be registered.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	162	These proposed amendments have significant implications for an important general principle underlying the design of the regulatory system proposed in the Bill. The approach adopted in the Bill is to specify a single primary title under this section by which members of the registration board of each designated profession will be known. The primary title shows a generic name by which each of the professionals concerned is most commonly known to members of the public.For the professions currently included in the Bill there would in each case be a number of alternative or variant titles reflecting specialties within the professions. For example, the title "radiographer" would encompass diagnostic radiographer, radiation therapist and radiotherapist, whereas a "psychologist" would be a health, education, counselling or clinical psychologist. Variants would also encompass titles used in other countries. For example, "speech and language pathologist" would be used rather than "speech and language therapist", and "clinical nutritionist" rather than "dietician". In the health service, several of the professions would be known primarily by their grade titles. For example, the titles "child care worker" and "child care leader" would be used for social care professionals. In addition, abbreviations of the titles are in common use in the health and social care areas generally. Examples include physiotherapist and occupational therapist. The same would be true in the case of chiropodists and podiatrists.To avoid the specification in the legislation of several different titles for individual professions, which undoubtedly would be very confusing for everyone, not least the public, the issue of multiple titles is tackled by empowering the Minister, under section 94(3), to protect variants of the primary title by which those practitioners registered with the registration board of a designated profession are known. The intention in protecting variant or alternative titles is to guard against a wilful attempt by non-registered persons to convey the impression that they are members of a profession regulated under the Bill.An important feature of this process is set out in section 94(7), which provides a safeguard against misuse of the power to protect additional titles in that a draft of a regulation made by the Minister protecting additional titles must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and a resolution approving the draft must be passed by each House. This allows each case to be examined on its merits, balancing such factors as the protection of the public and the promotion of competition.While I understand the specific issue that arises in this context in regard to the chiropody profession, as raised by several Senators, the adoption of an exceptional approach in this instance would put the chiropody registration board at odds with other registration boards and would serve to obscure rather than enhance public understanding of the health and social care professions.On the qualifications of chiropodists, the Department has undertaken a comprehensive assessment of the competence of chiropodists who wish to practise in the public health service to deal with the differing levels of formal educational qualifications that exist among practitioners. While I appreciate the concerns of the Senators, the professional bodies representing chiropodists have not advised my Department that they would prefer the term "podiatrist". Therefore, I do not accept the proposed amendments.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	163	I do not know with which registration board with which the word "podiatry" would be at odds. Senator O'Toole stated the importance of making sure that international registrations are similar. The degree people are required to have to be registered by a board is a BSc in podiatry. Senator Maurice Hayes explained the circumstances in Queen's University in this regard. Obviously, the profession has contacted many Senators saying that it would like "chiropody" changed to "podiatry". If we do not make the change we are just bringing things backwards, as Senator O'Toole explained.How many Members of this House have been contacted by members of the profession to say they would like the terminology changed? I discussed with the Clerk the possibility of including "podiatry-chiropody". It is up to the parliamentary draftspersons to decide what they would do with this. I am totally unconvinced by the Minister of State's argument. It is extraordinary that members of the profession of all the various councils have been asking for this change.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	164	The Minister of State obviously outlined fairly detailed circumstances regarding the concerns about other professions. To agree with Senator Henry and others, no representatives of the other professions referred to in the Bill have made contact with me but the professionals involved in chiropody certainly have done so. They have made a fairly genuine case, particularly regarding the transition from one educational qualification to the other and the difficulty that will arise at a later stage because of the two different standards. Perhaps an exception could be made for chiropodists in light of the fact they represent the only discipline that contacted us on this matter.The Minister of State said there was no request from the professional body to change from "chiropodist" to "podiatrist". They have made such a request and the representation made to me was certainly not about changing from "chiropodist" to "podiatrist" but about dual recognition. Perhaps there is some confusion over the representation made to the Department. I ask the Minister of State to consider acknowledging the case being made. Perhaps he cannot do so today because it would require further discussions but he might indicate to us that he is prepared to discuss the matter with the professional organisation in advance of the legislation being considered in the Dáil. I would like to see progress in this matter because it is of considerable concern.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	165	I made a resolution that I would keep quiet about matters that I had not raised myself but, having listened to the argument, I would like to make one point to the Minister of State. If he refuses to accept Senator Henry's amendment, anybody could come into this country and call himself or herself a podiatrist and there would be no regulation to prevent him or her from doing so. If I am wrong, will the Minister of State please tell me? It appears that he is saying that if one wants to be a chiropodist and calls oneself a chiropodist, one will be regulated, and that if one comes into this State and calls oneself a podiatrist, one will not be regulated. People will come here with what is the universally accepted description of the profession outside the State, call themselves podiatrists and we will not regulate them. This appears to be the consequence of the Minister of State's argument. I do not know much about the distinction between chiropodists and podiatrists but, having listened to the debate, it is quite clear what is happening. We will have a situation where the State will not regulate podiatry while virtually every other state in Europe will do so.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	166	The Minister of State said something which bothers me, namely, that he had no such representations from the profession. I understood that I was representing the viewpoint of the profession on this issue. If it is not the viewpoint of the profession, we should think differently on the matter. I notice the Ministers of State have changed positions and I get the impression they are not in a position to accept the change because the argument against it is clear. We need to make this change, and I believe that if the Tánaiste were here she would accept it.I agree with what Senator Dooley said. I would be happy if the Minister of State gave an indication that he would discuss the matter with the profession before Report Stage. If it is the case that we are misrepresenting the profession, I will back off straightaway. I do not think that is the case or else we have been seriously misled. Perhaps the scenario outlined by Senator Ryan can be dealt with in the Bill if people are purporting to pass themselves off as chiropodists while calling themselves something else or having a different qualification.The real issue is that if we represent the viewpoint of the profession, we need to have some element of recognition. The easiest way to deal with the matter is to recognise both titles within the Bill. I cannot understand how that would create confusion or difficulty. In fact, it would bring us into line with international best practice, the international usage of titles and what is required under the Good Friday Agreement and the European directive on mutual recognition of professional qualifications. The only compelling argument that might be raised against us is that we are proposing something the profession does not require. I understand we are proposing something the profession requires, and in that case it should be considered.I recognise the Minister of State has just arrived and he is just picking up on the issue. I would like to know whether there was consultation with the profession and that the professionals did not make this suggestion to the Department. Let us put that on the record so that we will know whether we are receiving clear lines of information.
#GeraldineFeeney	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-party	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-dob	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	167	In light of what Senator Ryan said, could a podiatrist come here, set up a practice and not be registered or recognised even if he or she has a university qualification? Perhaps the civil servants thought podiatry would be included in the next phase because there are just 12 professions included in the Bill. If the profession was not catered for, as Senator O'Rourke, Senator Dooley and Senator Browne said, what is wrong with including "chiropodist-podiatrist" or "podiatrist-chiropodist"?
#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	168	I apologise to the Minister of State for leaving but I thought I had an appointment with his Minister. I thought this amendment would go through on a nod. I do not understand why we are fighting the Battle of the Somme over the difference between chiropody and podiatry, because there is no difference. There is no need to include podiatry because these practitioners are already included. This is what the profession calls itself universally, therefore, the modern title should be included in the beginning. The Minister's reply earlier was a load of old gobbledygook. One might as well use the phrase "bone-setter" for any form of orthopaedic surgery. If people want to include "chiropody" let them do so, but it should read "chiropody-podiatry".
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	169	Like Senator O'Toole, I am amazed to hear that the profession has been in contact with the Department urging it to keep the name "chiropodist". I have received information from them throughout the years because, as president of the Diabetes Federation of Ireland, I have been involved with the profession. The Minister of State will be aware that foot care is important. This business about podiatry has come up in the past. All of us on these benches must take some note of university degrees — after all a BSc in podiatry is the qualification.
#FeargalBrowne	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-party	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-dob	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	170	It is regrettable that during the Second Stage debate the Minister did not remain until the spokespersons had finished their contributions. Today the Ministers of State switched places, and after an argument being made for half an hour, we now have another Minister of State in place making a fresh argument. The Tánaiste told me that the Bill, which is long overdue, has been bandied about in Government for 20 years. If the Bill is enacted, the Minister has the option of including these other groups in the future. Why not do so now? We have waited 20 years so we should include these groups and do a good job now. It makes common sense.
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	171	I apologise for coming here but the Minister of State, Deputy Power, had a prior engagement in a Dublin hospital. He is speaking at a function at 4 p.m. so he could not be here.I understand that four professional bodies represent chiropodists in Ireland, none of which approached the Department to change the title to podiatrist. However, I will contact the professional bodies concerned to ascertain their formal views on the matter. It is intended to regulate both chiropodists and podiatrists under the aegis of the chiropody registration board by including one title in the legislation and dealing with the other later by way of regulation under section 94(3).While 12 professions are included in the Bill, several other professions have also endeavoured to be regulated. It is the intention of the Department to regulate the professions later.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	172	We can only act on what we are told. I received calls from a registered chiropodist who said that we could include in the Bill "chiropody-podiatry" which would mean that each title would have the same significance. Perhaps the Minister of State will contact the registered bodies concerned before Report Stage and find out what they want. We do not know enough about the issue so we can only act on what the professionals tells us. I am always pleased to be lobbied by professionals. When I received a telephone call yesterday I said that I would speak on the matter today. If the Minister of State cannot do so, perhaps his officials will meet the registered body of chiropodists to ascertain its members wishes in this regard.
#FeargalBrowne	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-party	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-dob	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	173	I agree with the Leader who is speaking sense, as always. My understanding of section 95 is that if the Minister wants to do this at a later stage it will still require the laying of a draft of the proposed legislation before both Houses of the Oireachtas and each House will have to pass a resolution approving the draft. That means going through the whole procedure again. Why not do it now? Perhaps Senator Henry would agree to withdraw her amendment now so it can be validly moved on Report Stage and the Minister will have sufficient time to check with the relevant people.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	174	I agree with Senator O'Rourke and the individual from the profession who contacted me. It is not about one versus the other. It is about dual recognition. The person in question is a qualified chiropodist with a pre-1986 diploma who has upskilled to a degree in podiatry. The Minister said, as did the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Power, that he had had no contact from the professional bodies regarding the change of name from chiropodist to podiatrist. Notwithstanding the wording of the amendment, the issue is clearly that of dual recognition. Perhaps the Minister can tell the House whether there has been any discussion or a request for dual recognition. That might simplify the issue. As Senator O'Toole has indicated, we are acting in good faith having had numerous discussions with members of the profession and are trying to the best of our ability to highlight the issues as we understand them based on representations from the profession. The arguments put forward seem exceptionally reasonable to me and to other Senators and they require further consideration.I would be happy to conclude on this matter today with an assurance from the Minister that he will discuss the issue of dual recognition with the four groups from the profession and allow some discussion on it here on Report Stage.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	175	It is crucial that we have clarity on the issue of dual recognition and that there is no attempt to abolish it. Senator Ryan referred to what could happen. It is clear that as the legislation is currently drafted people could not misrepresent themselves as being chiropodists. However, people could misrepresent themselves as being podiatrists. That is the difficulty. That leaves a gaping hole in the Bill. Knowing that to be the case, we are about to pass legislation to legislate for a loophole we know exists and are trying to address. It would be very foolish of us not to take that on board.We have put forward a very persuasive argument, which I will not rehearse. I do not believe either Minister disagreed with the points made, but he tried to pinpoint some technical problems. I do not see any technical problems. This is a matter of protecting the public, protecting a title and giving due recognition to people who are duly and properly qualified.I suggest that we park this issue until Report Stage and that in the meantime the Minister's officials make contact with the professional bodies and return with a revised proposal on Report Stage. We all have the same objective. There is nothing political about it and nobody is trying to undermine anybody. On that basis I would be happy to move forward.
#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	176	That is a helpful suggestion, as was the Leader's. I would ask that the Minister's officials make one additional telephone call to establish the position in Northern Ireland so that there is total fluidity around the country.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	177	I have a procedural point. We have spent 45 minutes discussing something Senator Maurice Hayes, who is as experienced a public servant as I have ever met, said he thought would go through on the nod. There is a message to be learned from that by the Minister, namely that the Members of this House and the Dáil put down amendments for a reason and expect a reasonable response. We did not get a reasonable response — we got gobbledygook, a classic parliamentary draftsman's reply to the effect that because we did not put it in, it should not be in and that it should not be in because we did not put it in. We regularly get such a response. Members of the Oireachtas are entitled to serious responses to their amendments.
#CamillusGlynn	unknown-#CamillusGlynn-party	unknown-#CamillusGlynn-dob	unknown-#CamillusGlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	178	This Bill is timely. We should not sacrifice accuracy for speed. The point made by the Leader, by Senator Maurice Hayes and others is that we should wait for absolute clarification. We are talking about two different things although they are related. There should be clarification and we should proceed accordingly. If a Government amendment is necessary, let us get it right. It is as simple as that.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	179	I am becoming more and more alarmed. The Minister of State stated that 12 boards are being set up. Is he signifying that we might set up a podiatrists' board as well?
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	180	I did not signal that.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	181	It is suggested that the wording regarding "podiatrist" could be left until later. I would hate to see the profession divided up into chiropody and podiatry.
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	182	What I said is that none of the four professional bodies has been in contact with the Department of Health and Children and that we will now contact them as well as acting upon the suggestion of Senator Maurice Hayes regarding the situation in Northern Ireland. We will then be better briefed to come back to the issue.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	183	I agree with the suggestion that we postpone this until Report Stage while the officials telephone people in Northern Ireland and all sorts of exciting things happen.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	184	We now come to amendment No. 2 in the name of Senator Brendan Ryan. Is it agreed to take amendments Nos. 2, 3, 23 and 24 together?
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	185	I understood we had decided to take amendment No. 24 on its own, but it is a matter for Senator Henry.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	186	We had decided to take amendment No. 24 on its own. Amendment No. 24 includes physical therapists and physiotherapists, and podiatrists and chiropodists, and I thought we had agreed to omit physiotherapists for the moment.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	187	Is it agreed to take amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 23 together? Agreed.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	188	I move amendment No. 2:
In page 9, line 9 to delete paragraph (g) and substitute the following paragraph:"(g) physiotherapist or physical therapist”.On a procedural matter let me suggest gently, as I have often done in this House, that it would be no harm to consult Members regarding grouping.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	189	The Senator should speak to the amendments. I am not enforcing anything. I am taking amendments as agreed by the House.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	190	I agree, although it took me 20 years to discover that I could disagree with the grouping of amendments.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	191	A Leinster man is always a bit slow. If the Senator had been born in Cork he would have picked it up quickly enough.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	192	The Senators should address the amendment.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	193	In deference to the Chair, I will not respond to Senator O'Toole.We have all had representations made to us regarding the confusion between the terms "physiotherapist" and "physical therapist". Listening to the language, it is easy to understand the confusion. Apparently, in terms of health insurance, if one goes to a physical therapist one may not get payment under one's health insurance but if one goes to a physiotherapist one does. There is considerable uncertainty. The request received by all of us in the House was that the term "physical therapist" be introduced as well.Having heard the response to the last amendment, I could probably write the response of the Minister of State to this one because it will be identical except the words "physical therapist" will be substituted for "podiatrist". The same issues will be raised and we will hear about occupational therapy and other peripheral matters. I understand that all 60 Members of the Seanad received representations about only two terms, "podiatrist" and "physical therapist". This demolishes all the arguments about terminology because no other terminology is sought. In terms of the 12 designated professions, of all the bodies involved, there were quibbles about only two words. In both cases, reasonable suggestions for alternatives or extra wording were used. There is no open-ended request for a variety of vocabularies, therefore. After something of a pause, one of the disputed terms has been sensibly disposed of. I suggest to the Minister of State that there is a perfectly reasonable response with regard to the definition of "physical therapist" unless he has a compelling reason that this term is problematic.
#CamillusGlynn	unknown-#CamillusGlynn-party	unknown-#CamillusGlynn-dob	unknown-#CamillusGlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	194	We should be careful about this issue. On the face of it, it may seem that a physiotherapist and a physical therapist are the same but I understand that the work undertaken by each is different. A physical therapist is more concerned with sports injuries, rather than the more regular work undertaken by the physiotherapist. I am swayed by the opinion of the Minister of State and his Department because I am sure they have undertaken careful research into this matter. It is a question of getting it right.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	195	Again, I am afraid I can anticipate the reply I will receive. There are approximately 2,000 physiotherapists and I have been told for years by their international body that the term "physical therapist" is internationally interchangeable with "physiotherapist". The two titles are synonymous and Irish physiotherapists would like those titles to be protected together. Over the past ten or 15 years, people with training in physical therapy but not physiotherapy, and who have been known only as "physical therapists", have arrived in Ireland. Nobody is saying that these people do not do good in the field in which they work, which I understand is mainly massage and which many patients seem to find helpful. There is no denigration of these people, therefore, but it is important to recognise they do not have the same training as physiotherapists.We must ask these physical therapists to bring forward their qualifications so we can ascertain the most suitable title for their profession. It is important that Ireland keeps in line with the practice of various international boards. Physiotherapists and physical therapists are interchangeable internationally because they have the same training. We should try to follow the international standards in this legislation.
#GeraldineFeeney	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-party	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-dob	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	196	I agree with previous speakers that we must protect the title for one profession, namely, physical therapist-physiotherapist. Physiotherapists have told me they want to work hand in hand with physical therapists, but wish the latter to operate under a unique title, separate from their own. As Senator Henry observed, the world professional body wants the title protected for one profession, which is the physiotherapist. Physical therapists, as we know them, deal more often with massage therapies than sprains and breaks. One will always find a physiotherapist working in a hospital setting, but this is not the case with physical therapists, as we know them. I have used the term "as we know them" more than once because in the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland, Europe and the United States, a physiotherapist is called a physical therapist but there is a significant difference between the two professions in this jurisdiction.As we pointed out in the House last week, we do not wish to do damage to any profession, nor do we want to deprive any professionals of work. This Bill is vital for the protection of the public, however, in ensuring there is no confusion regarding the two professions. I will be pushing for the protection of both titles for one profession.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	197	Senators Henry and Feeney have expressed exactly my own views on this issue. This discussion appears to be different from the last one we had on the issue. I understand that 92 countries use the term "physical therapist" to mean "physiotherapist" in their various languages. It is not sufficient, therefore, for us to effect a change in this regard by regulation under section 94. There is no choice in this matter. Senator Maurice Hayes spoke earlier about the situation in Northern Ireland, where the terms "physiotherapist" and "physical therapist" are interchangeable in law. We must include these two terms, both denoting the same profession. The terms were interchangeable in this jurisdiction up to ten or 15 years ago until the term "physical therapist" began to acquire a different meaning.I apologise to physical therapists for my statement of last week that the "title of physical therapist applies to those practitioners who do not have professional qualifications". I should have said "who do not have the same professional qualifications" because I am sure these practitioners have such qualifications. However, as Senator Feeney observed, they are not the same qualifications as those possessed by physiotherapists. Physical therapists do not generally operate in hospitals but in a different capacity.The temptation is for the Minister to decide that this issue will be regulated under section 94 but this not the correct approach. In 92 countries, the two terms are understood to be interchangeable. This issue is easily resolved by including the terms "physiotherapist" and "physical therapist" as interchangeable in the Bill and regulating this interchangeability to ensure that both terms apply to the same profession. If such an approach is established as a fait accompli, those practitioners who use the term “physical therapist” will have to find another title for their profession. They are currently using many different terms to describe the work they do.The most important task in the context of this issue is to protect the public. We are all aware that it is commonplace for people to consult practitioners who call themselves "physical therapists" in the mistaken belief that such practitioners are physiotherapists. Patients in these circumstances have found that such treatment is not covered under the terms of their contracts with BUPA and VHI. We must protect the public and there is a simple solution to ensure this objective is achieved.
#FeargalBrowne	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-party	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-dob	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	198	Members have been contacted by both physical therapists and physiotherapists and our objective is to recognise that they both do important work. However, we acknowledge that they do slightly different jobs and have slightly different backgrounds and qualifications. An MBIMS Catibus survey carried out in September last year indicated that nine out of ten Irish adults were aware of physiotherapists, while only three in ten were aware of physical therapists. A further one in three of those surveyed considered physical therapists and physiotherapists to be the same or similar, while half of those aged over 65 did not know the difference. It is important that this matter is clarified. That is the purpose of the amendments under discussion, which I hope will receive the backing of the House.

All hell would break loose in such a scenario and we must be careful to avoid that. There seems to be a strong similarity between the two qualifications but there is a difference. We must be careful not to put something into law that might not stand up in the fullness of time.
#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	200	I agree with Senator Glynn on this issue. The inclusion of the term "physiotherapist-physical therapist" suggests that these professions are the same, which is not the case.The international terminology which identifies physiotherapists as physical therapists is one that we have to get to grips with to ensure that people's qualifications in these fields are recognised. We must also recognise that people in Ireland who describe themselves as physical therapists do not have the qualification or provide the full range of service of that held and provided by a physiotherapist.There are possibly two ways of dealing with this issue. One is to offer physical therapists who wish to do so under the transitional arrangements the opportunity to bring themselves up to the standard to provide the broad range of physiotherapy services. The other option is to encourage them to come under such a title as may be agreed, under subsection (2), which provides for designation of other bodies. The Minister of State might also consider the designation of chiropractors. As Senator Glynn said, it is quite dangerous to suggest that these two kinds of therapists are exactly the same.

Rather a situation has arisen over a long period whereby a significant number of persons are currently practising in this State and earning a livelihood providing services to the public using the title "physical therapist", which in other countries would appear to be synonymous with the title "physiotherapist".The imposition of a solution by means of a legislative amendment does not constitute a sustainable long-term solution to this issue. The range of possible solutions must be explored thoroughly between the relevant parties through a process of real engagement and focused consultation on a partnership basis. I am not convinced that there is sufficient evidence at this point to justify the strong legal measure that the proposed amendments would represent. It would pre-empt the resolution of a long-standing and complex issue that requires careful consideration of the rights and obligations of all parties involved.The provisions of the Bill allow for protection of the titles in the future following further detailed examination of all relevant issues, allowing time for the representative bodies to come to a practical solution on a mutually agreed basis. The rights of existing practitioners must be respected. Reservation of the title "physical therapist" to physiotherapists could impact significantly on the livelihood of many physical therapists. There are several hundred people practising as physical therapists. A sustainable long-term solution is required which acknowledges this fact and protects the public.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	207	I thought the main objective we were trying to achieve was to set up registers for the protection of the public. Of course I am sympathetic about people and their livelihoods but the protection of the public is important. I have a vested interest in this area. As a medical practitioner, I must be sure of the qualifications of those to whom I refer people. Under the legislation we are allowing for a situation which does not represent an improvement on the current position. Therefore, why bother with what we are doing? There is confusion about this issue.I recognise that those people who have recently arrived in the State and call themselves "physical therapists" do a useful job, but members of the public believe they are physiotherapists. We know that because during the Second Stage debate many Members pointed out that it is only when members of the public apply to have their fees reimbursed from the VHI or BUPA that they find out that people they were attending were not physiotherapists. I do not believe they are trying to defraud people or do anything awful, but some people with little training, and Senator Glynn in particular has spoken about the charlatans, will take thousands of euro from people. We are perpetuating the opportunity for people to do that by the way we are dealing with this legislation and by saying that in years to come we will introduce some regulation. We should settle matters now.
#FeargalBrowne	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-party	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-dob	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	208	This debate is turning into a farce. The purpose of the Bill and the reason we all welcomed it was that it would afford protection to members of the public whereby if a person had an illness or an injury he or she would be able to attend the right person, so to speak. It would also afford regulation to the professions which would be beneficial for them. In addition, as Senator Henry pointed out, if a medical practitioner refers a patient to another person, the medical practitioner would have some guarantee at least that that person is properly qualified.Nobody is saying that the two kinds of therapists are the same, but our amendments are clear. We acknowledge there are two major bodies, namely, physiotherapists and physical therapists. They do different work and have a different educational background. I will pose the same question Senator Ryan posed during the debate on an earlier amendment. If this amendment is not accepted and the title "physiotherapist" applies as it currently stands, does that mean that a person can come into the country tomorrow, start practising as a physical therapist and not be regulated? Surely that is in nobody's interest, certainly not that of the patient, the physiotherapist or the physical therapist.

The Minister of State said there are 700 physical therapists here and Senator Henry pointed out there are 2,000 physiotherapists. The school of physical therapy has been in existence for ten or 15 years.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	210	Where is it?
#GeraldineFeeney	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-party	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-dob	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	211	In Dublin. We all acknowledge that physical therapists have their own scope of practice and no Member wants to do them any damage. However, in the interest of members of the public, we as legislators must take a stand and point out that in every other jurisdiction except the Twenty-six Counties, a physiotherapist is also known as a physical therapist. We cannot let members of the public believe they are one and the same. We should take a stand on this and something must be done now to protect that title.Since I was elected to this House two and a half years ago, I have received letters from physiotherapists requesting the protection of the title "physical therapist" in regard to their profession. In that respect, I must say shame on me in that all I did about this was make inquiries, obtain information and send it out to them but nobody was doing anything to address the issue. This probably happened for two and a half years before I was elected to this House. Now we are pushing the issue further aside again.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	212	During the debate on Second Stage I said that in the 1960s some people, who did not have the appropriate qualifications, called themselves "chemists". I do not know how that was solved but I am sure it was by an Act of the Oireachtas. In the 1970s I came across an architect who had no qualifications but put the title "architect" on the door, and I am sure that issue was solved internally or by legislation.I accept it will be unfortunate for people who call themselves "physical therapist" if they are no longer allowed to do so unless they have the qualifications of a physiotherapist. However, given that in 92 countries the titles are interchangeable, we do not have the freedom to leave the title in doubt in the minds of members of the public. Therefore, if the purpose of the Bill is to protect the public, we have no choice but to grasp this opportunity and state forthrightly, as the position will be for people who call themselves "physical therapists", we cannot leave the public open to the danger of misunderstanding in this regard. The Minister of State must grasp this opportunity and provide that people may not call themselves "physical therapists" unless they are physiotherapists.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	213	What Senator Quinn said is the nub of the issue. One of the wonderful things about dealing with legislation is that one learns a great deal. Given that the citizens of 92 countries accept that physiotherapy and physical therapy are the same profession, when a person sets up a school of physical therapy or calls himself or herself a "physical therapist" and practises as one, that is misleading, although I accept nobody set out to be deliberately so. Nevertheless, it is misleading and it is our job to protect the public from things, which are either deliberately or accidentally misleading. If Senator Quinn, in his other profession, were to carry an advertisement, which suggested something, which was not true, even if it were not his intention to do so he would probably be reprimanded by the Director of Consumer Affairs. In this State alone, the term "physical therapy" is claimed to apply to a different profession while everywhere else the term means the same as "physiotherapy".I am concerned about the livelihoods of physical therapy practitioners but I am more concerned about the common citizen who needs physiotherapy and mistakenly ends up with a physical therapist. The sensible thing is to describe the profession by its two terms used throughout the world, invite those who commonly describe themselves as physical therapists to find another appropriate and non-misleading title for their profession and let them continue to practise. If they are doing a different job from physiotherapists their profession will not be affected by the name they give themselves because the people who know they are different will be those who consult them. If they have clients who think they are going to a physiotherapist they are, whether deliberately or otherwise, misleading those people. The best thing to do, both for the profession and its clients, is to have a new name, which is not open to misunderstanding.There are only two issues here. My colleagues and I could have submitted 40,000 amendments about aromatherapy, ki-massage therapy and so on. We did not do that because we understand what is involved. There are two words about which there is some debate. The reasonable thing would have been to listen to the consensus across the House, agree to consider the amendment again on Report Stage and attempt to address a legitimate concern regarding the confusion between two terms which, if rushed, sound identical and which in 92 countries are accepted to be identical.I appeal to the Minister of State to listen to the arguments put forward and agree to think about the matter. The amendments can be reintroduced on Report Stage when the Minister has had time to consider them. We are, after all, somewhat rushed. The Bill was first debated only last week. It is complicated legislation containing many technical terms. A little time would do no harm.

In almost 15 years, no negligence case has been brought against a physical therapist. No one, certainly not on this side of the House, is casting aspersions on physical therapists.Were talks held with physiotherapists' representatives and was this point raised by them? Are they willing to have the titles separated in order to avoid confusion? It is unfortunate that the term "physical therapist" is recognised throughout the world as meaning the same as "physiotherapist". Can the Minister of State clarify this point?
#GeraldineFeeney	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-party	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-dob	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	217	I suggest that the Minister of State or his officials meet with the two professional bodies to see if a new name can be agreed for physical therapists. Senator Ryan could then withdraw the amendment and resubmit it on Report Stage when those consultations have been completed. We cannot leave room for confusion.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	218	Amendment No. 23, which I submitted, is similar to Senator Ryan's amendment. I take Senator Feeney's point. If the Minister of State can undertake those consultations before the debate on Report Stage I would be happy to withdraw that part of my amendment.There is another part to amendment No. 23. It comes to light partly because of what Senator Ryan has just said. He referred to the fact that if I, in my other job, happened to carry an advertisement which misled unintentionally I would still be guilty of the offence.Section 79 states that a person "is guilty of an offence if, with intent to deceive, he or she contravenes section 78(4)", and so on. Can the Minister of State put my mind at rest on this matter? If someone who uses the wrong term afterwards claims not to have done so with intent it appears that the person would not be guilty of an offence. I am saying that if a person uses the wrong term he or she is guilty of an offence. Before I withdraw the amendment in full I would like to hear the Minister of State's view as to whether there is a need for the second part of amendment No. 23.
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	219	I would be willing to consult the representatives of physiotherapists and physical therapists in an effort to come up with another title for physical therapists. I fully understand what everyone has said about the confusion in this country compared with other countries where the two qualifications are synonymous. The titles are not synonymous in Ireland because there are different educational requirements for physiotherapists and physical therapists. With the agreement of the House I will go back to both organisations to see if they can suggest an alternative term. That would solve the problem for everybody. No one is casting aspersions on either profession. A change in wording could get us over this hurdle.The words "intent to deceive" are required to demonstrate the necessary level of proof required to secure a conviction. I understand what Senator Quinn is saying but I do not think there is any intention by anyone to deceive.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	220	I understand that but we are not saying there is an intention to deceive at present. I am concerned about the future. My amendment states: "In this Act the title "physical therapist" shall be deemed equivalent to the title "physiotherapist" and its use is restricted exclusively to those professionals who are registered as physiotherapists." The second part of the amendment states: "Anyone contravening paragraph (a) is guilty of an offence.” It is not a question of whether a person intended to deceive. If someone calls himself or herself a physiotherapist it would not be an acceptable defence to say he or she did not know an incorrect term was being used.I do not wish to press the amendment at this stage. The Minister of State has agreed to consult further and the amendment can be resubmitted on Report Stage. It is not simply a question of intent to deceive. If someone uses the incorrect term it should not be a good defence to say he or she did not know.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	221	As you well know, Acting Chairman, my vanity alone leads me to withdraw most amendments on Committee Stage simply so I can resubmit them on Report Stage. I would not have pressed the amendment anyway but I am grateful for the willingness of the Minister of State to consider it on Report Stage. If he sustains the tone he has just demonstrated we will make an enormous amount of progress on the Bill in the 40 minutes remaining. All the Opposition seeks are reasonable responses and this is not a Bill on which we have any intention to waste time. We have spent a great deal of time, however, talking about matters that should have been resolved at an earlier stage. Therefore, while I cannot speak for Senator Browne, I am happy to withdraw my amendment No. 2 with a view to possibly reintroducing it on Report Stage.
#FeargalBrowne	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-party	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-dob	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	222	I am willing to withdraw amendment No. 3 with a view to resubmitting it on Report Stage. I await the Minister of State's comments at that stage. I appreciate the gesture he has made.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	223	I move amendment No. 4:
In page 9, line 17, subsection (2), after "subsection (1),” to insert “and in particular shall, within the period of 12 months from the passing of this Act, so designate the profession of counsellor or therapist,”.Every time I refer to this matter I must declare an interest because I am married to a psychiatrist and, consequently, I do not get an unbiased view of the issue. What troubles me is that in the list of professions to be designated there is no mention of therapists or counsellors. Many people are concerned that some may claim to be psychotherapists who only have a six-month diploma, while others claim to be counsellors who may have a diploma obtained following a 12-month part-time course. Many of those professions probe deeply into vulnerable areas of people's emotions and their personal lives. It is a profession that desperately needs to be regulated through the formal recognition of proper professional qualifications.The 12 designated professions are listed in section 4(1). Section 4(3)(c) refers to “the resolution, through guidance, counselling or otherwise, of personal, social or psychological problems;” but there are only one or two of the professions to which that could currently apply. Much of what one would call “the resolution, through guidance, counselling or otherwise, of personal, social or psychological problems” occurs outside the profession of psychology and is practised by people who are not qualified as psychologists. A huge number of people are practising that sort of stuff but it is dangerous for untrained, unskilled people to probe other people’s subconscious. It is potentially as dangerous as people prescribing limited amounts of medication because one is getting into very dangerous territory. I moved the amendment in order to raise this matter and I appeal to the Minister of State to consider it.We can discuss on the section some of the criteria that arise later in the Bill concerning how a health or social care professional should be designated. To a degree we are saying that we will follow the market rather than defining it but I am not madly keen on that approach. When dealing with human vulnerability on the one hand, and the designation of professions on the other, one must ask what is good for the public, rather than asking what the public wants. I will raise a number of questions about that when we discuss the section. What proposals does the Minister of State have to regulate counselling and psychotherapy?
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	224	Senator Ryan has raised a most important issue concerning an area in which the general public is at its most vulnerable. The Irish Council for Psychotherapists has been in contact with me to say that it has standards in place and is linked to the European Psychotherapy Association. The council has signed up to the EPA's standards and would like to be included within the terms of the Bill. Therefore, I propose to table an amendment on Report Stage to include psychotherapists. As Senator Ryan explained, some people may describe themselves as counsellors or therapists but not all of them are. For that reason, it is most important to put regulations in place for the sake of the general public.
#GeraldineFeeney	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-party	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-dob	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	225	Psychotherapists and counsellors are not mentioned in the list of designated professions in section 4(1). Senator Ryan made a relevant point in his contribution last week when he stated that in the past we turned to priests if we had troubles or worries. As the Senator pointed out, however, priests have six or seven years' training depending on the religious order with which they studied. At least they had some kind of training. There are well qualified counsellors who may have an interest in psychotherapy and will look after a person very well. There are others, to whom my mother would have referred as "fly-by-nights". They cause more harm than good to people seeking help who comes away feeling more confused than ever. The Minister of State should consider provisions to rope in such people when it comes to Report Stage.During the debate on Second Stage, concern was expressed about rogue practitioners who were doing damage to people who had nobody to pick up the pieces for them. I support other speakers in calling for that aspect to be examined in order to ring-fence such people.
#CamillusGlynn	unknown-#CamillusGlynn-party	unknown-#CamillusGlynn-dob	unknown-#CamillusGlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	226	My view on these matters is well known. I support the idea that people delivering professional services should be qualified to do so. Section 4(1) refers to 12 designated professions but the Bill allows the Minister to include other professions in the fullness of time. Apart from focusing on the need to register the 12 designated professions, the Bill also deals with who is entitled to call themselves what in other groups, apart from the 12 aforementioned professions. The debate is welcome and the public will be the winners when it becomes law. When the Bill is enacted and other groups are added, as the Minister of the day may deem appropriate, the public will be getting a service from properly qualified people who have the full approval of the Department of Health and Children.I cannot disagree with Senator Ryan that a number of other groups need to be included within the provisions of the Bill but I am sure they will come forward in due course.
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	227	I thank Senator Ryan and other speakers for drawing attention to this important area, including counsellors and psychotherapists. I agree that many of those who practise as counsellors and therapists do an excellent job but, unfortunately, that cannot be said for all of them. There is a big problem there. Given my responsibility for mental health, I have met many of these groups. I agree that they should all be regulated by the Bill but, unfortunately, there is a dichotomy in that they cannot agree among themselves. Many of them are well qualified but Senator Ryan has been kind in saying that others have completed six-month courses. Some may have attended much shorter courses than that.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	228	I know.

I have met many counsellors' and psychotherapists' groups and have asked them to come up with proposals which we can consider. I want to do what the Senator has suggested but it would be extremely difficult to do so at the moment. One could end up with a lot of court cases because many of these people have qualifications. We must therefore be extremely careful how we go about matters. The Senator's amendment proposes inserting a timescale of one year. I wish we could do it within a year. However, I am not that optimistic that we would be able to do so. As I look to the future of mental health services, I see the need for properly trained counsellors and psychotherapists, as all psychiatrists would agree. As we have only one opportunity, we must be extremely careful to get this right. I want to consult psychiatrists and everybody in this field. Some of the groups with which I had discussions could not agree among themselves how to define the various therapists and counsellors. I have asked them to come back to me with proposals at which time we will reconsider the matter. Unfortunately, I cannot accept the amendment as worded. I am grateful that we have had the discussion today.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	230	As I said earlier I would not dream of pushing it, as I would be unable to raise the matter again later. I agree we have superb professionals in these areas. I had an unfortunate experience not many years ago when my son was in second year and a classmate of his committed suicide at the age of 14. Within an hour the Southern Health Board provided counsellors advising the teachers how to deal with the matter. The teachers and others told me the quality of service was first-class, professional and very good. Properly-trained and qualified professionals represent a significant asset in a crisis.The failure of the profession to agree is the problem I want to address. I suggested a timeframe of 12 months as it is time the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children advised the group to either agree a framework of qualifications or let the Department write them on its behalf. We would not allow every quack to walk into the country and write prescriptions just because the medical profession could not agree on these matters. It is correct that we properly regulate who can practise medicine because such people are allowed to write prescriptions, which is the main factor that distinguishes medical practice from other areas of care for vulnerable people.We must recognise that what was the case 50 years ago is quite different now. Many people are opting for other ways to get support for emotional and other distress, which may be better for them than a lifelong dependence on medication. I know of documented stories of poor counsellors creating lifelong dependence. While I do not mention any single individual, this is capable of being very cynically interpreted as it also represents an income stream for life. A misfortunate wretch might feel he or she must see a particular professional every week for the rest of his or her life and pay €40 or €50 each time. A person with 20 or 30 such clients would be on the pig's back for life.While I may take issue with the Minister of State on this matter, I feel that if within 12 months the groups cannot agree on a format for qualifications, on behalf of the people of Ireland, the Minister should tell them what qualifications will allow people to call themselves therapists and counsellors. Given the disparity, unless we take action, I do not believe large chunks of that profession would take action.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	231	I very much support Senator Ryan's sentiments. As Senator Glynn and the Minister of State will be well aware, spoken therapies have become so much more common in psychiatry than psychotherapeutic drugs that we must try to tackle the issue. More people are consulting such professionals and we will need to make the decision if they cannot do so among themselves. As Senator Feeney will be very aware, we must be very careful regarding the individuals to whom people are being referred by, let us say, our psychiatric colleagues. They must know that a proper standard is in place and ultimately we must make the decision as to what can be considered a proper standard.

I agree with what has been said and will follow up on what Senator Ryan has said. I agree these people need to be regulated and I will do everything to drive forward the message to them.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	233	I move amendment No. 5:
In page 9, subsection (3)(b), line 32, to delete “or” and substitute “and”.This is a very simple amendment, which is unlikely to need 25 minutes' debate. One should make a diagnosis of a condition, treat it and care for the person as opposed to the current wording which is "the diagnosis, treatment or care of those who are injured, sick, disabled or infirm".
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	234	The Minister of State should accept the amendment.
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	235	Changing the words could have the effect of excluding people. Substituting "or" with "and" would inappropriately restrict the definition of a health or social care profession. By leaving the word "or" in place a health or social care profession can be a profession in which a person exercises skill or judgment relating to the diagnosis, treatment or care of those who are injured, sick, disabled or infirm. By replacing "or" with "and" a person would need to exercise skill or judgment relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of those who are injured, sick, disabled or infirm. In other words, all three would need to be carried out to be considered a health or social care profession. This is considered to preclude a number of professions currently included in the Bill. Therefore, it is not proposed to accept the amendment.

Should it not state "the diagnosis, treatment or care of those who are injured, sick, disabled or infirmed"? I believe it should state "infirmed" as opposed to "infirm".
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	237	Infirm is a general term. There is no such word as "infirmed".
#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	238	It is possible to be infirmed in the same way one can be sick.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	239	Whatever about the time we have spent up to now, many questions remain to be asked about section 4. I will go through my questions seriatim, as I want to ensure they receive answers. The section contains a list of the health and social care professions. When the Bill is enacted two things will happen. First, only those who are properly qualified will be allowed to describe themselves as belonging to one of these professions. Second, only people who are correctly registered will be able to practise these professions. I am concerned about, for example, a medical doctor who could sometimes be a dietician, sometimes a psychologist and sometimes, as many GPs are, a social worker. While I am not being awkward, this is a genuine question. How can we be sure we will not have a series of territorial wars in which the general work of a medical doctor and particularly a general practitioner will be eaten away by exclusive claims of these individual professions?
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	240	It would be extremely difficult for me to speak about turf wars down the road in the medical profession. There were turf wars in the past and there will more in the future.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	241	The medical profession is good at defending its patch too.
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	242	All professions are. The legislation does not prescribe the regulation of the scope of practice for any profession. It would be open to any designated profession to define the scope of its practice as part of its code of professional conduct and ethics. Endangering the public by operating outside the scope of practice would be grounds for complaint against a registered practitioner. It is considered that any legal protection of scope of practice would inappropriately restrict the development of a profession as professional boundaries expand in line with the development and growth of professional skills and knowledge. Protecting scope of practice would also better constrain skill mixes and the most effective utilisation of scarce professional resources as auxiliary professions, take on tasks and activities that would previously have only been carried out by qualified professionals.I understand Senator Ryan's point but if what he said happened in the future, it can be legislated for then — now is not the time to do it. The regulation of these professions will not have an adverse impact on the medical and other professions.
#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	243	Senator Henry might be able to answer this because of her professional background. These used to be profession supplementaries in medicine and they now stand on their own. Now they will be part of a primary care team where people play different roles. It would be ridiculous if a good GP who wanted to tell someone to eat less fat had to first consult the nutritionist. The GP will develop his or her practice in the normal way and when a person needs specialist care from a dietician or a similar profession, it will be dealt with then. The legislation should be as flexible as possible so modern medicine and primary care can develop, leading to enhanced team work.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	244	I take Senator Ryan's point but Senator Maurice Hayes is right. There is much more team work now in hospitals. As for general practitioners feeling their jobs are being taken, there is hardly a general practitioner in the State who is not ready to collapse. There is no GP in Mulhuddart to treat 10,000 people and there is barely one in Ballyfermot. The people of Mulhuddart will be ecstatic, as will any medical practitioner anywhere in the area, if some social workers, psychologists and dieticians turn up. The head of the Mater Hospital blamed the accident and emergency department crisis on the fact that there are not enough GPs and that they are not working late enough. If some of them were open at 2 a.m., it would remove many of the people from accident and emergency departments. I cannot see this causing any crisis in primary care because we are in a dire situation as it is. These people will be welcomed.
#GeraldineFeeney	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-party	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-dob	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	245	I agree with Senator Henry. I oversaw the rewriting of the ethical guide for the Irish Medical Council and the doctors' scope of practice is clearly outlined. I can understand, however, Senator Ryan's point. Doctors would refer to the relevant disciplines rather than take on the work themselves. They are only too glad to know there is a supplementary profession to back them up.
#CamillusGlynn	unknown-#CamillusGlynn-party	unknown-#CamillusGlynn-dob	unknown-#CamillusGlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	246	The role of a GP has changed substantially in recent years, with GPs standing back from carrying out certain procedures in their surgery due to a fear of litigation. Who could blame them, the way people think now? The co-operative system has been a welcome development in the lives of GPs — it works well in the Midland Health Board system.The attending disciplines referred to would be welcome but Senator Henry is right, there is a shortage of general practitioners, mainly as a result of the rise in population, the retirement of general practitioners and the method by which they are replaced, which is slow. We must get this right. Replacements must be vetted and the health board must ensure that the person taking up the position is suitable. We should not sacrifice accuracy for speed.
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	247	I understand Senator Ryan's point. All professions must change and one of the major problems I face is getting people to understand what team work means. That is a major challenge for all of us who want to achieve a better health service.Senator Glynn mentioned the co-operatives. I was at the Shannondoc co-op in Limerick, where doctors work together on a team basis. Although a small number of GPs still resist the idea, of the thousands of people treated in the mid-west, only 8% were appropriately referred to accident and emergency wards. The remainder, were treated by the general practitioner or nurse through the co-op. That shows that when things are done properly, with the professions working together as a team, the system works. The corresponding referral figure might be as high as 30% of the people in an area where there is no co-operative. I take the point but the Senator should not worry.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	248	I will not be losing any sleep. If the appropriate number of people had medical cards, the figure would be even lower than 8%. Many people feel they cannot afford to visit the GP.
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	249	I hope that will change in the next few days.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	250	Ever since the Revenue Commissioners decided that quadriplegics were not covered by the legislation exempting people from excise duty for cars because the legislation stated the exemption applied to those who could not use their hands or their feet, I have always felt an obligation to tease out what legislation really means because, although that was a most peculiar interpretation, the Revenue Commissioners used it to refuse people an exemption.Elsewhere, section 4 states that if the Minister considers it is appropriate and in the public interest that a health or social care profession be designated, he or she shall have regard to certain factors, such as the extent to which the profession has a defined scope of practice and applies a distinct body of knowledge and the extent to which the profession has established itself, including if there is at least one professional body representing a significant proportion of the profession's practitioners. That is acting after the fact. I am not trying to be awkward, but there is an expectation that all people working in these areas will be of a sufficiently high professional standard to do all these things. The trouble is that some of them are not, as the Minister of State just indicated. They cannot agree. I am worried that this section might restrict the Minister from intervening where people are doing harm and because they are not part of an organised profession with the type of structure outlined in paragraphs (a) to (d), inclusive, the Minister would not have the legal power to intervene. I would question this. For example, if the health or the safety and welfare of the public is threatened, it is not much consolation to learn the Minister cannot do anything about the situation because a particular profession is not well organised. There is a gap there and I merely ask the Minister of State to consider it.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	251	This is a brief and probably malicious question. Section 7 states:The object of the council is to protect the public by promoting high standards of professional conduct and professional education, training and competence among registrants of the designated professions.Is there a similar primary object in the legislation governing the Law Society or the Bar Council of Ireland, my own professional body — the Institution of Engineers of Ireland or, indeed, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland? The provision that the primary objective of the self-regulating body should be to protect the public is admirable and should be in all legislation dealing with the regulation of any profession. I wonder whether similar provisions exist in respect of the bodies I have mentioned. If the Minister of State does not know, it is not a fair question. However, I just want to make the point that it should be the first paragraph of all legislation dealing with the professions.
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	252	I do not know the answer to the Senator's question. As I understand it, based on the pharmacy profession, which I know best, the responsibility of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland is to protect the public. I cannot speak about the other professions. However, the Senator is right.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	253	I may have missed it, but I cannot find a reference to any qualification the chairperson of the council should have when the Minister selects him or her. It is amazing there is no suggestion that the person to be appointed ought to possess some qualification or degree. I know that under the present Minister this could not happen, but if it were a Labour Party Minister for Health and Children, the person appointed could be a prominent member of the Labour Party. I believe the chairperson of such an important body should have some threshold to get over before taking office. It is a pity, because there is so much prescription right through this section, all of which I agree with. I think, however, the office of chairperson could be better defined.
#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	254	I hate to disagree with Senator Ryan. I do not believe a Minister should be too constrained in the appointment of a chairperson to a council. I accept that ideally he or she should have the ability to know what is going on, etc. In my experience, however, the best qualification for a chairperson is some horse sense, not necessarily degrees or academic qualifications. The role is essentially one of protecting the public. In my experience the people best able to protect the public are those who know what is going on in public. I accept that a certain level of know-how is needed to deal with issues, but it would be a mistake to try to be too prescriptive.
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	255	I would agree with Senator Maurice Hayes and I do not propose to accept the amendment. It could be very restrictive.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	256	There is no amendment involved.

As regards any stipulation about who should chair a council, the fact that a person might have qualifications does not necessarily mean he or she has common sense. I prefer to leave the situation as it is.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	258	Is section 9 agreed to?
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	259	I have a few more comments to make.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	260	This debate will continue next week because, clearly, there are many issues to be discussed. If the professions outlined in the Schedule wish to contact any Member of the House, we will be pleased to hear from them. I would remind the House that the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, will be taking Private Members' business as well. I suggest a formal break of ten minutes between 5 p.m. and 5.10 p.m.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	261	Is that agreed? Agreed.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	262	On section 9, I would like to suggest a very small amendment, to deal with the issue I have raised. I am responding to what Senator Maurice Hayes said. Subsection (4) states:Before appointing a chairperson under subsection (1) or an ordinary member under subsection (3)(b)(i) or (ii) or subsection (6), the Minister may consult with any organisations he or she considers appropriate.I would be much happier if that means "shall consult", so the Minister must actually talk to somebody else he or she considers appropriate, before appointing a chairperson. Sensible people will consult, but both in my own party and in others, decisions are sometimes made about appointments to these bodies that, superficially at any rate, may not appear too sensible.There is another question I may have missed. The Teaching Council, for example, makes some effort at gender balance. In all of the procedures for electing people to the various councils, I do not find, or I may have missed, any suggestion of gender balance. Will the Minister of State say whether this is deliberate policy or an omission and can we think about it between now and Report Stage?
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	263	The Senator can do so.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	264	I can what?

#GeraldineFeeney	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-party	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-dob	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	266	It is somewhat tongue-in-cheek for me to say this, but I am inclined to leave that word "may" instead of "shall consult", to avoid being overly prescriptive. I say this as someone who represented the public interest on An Bord Altranais and the Medical Council. I worked alongside people who represented the public interest with me and they were the best workers one could find. If one was being prescriptive one could not have picked better people. My only fear is that if we insist that the Minister of the day "shall consult", that is to prescribe. If one of the 12 has a grievance against somebody being put forward, whether male or female, he or she might object and insist on an appointee from a particular organisation. The Minister of the day could never get 12 bodies to agree to one chairperson. There will always be something wrong.When we consider past appointments, it is possible to be cynical; perhaps they were not all good. By and large, however, people who represent the interests of the general public have a great role to play and the chairperson would, ideally, be representing those interests.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	267	I am not concerned about the consultation issue because if anyone wants to make a go of anything he or she must consult. How else can he or she get the information required? I do not agree with providing for gender proofing in legislation. Whereas one can do a job whether one is man or a woman, the term "gender proofing" is always used to label women who it is claimed would not have got where they are without a quota system. It is very discriminatory.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	268	Why then was the teaching profession deemed to require it?

#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	271	I move:That Seanad Éireann:—noting the emerging crisis in the delivery of our maternity services all over the country;—noting the recent unnecessary death of a person in Monaghan due to the downgrading of the accident and emergency service in Monaghan;—noting the 33 hour wait by an ill woman on a trolley in Limerick Regional Hospital recently;—noting the determination of the Minister for Health and Children to implement the disastrous recommendations of the Hanly report;calls on the Government to drop the Hanly report and to upgrade the accident and emergency service currently available in general hospitals all around the country in order to ensure that every patient in need of a service gets the service they need when they need it, and to further ensure that the crisis in the maternity service is not allowed to deteriorate further.I am happy to move this motion on behalf of the Labour Party group. The reason for tabling it — we appear to debate health a great deal in this House — is that the issue cannot be ignored. The state of our health services is one of the major preoccupations and concerns of the public. That is not the main reason one would table a motion, although it is a good one. It is because our role as an Opposition group, particularly in Private Members' time, is to seek to make the Government accountable for its actions and also to engender public debate about Government policy, Government decisions and to raise in a public arena matters of major concern.Last week when I considered what we should discuss in Private Members' time it appeared that issues around health were at the top of the agenda, particularly the delivery of maternity services, the crisis in acute services in the Monaghan area, due directly to Government policy in regard to Monaghan General Hospital, the 33 hour wait by an ill woman on a trolley in Limerick Regional Hospital, which was highlighted in the media last week, and the determination by the Minister for Health and Children to implement the disastrous Hanly report, which is the area on which I wish to concentrate. My colleague, Senator Tuffy, who will second the motion, will speak on the issue of maternity services, which is appropriate considering that she is the most recent mother in the House.I shall speak about the position in Monaghan and the situation in Limerick, with which I am quite familiar, given that I live near Limerick. The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O'Malley, whom I welcome to the House, may be aware, as I am from staff in Nenagh General Hospital and people I have met, that people from Limerick and its environs are using the accident and emergency service in Nenagh because they cannot get into Limerick Regional Hospital. If they go to Limerick to access the accident and emergency service they have to wait hours and sometimes two days. I know of people who were sent to Limerick Regional Hospital from Nenagh hospital with fractures and were there for almost two days. I spoke to a lady recently who spent almost an entire weekend in the hospital's accident and emergency unit despite it being a so-called designated hospital under the Hanly recommendations. People from the Limerick area are travelling to Nenagh hospital to use its accident and emergency service because of the horrendous delays in Limerick Regional Hospital.A debate took place in the other House last week on the position in the north east. I have read that debate. I specifically wish to raise one comment made by the Tánaiste and Minster for Health and Children, Deputy Harney. In her remarks the Tánaiste made it clear she is determined to implement the Hanly reforms. That was the first time she made it clear she would do so and it is one of the reasons the motion is before the House. The Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, contributed to the debate. The Tánaiste stated: "The board proposes to recruit five additional non-consultant hospital doctors to facilitate the early restoration of 24 hour, seven-day medical cover to Monaghan General Hospital, at an estimated additional revenue cost of €500,000 a year." She went on to say that revenue funding for ten additional beds has been approved.The language used by the Tánaiste is the same language that is used in regard to Nenagh hospital — the notion of 24 hour, seven-day medical cover by non-consultant hospital doctors. Non-consultant hospital doctors have also been recruited for Nenagh hospital. This is a clever play on words and it raises the question as to when an accident and emergency service is not an accident and emergency service. It is not an accident and emergency service when surgical services are removed. It is notable that in Monaghan General Hospital surgical services are being removed, therefore reducing Monaghan to what the other hospitals in the Hanly recommendations should provide, namely, 24 hour, seven-day medical cover.The provision of medical cover effectively amounts to a minor injuries clinic. Without the backup of consultants on site and surgical services it cannot be said to be an accident and emergency service. We can see from the Monaghan area what are the implications. The family of Mr. Benny McCullagh know them. He was a man who lived very close to Monaghan General Hospital and who died because the hospital could not treat him as it did not have the acute service required. That is the consequence that will follow the implementation of the Hanly report. I have no doubt that what is happening in Monaghan is a test case in this regard. If it can be implemented in Monaghan and in the mid-west, Hanly II will be rolled out and the reform will be in place. I also do not doubt the total determination of the Minister to do that. I ask her to come into the House and state that in clear terms. If she does not attend the House this week I ask the Minister of State to state clearly that it is the Government's intention to implement the Hanly reforms because it believes that is what is best for the patient. There is a body of opinion that believes that.However, the fundamental basis on which Hanly is positioned is totally flawed. In that regard I refer not only to the report itself but to an analysis of it prepared by Ms Catherine McNamara, a health economist, on behalf of the hospital services action group. Ms McNamara is not the only person to have pointed this out. In this widely available document, which was published some months ago, she points out that the evidence for the basic proposition in the Hanly report, namely that higher volume hospitals produce better outcomes, is flawed. The statistics and evidence to which the report refers are misinterpreted.The Hanly report states that larger volume hospitals produce better patient outcomes. It refers to the York report in that regard, yet the latter report came to the exact opposite conclusion. The members of the National Task Force on Medical Staffing did not read the York report or, if they did, they chose to interpret it in a different way. Therefore, criticisms of the Hanly report are not the wild rantings of culchies from the regions, whether it be Monaghan or north Tipperary, as one would have it from certain urban commentators, particularly those from Dublin. They are not the mad rantings of country people who allegedly want a hospital at every crossroads. The fact is that the very foundation of the Hanly report is totally different from what the task force says it is and therefore the policy is flawed. However, the Government, by way of its single-minded, "must be right" approach, is determined to wreck the health service of communities throughout the country with its disastrous policies. An example is the downgrading of Nenagh accident and emergency unit, which would result in thousands more using an already overcrowded facility in Limerick.If one asks why the Government wants to do this, one will start to see clues. Obviously there is another agenda, which in turn is one of a series of agendas. An article in The Irish Times from Saturday, 13 November 2004 offers a clue to the nature of the real agenda: “The Tánaiste and Minister for Health, Ms Harney, will signal next week [presumably this week] that she wants public hospitals to enter into agreements with the private sector to develop additional medical facilities on their campuses.” Of course this is happening already. The Minister will know that there were recent tenders for the building of a private hospital close to the existing public facility in Limerick. This indicates that the real agenda is to build private facilities and to have a system in which one buys one’s health care. This is the bottom line.We see evidence of this approach in many areas, particularly in the tax breaks for capital funding for facilities for the care of the elderly. Such facilities are not capable of taking and do not want to take elderly people with medical conditions who cannot leave hospitals because they have nowhere to go. Such people are, according to a horrendous phrase, the "bed blockers". Nursing homes can only take relatively healthy old people. Hospitals have to take the medical patients because the nursing homes cannot afford highly qualified nurses and medical personnel to care for them.It is clear that the PD agenda of the Government, which is accepted by Fianna Fáil, is to have private facilities in public hospital premises. This, on its own, is not necessarily bad, except that underlying the agenda is the principle that we should be buying our health care. The national treatment purchase fund is another example of this. I fundamentally object to the idea that one should have to purchase health care in a private market. Under this British system this would be called Thatcherism.If one cannot afford to buy health care, where will one get it? The public system is being run down and the idea is to force people to use the private system. There is considerable evidence of this, which, unfortunately, I do not have time to set out this evening. I hope we will have a comprehensive debate on the Hanly report in particular. I call on the Minister to think again. It is not too late to reverse this disastrous health policy and to realise that the circumstances in Monaghan will replicate themselves around the country. Is that what the Government intends to achieve?
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	272	I believed the Minister for Health and Children would be present today. She is in my constituency and I wanted to have the opportunity to wish her well in her new position. I had hoped to ask her about Peamount Hospital in my area. I do not know if the Minister of State will be able to update me on it. I want to know the Department's opinion on the plans for restructuring the hospital and on the need to provide more respite care resources.Apart from its implications for Peamount Hospital in my constituency, the Hanly report does not constitute a significant local issue. I read an economic analysis of the Hanly report by a Dr. McNamara and having considered the report's implications for Peamount Hospital, including the proposals to reduce or remove its TB care services, I can see why it is flawed. I hope the new Minister for Health and Children and the Minister of State will consider this. It is good that a report such as the Hanly report has been published, but one does not just accept such reports lock, stock and barrel. One should consider the Hanly report critically before implementing it and accept that there will be different views thereon.As Senator O'Meara has stated, there is a tendency to portray those who criticise the Hanly report as if they were backward and living in rural communities that are against progress. As Maeve-Ann Wren stated in her book, in reference to the election of Deputy Connolly——

#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	274	People are voting for candidates like Deputy Connolly because they want more accessible health care services and because they are unhappy with the present health system.As Senator O'Meara stated, I will refer specifically to the maternity health services. I had a baby recently and this has really made me conscious of issues concerning babies, children and families. Two days ago, the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, awarded Limerick Maternity Hospital a UNICEF and World Health Organisation award, which is part of a programme initiated by the two organisations to promote breastfeeding. I did some research and noticed in a newspaper a reference to the implementation of a ten-point plan in this regard. The World Health Organisation and UNICEF introduced this concept circa 1989 and a number of hospitals in Ireland are trying to implement it. The World Health Organisation and UNICEF assess the implementation of the plan and interview mothers who have been to hospitals to understand their experiences of those hospitals' practices and procedures. Limerick Maternity Hospital must be commended on being the first Irish hospital to receive this award and for faring so well in the assessment procedures.Breastfeeding should be promoted but should not be pushed on people. The statistics indicate that it helps to reduce the incidence of diabetes and so on. Promoting breastfeeding will reduce diseases in the future and help the health system. I had a good experience in the Coombe maternity hospital, but there is room for improvement in many areas. Hospitals need more resources and the Government needs to be proactive in providing backup for hospitals to provide services. The hospitals are very busy, even though statistically there are fewer births than in previous decades. Given the closure of hospitals and cutbacks in budgets, hospitals are finding it difficult to deliver a service, particularly in supporting new mothers who wish to breastfeed. If they do not wish to do so, they should be helped as much as possible. I hope the Government will do as much as possible to promote this initiative. An official in the Department of Health and Children co-ordinates this policy but perhaps the Government will consider putting in place legislation to deal with the issue. The Limerick maternity unit tried to ensure that a formula would not be advertised by health professionals. This is done on a voluntary basis but perhaps legislation needs to be put in place.Children require good maternity services in order to get a good start in life. All the supports necessary should be provided for mothers. I do not have the figures for 2004, but the masters of two maternity hospitals in Dublin, the Coombe and Holles Street, indicated that their budget was cut in 2003, which is unsatisfactory. In 2003, the Coombe Hospital had the highest number of births since 1972, when it was encountering Government cutbacks. I hope this policy will not be continued by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Malley, and the new Minister for Health and Children.The national treatment purchase fund is a Progressive Democrats policy. While it is currently achieving some success, it is not a good long-term policy. It will do nothing to create extra beds, yet is using up valuable resources. If we are to solve the problems in the health service, much more needs to be done in the long term than buying services from the private sector.
#CamillusGlynn	unknown-#CamillusGlynn-party	unknown-#CamillusGlynn-dob	unknown-#CamillusGlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	275	I move amendment No. 1:To delete all words after "Seanad Éireann" and substitute the following:"commends the Government on its continuing substantial investment in the health services; notes the progress already made in implementing the health strategy Quality and Fairness — A health system for you; and endorses the commitment of the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children to achieving health reforms that will benefit all members of the community.”I cannot accept Senator O'Meara's comment that there has been a scaling down of investment in the public health service, which is not true. The statistics indicate the opposite is the case. For example, the funds invested have allowed the Government to hire 8,200 new nurses, 438 new consultants, 661 new occupational therapists, 456 extra physiotherapists and 200 extra speech and language therapists.I am a long-standing member of the Midland Health Board and a number of consultant posts have been approved and brought on stream in the past six or seven years. In 2000, a consultant physician, a consultant in the area of oncology, a consultant in the area of accident and emergency, a consultant haematologist, a consultant orthopaedic surgeon and a consultant radiologist were appointed to the Midland Regional Hospital in Tullamore. New posts approved by the board include a consultant in emergency medicine, a consultant anaesthetist — date to be confirmed, a consultant nephrologist, two consultant anaesthetists and a consultant surgeon. A total of nine consultants have been appointed in Mullingar since 1997. Documentation from the Midland Regional Hospital in Mullingar lists a consultant radiologist appointed as per the service plan 2004. In the past few years, Portlaoise has received three new consultants and consultants have been appointed in the areas of accident and emergency. This does not indicate that the Government has reduced investment in the area.The funds invested have gone a long way towards the largest hospital modernisation programme in our history. They have contributed to a dramatic increase in care places for people with disabilities and contributed to improving cancer survival rates and exceeding ambitious targets three years ahead of schedule. In 2003, almost 200,000 more cases were dealt with in our hospitals than were dealt with before we started our programme. This is clear evidence that what the Senator said is not true. In 2003, more than 1 million people were treated in the health system — real people, receiving real treatment for serious conditions. We also know there is a long way to go in many areas.Everyone recognises that funding alone will not and cannot deliver the health system people deserve. We have now published the most comprehensive reform programme in the history of the health service. Each element of the system, from primary care to acute services, has been analysed. A challenging agenda for delivering world class care has been set out. We are supporting a reform programme, which will make fundamental changes to health care in Ireland. Health reform is not just about changing structures, it is about accountability, planning, financial management and control systems. When we talk about financial management and control systems, we must ensure that when we put money into a system it will deliver and achieve results. I do not think anyone can criticise the incumbent Minister or previous Minister for ensuring that we get value for money. Crucially, it is about ensuring that funding goes to where it is most needed, namely, direct patient care.Everyone knows that reform is not an option, it is absolutely essential. The existing structures and work practices within the health service are 35 years old. As I said previously, we should not be afraid to push out the boat because the health boards have served us well.

Every week Senator Leyden goes on and on saying it is gone. The former Minister, Deputy Michael Smith, has publicly broken ranks by stating he is against it. We had the ludicrous scenario of the former Minister for Health and Children going around parts of the country such as Nenagh and Ennis a few weeks before the local elections telling people not to mind the Hanly report because nothing is going to happen.What is the status of the Hanly report? The Fianna Fáil amendment does not mention it, nor does it indicate that Fianna Fáil is in favour of it. The absence of Fianna Fáil Members from the Chamber does not augur well for it. They are obviously terrified to speak on this issue because they know the Hanly report is a disaster.Most people would have no difficulty in travelling a distance for elective surgery. Most people in Carlow would have no difficulty travelling to Dublin, Waterford or Kilkenny for elective surgery. However, they have grave difficulty with the withdrawal of their accident and emergency and acute services. Anyone who has had to use those services recently will not want to see them abolished. That is a fundamental flaw in the Hanly report.Coupled with that is the fact that we do not have people employed in the ambulance service who can administer the level of medical care that is needed. Other countries have a very highly-skilled, professionally-trained ambulance staff. We do not have that here. Our staff are trained only to carry out a very limited number of medical procedures. That is a fundamental flaw. The Minister cannot say that if the accident and emergency service is withdrawn from Kilkenny, it can provide a better ambulance service. I know of one recent example of a person in Carlow who started to choke when a piece of rasher got stuck in her throat and she had to drive all the way to Kilkenny. One can imagine how terrified she was. Imagine how she would have felt if she had had to go to Waterford, which is twice the distance. Let it be clear that people have no difficulty travelling for elective surgery, but they have great difficulty with the withdrawal of accident and emergency and acute services. That is the fundamental flaw in the Hanly report.The impression has been given that Mary Harney was born only six weeks ago and had no part to play in Government. She has been in Government since 1997. In Cabinet there is meant to be collective responsibility, although we did not see it today when Senator Morrissey and the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, were tearing each other asunder on radio. She was there and she approved the budgets. She cannot, therefore, blame the previous Ministers for Health and Children, Deputies Cowen and Martin. She bears responsibility. It is nauseating to see her carrying on lately as if she has had nothing to do with health over the past seven years. She had and the public are not so foolish as to believe otherwise.Last Monday week, having been appointed spokesperson on health, I went with Deputy Twomey to St. Luke's Hospital in Kilkenny where there was no one on trolleys in the corridors. That has nothing to do with Deputies Harney or Tim O'Malley.

There is a paediatric unit which children can attend with their parents. There is a day ward. However, there is no toilet in the ward and people must go down a corridor to access a toilet. I hope the Minister will take that on board and do something about it. There is also a minor injuries assessment area and a small dedicated accident and emergency unit.The hospital also works very well with local general practitioners in an effort to eliminate the practice of people coming into accident and emergency units except as a last resort. It is thanks to the dedicated staff at St. Luke's that we have an ideal example of what the Minister should encourage the Dublin hospitals to do. The Hanly report seems to be having a go at hospitals outside Dublin. If Mr. Hanly were being truthful, he would focus his attention on the Dublin hospitals because that is where the difficulties are, not in Nenagh, Ennis, St. Luke's and other hospitals outside the Dublin area.Recently, the Minister spoke about getting €1 billion extra in funding. The reality is — and I challenge the Minister to clarify this — that three quarters if not more of that funding will go on staff wages and administrative costs. Of the €1 billion we will be lucky to see approximately €200 million in extra resources for the health service.The health strategy published a few years ago referred to diagnostic health centres. There were to be three in the country. Carlow was in line to get one, given that it is the only county in the country without a general hospital. There were plans afoot for a private hospital in Carlow which was to have the diagnostic health centre attached to it. That idea seems to have evaporated.It is worth noting that my colleague from Monaghan, Deputy Crawford, tabled a question recently to the Minister for Health and Children which showed that the outgoing Minister for Health and Children had spent €30 million on nearly 150 reports, very few of which were implemented. I challenge the Minister, and Senator Glynn as Seanad spokesman on health, to organise a debate in the House in which we could have a progress report on each of those reports. I am sure we could do it in two minutes because they were published, put on a shelf and are now gathering dust.The abolition of the health boards seems to be the greatest farce of all time. The number of health boards has gone from 11 to four. The CEOs are still in place. The CEO of the South Eastern Health Board will be staying on for a further six months. Why are we reducing the number of health boards from 11 to four if the same administrative structures remain in place? What is the purpose of doing so? I have asked for the Minister to come to the House and explain whether there will be staff redeployment or staff losses within the health board. Staff working in the health boards are rightly concerned about their livelihoods. The public are also concerned that the plan to reform and slim down the health boards appears to be a myth and that there will be a more bureaucratic service, which they do not want.It is very worrying to hear the masters of the maternity hospitals say they are thinking of putting a cap on the number of patients during the summer months in the interest of patient safety. They announced that there are only nine delivery wards in the hospital and that one day there were 19 women in labour at the same time. In Limerick the staff levels are too low. There is one consultant for every 750 births when the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology recommends a patient-consultant ratio of 500:1. This has been going on since 1998, a year after the PD-Fianna Fáil Government took office. The Government has ignored the situation at its peril and it will come back to haunt it in the coming months.

I wish to speak about my constituency of Dublin Central, which includes the Mater and Temple Street Children's Hospitals. Some €16 million was invested last March in the project to relocate Temple Street Children's Hospital to the Mater Hospital complex, the most significant health service investment in the country. Some commentators cannot decide where the problems are but flit about without settling on any specifics. I have witnessed the effort and professionalism of the staff in Temple Street Children's Hospital. They are committed to providing a first-class service to the children of Dublin and elsewhere.The Mater Hospital complex has been allocated an investment of €600 million, which will provide for a new accident and emergency department, operating theatres, day units, outpatient facilities and on-call rooms. Earlier this year, a new heart and lung transplant unit was opened. These are concrete developments. I dispute Senator Browne's contention regarding a concentration on Dublin and I shall list some of the indisputable facts. There have been developments in cardiology and radiotherapy at University College Hospital Galway; a new oncology unit is in operation in Limerick Regional Hospital; Cork University Hospital has a new radiotherapy centre and a chest pain clinic; and there is a new medical assessment unit and additional beds in St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny.

One can talk all day about the problems that exist. As public representatives, we hear daily about constituents' difficulties with accident and emergency services and waiting lists every day. However, of the more than 1 million patients who were treated in our hospitals in 2003, some 83% found it a positive experience. We must give credit where it is due. Everybody agrees that immediate reform is needed and this is the objective the Government is implementing. We all hear the scare stories and everybody has a family member who has experienced the hospital service. Senator O'Meara spoke about services for the elderly. Significant resources are being invested in this sector to fund facilities such as housing, heating, home visits and so on. Senator Glynn mentioned the number of new physiotherapists. We can offer criticisms until the cows come home but that will not improve conditions for those people who are depending on health services.

The only issue which bothers many of us involved in the sector is the question of where this money has gone because there are terrible deficiencies in the sector.Senator Browne mentioned that Dr. Declan Keane, the master of Holles Street Hospital, has warned there would have to be a limit on the number of deliveries that can take place there next summer. I compliment Dr. Keane on informing young people of this nine months ahead of time because it casts an entirely new light on family planning. A woman hoping to conceive must ensure there will be a bed available for her in nine months time. It is interesting that the former master, Mr. Peter Boylan, advised patients not to contact the hospital or any doctors about this situation but to discuss it with their local Deputy. This is a serious political issue. There is a terrible shortage of beds in the maternity service, not only in Holles Street Hospital. There is an increased population, including an increased population of young people, and we are pleased to observed that, following a drop to 50,000 from 70,000 some years ago, the birth rate is again rising.The major crisis relates not only to the lack of accommodation within the hospitals for the safe delivery of babies but to the serious lack of midwives. Ireland is well below the United Kingdom recommendations on staffing in this regard. It is difficult to ascertain the number of midwives necessary to ensure good care for women, antepartum, during labour and postpartum, but we cannot seriously say that we have already achieved such levels. The expert group on midwifery education at graduate level is due to report shortly. The worry is that, if the group recommends we should train a given number of graduates here, there will be insufficient graduates to train until 2009 or 2010.There is a serious discrepancy in the number of graduates available to be recruited and the number that will be required. This problem is exacerbated by the change to a four-year degree programme from a three-year course for nursing, which means there will be no qualifying people next year. There will be a dearth of recruits to midwifery for several years after that. A pilot scheme was conducted in Trinity College which proved popular, with almost the entire class graduating. That scheme ended in 2003, however, and there has been no attempt to operate it again.It is astonishing to see the emphasis put on overseas recruitment because we know that we cannot recruit midwives abroad. This is interesting in the context of the debate which took place in the House this afternoon about trying to ensure that our registration arrangements are acceptable on an international basis. Many midwives who qualify outside the EU are regarded as obstetrical nurses and are not in a position to be employed here. We must be careful about these issues and cherish those people who qualify in this country. We are not doing this.I am sure Senator Brady is aware that the other day, 76 mature students graduated from the Mater Hospital but only 30 of them were offered permanent posts at a time when the master of the hospital has a dire shortage of nurses. When one hears of beds being closed in a hospital it is usually because there is a shortage of nurses. When one hears of operations being postponed, it is frequently because there are no intensive care nurses or operating theatre staff available. We have a serious situation regarding nurses. We are not cherishing them enough and are offering them only temporary posts. Is that being done to save on PRSI payments or such like? It is a serious issue and one we need to immediately address.We also have a crisis in our accident and emergency departments. I was interested to hear the Tánaiste's solution when she addressed accident and emergency nurses at a recent meeting. It is to set up treatment units run by nurses. There is nothing the matter with that, but where will we find the nurses? If we cannot find them to staff the hospitals in the established posts, how will we get them to staff the new units proposed to be, set up? At the same time we are concentrating on primary care and, as the Minister of State described earlier, many of the co-ops that have been set up are doing extraordinarily well.However, the Mater Hospital is in a crisis regarding its accident and emergency department. It is dreadful. I have seen people in the outpatient department being treated on trolleys and doctors treating people who were still in ambulances in the car park. The CEO of the Mater Hospital said that general practitioners in the area should try to do more to prevent so many people attending the accident and emergency unit, with which I agree.Why is the Ballymun health centre still unopened two years after it was built, long after it should have been commissioned and opened? There is a problem with the provision of heating and electricity in the old Ballymun health centre such that it is dangerous to use. The centre is allowed to employ more staff but it has nowhere to put them. Whatever sort of turf war is going on there should be resolved immediately. This is not the only case where this type of thing is happening. Good facilities have been built in many institutions throughout the country but they have not been opened due to the fact that they are not being commissioned or the hospital in question is not allowed to employ the necessary staff.Some Members may remember when I used to debate with former Senator Cassidy the position regarding the wing in Mullingar General Hospital, which had not been opened. As far as I am aware, that remains the position today.

We pay agency fees to recruit nurses abroad and we are not looked on kindly in the developing world for taking their best trained and most intelligent people. We should put a stop to that.There is also another development we need to carefully monitor. The other day a friend of mine, who was on a panel to recruit an orthopaedic surgeon in a town not far from Dublin, told me that not one Irish national had applied for the post. The Minister of State will remember the emphasis people who were working abroad put on the fact that they want to return to work in Ireland. This is not the first time I have observed that no Irish nationals applied for some jobs. It is because people are not being given the tools to work with or the facilities they need when they return to Ireland. Professor Aidan Halligan will not be the only one to say he will not come back here.

The Hanly report addresses the key issues of how to provide safe, high quality acute hospital services, 24 hours a day, seven day a week and to do so as the working hours of our junior doctors are reduced in line with EU law. In response to that, the approach is to provide appropriate services and procedures in local hospitals, including those claimed by some to be under threat. The proposals will mean a better service for patients.The Hanly report also recommends investment in local hospitals to provide more services for patients, including elective medical and surgical procedures, outpatient services, pre and post-natal maternity services and better access to diagnostic facilities. The report also recommends a full range of acute hospital services should be available within each region so that patients should not have to travel outside their region other than for specialised supra-regional or national services.At the core of the report is the retention of local access to acute hospital care. It recommends the decentralisation of a large proportion of the elective care and other services currently delivered in large acute hospitals to smaller, local hospitals. Properly resourced local hospitals can do much more and eliminate the need for people to travel outside their region for most procedures.Contrary to some reports, the Hanly report does not propose the closure of any hospital. Nor does it propose that any accident and emergency departments or maternity units should close. Instead, the report makes specific recommendations for reorganising hospitals in two health board areas——

I was a member of a local authority for a number of years and many resolutions for this area were discussed. I also share the concerns of the former secretary of LAMA. LAMA made a number of important submissions to the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, which represent a vital and constructive input by the local authority sector on proposed changes to Ireland's health board structures.The former general secretary of LAMA, Senator Bannon, stated that it was pointed out to the Minister that while LAMA recognises the need for rationalisation, it was also imperative that the public receive the best provisions available. I agree those remarks by Senator Bannon at the time. They are as true today as they were two years ago. It is imperative that we get good value for money. It is in all our interests to ensure that the best health service possible is provided throughout the country. I wish the Minister every success in implementing the proposed changes.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	340	I was taught in my days as a student in UCD that the job of management was clear: it was about planning, organising, staffing and controlling. It is the Government's job to manage the health service. Its members tell us, although I do not agree with them, that they have not controlled expenditure because they now admit, as the former Minister for Finance told us over and over again, that all the money went down a black hole. I do not share that view, but that is the Government's view, that it failed to control expenditure. It wasted money. That is what its members said. I could give them a reason for that. It is because they spent the money before they had a strategy. They had a lot of the money before they put together a strategy on how to spend it. That is not a great idea, but I do not believe they wasted the money.There has been a significant increase in staff in the health services. That is one of the jobs of management. It called for more staff, but it was mostly management staff. Who are they listening to when every middle ranking manager suddenly discovers that he or she needs an assistant manager and then the assistant manager also needs a secretarial assistant? If one wants to find out why someone decided something one must meet the secretary to the assistant manager who tells one whether or not the assistant manager is available who, in turn, will talk to the secretary to the manager who will then tell one when the manager will be available. That is the experience of health care professionals. When they discover that a ward, which was open last week is now closed, their first question is, "Who decided that?" No one in a health board can say who made the decision.The same will be true of the health service agency when it gets going, headless as it is at present. That is the job of management. No decision should be taken in the health service unless an identifiable person with management authority is clearly responsible for it. If they do not want to accept responsibility they should not be in the job and it is the job of the Government to deal with people who will not accept responsibility. Decisions are passed around from one to the other with no certainty as to who is responsible.Centralising into a super-agency will change nothing because the personnel who will manage the health services, as distinct from the people who deliver it, will be the same people who are in charge now, except that they will be accountable to nobody. There will no longer be any local involvement. Extra staff do not help because failure to control means that staff are not where they should be.The least said about organising and planning the better. How could anyone claim credit for planning who agreed the capital expenditure of €500 million to build new facilities and forgot that they would need to be staffed and equipped? Suddenly, there was a budgetary crisis because all these wonderful facilities were lying empty. That was management's failure.We must not get away from the fundamental fact behind a distortion of which people hid for a long time. We are not spending enough money on our health services. The OECD figures show that we manage to include certain services in health expenditure and, to a great extent, spend money twice. When the Government talks about care of people with disabilities, it cites the chunk of the health budget which goes on such services. When it talks about health services it puts that chunk back into the health services. The truth is that, comparing like with like, we are close to the bottom of the OECD table and we are probably at the bottom of the table of comparatively rich countries. In deference to Senator Mansergh, I will not identify our position on the world table of richest countries. According to the famous report in The Economist we are the fourth richest, but other people see it differently.We are among the lowest. The two indices of managing and funding the health service are both disastrous. There is no point in citing statistics about the extra numbers of this, that or the other. The measure is what the public get, and what they get is a mess. The fundamental cause of the mess is the lack of clear lines of accountability and responsibility and identifiable individuals who are responsible for budgets when those budgets are adequate.What level of genius was required to figure that if the country is experiencing an economic boom and draws in vast numbers of former emigrants or new residents, the birth rate would rise? What level of planning and insight was needed for this conclusion? The problem is not confined to the Department of Health and Children. The Department of Education and Science is still on the trajectory of a declining birth rate in planning primary schools. We are subject to the tyranny of averages. In some parts of Ireland we have big schools which are empty, while in other parts of the country, villages with four times the population are served by schools which were designed and planned for the days when people were fleeing from those places in vast numbers.The same issue arises with maternity services. I used to think we were doing extremely well in the area of infant mortality until I checked the figures this evening. In 1990, our infant mortality rate was 16th from the top of 29 OECD countries. In 2002, we were at the same level. Our infant mortality rates have progressed not a whit in 12 years of prosperity. We are still towards the bottom of the table. Our performance is not bad. By comparison with developing countries it is very good but it is not something about which to boast. To restrict funding to maternity services when infant mortality statistics do not show a spectacular success is close to scandalous.If we are to have a health service of the quality our people deserve we need a fundamental change in the quality of management at every level in the health services because management has failed abysmally. Our doctors and nurses are among the best trained in the world but our management is letting them down. Good managers must be provided with spectacularly increased targeted resources to deal with the problems. Otherwise, we will end up with the same miasma of waste and incompetence which has held back the development of our health services.

The people of Limerick should have a choice. I note the Senator's remarks. Many people in Nenagh and north Tipperary will note them also.Senator Tuffy questioned the validity of the treatment purchase fund. She should ask any of the 20,000 public patients who have had treatment paid for by the fund rather than raise it as an issue with which to beat the Government. Those 20,000 people are very happy with the service they have received. As a result of the success of the fund the Government is considering extending the system to take more patients from outpatient waiting lists. I hope that proposal will be acted upon to the benefit of patients.Senator Browne said the Minister for Health and Children had blamed her predecessors, Deputies Cowen and Martin, for deficiencies in the health service. I ask him to come here and tell the House when the Tánaiste made those remarks. I am not aware of them and I never heard her make those comments.I wish to put on the record of the House exactly what the Government is doing, the amount of money that is being spent and the success of the Government in this area. This year we will allocate over €10 billion to health care, an increase of almost €1 billion over 2003. This investment has ensured the employment of extra health professionals providing quality services to patients.In the past eight years, an extra 8,000 extra nurses have been employed in the health services. That is an average of 1,000 nurses per annum. Listening to some commentators one would swear that no new members of the nursing profession had been employed in that period, or that there was a deficit of nurses. An additional 500 consultants have also been employed along with an extra 1,800 other medical and dental personnel. We have also employed an additional 660 occupational therapists, 450 more physiotherapists and some 200 extra speech and language therapists.Some speakers castigated the Government and said much of the money was being spent on paying people but, obviously, if people are employed they must be paid. I have no problem in paying good wages to the many excellent personnel we have in the health services.These figures illustrate the extent of the Government's commitment to allocating extra resources where they will have most benefit — to staff providing services to patients and clients. The increased funding in the hospital sector is reflected in measurable increases in services. The number of patients discharged from hospital having been treated as either inpatients or day cases in 2003 was more than 1 million, an increase of over a quarter in the number of patients treated compared to the number in 1997.Many people do not yet realise that day activity is now a significant component of hospital-based care. There has been a substantial increase of over 80%, from approximately 243,000 cases to 447,000, between 1997 and 2003. That represents a major change in practice, which has provided a successful outcome. That is the way modern surgery is going to go with many more day cases being treated.In 2003, there were some 1.2 million attendances at emergency departments and some 2.2 million attendances at acute hospital outpatient departments. It is important to view the current debate about hospital services in the context of these figures. We have invested in services, provided thousands of extra health professionals and are seeing the benefit to patients in terms of increased services over the past seven years. There is no doubt that more remains to be done but it is important to acknowledge also what we have achieved.The Labour Party motion refers in particular to maternity services. It is important to set out a number of facts to set in context the debate on the availability of maternity care. In recent years, staffing levels have risen substantially in the three Dublin maternity hospitals. Medical staffing has increased by 25%, nursing staff has increased by 15% and health and social care professional staff has risen by 36% since 1998.The Government has acted to address concerns about capacity and infrastructure in a number of maternity hospitals. During the summer, the previous Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, approved proposals at the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street, designed to increase capacity in delivery rooms, theatres and neonatal intensive care units, as well as providing improved postnatal facilities for mothers and babies. He also approved the appointment of staff to oversee and manage the project, and the process of selection of a design team is under way.The Department of Health and Children has been working closely with the Coombe Women's Hospital and the ERHA to progress the future development of the hospital infrastructure in response to increasing demand for services. We have approved the appointment of a design team at the hospital to allow planning to commence on a new capital development, which will include an extension to the neonatal intensive care unit, upgrading the existing ICU, a new caesarean section theatre, a day assessment unit, an ultrasound suite, a parent craft-admissions unit, an upgrade of mechanical and electrical services, and ward upgrading. The estimated capital cost of these works is almost €20 million.At the Rotunda Hospital, a development which included the amalgamation of the paediatric and neonatal intensive care units, as well as the upgrading of postnatal beds on the third floor, was commissioned in 2003, at a capital cost of approximately €10 million.The Eastern Regional Health Authority has also been working with the three Dublin maternity hospitals to consider ways to address the increase in births — up by 8% between 1998 and 2003 — and to introduce initiatives that would alleviate some of the current pressures. These initiatives include the further development of community-based midwifery lead services, such as the Domino and early transfer home programmes.The Government has acted to develop maternity services in other parts of the country and to address specific pressure points. For example, the Mid-Western Health Board has recently been given financial clearance for a seventh consultant obstetrician-gynaecologist. A capital development is under way to provide an additional delivery suite, theatre and an extension to the admissions-reception area. These improvements are expected to be ready in early 2005.Work has also commenced on the development of new midwife-led units at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, and at Cavan General Hospital at a combined estimated capital cost of €1.5 million. This service will offer women greater choice and control within the maternity services. It is anticipated that these units will be fully commissioned early next year.The Government has provided additional revenue funding of €1.2 million to commission the new maternity unit at Letterkenny General Hospital in early 2005, together with equipping costs in the region of €0.8 million. The new unit will provide enhanced facilities and additional midwife staffing, as well as some increase in capacity.Construction work is continuing on a new amalgamated maternity unit at Cork University Hospital. Construction is expected to be completed by the middle of 2005. This new maternity hospital represents an investment of €75 million and will replace the existing facilities at St. Finbarr's Hospital, Erinville Hospital and the Bons Secours Hospital, Cork. The unit is designed to cater for approximately 7,000 births annually.The product of these investment initiatives in maternity services will be reflected not just in terms of expenditure, activity and employment numbers but also in the continual drive towards improving the quality of services provided. The Government is committed to the further development of maternity services in line with available resources.Accident and emergency services have been the subject of considerable concern in recent times. I, too, am concerned about the present situation and the difficulties being experienced by patients in accident and emergency departments. Patients should be treated with dignity and respect. It is important to put the provision of acute hospital services in context. Over the past two or three decades there have been numerous important advances in surgical technology and in anaesthesia. These advances have improved greatly the range, safety and effectiveness of the procedures that can be offered by modern health systems. Modern medicine has allowed us to live longer and have a better quality of life. As a consequence, however, there have been dramatic increases in the demand for treatment.Delivery of the emergency service at hospital level is interdependent on the inpatient elective service, day and outpatient care. The effective delivery of emergency services cannot be dealt with in isolation from the delivery of all hospital based services. A key conclusion of the Comhairle na nOspidéal report on accident and emergency services, published in 2002, was that a hospital-wide response was needed to meet the requirements of the emergency service. Improved processing of patients through the emergency department, via minor injuries units or medical assessment units, is but one aspect of the hospital-wide response needed.Earlier today, Comhairle na nOspidéal formally presented its report on acute medical units to the Tánaiste. This report recommends how acute medical units should be developed and operated to improve the experience of acute medical patients through the hospital system.In tackling the problems in accident and emergency departments it is also necessary to look beyond the acute hospitals and to examine the impact of primary care, non-acute care and community care on the accident and emergency service. We need to take a whole systems approach, which addresses the needs of people on a timely basis in the most appropriate setting. The Government has already introduced a number of initiatives aimed at improving the delivery of acute services and alleviating the pressures on accident and emergency departments.Improved and expanded accident and emergency departments are being provided. Recently, new accident and emergency departments have been provided at Cork University Hospital, James Connolly Memorial Hospital, Naas General Hospital, South Tipperary General Hospital in Clonmel and Roscommon General Hospital. The accident and emergency department at the Mater Hospital has also been refurbished and a new accident and emergency department is under construction at St. James's Hospital.Following a submission from the Eastern Regional Health Authority in June 2004, the Department of Health and Children approved proposals for short and medium-term actions to be taken to address the problems associated with emergency departments in the Dublin academic teaching hospitals. The cost of these new initiatives is €2.4 million in a full year and includes the appointment of a consultant in emergency medicine and specialist nurses, the establishment of rapid assessment teams and a clinical decisions unit, and the provision of multi-disciplinary teams to assess patients.Additional emergency medicine consultant posts have been approved. Some 51 emergency medicine consultants are now employed in acute hospitals, which represents a 260% increase since 1997. The availability of senior medical staff in emergency medicine departments should facilitate rapid clinical decision-making, and the enhanced management, diagnosis and treatment of patients.Pressures on the hospital system, particularly in the eastern region, arise in part from difficulties associated with patients who no longer require acute treatment but are still dependent. Funding of €16.8 million has been made available to the ERHA, which will result in some 600 patients being discharged to a more appropriate setting. Planning for the discharge of patients by acute hospitals and the liaison with the community services has been prioritised on an ongoing basis by the Eastern Regional Health Authority. Initiatives such as Homefirst, Slán Abhaile and home subvention are all contributing to providing alternative care packages allowing older people to be discharged. A total of €5 million is also being provided to the Southern Health Board under the delayed discharges initiative in 2003-04 to facilitate the discharge of patients from the acute hospital system.Increasing acute bed capacity will also have an impact on the delivery of emergency services. The Government is committed to increasing acute hospital bed capacity as indicated in the health strategy. Since 2002, funding has been provided to hospitals to open an additional 900 beds. Some 600 of these beds are already open and the rest will come on stream in later this year and in 2005.Notwithstanding the initiatives that have been introduced to date, the continuing difficulties and delays in accident and emergency departments are not acceptable. The Tánaiste has stated that the delivery of accident and emergency services will be an area for particular attention during her term as Minister for Health and Children. She has spoken of the need to identify the particular pressure points within the health system that affect the efficient delivery of emergency services. As Senators already know, the Government delivers. I am very confident that the Tánaiste will deliver what she has promised by way of a package of measures and initiatives to address problems in accident and emergency departments. She has promised that this will be done in the context of the 2005 Estimates, which are due for publication tomorrow.Any improvement in accident and emergency services, and in acute hospital services, must be strongly supported by increased emphasis on pre-hospital emergency care. The Government has been working to develop this area. Critical developments include a major upgrading in training and standards, the equipping of emergency ambulances with defibrillators and the training of ambulance personnel in their use, the introduction of two-person crewing and improvements in communication equipment and control operations.Currently, ambulance personnel are limited in the range of medications they can administer at the scene of an illness or accident. To address this issue, the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, announced policy approval for the development of the advanced paramedic training programme. Legislative changes are being progressed as a priority to provide a statutory basis for the administration by newly-trained paramedics of additional medications, such as cardiac medications, to patients. The new measures will mean that patients, wherever they live, will have equitable and rapid access to a wider range of emergency services. It is intended that this expanded service will start to roll out in 2005, following the completion of training of ambulance personnel.The ambulance service has an important role to play in the delivery of an integrated hospital service throughout the country. To this end, the Government will continue to focus on the development of the service and to ensure that the issue of ready access to treatment remains at the centre or our health policy.Considerable debate has taken place on how we should organise our hospital services. We face important challenges in developing a service that meets patients' needs quickly and effectively. While inevitably people will hold different views on how we can bring this about, we must acknowledge a number of critical realities if we are to agree on how best to move forward. These realities include the need to reduce the working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors and the importance of ensuring that patients receive the right type of treatment, in the right place, by a senior clinical decision-maker capable of making decisions without delay.In the debate about the future organisation of acute hospital services, it is important to remember that we are obliged to implement the European working time directive, which involves a considerable — and welcome — reduction in the working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors. We are already involved in a process aimed at reducing average working time to 58 hours per week. This is part of a longer term process to achieve a 48-hour working week for junior hospital doctors by August 2009, less than five years away.It is not acceptable for doctors to have to work 70 or 80 hours per week, or even more in some instances. Excessive working hours are not good for doctors or patients. We need to find alternative ways of providing services in our acute hospitals so that doctors can work reasonable hours and patients can be sure of a top quality service at all times. While this means considering carefully how we configure our acute services, it does not mean closing hospitals or downgrading them. Many hospitals have substantial scope for increasing the services provided, including those claimed by some as being in danger of losing services or closing. As far as the Government is concerned, we need to harness the potential of every acute hospital to provide the best possible service to the local community.We must decentralise as many as possible of the elective treatments currently provided in the larger acute hospitals to smaller local hospitals. At present, the larger hospitals tend to provide a very high proportion of all day-surgery and medical procedures. If properly structured and developed, the smaller local hospitals could take on significantly more of these treatments. This would greatly reduce the need for people to travel outside their own region for most procedures. Far from reducing the importance of smaller hospitals, the Government is committed to expanding considerably the services that can safely be provided within local communities. This will be to the benefit of all patients and will ensure that they receive as many services as possible closer to home.A second reality to be faced in the future organisation of hospital services is the need to provide much greater access to senior clinical decision-makers so that patients can receive speedy and effective treatment. We remain excessively dependent on doctors still in training and we have an insufficient number of consultants. This means that patients who could be diagnosed and treated quickly by experienced clinicians must, in some instance, wait for unacceptably long periods until their condition can be identified and dealt with.The Government is committed to developing a consultant-provided service, rather than one which is predominantly consultant-led. We need consultants to work closely together in teams, so that senior clinical decision-makers have a substantial and direct involvement in diagnosis, delivering care and overall management of patients. Achieving this will require change. It will involve more consultants and fewer non-consultant hospital doctors, and will require reform of existing work practices.We can and will make progress in developing our acute hospital services in a way that is in the best interests of patients. Whatever position we take on the future of acute hospitals, it is clear that the present situation is not satisfactory. We cannot continue with more of the same. Change is necessary, and we can achieve it in a positive way that benefits everyone. However structured, acute hospitals need to work closely together in recognised groupings, or networks, so that we can maximise the services that can be provided by each hospital. Every hospital, whether big or small, has a vital role to play. We need to stop talking about hospitals supposedly in danger or under threat and concentrate on how we can harness the contribution of every hospital in delivering quality services for patients.The initiatives I have outlined for the House represent tangible evidence of the commitment of the Government to the provision of high-quality, cost-effective, timely and responsive hospital services for all. The Government is committed to supporting and developing critical services, including key areas such as maternity and accident and emergency services. Let us move away from scare tactics and unfounded claims of downgrading and loss of services. Instead, let us have a debate about how best to work together to develop a quality health service for the future.

#FrankFeighan	unknown-#FrankFeighan-party	unknown-#FrankFeighan-dob	unknown-#FrankFeighan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	359	I thank the Labour Party Members for proposing this motion, particularly the call for the Government to drop the Hanly report and upgrade the accident and emergency services currently available in general hospitals around the country. The health service exists to serve the needs of the sick and injured and that must determine any changes, particularly those that might disadvantage patients.Many people oppose the report but there are positive aspects to it — at all times I highlight the positive and oppose the negative in this House. The proposal to concentrate accident and emergency services in centralised locations, however, is mistaken and would cause serious problems to people needing urgent care. When the Hanly report was first introduced in this House, a constituency colleague who was a former Minister in this Government was chairman of the Western Health Board. He had to courage to stand up and say that the report should be binned. I am disappointed that Senator Leyden's colleagues have not listened to him but he was right on this occasion. We disagree on many matters but I pay tribute to his vision of where this report should be. Perhaps he has signed the Fine Gael petition on medical services in Roscommon, he signs many things.It is the job of the Opposition to question and dissect all proposals in the report. We recognise the value of multi-disciplinary teams but the reduction of the number of hospitals delivering accident and emergency services from 40 to 12 is not safe or acceptable. The plan is an experiment and experiments in health service delivery cause suffering and death if they go wrong.The Hanly report spells disaster for Roscommon. It is anti-rural — we cannot replace a hospital with an ambulance service but we are supposed to be thankful for this. If a person in Roscommon has a heart attack, he or she must be driven to Galway because the hospital in Roscommon will be closed. Anyone who has travelled the road from Roscommon to Galway knows that it is not a super-highway. There is a golden hour following a heart attack but by the time a person reaches Galway and gets through the traffic there, that hour is gone. Patients could die on the road because even a first rate ambulance service cannot operate on a second rate road structure.Consultants at Limerick Regional Maternity Hospital have warned that they may be forced to turn pregnant women away because staff levels are too low to ensure safe deliveries. That does not reflect a state of the art health service. According to the hospital there is one consultant for every 750 births when the institute of gynaecology recommends a patient to consultant ratio of 500:1. This is a crisis waiting to happen. The last Minister spent his time producing reports. He was the Minister for fudge, always kicking issues to touch. The new Minister should act on the reports and not kick them to touch.The death of a 72 year old Monaghan man from a heart attack as an ambulance took him to Cavan General Hospital led to renewed calls for Monaghan hospital being put back in action as soon as possible. The Hanly report does not address the fundamental problems of bed shortages in major hospitals or the failure to provide suitable step down facilities that results in people spending too much time in hospital and not in the community where they should be.I wish the Minister well in her job because much relies on the success of the health service. The Hanly report goes about it in the wrong way. It is anti-rural.

There was an article in The Irish Times on 3 August 2004 on a report compiled by Dr. Peter Barrett of the Independent Reconfiguration Panel in Britain, which reviews contested plans for change in the British health service. He came to Ireland and had a look at the Hanly report and said he did not see anything in it to suggest hospital closures. He stated: “I saw a lot of suggestions that might modernise and change, but nothing about closure.” How much more is needed?
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	375	We never said that. There is nothing in Hanly about closure. It is about downgrading and loss of service.

Dr. Barrett went on to say that there was nothing in Hanly to prevent flexibility, local consultation, development of local services and the keeping of services locally, as long as it was appropriate and safe to do so. Again, is that not best for patient care? He further said that the perceptions reflected people's anxiety about change. The Opposition is anxious about change. Nobody likes change, but it must be embraced. Do not run away from it.I am sorry if I sound like a long-playing record but these are matters that have been pointed out from this side of the House time and time again.

Senator Bannon should read his report. The development of primary care and the ambulance service will, Dr. Barrett says, go hand in hand.

Is that not another reason to listen to more people such as Dr. Peter Barrett and let us have less of the terrifying tactics from the Opposition? The only good thing I heard Senator Browne say was his reference to Dr. Gary Courtney, a man I know well. I have visited St. Luke's and many hospitals during my five-year term on the Medical Council. I wish to God I could take every Senator out of this House and send them to some of the hospitals I have been in around the country. One would not bring a dog to some of them, they are so bad. However, when the Government tries to do something, the Opposition shouts and roars and beats the same old drum, saying in effect, "Let us hold on to this".

Dr. Courtney's blueprint is working well. I take my hat off to this consultant. It is also working in other areas. Senator Feighan said no one wanted to know about Hanly outside Dublin. I object to that. I come from the north west and we welcome Hanly. We are embracing Hanly in the north west and do not have a problem with it.Finally, I just want to raise a point made by Senator Ryan. He talked about infant mortality and said it was more or less the same today as it was 14 years ago, with little change. He had done some research in the Library. I question the research and the figures because no later than four to five years ago, UNICEF issued a report that claimed Ireland was one of the safest destinations in which to have a baby. I would like to ask Senator Ryan where he got those figures. I would love to have a good debate in this House, where we do not thrash out the same matters time and again. I wish Members of the Opposition, when they shout and roar about Hanly, would offer some alternatives worth listening to. Hanly is here as the result of an EU directive.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	388	I welcome the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children and wish her well in her new job. However, I would prefer to see her in Mullingar this evening opening phase 2B of Longford-Westmeath General Hospital, a project that has been in the pipeline for 11 years. The shell is built and nothing more constructive has since occurred I strongly support the motion in the light of the Minister's determination to implement the disastrous and life-threatening recommendations of the Hanly report. How many lives have to be lost before the current Government admits to the report's inadequacy and, more important, takes action to drop it? Whatever the fate of this report, questions must be asked and answered as to how a critically-ill man was recently taken away from, rather than brought towards, necessary emergency treatment. This man, Mr. Benny McCullagh, lived 500 yd. from Monaghan hospital and suffered a heart attack at his home. An ambulance arrived quickly and he was treated by the paramedics, but then farce took over. Instead of being promptly brought a few yards to Monaghan hospital the ambulance took him 30 miles to Cavan hospital. The ambulance driver was not to blame. His instructions forbade him taking the cardiac arrest patient to Monaghan. Whether Mr. McCullagh would have lived had he been taken to Monaghan hospital is not for us to judge, but he deserved every chance he could possibly get. This is what he and other patients are not getting.Quality and safety are mentioned over 100 times in Hanly, but if this is an example of how they are to be enforced, I tremble for the needy and vulnerable. In June 2002 the Government promised to implement a full range of measures to improve accident and emergency services, by significantly reducing waiting times and having senior doctors available at all times. However, the Hanly report intends to remove 24-hour accident and emergency services from the majority of hospitals around the country. Our accident and emergency departments are currently bursting at the seams. The Irish Nurses Organisation issues statements, almost on a weekly basis, to highlight the fact that its members cannot cope with the demands. This is happening in every former health board region. One has only to look in the newspapers or talk to any hospital nurse or doctor who will say they cannot cope with the levels of demand.

Canada ended up with a health care crisis. This was very evident, it was in the media and the Minister knows all about it. The result was partly due to the centralisation of services and the reduction of a 30,000 bed capacity. Centralisation removes local access and is socially disadvantageous for the young and, indeed, the elderly.Following Fine Gael revelations which showed that approximately €460 million worth of hospital facilities were lying idle because the Government had failed to provide the necessary funding, the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, miraculously came up with something like €85 million to open some of them. However, a great many were never opened, despite the promises made in the run-up to the local and European elections, and they still remain closed.

As the Senator informed us, an ambulance arrived within four minutes which compares very well with international standards. I wish people would not speak about downgrading hospitals as if to look after the elderly and those with chronic conditions were somehow less honourable and praiseworthy than to carry out spectacular surgery of one sort or another.I offer these reflections to the Minister as I have been in the business for a long time. I carried out a review of the Northern Ireland hospital system and produced a report which was very similar to Mr. Hanly's. The words used may have been different, but the thrust was there. It is unfair and unreasonable to encourage people to believe one can provide full accident and emergency cover at every hospital around the clock. I wish people would stop talking about hospitals and consider hospital and health systems in which so much more can be done at the primary care level to keep people out of hospitals. A great deal can also be done to get people out of hospitals and into more suitable care.At issue is the concentration of a small number of surgical specialties and cancer treatments. International experience does not support Senator Bannon's argument, especially in the context of cancer treatment. According to international experience, concentration improves outcomes and survivability.

Oddly, I found the converse to be the case in a survey of two or three hospitals in Northern Ireland where 92% of people attending accident and emergency units would not have had to be there if proper minor-injury units had been provided. If I were the Minister, I would put my money in that area as is being done in the United Kingdom where walk-in centres are proposed. Such centres will be staffed by nurses and general practitioners, removing a significant population from accident and emergency units.Even if one wanted to provide 24-hour accident and emergency services and high-level surgery in every hospital, one could not do it. It is not only a matter of money, one cannot get the people. If one could recruit the requisite number of staff, there is not sufficient workload to maintain their skills. An attempt must be made to organise the system in such a way as to concentrate some services while decentralising others, as permitted by modern diagnostic techniques. I encourage the Minister not to let the Hanly report go.

The Minister of State was very clear that the Hanly report represents Government policy and will be implemented. Now we know and need no longer listen to remarks such as those made in this House two weeks ago to the effect that I could stop flogging a dead horse and cease to talk about the Hanly report because it was a dead duck. The horse is not dead and the duck is very much alive and part of Government policy.

#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	437	One has only to read the Hanly report to know what this implies.I thank all Senators for their contributions and like Senator Maurice Hayes acknowledge that all Members are sincere in their beliefs on how the health system should operate. I hope people accept that about me. I believe fundamentally that the Hanly policy is disastrous. I disagree with Senator Maurice Hayes who says one cannot have an accident and emergency unit in every hospital. If accident and emergency services are removed from 26 hospitals as planned in the implementation of the Hanly report, many hundreds of thousands of people will have to travel long distances to avail of them. People's health will be put at risk.While there are people who say I am scaremongering when I say that, I ask Members to believe I am not doing so. I have read a great deal of literature and examined a great deal of research. I am especially concerned that the fundamental premise on which the Hanly report is based is not borne out by the statistics contained within it. The statistics do not show that larger hospitals produce better outcomes. They show the opposite. The cornerstone of the Hanly report says something entirely different. Despite that, the Government is determined to implement it. That is the reason I do not believe what Senator Feeney said. I do not believe the Hanly report is all about implementing the EU working time directive because there are many ways to implement it. One does not have to deprive whole areas of the country and put the health of many at risk to solve the problem of the EU working time directive, which we had long enough to consider.There are alternatives to the Hanly proposals which the hospital services action group will roll out in the coming months and at which I will invite the Tánaiste to look. They are well-worked out proposals based on some issues discussed in the Hanly report on team-building and so on. The fundamental cornerstone is that local access to acute hospital services is essential to maintain a health service that people need.The Minister referred to the distance between Nenagh and Limerick and getting to Limerick as if it was just a hop and skip. As it happens the distance is not great. However, the distance from Upper Church and from Thurles to Limerick is much longer and the road is bad. I agree that is not the worst part of the country in terms of roads infrastructure and access to hospitals but the west is in a much more difficult position. Some people say the Hanly report has nothing to do with Dublin but something has been neglected in this debate.

If Navan Hospital is downgraded more people will come from the hinterland of Dublin to use, for example, St. Vincent's Hospital. Given that Portlaoise and Nenagh hospitals have been downgraded there is no accident and emergency service between Limerick and Dublin. There is no accident and emergency service on the N7 on one of the major arteries of the country. There will be no maternity service between Galway and Dublin because Ballinasloe hospital will be downgraded.

course of investigating any additional matter under paragraph J(2) or a matter being investigated under paragraph J(1) investigate any other matter of which it becomes aware when it is satisfied that such further investigation is necessary for the tribunal to make findings on any such additional matter or a matter referred to in paragraph J(1) above.(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of these terms of reference the presentation to the Clerk of the Dáil of an interim report or reports, as the case may be, and of the final report on the matters identified at paragraphs J(1)(a) — (g), J(2)

decide:(I) to carry out such preliminary investigations in private as it thinks fit using all the powers conferred on it under the Acts, to determine whether sufficient evidence exists in relation to the matter to warrant proceeding to a public hearing if deemed necessary, or(II) not to initiate a preliminary investigation and-or a public hearing of evidence in relation to the matter notwithstanding that the matter falls within the tribunal's terms of reference, or(III) having initiated a preliminary investigation in private, and whether same has been concluded, but prior to the commencement of any public hearing of evidence in the matter, to discontinue or otherwise terminate its investigation notwithstanding that the matter falls within the tribunal's terms of reference.In

whether their age and-or state of health is or is likely to be an impediment to such person being in a position to co-operate with the tribunal or to give evidence to the tribunal in private or in public;(ii) the likely duration of the preliminary investigation or public hearing into any matter;(iii) the likely cost, or other use of the resources of the tribunal, of such investigation or any stage of the investigation into any matter;(iv) whether the investigation into the matter is likely to provide evidence to the tribunal which would enable it to make findings of fact and conclusions and-or to make recommendations;(v) any other factors which in the opinion of the tribunal would, or would be likely to, render an investigation, or the continued investigation into any matter inappropriate, unnecessary, wasteful of resources, unduly costly, unduly prolonged or which would be of limited or no probative value.(7) subject to paragraph J(3) any matter not brought to the attention of the tribunal or of which it is not aware by 16 December 2004 shall not be the subject of any investigation by the tribunal.'.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	455	The purpose of the motion is to allow an amendment to enable the tribunal to complete its work by 2007. This is significantly earlier than would be the case if the amendment were not made. Under the existing terms of reference for the tribunal, it is mandated to investigate any allegation of corruption associated with the planning process. The fourth interim report issued by the tribunal on 15 June of this year gave an overview of the work on hand. Although the tribunal was, of necessity, very circumspect in the language that it used, the report indicated that the tribunal still has a large volume of work on hand, which, if investigated in full, would require the tribunal to carry on until 2014 or 2015. There was some comment that it would still be in operation for the centenary of the 1916 uprising.The tribunal itself requested a change to its terms of reference to allow it a discretion not to pursue certain lines of inquiry. If Members check the original arrangement under which the tribunal was set up, they will note that it can request changes to its terms of reference. After the tribunal's request, the Government mandated the Attorney General to consult the tribunal on changes to its terms of reference, as provided for under the 1998 tribunals legislation. This is the appropriate contact point. The Attorney General was also asked to discuss with the tribunal the impact of the Government's decision in July of this year to apply a new scale of fees to the legal teams of existing and future tribunals.As I stated, the tribunal currently has a mandate to investigate any allegation of an act of corruption associated with the planning process. The major changes proposed, which are the subject of today's motion, will add a new paragraph J to the terms of reference. Sub-paragraph J(1) enables the tribunal to complete its current investigations into planning issues in Dublin, including the Carrickmines and Quarryvale modules and interlinked matters. Sub-paragraphs J(2) and J(7) provide for the introduction of two important deadlines. There were no deadlines previously.Under sub-paragraph J(7), the final date for receipt of any new complaint or request for investigation is fixed by the terms of reference at 16 December of this year, that is, 30 days from today. By 1 May 2005, the tribunal must decide what new matters on its books will be proceeding to a public hearing. After that date, no new investigation can be referred to public hearing by the tribunal.However, there were concerns that the tribunal could discover something during its investigations which it feels must be investigated to allow it to complete its overall report. An inflexible deadline should not tie its hands in investigating something like that. All Members would agree with this. For that reason, sub-paragraph J(3) provides that, notwithstanding the dates in the terms of reference, the tribunal will also be able to investigate something that it discovers if it is necessary to enable it to make findings on the matters it is already investigating or has decided to investigate.Sub-paragraph J(4) provides that the report or reports produced by the tribunal will be taken to be in full compliance with its terms of reference. Paragraph J(6) will enable the tribunal to exercise the discretion it sought in the fourth interim report on matters it proceeds to investigate, having regard to certain factors such as the age or state of health of people who are likely to be witnesses, how long the investigation will take, and the likely cost and relevance in terms of the overall cost vis-à-vis the complaint itself.I intend to bring a short Bill before the Oireachtas in the next few weeks to give legal backing to the discretion being granted to the tribunal to decide which issues to investigate within its terms of reference. Given the benefit of hindsight, it appears extraordinary that the tribunal currently does not have the discretion to reject an allegation. For example, if there is an allegation that someone improperly received €250, the tribunal would nonetheless have to go through a whole panoply of investigation, which would cost perhaps tens of thousands of euro. It is improper not to give this discretion to the tribunal. These changes to the terms of reference set a firm timeframe for the work of the tribunal. The tribunal has indicated that the changes to the terms of reference will allow it to complete its work by March 2007.In addition, the tribunal has now confirmed in writing to the Attorney General that it intends to utilise the power to sit in divisions when it is appropriate and practical to do so. This could not happen until after the hearings of the current modules. However, it is anticipated that the tribunal will begin to sit in divisions thereafter. The idea that the three judges should sit in a plenary session is not tenable. It is a practical suggestion that the tribunal should be in a position to sit in divisions.In order to help the tribunal to meet these new more challenging timeframes, especially to allow it to sit in divisions, the Government has agreed to the allocation of an additional seven legal persons to the tribunal's legal team. Initially it will involve additional cost. It should be looked at in the context of the shorter timeframe for completion of the tribunal's work of less than three years compared to a ten-year timeframe, as indicated in the fourth interim report. The Government has decided that the new fee scale for lawyers appearing at tribunals, which was approved by the Government in July 2004, will not apply to the tribunal until 31 March 2007.I wish to conclude by saying that I believe the changes being proposed today will allow the tribunal complete its mandate, in a more timely way, within a more certain framework. The changes will allow the tribunal reach findings and make recommendations to help ensure that the events it has investigated cannot occur again. I commend the motion to the House.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	456	The motion before the House is a product of discussions and agreement between the Government and Judge Mahon. It is not the result of an open and frank consultative process between the Government, Opposition and Judge Mahon. Why were there not more meaningful cross-party consultations on the matter? I understand the members of each party met with the Attorney General and the Government. It would have been preferable if the Government was more inclusive in its discussions. It would have given the Opposition a better opportunity to meet Judge Mahon. This is not to say that the motion, which proposes the speeding up of the work of the planning tribunal, is not welcome in principle because, if the current terms of reference remain unchanged, the timescale for completion of the tribunal's workload will be ten or 11 years.This morning in the Dáil, my colleague, Deputy O'Dowd, tabled two amendments. The first suggested that after each of the modules, the tribunal will conduct public hearings and issue an interim report. In the interests of openness and transparency, the tribunal must publish reports as soon as they are complete and not wait until a future date to report on issues which will have been in the public domain for a number of years.The second amendment concerns the legitimate request to the tribunal to provide the Oireachtas with recommendations on the effectiveness and improvement of existing legislation governing the important issue of corruption. I hope the Minister will consider the amendments tabled by Fine Gael. We had no time to table amendments in this House because I only received the amended schedule this morning.As a forum for receiving complaints about corruption, which have dogged this investigation, what does the Minister envisage will replace the Mahon tribunal? Despite its shortcomings, the tribunal exists as an official vehicle for dealing with complaints. It appears the door will be firmly closed in 30 days and the only recourse open to people will be the Garda. What proposals, has the Government to fill this void?The proposed cut-off date for complaints is 16 December 2004. Fine Gael is proposing the setting up of a committee of investigation to investigate allegations of corruption, which should be taken on board. In An Agreed Programme for Government, the Government made a commitment to introduce a proceeds of corruption Act, but it appears to have withdrawn from that commitment. People have mentioned this to me on several occasions. I would like the Minister to spell out the policy on the issue.In the fourth interim report, Judge Mahon anticipated that the tribunal would run until 2014. He now believes it will conclude in 2007, seven years earlier than scheduled. I am sure the Minister will agree this implies an extraordinary condensing of proposed investigations. It begs the question as to what has fallen off the wagon and what issues reported to the tribunals will not be investigated. It appears that Deputy McCreevy's proposed reduced fees will not apply to the agreed seven new staff members of the tribunal. Why are these people being paid exorbitant rates, which is causing widespread public concern? The principle of competitive tendering is not being applied in this instance. The cost of the tribunals since 1997 is a whopping €36 million, which is tantamount to legalised corruption. It is an issue which needs to be addressed because the general public are fed up with the costs associated with the tribunals. Perhaps the Minister will respond to these issues.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	457	I am pleased the Minister, Deputy Roche, came to the House tonight. This matter has received general approval and agreement. This move came from Judge Mahon and, as Leader, I would like to pay tribute to both Judge Mahon and his predecessor, Mr. Justice Flood, for the painstaking work they carried out. We all demanded and got the appropriate terms of reference for the tribunals. We laid down the salaries and conditions that would apply. Even though the changes Deputy McCreevy proposed will be introduced in March, to change salary arrangements mid-stream was difficult.We must remember that there was a demand for these tribunals to be set up. There was a further demand to appoint more judges and I am pleased the judges will make arrangements to sit in three separate streams in which they will be able to deal with issues in a concurrent way, which will be helpful to the whole process. I have every confidence that the professionalism shown by the Mahon tribunal will continue. There was an outcry when it was reported that the tribunals would not end until 2014. Everyone said we were suffering from "tribunalitis". My response was that everyone was crying out for the tribunals, they were provided and we should now get on with it. I have always felt that one should not comment on nor throw stones at them. The work, which goes into the tribunals is very professional and time-consuming.I share the opinions expressed regarding the costs of the legal team. The Minister said more members would be appointed to the legal team and that would be more productive and cost effective rather than otherwise.Countries around the world have come to grips with corruption. Many have had tribunals. Many have dealt with matters in other ways, depending on the country and how it views such issues. From now on, once this is over, such matters will be dealt with by, a commission. We passed legislation in the House setting up a commission, which will be quicker and better able to take on board issues that arise. There was concern that a tribunal could discover something during its investigation that it felt must be, investigated to allow it to complete its overall report. There could not therefore be an inflexible deadline. Sub-paragraph J(3) provides that notwithstanding the dates in the terms of reference, the tribunal will also be able to investigate something that it discovers if that is necessary to enable it to make findings on the matters it is already investigating or has decided to investigate. There are full safeguards in this as it is laid out.The Minister also consulted with the nominated representatives of the relevant political parties as the Bill was going through. The tribunal has now confirmed in writing to the Attorney General that it intends to utilise the power to sit in divisions. That is entirely correct. It cannot happen until the current module is over. Once it is, it will begin to sit in divisions.We cannot have this every way we wish. We demanded tribunals, which we wanted to be punitive, far-reaching and comprehensive. We got them, but as soon as we did people began to say they were too costly and we should not have bothered. Matters such as this have a price. The general tenor and conduct of our country has a price. The price is the tribunal and the professional people who sit on it. This motion is timely. It is neat and understandable. I commend the Government for the way it has handled this matter.
#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	458	I too welcome the Minister to the House. This is a timely proposal and we should be prepared to assist the tribunal in any way we can and pay tribute to it for the work it has done.These tribunals were great cathartic events in the life of the nation. They have done much to purify public life and, I hope, to restore credibility. However, the longer they are allowed to go on the less impact they will have and the more they will become a part of the furniture. It is important to bring them to a conclusion.I have two comments. One arises from Senator Bannon's call for interim reports. There is much to be said for that idea. It is very important that the tribunals name the people who are corrupt or guilty. It is also important to clear people against whom ungrounded allegations were made because of the way cases are presented; there is an opening statement in which all the dirty linen and allegations the tribunal sets itself to investigate are aired. It is not the fault of the tribunal, but these matters are broadcast publicly on the airwaves and they take on the appearance of fact so that there are people against whom allegations are made whose names cannot be cleared until there is a final report. A means of dealing with that relative injustice would be helpful.It is intended to bring a Bill before the House. However, the proposal to provide for the tribunal to investigate something it discovers if it is necessary to enable it to make findings on matters it is already investigating might be a bit narrow. What happens if the tribunal is investigating a case and discovers an appalling event relating to another case? Is it to pretend it did not discover it? It should be left to the tribunal, if there is a matter that appears to it to warrant investigation, to come back to the House and ask to be allowed to investigate it. The proposal seems to unnecessarily curtail the tribunal.I congratulate the Minister on this timely motion, which I support.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	459	I thank Members for their contributions.Senator Bannon made the point that the Government should have involved the Opposition in the discussions with Judge Mahon. This matter arose in the other House as well. It is simply not possible to do that because the two Houses of the Oireachtas passed legislation in 1998 that prohibits such an approach.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	465	The Senator should listen for once, and he will hear the truth. The Act makes it clear that the appropriate person with whom to interface or make contact is the Attorney General. That is the way the legislation was drawn. For the record, on the day I received the final draft of these agreements and put them to Government, I contacted the Opposition parties and the Attorney General and spent the best part of an entire day meeting and briefing the Opposition to the extent that it was possible. It is simply not truthful to suggest that the Government of the day is trying to prevent anybody being involved. I am not prepared to allow that to stand on the record. The Act, which we in our wisdom put on the Statute Book in 1998, has determined the modalities that deal with the tribunals.I ask Members to read the legislation in the context of the amendment motions. I was asked whether I would have accepted amendments. I would have if it were legally possible for me to do so but again if Members take the trouble to read the legislation that we collectively put on the Statute Book they will find we specifically provided that the tribunal must request any changes or that it must consent to any changes following consultations with the Attorney General on behalf of the Minister. The Minister does not interface in any way with the judge and it would be improper to do so. The appropriate mechanism through which any contact is to be made is through the Attorney General. It is an unusual role for the Attorney General because the Attorney General is appointed under the Constitution to be the legal adviser to the Government. However, on this occasion the Attorney General acts as a bridge between the Houses of the Oireachtas and the tribunal.It is untrue to suggest that the Opposition was in any way excluded. It was involved to the extent that it was possible to do so. The Senator may shake his head as much as he wants. The reality is different. I met four people designated by his party leader to discuss this.

He can check with his party leader. There were other contacts which I will not discuss here.The Senator also suggests that when the tribunal ends there will be nothing to replace it. That is not true. On the point raised by Senator Maurice Hayes, the existing power to establish a tribunal will continue to be on the Statute Book and it is a choice for the Houses of the Oireachtas if they want to establish another tribunal.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	468	I asked for a committee of investigation.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	469	If another issue were to be discovered, that would be one approach. The second approach, which Senator Bannon seems to have overlooked but which was mentioned by Senator O'Rourke, relates to the legislation introduced last year by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to establish commissions of investigation. This legislation draws on our experience of tribunals and allows for a much less convoluted or contorted approach to be adopted, an approach that would become less of a feeding ground for people in the legal profession. A more cost-conscious approach has been adopted. It is also worth remembering what we have done as parliamentarians to bind ourselves to rules of good behaviour. We have established standards in public office and a most transparent system for dealing with political donations. We should not always flay ourselves in the belief that Irish public representatives are behind in this regard. We have put very stringent procedures in place to deal with the type of corruption, which we discovered at the outset of this process.An issue, which was raised by Senator Bannon and about which there was significant criticism in the other House is that relating to legal fees. It is difficult to disagree with anything that has been said about the extraordinary levels of fees which are being charged. In reality, however, there are people who have invested a significant period of their lives in the tribunals. If the Government were to announce that their wages will be cut, which would be the effect of a unilateral introduction of the new fees, some of them might walk away. We would then be in the extremely difficult situation whereby the tribunals would be unable to complete the difficult tasks with which they are charged.We are trying to bring finality to something which has taken legs. The tribunals were put in place, and this one in particular, as a result of the revulsion that was felt both in the Oireachtas and by the public. Nobody had the prescience to predict that this process could continue for ten or 15 years. The Government's current approach was taken at the sensible suggestion of Judge Mahon in order to bring finality. We are introducing the necessary arrangements to give effect to the changes requested by the tribunal. That is all we are doing, nothing more and nothing less. It is simply not true to suggest that anybody in either House is imposing these changes. We are doing what the Act says we should do by taking a proposal from the tribunal and giving it legislative effect.I am grateful to the House for accommodating me today because I am anxious to get these arrangements through so we can look forward to a conclusion in 2007.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	472	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, to take this Adjournment matter on an issue which is very important to the people of County Longford. The motion relates to the community employment scheme to maintain Longford County Council's burial grounds under a cemetery maintenance programme. The council has applied to FÁS for a community employment scheme to replace the Longford jobs initiative scheme, which has been running for the last year, to maintain the council burial grounds. Employment for eight persons was granted, whereas an application was made for four times that number to maintain more than 50 cemeteries in the county.Regrettably, FÁS, the State training and employment authority, is not in a position to fund the Longford jobs initiative scheme. As an alternative to this scheme, Longford County Council has applied to FÁS for a community employment scheme. Unfortunately, while the opportunity to apply for such a scheme is broadly welcome, the scheme, as granted by FÁS, will not enable the council to provide the same level of service to burial grounds as heretofore.The Longford jobs initiative scheme provided valuable training for its participants and much needed support for local communities in improving and maintaining local burial grounds. I take this opportunity to thank those involved in running the jobs initiative scheme for their wonderful work in the past and for their respect for our deceased. Their efforts not only impacted on Longford people but aided tourists and those seeking their roots to avail of safe and well-tended cemeteries.Longford County Council has a limited budget available for financial support for community groups. I ask the Minister of State to ensure that the maximum level of funding is available to the council to set up and finance a cemetery maintenance programme in Longford. Longford has the lowest base in the country and some 7% of our funding is derived from rates. Longford County Council depends on capital grants from the Department for the funding of services. The eight jobs granted will make it impossible for a successful scheme to operate. Last year's level was the minimum required to continue this valuable service. Some 18 people were employed at that time and they did a good job. That level of service must be maintained for the benefit of the community.The stipulation regarding the over 55s is gone and the Minister of State might clarify the situation with regard to the three-year rule. Are people still excluded after three years? I hope the Minister of State will respond favourably and that I can bring good news home to Longford.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	473	I thank Senator Bannon for raising this issue and affording me the opportunity to clarify the situation. Following our recent appointments, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, and I reviewed current policy on the operation of the FÁS employment schemes, which comprise community employment, jobs initiative and social economy programmes. In undertaking this review, we have taken fully into account the views and concerns expressed to us by various interest groups and other key stakeholders, including the social partners, with whom there have been extensive consultations in recent months.On foot of this review, the Minister decided that a number of changes would take affect as and from 10 November 2004. There will be no compulsory lay-offs on the jobs initiative scheme and those participants who remain on the scheme will have their contracts renewed. People who leave the scheme voluntarily will be, replaced by community employment participants to support the service being provided. Likewise, there will be no compulsory cessation of social economy programmes, which play a valuable role in communities. In situations where an enterprise decides to cease activity, the employees affected will be assisted by FÁS in finding alternative employment. In addition, the three-year cap will be removed for community employment participants aged over 55. This category of participants will be eligible to participate on community employment schemes for a maximum of six years. In the case of people advancing beyond 55 years during their normal period of service on a community employment scheme, participation can be extended for up to a maximum of six years. The ring-fencing of essential services, particularly health-related services and drugs task force clients, will be maintained.The community employment schemes will remain as an active labour market programme with the emphasis on progression to employment. Despite the buoyant labour market, the continuing high level of inward migration and low unemployment, I am conscious that there is still a need for these schemes for people who find it difficult to secure employment. In 2005, therefore, there will be 25,000 places in total on community employment schemes, jobs initiative schemes and social economy programmes. These employment schemes have made a major contribution towards the provision of a network of valuable community services throughout the country. Equally, they offer participants the opportunity of work experience in a wide range of disciplines, which equips them in time to progress to full-time employment in the open labour market.I am happy to announce that funding for the particular community employment project sponsored by Longford County Council and referred to by Senator Bannon has been approved. Contracts have been issued to the council. The project is expected to commence by the end of November 2004 and the recruitment process has already commenced.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	474	Is there any possibility that the Minister of State might increase the numbers allocated to Longford?

#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	475	The principal difficulty heretofore raised with the Government by sponsors of schemes was that they tended to have approval for scheme numbers in excess of those, which were available in their areas. The raising of the cap related to those aged over 55 was meant to address that shortfall in eligible participants. I was not aware of the details of the numbers allocated to Longford County Council. I will arrange to have the matter examined and report directly to the Senator on it.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	476	I welcome the Minister of State to the House. This matter relates to a request for a review of circular 09/04 issued by the Minister and the Department of Education and Science last June. The date on which this circular was issued was inappropriate as the school year had come to an end. The circular's contents, dealing with the allocation of special educational teachers to primary schools, has serious significance for many schools throughout the country. The allocation of special educational needs teachers under the new arrangements is one teacher to 140 pupils in an all boys' school, one teacher to 150 pupils in mixed co-educational schools and one teacher to 200 pupils in all girls' school.We are told all children are equal and should be treated as such. This directive discriminates seriously against an all girls' school. There is a bias in it. There is no scientific basis on which the Minister or the Department can draw for this. All that has been done to date in this area was the carrying out of a special education census in 2003. If the decision is based on that census, it was unscientific. There is no justification for discriminating against all girls' schools as a result of it.We can all agree that a large majority of pupils in receipt of special education needs support are boys. I am not aware of a scientific study that would allow for the discrimination illustrated in the figures to which I referred. Principals of all girls' schools and their boards of managements have expressed concern at this differential, for which there is no justifiable basis.That more boys than girls were in receipt of special educational needs assistance, according to the special education census, is not a justifiable basis for a decision to allocate a special needs teacher to any school. There is a gender imbalance in this decision. If a decision on this basis is enforced, all girls' schools irrespective of their needs, which in a particular year may be greater than the needs of all boys' schools, will be discriminated against. Children who at present warrant special treatment will be deprived of it from September 2005.The only course open to parents, who believe their children are in need, is to revert to the courts and challenge the decision under the Equality Authority. We heard the former Minister say that we want to keep such cases out of the courts.The needs of children in any school should be the primary criterion when allocating special education teachers. It is fundamentally unjust for the allocation of such teachers to be connected to the gender of a child. The newly proposed system, if enforced, is unfair and unjust and cannot be upheld in those schools.I refer to the Presentation primary school in Tuam. It currently has five special needs assistants. That school is short a resource teacher and it applied to the Department for the appointment of such a teacher in June last year at which time it also applied for the appointment of an RTT, but it has not received an acknowledgement by the Department. Given that the Minister recently said she wants to appoint all the special needs assistants required throughout the country, how has the Department failed to respond to requests made a year and a half ago for special resources in those areas? This school in Tuam is not designated as disadvantaged. It beggars belief that the Minister would stand over discrimination and bias of this kind.I ask that this matter be reviewed immediately. We are led to believe that a review is currently taking place in the Department and visits are being made to schools to ascertain special educational needs, but it seems to ignore discrimination in this area in certain schools.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	477	I thank the Senator for affording me the opportunity to clarify the position of the Department of Education and Science on the new arrangements for the allocation of resource teaching support to primary schools, including the Presentation primary school, Tuam, County. Galway. The proposed new system for resource teacher allocation involves a general allocation for all primary schools to cater for pupils with higher incidence special educational needs, that is, pupils with borderline, mild and mild general learning disability and specific learning disability. The allocation is also intended to support those with learning support needs, that is, those functioning at or below the tenth percentile on a standardised test of reading and-or mathematics. An additional 350 teacher posts are being provided to facilitate the introduction of the new system.The proposed allocation mechanism is as follows — in the most disadvantaged schools, as per the urban dimension of Giving Children an Even Break, a teacher of pupils with special educational needs will be allocated for every 80 pupils to cater for the subset of pupils with higher incidence special needs; in all boys' schools, the ratio will be one teacher for every 140 pupils; in mixed schools, or all girls' schools with an enrolment of greater than 30% boys, the ratio will be one teacher for every 150 pupils; and in all girls' schools, including schools with mixed junior classes but with 30% or fewer boys overall, the ratio will be one teacher for every 200 pupils. In addition, all schools will be able to apply for separate specific allocations in respect of pupils with lower incidence disabilities.

#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	479	In the particular case of the Presentation primary school, Tuam, I wish to advise the Senator that, as a school with most disadvantaged status in the context of the urban dimension of Giving Children an Even Break, the most favourable ratio of 80:1 would apply.The rationale for a pupil teacher ratio of 150 pupils for every teacher in mixed schools to support pupils with higher incidence special educational needs and learning difficulties is as follows — the pupil teacher ratio for a learning support teacher was approximately 300 pupils, 10% of whom would be expected to have learning difficulties in the fields of literacy and numeracy. On that basis, approximately 15 out of a group of 150 pupils would be expected to have learning difficulties. This is considered half of a teacher's caseload. A further 3%, or four to five pupils, in this cohort would be expected to have higher incidence special educational needs and would expect to receive 2.5 resource teaching hours per week. This would account for the other half of a teacher's caseload.The rationale for the different pupil teacher ratios in boys' schools, where the ratio is 140:1 and girls' schools where the ratio is 200:1 is twofold. First, international literature on the incidence of disability indicates that, across all disability types, there is a greater incidence in boys than in girls; and, second, international and national surveys of literacy and numeracy have found that these difficulties are more common among boys than girls.The rationale for the level of support proposed for schools in areas of urban disadvantage is that evidence shows there is a significantly higher incidence of literacy and numeracy difficulties in areas of urban disadvantaged compared to other schools, including those in areas of rural disadvantage. It is important to emphasise that applications may be made for specific resource teacher allocations in respect of pupils with lower incidence special educational needs, regardless of gender, of pupil or status of school.The proposed system is intended to improve and streamline the special education resource teacher allocation process. The model will obviate the need for cumbersome individual applications, while at the same time ensure that pupils currently in receipt of service continue to receive the level of support appropriate to their needs. In that context, the additional posts being put in place represent a significant investment to ensure the success of the measure.Nonetheless, the Minister for Education and Science is conscious of difficulties that could arise in regard to the model, particularly for children in small and rural schools, if it were implemented as currently proposed. Accordingly, the Minister will be reviewing the proposal to ensure that it provides an automatic response for pupils with common higher incidence special educational needs. The review will involve consultation with educational interests and the National Council for Special Education before it is implemented next year.I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to clarify the position on this matter.

This is an important matter for the people of Waterford and the south east region. I have never seen a region so united on any issue as the people of the south east are on this one. The Irish Society of Medical Oncologists has made the following submission to the National Cancer Forum:The members of ISMO consider the development of comprehensive cancer centres to be the major cancer care requirement urgently needed under the next phase of the national cancer strategy. We recommend that these centres be developed at eight sites currently providing major cancer care in Ireland. These are Cork University Hospital, the Mid-Western Regional Hospital, Limerick, University College Hospital, Galway, Waterford Regional Hospital, St. Vincent's University Hospital, the Mater Hospital, Beaumont Hospital and St. James's Hospital.These are the experts in their field. They would not suggest this was the level of care required if they did not think it was in the interest of their patients and of the population in general. The society's submission is a balanced one, particularly in view of the fact that representation on the body which formulated the submission has a regional balance to it.The same could not be said of the group, which formulated the Hollywood report. It was largely made up of consultants and medical people from Dublin and Cork. They had their own agenda, which is only natural. If people from Waterford or Limerick had produced a similar report their bias might go in a different direction. The bias in the Hollywood report is skewed in a certain way. The Hollywood group also set out to justify the supra-regional concept, which is used in some larger countries. It will not work in Ireland because of our lack of infrastructure. The group should have looked at models in countries such a New Zealand and Norway.An attempt was made to keep the ISMO submission quiet. The Cancer Care Alliance submitted a freedom of information request and got what it thought were all the documents relevant to the Hollywood report. The alliance subsequently discovered that the ISMO document had not been made available to it. This is disturbing. Why was it suppressed? Was it because it went against the tenor of the Hollywood report? Were all the members of the Cabinet aware of this vital piece of information?There is a song, with the lyrics that "two out of three ain't bad." However, two out of three is bad for cancer care in the south east region. Waterford Regional Hospital's cancer service consists of surgery and chemotherapy but not radiotherapy. This is a nonsense. The entire range of facilities should be available together. The facilities for cancer patients in Waterford Regional Hospital are sub-standard. There is no proper dedicated oncology unit.There is a tremendous oncology unit in the University Hospital in Limerick. The mid-western region, which the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, represents, is also seeking radiotherapy facilities. The people of that region are right to demand that service. Given the size of the region they also should have radiotherapy but at least they have a fully functioning dedicated oncology unit. We do not have such a unit in Waterford.BreastCheck is turning out to be a joke. It was announced in March 2003 but I am informed that we are unlikely to have the service in Waterford until 2006. Once again, the people of Waterford are being treated as second class citizens. They are being told that if they want mammography they must go to Cork. This is not good enough.We were promised proper travelling facilities for people who had to access radiotherapy facilities in other areas. Recently I heard of an old man who was given a 7 a.m. appointment, which is not suitable for someone who has to travel. He was to have 26 daily radiotherapy sessions. He was told to take the appointment or leave it. The South Eastern Health Board did not have a transport infrastructure in place and had to provide a taxi for this patient. It is nonsense to say travel facilities are available or that access will be provided to other regions. It is not happening.The Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children has made great play of the additional funding she hopes to be given for the health services in the forthcoming Estimates and budget. She is right to tackle the problems in the accident and emergency service but there is also a serious problem in cancer care. Cancer is the only disease, which will touch every family in the country. One cannot say that of any other disease. I plead with the Minister to ensure that sufficient funding is provided so that proper care can be given to cancer patients.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	481	I thank Senator Kenneally for raising this matter on the Adjournment and for giving me this opportunity to set out the current position on the provision of radiation oncology services nationally. I wish to reiterate the position as set out by the Tánaiste, that the Government is committed to making the full range of cancer services available and accessible to cancer patients throughout Ireland. To this end, the Government will provide considerable investment in radiation oncology facilities in the coming years. The central aim is to ensure access by cancer patients throughout the country to high quality radiation oncology in line with best international standards.The submission referred to by the Senator was made by the Irish Society of Medical Oncologists to the National Cancer Forum in the context of the development of a new national cancer strategy and was discussed by the forum at its meeting in May 2003. The National Cancer Forum is the national advisory body on cancer services and is a multi-disciplinary group of experts, including representatives of all modalities of cancer care.The context of these discussions was the current fragmented delivery of cancer services nationally. In developing the new national cancer strategy, the forum's considerations have been informed by the broad strategic context in which the cancer strategy exists, a comprehensive review of the current status of cancer care, a review of the literature evidence concerning key aspects of the organisation of cancer services and a review of international models of care. The forum has concluded that the current arrangements for the delivery of cancer services are not generally in accordance with best practice and cannot be recommended to deliver best quality cancer care.As regards radiation oncology, the Government's policy is informed by the report entitled "The Development of Radiation Oncology Services in Ireland". The expert group that developed the report comprised a range of experts involved in the provision of radiation oncology in Ireland, North and South. Some of the leading experts in their respective fields were represented on the group, including radiation oncologists as well as physicists and radiation therapy expertise. Two patient advocate representatives were also members, one from the Irish Cancer Society and the other from Aid Cancer Treatment. The report has been the subject of significant national and international endorsement from organisations such as the Irish Cancer Society, the American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute in the United States.In developing its recommendations, the expert group undertook an extensive review of the organisation of radiation oncology services in countries such as Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia. The predominant view of the group, based on international guidelines of best practice is that radiation oncology services would be best developed in the context of a clinical network model of four large centres in Dublin, Cork and Galway, where new treatment centres have appropriate staff and equipment resources based around a minimum 4-6 linear accelerator treatment capacity. This report was discussed and unanimously endorsed by the National Cancer Forum at its last meeting on 17 September 2004, as the framework for the future development of radiation oncology services in this country.Significant progress is being made in implementing the recommendations of the radiation oncology report. Approval has issued for the appointment of an additional five consultant radiation oncologists and recruitment is under way. These developments will significantly improve access to radiotherapy for patients in the south east and elsewhere.As recommended in the report, the national radiation oncology co-ordinating group has been established. The group comprises clinical, technical, managerial, academic and nursing expertise from different geographic regions. The group's remit encompasses recommending measures to facilitate improved access to existing and planned services, including transport and accommodation. The group will also advise on quality assurance protocols and guidelines for the referral of public patients to private facilities.Funding of up to €l million is being made available to develop a national telesynergy network for oncology services. The aim of the network is to improve service delivery and efficiency, to better use consultants' time, reduce consultant and patient travel, and support earlier and better diagnosis.Radiation oncology centres will be required to provide services on an equitable basis which will ensure that patients of equal need will have equal access. Geography will not be a barrier to equal access. Radiation oncology centres at major teaching hospitals will be required to provide outreach services to hospitals in adjoining regions. This is currently the case and as more consultant radiation oncologists are appointed it will be necessary to ensure that there is an equitable spread of outreach services.The model proposed by the report on the development of radiation oncology services in Ireland will provide a framework that meets the following national and international standards: it will adhere most closely to World Health Organisation, US national institutes of health and gold standard of cancer treatment being delivered within the context of a comprehensive cancer centre model; it will enable the development of specialist clinical teams with both tumour-specific and technology-specific expertise; it mandates the development of more extensive and integrated multi-disciplinary care; it meets the stated and expected medical and paramedical training programmes and their associated national and international accreditation mechanisms; it facilitates the most rapid implementation of new radiation technologies, particularly those with significant complexity and expense; and, fundamentally, it will address the issue of access where a profound shortage of national treatment capacity no longer becomes the dominant limiting factor.I wish to reiterate the Government's commitment to providing the full range of cancer services for people throughout Ireland. In its decision last year on radiotherapy services, the Government remained open to the provision of a satellite radiation oncology unit in Waterford and elsewhere. The question of networked satellite locations will be kept under active review. New ideas and suggestions are continually being made and they are given fair consideration within the need to avoid a haphazard overall outcome.We are determined to deliver enhanced services for the whole population as soon as possible. We will keep an open mind on how this objective can be achieved, bearing in mind the recommendations of the expert group, and our objectives of achieving best clinical outcomes for patients and making services both accessible and available to all cancer patients.
