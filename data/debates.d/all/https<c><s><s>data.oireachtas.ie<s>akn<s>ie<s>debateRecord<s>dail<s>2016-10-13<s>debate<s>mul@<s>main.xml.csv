We are all aware of the housing crisis the Government continues to preside over and of the details of the all-party Oireachtas committee on housing. This Government has been very good on announcements, particularly in the social housing area, but it has been scant and very short on delivery. It may come as no surprise to anyone that while the Government talks about building social housing, the allocation for local authority housing budgets has been cut by 7% for next year. Today, more than 2,300 children continue to live in emergency accommodation. Home repossessions continue apace and to increase because of an Act that the previous Government passed, the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act. We have not done anything to stop families going into homelessness and losing their family homes. The lack of supply is still a very serious problem and is causing issues for house prices as well as for the rental market. As the Minister knows, the rents in Dublin and across the country are back up to 2007 levels. There is a situation right now in which a two-bedroom apartment in this city costs €1,750 per month, yet this Government expects people to be able to save a 20% deposit to buy a house. Getting on the property ladder is practically impossible, yet the Governor of the Central Bank is still refusing to do anything with the deposit rates that he has set down. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, has not been able to convince him that setting a ceiling of a 20% deposit for buyers in the market is next to impossible. It is ensuring that families, and young families in particular, are unable to get onto the housing market.For a €400,000 house, the standard price of a house in Dublin, if one is lucky enough to find one, a person will require an €80,000 deposit, yet the Government has failed to persuade the Governor that changes are required. The announcement in budget 2017 of the first-time buyer's grant initiative will do nothing but push up prices further. The issue of supply has not been addressed. Why would a builder or developer currently selling houses at €400,000 not increase the price? The Government has given them a blank cheque and those who will suffer are those who cannot afford to buy a house. That is why the issue needs to be addressed urgently. Is the Minister and the Government at all concerned about the impact the initiative will have on house prices? Will the Minister confirm if an impact analysis was carried out by the Government of how the initiative would affect house prices? If an impact assessment was carried out, will the Government publish it in order that it can be debated in this House?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23223	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	2	I welcome the budget housing initiative. There is to be a 49% increase in the capital allocation for housing next year, a significant investment that underpins the detailed action plan for housing issued by the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney. Action is to be taken under the plan across a range of areas. As admitted by the Deputy, it provides for the provision of 47,000 social homes. There are other initiatives to help builders to start to build, including the affordable rent scheme and the upfront payment for social housing within private schemes. We recognise, of course, that there is a housing supply problem. From my experience in my area, very few starter homes are being built. There are plenty of expensive infilled homes to trade up, but there is a real problem in the starter home market. In the light of the deposit requirement set by the Central Bank for good banking reasons, the Minister for Finance has made provision in the budget for a help-to-buy scheme. First-time buyers of new homes will receive a tax rebate of up to €20,000 which will be immediately reckonable in meeting the deposit requirement about which the Deputy has expressed concern. This will immediately help more young people to get into the starter home market. The Deputy can see with his own eyes that there is no movement in the market. An analysis has been carried out of its different parts and how they are moving. The starter home market is one in which there is low volume and no movement.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23223	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	5	The measure has been designed directly to help the very people to which Deputy Darragh O'Brien refers, namely, young people seeking to get on the home ownership ladder. They are living in expensive rental accommodation and find it difficult to put a deposit together. This is a measure which has been designed directly to assist them.

Has the Government carried out an independent impact assessment of its first-time buyer's grant initiative? If it has, will it publish it? This is not a help-to-buy scheme but a help-to-sell scheme. That is actually what it is. In the few estates being built in my area starter homes are costing approximately €430,000. Will the Minister indicate to the House that he is confident that the initiative will not lead to house prices increasing further throughout the country? We are certain that it will. The Government has set a ceiling, but it will give a €20,000 rebate on a €600,000 house. We should be seeking to set a cap and looking at construction costs, but the Government has no initiative in that regard. It has done nothing about development levies, certification costs, VAT on construction, off-balance sheet developments and other such matters. It could bring in the credit unions which could fund schemes to build affordable homes, but it has done nothing to stop families from falling into homelessness. The number of home repossessions is increasing day after day and the Government is not tackling the root cause of the problem. Has it had an independent assessment carried out and, if so, will it publish it? Will the Minister indicate to the House that he is confident that this initiative will not lead to further increases in house prices because the Government is not addressing the supply issue?

We continue to have a problem which the Deputy seems to ignore, namely, that young people are paying expensive rents and cannot put together the deposit the Central Bank, for proper reasons, has set. We do not want a repeat of the banking bubble, which is the reason the Central Bank has set down requirements. The Government is introducing a scheme that will help young people to provide a deposit to be able to purchase homes that are not being built at the moment.

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	19	After all the pronouncements about the universal social charge in Tuesday's budget package agreed by the Government and Fianna Fáil, a worker on €20,000 a year will benefit to the tune of €1.92 per week, while those on €30,000 a year can look forward to an increase of €2.88 per week and a person earning €45,000 a year can expect a whopping increase of €4.43 per week. Pensioners, carers, citizens with disabilities and others in receipt of social welfare payments will get a little more - a whole fiver per week - but not young people who are worth only €2.70 per week, according to the Government and Fianna Fáil. We have not been told exactly when people will receive these increases but the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, indicated it will be some time in March. As it happens, around the same time another group of citizens will receive an increase in their pay. I am referring of course to the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Minister, his colleagues in Cabinet and the Deputies in the Chamber today. Politicians will not be fobbed off with an increase of a fiver per week though. The Taoiseach is in line to get an increase of almost €5,000 next year, and a further €5,000 per year in the following two years, bringing his salary to an even €200,000. The Minister will not do too badly either, as he will receive almost €4,000 per annum for the next three years, or almost €12,000 in total. There will be no waiting, uncertainty or measly €5 for them. What of Deputies? In April 2017 and again in the following year, they will receive more than €2,500, giving a total increase of €5,200 over two years. This is not exactly fair, is it? This morning, we were told in some media outlets that Ministers will be asked to defer their salary increase. That is not good enough. A stop must be put to all these increases. When citizens are struggling that would be the fair, right and decent thing to do. It is once again a case of one rule for ordinary families and citizens and another rule for those who are in power. It is an example of looking after No. 1 while the rest can wait. The Government tells us this is new politics but it is the good old days again, which is perhaps not surprising given that Fianna Fáil's fingerprints are all over a budget once again. I have a simple question. Will the Minister assure the House that no salary increase will be paid at this time to the Taoiseach, Tánaiste, Ministers, Deputies or Senators?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23223	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	20	I thank Deputy McDonald for her question. I am surprised she is not praising the Government for providing an increase for 850,000 people who have not received an increase for eight years, including carers, people with disabilities, people on invalidity pension, blind persons and the unemployed.I would have thought the Deputy would particularly welcome the fact that, for the first time, we have a very strong, progressive Government, the budget of which will have a very positive impact in helping those who are paid the lowest, as shown in the ESRI's SWITCH model which does not even take into account the additional €8,000 that will be made available to parents availing of child care services as part of the very good initiative introduced by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone. We have a budget which is balanced and very fair. I absolutely agree with the Deputy that politicians need to take the lead in being more economical and that is what she will see from the Government. As she knows, we did not accept any of the increases during the term of office of the last Government. In the past few years the pay of Ministers was cut by 35%, as was right. We have also curbed expenses, done away with State cars and sought to make the Dáil a more effective workplace. That needs to continue and the Government will confirm next week that Ministers will not be availing of the proposed pay rise. Clearly, we are in a situation where we are producing a budget that seeks to address the needs of the country in a balanced way. There are, of course, those who are pressing for pay increases. In the budget we are offering an extra €300 million for increased pay, an extra €300 million for increased social welfare payments and €300 million in tax reductions. The Deputy is right to say these amounts will not have a huge impact in each individual case, but they are fair and balanced. They are being given against a background where we are recruiting an extra 7,000 people for services in the areas of health, education and policing, across all front-line services where there are really pressing needs. The budget takes a balanced approach to delivering for people, not just a sustainable path to achieving full employment but also fairness in a way that will help everyone. This is particularly the case for young people on lower rates of social welfare, to whom the Deputy referred. The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, has provided that they will receive the full rate of payment for participating in the Tús programme, back to education schemes and all of the other initiatives that can help to put them on a path towards finding permanent work. A lot of effort is put into building those pathways through traineeships and apprenticeships, in which we are again investing in the budget.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	21	Nobody with an ounce of common sense could claim fairness for a scenario where pensioners, older citizens and carers who save the State a fortune are meant to be thankful for being given an extra fiver a week, while, at the same time, those who hold the highest office in the land are in line for a bonanza in a pay increase. I hear the Minister's response that Ministers are voluntarily forgoing the rise, but that is not what I asked him. I told him - I put it to him again - that the Government had to put a definitive stop to all of the proposed pay increases. That is fair and the decent thing to do and is, I think, what is expected of us, as political leaders. That includes the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, Ministers, every Deputy and every Senator. I again ask the Minister to tell us if the Government will put a definitive stop to the increase, not provide for a voluntary pause. If it fails to do this, I want him to be aware that we will act to ensure the increases are stopped by way of an amendment, whether it be to the Finance Bill or enabling legislation.

Unbelievably, it is an agreement that has not been discussed or put to a vote in this Chamber. In reality, it has not seen the light of day in Dáil Éireann. It has been left to voluntary groups, community groups, trade unions, local authorities and non-governmental organisations to inform us of this matter and bring it to our attention. This far-reaching agreement is known as the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, the agreement that dare not speak its name in this Chamber. Fortunately, the public-driven awareness campaign throughout Europe has alerted us to what is going on. There are serious concerns being expressed by Germany, Austria, Hungary and Belgium, to name but a few of the countries, about the agreement. Moreover, the European Court of Justice is examining the EU–Singapore free trade agreement, another new generation deal intrinsically related to CETA. The ruling in this case which will be significant is expected in the spring and shall have significant implications and consequences for how CETA is applied. The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has acknowledged that the outcome of this case will have an impact on the scope of the provisional application of CETA. Effectively, the Government is planning to allow the Commission to sign up, in our name, next week to provisional application of the agreement and find out what this actually means in the springtime. I realise the Government is under pressure from the President of the European Commission, Mr. Juncker, although it did stand up to him in the case of Apple when it suited it. Mr. Juncker is on record as saying the credibility of the European Union's trade policy is at stake. What is at stake is the credibility of our democratic system if the Government allows such an agreement to be signed. In this regard, as the Minister is aware, a recent Red C poll commissioned by Uplift Ireland and which is of help to him informs us that 74% of the population of the country who still believe in democracy want a referendum not only on CETA but also on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP. Moreover, the Seanad has passed a motion calling on us not to sign the agreement and, more importantly, to uphold Article 29.5.2° of the Constitution. That article sets out that the State shall not be bound by any international agreement involving a charge on public funds unless the terms of the agreement have been approved by Dáil Éireann. Clearly, the agreement's allowing of businesses and companies to sue states will have serious implications for the public purse. In the circumstances, I am asking the Minister, as a democrat, not to sign up to it. Moreover, he should immediately instigate a frank and open debate in this Chamber.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23223	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	35	I thank the Deputy for her question. It is important to bear in mind that well over 200,000 Irish jobs are directly dependent on our trade. In the face of Brexit, which will put pressure on companies selling into the UK market, it is important that Irish businesses gain access to other markets such as the Canadian market. This is an agreement which has been negotiated between the European Union and Canada to allow greater entry to the Canadian market for certain products such as Irish dairy products which, as the Deputy knows, have been blocked. It would open the market to many other Irish companies selling manufactured and other goods. The Canadian market is a good one. It is one in respect of which there is a lot of common knowledge and understanding of the trading approaches adopted. This is an area in which Irish business will use the opportunities provided by the removal of non-trade barriers and the reduction of tariffs to allow Irish companies to create employment. That will be important in the coming years. We need a strong trading economy to enable us to work our way out of our current position. In principle, the agreements with Canada, the United States and other states are to be welcomed. Of course, as in any negotiation, we must ensure our interests are protected.Particular concerns have been raised about, for example, the dispute mechanisms surrounding investor agreements, which, I understand, have not been carried through into the Canadian agreement. There will be amendments to those sections and they have been agreed by the trade Ministers. This trade agreement will be brought before the House for debate in the usual way when its details have been finalised. That is the approach that has always been taken in these agreements. Under EU law, the European Commission is responsible for the negotiations and it carries them out in an increasingly transparent way. Cecilia Malmström, the Swedish European Commissioner for Trade, has made huge efforts to make sure that trade unions and community groups, for example, get access to those papers in such a way that they can understand what is being negotiated. However, in the long term, a trade agreement is good for a small, open trading economy such as ours. We need those markets, particularly in light of Brexit. We need to look at the detail of this agreement and not to leap to the conclusion that any trade agreement is bad. We depend on trade agreements, and many overseas companies invest in Ireland because of the openness that we adopt to trade. I, therefore, ask the Deputy to suspend her judgment on this until we see the final document and the opportunities it presents and we protect ourselves against any risks. There are always risks in any negotiation.

That is exactly what I am asking for, that we do not sign up to an agreement about which we know nothing but that we bring it before this House. Is CETA on such thin ice that it cannot withstand free speech and free debate? Is that what the Minister is saying in the context of new politics in this Dáil? I ask him not to sign up to this on 28 October, but to bring the matter before us so that we can discuss it. It is disingenuous of him to say that we need trade agreements and that they are good and to suggest that those of us who raise questions are not behind trade agreements. I am absolutely behind trade agreements and creating jobs in this country. In fact, there is a crisis in the regions because of a lack of jobs. This agreement has nothing to do with that. This trade agreement opens us up to neoliberal policies without any regulation. It opens up our public services and makes it extremely difficult for us, if we change Government in the future, to go back and bring public services back under public ownership. At the very least, if the Minister wants to stand by this agreement, he should bring it before us and let us discuss it in an open and fair manner. Finally, I was horrified to learn just before I spoke that it would seem a French MEP has been refused entry into Canada because he was to speak on this agreement.

Of course, there has been agreement which will open up sectors, so Irish food companies, including those in the Deputy's area, will have opportunities to trade into the Canadian market, which is to be welcomed.

As the Deputy knows, the agreement has been negotiated over a number of years, so the Minister is very alert to those concerns, as are other Ministers. Modifications have been made to the agreement to take into account public concerns. It will come back for ratification in the House, as normal, and the Deputy will recognise the value of it.

#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	46	Following this week's budget, we now have spending of €14.6 billion on our health services. That is a huge increase. It is almost 20% of total spending by this Government of taxpayers' money. We have one of the highest health spending ratios in the OECD but we continue to have some of the worst health outcomes. I acknowledge that there are many excellent outcomes and very good practices going on in our hospitals daily, but huge issues remain. The Minister's experience and that of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, who tried to divvy up the funding with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, means they understand the process. It is a headache. A sum of €500 million was already added in October by the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, whom I wish well in his post. Now €490 million is to be added to that.That is almost €1 billion extra this year, on top of an extra €1 billion last year. There is no accountability. Unfortunately, our outcomes are not improving especially at our accident and emergency departments. St. Joseph's Hospital, now called South Tipperary General Hospital, in Clonmel is a small hospital when compared nationally. It consistently has 30 or more patients on trolleys every day. The front-line staff are under enormous pressure. A long time ago, when the Minister, Deputy Noonan, was the relevant Minister, when there was agreement to amalgamate and move to Clonmel, we spent €20 million to upgrade Our Lady's Hospital in Cashel to a magnificent state-of-the-art facility and it lies idle. There are no lights on and the doors are closed except for some small activities during the day. It makes no sense. Why do our citizens have to beg for home help? People with intellectual and other disabilities have to beg and have to deal with HSE bureaucracy. There is something really bad with the bureaucratic system of the HSE. It is past time for this to be tackled. We need to get accountability and proper standards, and we need care for our citizens. That is a very basic right: we are not in a Third World country. Why are 24 year old mental health patients forced to lie in a psychiatric ward when they should be treated in the community? Mental health services were taken away from Clonmel without putting community services of any value in first. We are making these decisions. As we speak, in Clare and north Tipperary there is a review of our first responders and ambulance services following the closure of accident and emergency departments in Nenagh and Ennis. Now these will be taken away from us. We have Civil Defence and Red Cross ambulances trying to bring people to hospitals, augmenting the service of the HSE. I am asking the Minister, who is an experienced Minister, and his colleagues in the minority Government to deal with the layers of management in the HSE. We have 35% more managers in the HSE now than we had in 2007, right at the beginning of our crisis and all the suffering that went on. We have terrible outcomes and scandals such as the recent one with drug payment overcharging by a company, which just paid it back and nobody was held accountable. We need accountability in the HSE. I am demanding that the Government do it. The people want accountability but are not getting it. There are too many issues with people waiting for orthodontic treatment and everything else. There is no proper accountability or transparency.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23223	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	47	I compliment the effort of people working on the front line in the health service. It has been a very difficult number of years for them. We have had almost a lost decade in terms of investment in the health service when we would have been building capacity in key areas and that has not been possible. However, despite that and despite a near 10% reduction in the number of people working in the health service, the statistics reveal a 20% increase in the number of patients treated in accident and emergency departments. There was a similar increase in the number of procedures carried out, indicating that our hospitals and care services are delivering. However, we need to continue to invest and there are gaps, as the Minister, Deputy Harris, has made clear. This year for the first time ever, he will bring the HSE's budget in on target. He will do that next year. As the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, said in his budget speech, there will be very close scrutiny of the way in which health spending is being rolled out, with a precise eye to the sorts of issues the Deputy asked about: waiting times and the experiences of patients at the front line. Two specific options are being explored in respect of the Clonmel hospital - a modular-build extension, fitting out space in an area currently under construction; and in parallel the HSE will examine the potential for the development of a step-down facility in Clonmel. It is recognised that there has been an 8.6% increase in the number of people who have come to the accident and emergency department in this hospital in the past 12 months, which means there is increasing pressure on those services from growing patient need. The winter initiative specifically targets that hospital as part of the initiatives being taken to try to relieve that pressure. We will not solve a lost decade of investment in one or two years. This will take a systematic programme of reform and delivery. From the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and his predecessor, Deputy Varadkar, we have had a clear strategy to implement change within the health service and deliver better at the front line as well as a better working experience for those in it.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	48	I would like the Minister to correct the record. At the Government formation - he was there - we were told there was an overrun of €200 million to €300 million at that time. As he knows, the Minister, Deputy Harris, recently added €500 million. The Minister, Deputy Bruton, needs to correct what he said about it coming in on budget this time.We are looking in the wrong places. Fundamentally, the HSE has cannibalised itself and it is not fit for purpose. It is outdated and unfit. We cannot continue to throw money at problems; €1 billion extra last year and €1 billion this year is phenomenal money. I acknowledge there are good outcomes but there could be more although it does not help when the Government closes services in Nenagh and other locations, such as the backup services in Waterford, where patients were coming. We need to correct the record and not throw money at a dysfunctional outfit which is outdated and wasteful. The Minister said we wasted a decade but where was the decade of reform? I want a reply also on the issue of so many less staff in the HSE. There are front-line nurses and doctors, our best, brightest and educated, who will not work here. We cannot keep them in Ireland and they are being sought after worldwide. Why are there 30% more managers? There is a problem in the mushrooming of management while there are no front-line services. The lunatics are in charge of the asylum in the HSE and it is time they were reined in. I want the record corrected by the Minister that health is coming in on budget this year because €500 million has already been added, and with the additional allocation of €490 million it will be €1 billion extra this year.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23223	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	49	I understand the budget will come in on target. We will wait and see at the end of the year. I also understand that the provision being made this year for a €900 million increase will allow the HSE to develop a service plan, soon to be available to Members, that will show significant improvement in service across the board. The plan will be monitored very closely to make sure that it too comes in on budget and delivers the improvements. It will include the employment of 1,200 extra people at the front line. There are already 92 primary care centres and the plan includes a continued roll-out, with 30 more under construction and moving into place. That is the sort of long-term reform that would take pressure off the hospitals, see more patients treated within their own communities and have more access to home care support, which is the kind of environment in which people want to be treated. There is a real direction of reform but it will take time. I agree with Deputy McGrath that we have to monitor carefully that the money we put in delivers the results. One could see from the Ministers for Health and for Public Expenditure and Reform a very clear commitment that the monitoring will occur in the next 12 months and we will expect to see value for the money that we ask the taxpayer to put in.

#CarolNolan	unknown-#CarolNolan-party	unknown-#CarolNolan-dob	unknown-#CarolNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	51	I want to raise the issue of the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS. This service offers a wide range of supports with regard to behavioural and emotional difficulties, critical incidents in schools and in meeting the needs of vulnerable children. The service also has an important role in providing educational assessments and necessary reports in order to assist schools in identifying the needs of individual pupils with special educational needs. Under the current system these assessments are critical so children can access basic and vital supports and resources to pursue the best education. The Education Acts say that every child in the State should be entitled to a high-quality education, but how can they attain a high quality-education when there are not the necessary supports in place? It makes no sense. The practice we have is certainly not in accordance with the Acts. Since 2010 we have seen a cut in funding to the service from €22.5 million to €18.25 million in 2016. It was ironic that only yesterday in the Chamber we had Deputy Micheál Martin crying crocodile tears about the lack of funding for NEPS services, when it was Fianna Fáil that cut the services in the first place when it was in power. Fianna Fáil, despite all its spin, bluster and meaningless waffle, will facilitate the ongoing lack of investment by supporting budget 2017. The cuts in funding to the NEPS service have had a huge impact on children. As a former acting school principal I know only too well the frustration of trying to secure resources for children under our current system. I know the difficulties that schools face in choosing between the students with regard to resources. We are told that we can only refer one or two children for assessment in a particular year. I have felt the frustration and sheer disappointment of knowing that a child could achieve so much, and could achieve his or her potential with the right, basic supports. They cannot access these supports if there is not an assessment report in place, so the report is needed. We have a cruel situation where parents and schools that can afford it send the children for private assessments.Not every parent or every school has this luxury. Children from disadvantaged communities are left behind and in some cases they wait years for the proper supports and they fall behind and fall through the cracks in our education system. I have raised the issue on a number of occasions, most recently last week in the Chamber. The budget, supported by Fianna Fáil, allocates no additional funding to this vital service in 2017. How can the Minister possibly justify the lack of additional funding for this service in this year's budget?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23223	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	52	I thank the Deputy for raising the issue because it is very important. I assure the Deputy we are recruiting extra people to NEPS and it is within our provision. As part of the programme for Government we have committed to increasing the NEPS service by 25%. This year in the budget we have made provision for 900 additional resource teachers. This is specifically designed to reform the system so there will not be the same extensive reliance on the assessments to which the Deputy rightly describes as often having arbitrary access. The current system is highly dependent on these assessments and we will move away from them in a new model developed by Eamon Stack and the NCSE. The advantage of this model is that it will give schools a guarantee of the type of support they will get, based on the individual needs of the children. They will not have to rely on psychological assessments and will have other data to use to provide this allocation. This is a very progressive move, which will free up the services of NEPS to provide the type of whole school support for which it was intended. It was not intended to do assessments only: it was intended to support schools in their ability to deliver to children with special educational needs. I am proud that even in the recent very difficult years we got a 46% increase in the number of resource teachers for children with special needs and a 22% increase in the number of special needs assistants. This is a real investment and commitment by the Government to try to support these children. The new model, which frees up the NEPS resources to do more holistic support for schools, which will see an investment over the coming years in more NEPS staff, will be a win-win, with a better outcome for those children who depend on the services. It is an exciting programme and I am very glad to have been able to get the funding this year to commit to this roll-out, which will make a difference to the type of experience the Deputy had in her school in the past.
#CarolNolan	unknown-#CarolNolan-party	unknown-#CarolNolan-dob	unknown-#CarolNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	53	Why is the funding not mentioned in the budget? Too many children in the State need a report with recommendations to get accommodation in exams, and teachers need the reports to plan. I welcome the idea of the resource teaching model, and we will see how it will work, but the fact it will be nine months before it comes into effect is not good enough. Children are waiting. As it is, it is dire, and the fact they must wait another nine months for a service which may not work, and I have my doubts, is not good enough. The new resource allocation model should not be used to paper over the cracks caused by the chronic lack of investment in our education system. Educational assessments and other services provided by NEPS will still be critical to provide proper supports for vulnerable children and children with special needs. The programme for Government states a clear commitment to increase funding for the NEPS service, but it is not mentioned in the budget. I do not buy this and I do not accept it as an excuse. Sinn Féin proposed an investment of €3.5 million in our budget. Will the Minister commit to providing additional resources to NEPS, particularly for assessments? I know about this as a teacher, and many teachers have told me they do not buy into the airy-fairy notion of other resources being put in place which may not work.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23223	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	54	As I indicated, the programme for Government commits to a 25% increase in the staffing in NEPS and this is one thing we will implement. We are also trying to move to have less reliance on the types of assessments to which the Deputy rightly said disadvantaged children have less fair access. We are moving away from this high reliance. For example, we are simplifying accommodation of exams to make it easier for children who get accommodation at junior certificate to carry it into the leaving certificate. We are trying to free up NEPS to do the type of real work that needs to be done, not writing reports about submissions to get access, but to do work to support schools. At the same time, we are increasing the commitment to resource teachers.The material in the school to provide those children with the supports they need, therefore, will be increased and we will free up NEPS staff to do the work that was intended. This approach should be welcomed and I look forward to working with the Deputy at the committee on this roll-out, which will make a difference. We are committed to increasing NEPS staff in the programme for Government and this year we are recruiting within our existing provision.
#CatherineMartin	unknown-#CatherineMartin-party	unknown-#CatherineMartin-dob	unknown-#CatherineMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	55	I have just left the meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills where we had quite the discussion on an issue relevant to the Minister and to many junior cycle students and their parents as we near the end of the first term of the school year, which is the worry and uncertainty about the distinct possibility that because of the Government's ongoing dispute with the ASTI, thousands of students will automatically lose marks in their English examination next summer. Two weeks ago before the same committee, the Minister said he could not guarantee that students taught by ASTI teachers would not lose out on 10% of their English grade if the dispute affects their ability to participate in classroom-based assessments. As it stands, we have no confirmation from him that every junior certificate student will be assessed equally and awarded an equal grade for equal quality of work, regardless of the union to which their English teacher belongs, and this is simply not good enough. Alternative models are in operation, which could help solve this problem and provide a guarantee to students that they will not be adversely affected. For example, students who do not participate in oral examinations in junior cycle languages have their written examinations marked out of 100. This means students who do not take an oral component in a language examination do not automatically lose marks. This, or another model, may not be ideal but I ask the Minister to accept the urgent need to have a contingency plan in place. Such a plan requires a great deal of preparation. Will the Minister outline the steps he is taking to make sure these students do not suffer because of a dispute that does not involve them? The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform referred in his budget contribution to fairness and said we are on a pathway to a just and fair society. He said fairness is about investment in education and education is the bedrock of our society. He spoke about access to education and how it has transformed our society and he is right. As John F. Kennedy said, education should be the greatest equaliser of them all. However, for all the Minister's talk of fairness, it is essential that we realise that the most important investment is in our children and in our students and that fairness means we must, first and foremost, make sure they are all treated equally.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23223	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	56	The reform of the junior certificate is a huge investment in our young people and it is designed to ensure a much more balanced assessment of the way their learning is done and the way it is measured. Under the new approach, there will be a certificate of achievement, which will measure the projects they have been involved in across a range of subjects, thereby valuing intelligence of different sorts and not just the memory retention that is tested in written examinations. There will also be a classroom-based assessment which each student will write up and which will be examined independently by the State Examinations Commission, SEC. It will account for 10% of the overall mark while the conventional examination will account for the remaining 90%. The value of that approach is that it will allow teachers and learners to engage on subjects in a different way. I recently visited a school in Adamstown, County Dublin, and saw the value of it in teaching science and the way it transformed it. Students are doing projects and managing the understanding of science, not trying to remember what they learned three years ago and writing it down in a three-hour examination. This is something worthwhile. Sadly, the ASTI has decided that it will not allow the classroom-based assessment to be completed, a decision I deeply regret. This examination process has been set by the SEC and the integrity of the process involves three elements. It is unheard of for a trade union to decide not to allow children to sit part of an assessment pathway provided for them.Everyone in this House agrees that this pathway is the right direction, although perhaps not everyone else does. We have asked the ASTI to allow its teachers to derogate from the instruction that has been given, so that the English classroom-based assessment can be carried out and the young people sitting their junior certificate have access to that part of the examination. We need to be progressive about the way we teach and this is the right approach. We have invested in 550 additional teachers in this budget to support the roll-out of the junior certificate. Supporting teaching and learning in a new way, to progressively change the environment in which young people learn, is a very important element of the junior certificate. The Deputy stands up for the importance of education as a means to transform our society and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, whom she rightly referenced, recognises that if we want a fair and successful society, we have to value every element of our talent pool, not just the cohort who remember what they learned three years ago and can produce it in an exam. I hope the ASTI will allow pupils to complete the assessment system provided for by the State Examinations Commission.
#CatherineMartin	unknown-#CatherineMartin-party	unknown-#CatherineMartin-dob	unknown-#CatherineMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	57	In putting the question to the Minister, I was not asking him to defend the reform but to help the students and guarantee that they will not lose out on 10% of their marks in English. I hope the Minister can lead, prioritise, instil and inject a real sense of pressing urgency into the ongoing negotiations and that all involved will redouble their efforts to resolve the dispute but the possibility of negotiations failing necessitates having a plan B. The Government has a duty to the students and to the welfare of our young people to show foresight and see the consequences that might flow from its actions. It cannot flail from crisis to crisis without trying to anticipate the events it is putting in motion. The bottom line is that there is an ongoing dispute with the ASTI, which means junior certificate students are going to suffer. The Minister must find a way to level the playing field for these children. Next June, third year students will face their first State examination and no students should have to face that exam, to walk into the examination hall, knowing that before they put pen to paper, they are 10% down on their results through no fault of their own. The Minister for Education should not let that happen.

Last night I spoke about Enterprise Ireland and its team based in London. It provides support to clients to identify key business opportunities in the short to medium term, with advice on responding to the implications of Brexit such as improving competitiveness and reducing supply chain costs.Enterprise Ireland plans to intensify its international trade and investments schedule for the remainder of 2016 to include trade missions and events to Northern Europe, the USA, China, India and other high growth markets. Last week, EI hosted an international markets week at the RDS to provide Irish exporters with access to overseas markets advisers, which I attended. The EI strategy is to immediately strengthen Ireland's ability to penetrate other key markets so that we can sustain and grow exports and reduce our dependence on the UK. This will involve investment in programmes to ensure that EI clients have the finances, innovation and scale to grow on the international markets. The local enterprise offices, LEOs, are a key part of Government job creation and our regional enterprise development strategy. They are driving job creation and new business start-ups in every county in Ireland. During the first two years of their existence the LEOs supported the creation of 7,500 new jobs nationwide in small and micro-enterprises. This is real momentum. We want to build on that and to deliver and sustain more local jobs to communities throughout the country. The LEOs play a particularly important role in areas more heavily dependent on local sources of job creation as they would not necessarily benefit from IDA or EI clients. There has been much talk lately about the IDA not delivering for all counties. The IDA's reputation on the international stage is second to none. It is delivering many jobs for the country. For example, 640 jobs were created in County Clare last year by the IDA, which is the sixth highest number of jobs created country-wide by the IDA. I am delighted that the capital budget for LEO in my own area will increase by €4 million, or 22%, to €22.5 million in 2017. I have visited a number of LEOs and local authorities over the past few months and I intend to meet with more of them over the coming months. I want to ensure we are making the best use of additional funding.  Developing business ideas and building company capacity in start-ups is a key role of the local enterprise offices. Last year, the LEOs enabled more than 27,000 local businesspeople to avail of business training and more than 8,000 people availed of one-to-one-business mentoring. I am currently making provision to ensure that Microfinance Ireland can continue to provide finance for small companies for another five years beyond 2016. Microfinance Ireland has been very successful. The LEOs have a key role to play in promoting this scheme and they supported over 400 applications to MFI last year. Tomorrow is an important day for our young entrepreneurs in that it is the closing date for applications under the Ireland's Best Young Entrepreneur, IBYE, initiative, in respect of which a huge number of applications have been already received. This shows that this initiative is working. We must start from the bottom up. The LEOs have an important role to play in encouraging entrepreneurship and new start-ups. Through the provision of support for small new business we will grow employment not only in the regions but in every county and this, in turn, will drive recovery not only in the regions but in every community and county. I congratulate all young people who were successful in previous IBYE initiatives. The LEOs have supported more than 2,000 young entrepreneurs in realising their business ambitions. As I said, the application process closes tomorrow but a healthy volume of applications has been already received.  This budget forms part of the Government's three-year plan for our recovery. I believe our economy is moving in the right direction such that jobs will be created and sustained in regions in the coming years.

I welcome the fact that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has been allocated an additional €72 million. Specifically in my own area of responsibility in the development of sport and tourism, I am delighted that I have secured agreement from Government through the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for funding around the sports capital programme for 2017. I will provide further details of that in the coming weeks. This is of huge importance to me and other Deputies and to communities across the country. It is a programme that makes a tangible difference to communities in urban and rural areas. It is a labour activation measure and also a recognition by the State of the work that has been done by sporting organisations on the ground. I compliment and commend the work of the State agencies for which I have responsibility, namely Sport Ireland, Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland. There is competition for resources and there are challenges in the areas of both current and capital expenditure, but I am committed to working with the three agencies for which I have direct responsibility as well as the national governing bodies in sport and the representative organisations within tourism to ensure that we grow those sectors. Specifically in the area of sport, I draw particular attention to the work of Sport Ireland and my Department over the last number of months to prepare athletes for the Olympics and Paralympics. Contributing to the debate on the financial resolution is the first time I have had a chance to speak in the House since the games and I take the opportunity to compliment all of the athletes who represented us so impeccably in Rio. Sport Ireland and the Department are looking at the effectiveness of the high-performance programme and at Ireland's participation and performance at the Olympic Games. This will form part of our work programme for 2017. I am delighted that my efforts have resulted in the securing of the 9% VAT rate for the tourism and hospitality industry for the next 12 months. When that initiative was brought before the House initially some years ago, it was opposed for political purposes and the wrong reasons. It was opposed because of opposition for opposition's sake. The initiative has played no small part in the revival of the Irish tourism and hospitality industry and the creation of thousands of jobs in communities across the country. I welcome the decision of the Minister for Finance to continue with the 9% VAT initiative. It has returned a great deal to the Exchequer in terms of VAT, PRSI and PAYE contributions as well as other taxes by virtue of the fact that it is a stimulus to the tourism industry. It is regrettable that some of those who opposed the measure in the House when it was originally introduced as part of the jobs initiative do not have the courage to say now that they were wrong. They might use the opportunity to do that in their budget speeches later. Very few people have spoken about tourism but they might use their parties' time and their own time to say they were wrong to oppose the initiative. We have a tourism programme for 2017 which includes €109 million on the current side and €13 million on the capital side. This is very important in terms of growing the tourism industry. We have a vibrant tourism industry and we are developing brands that are enablers in terms of bringing people to the country to have a good experience. I cite in particular the Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland's Ancient East and the Dublin brand, A Breath of Fresh Air, but there is a great deal more that we have to do. There are three critical risks facing the Irish tourism industry as I have said publicly before. Brexit is an obvious threat but there is also competitiveness and political stability. I rank those in no particular order, but Brexit has its own challenges because tourism is an area which has contributed in no small way to the revival of the economy. It is a regional industry which has spread through every county. For my summer holidays, I was in the constituencies of both the Minister of State, Deputy John Halligan, and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle. Counties Donegal and Waterford have fantastic offerings, as do all our counties and there is an opportunity for people to experience that. The risks that exist are ones we cannot take for granted. I appeal to the industry on competitiveness. We must ensure that the visitor who comes to Ireland has an enjoyable experience and that our staycationer, the person holidaying at home in Ireland, also has an enjoyable experience so that we get the repeat business.We all remember what happened in the early noughties and do not want to go down that road again. That is one of the risks. Another is Brexit and the tumble in the value of sterling. The offering in places such as Scotland, the Isle of Man and Northern Ireland is something of which we have to be mindful as we develop our product. Stability is important in the development of tourism policy. The policy adopted by my predecessors in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, now Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, and the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ring, is critical in developing the industry into the future. There can be no shocks to the system in terms of policy. Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland are working off a blueprint. In the next few years we hope to have 250,000 people working in the tourism and hospitality industry. That is a major endorsement of the creation of real jobs in the real economy for real people who pay real mortgages and rear real children.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Breen, referred to job announcements. In Newcastle West, County Limerick, we were very fortunate recently to have an announcement of a long-overdue investment. It is almost 40 years since the last foreign company invested directly in the area, a company which is still in existence. It has been announced that Ortec is establishing a European manufacturing base in Newcastle West, with the creation of 110 jobs initially. That is very important and has been brought about by the climate created in the past few years which has made Ireland a good place in which to invest. The budget offers an opportunity which many other Deputies in the House in 2011 and I never thought would be possible within a five-year period. There will be an additional 2,500 teachers and 800 gardaí, as well as the allocation of €107 million for rural development. Farming organisations have welcomed tax initiatives and other incentives. There is the largest budget allocation ever for the health service, a €5 increase across the board in social welfare payments, as well as cuts to USC rates, a much hated tax introduced at a time when the country was on its knees. There is also support for first-time buyers, as well as a range of other measures across Departments in areas such as the arts, defence and agriculture.  We cannot have a programme-based recovery, section by section, unless we have a strong economy. Everybody in the House knows that the decisions taken in the past five years were very difficult, but it was the right thing to do. Can one imagine where we would be today had we not made these decisions? We would be in a very difficult position and not able to deliver any of the elements to which I referred, not to mention the improvements for which I hope to be responsible in my Department. There is no doubt that this is a new Government, but those in the cheap seats are being found out. It is very easy to criticise. In the aftermath of the general election there was an opportunity for people to tog off and put on a jersey, but some decided to run away. It was not the first time that had happened and it will not be the last. Those who signed up to support the Government structure in place have taken a risk because it is a political arrangement that has never been experienced since the foundation of the State. There are risks to the Government, but the principal Opposition party has behaved very responsibly. It has taken its duty very seriously in terms of the constitutional position of its members as Members of the Oireachtas, but that is where it ends. The rest of those in opposition have taken an à
la carte approach. Let us see their budget proposals and whether the figures add up. I refer to the Whirligig Witch and Mickey Mouse proposals that suggest we tax our way into oblivion in the hope the economy would recover. That is what Sinn Féin hopes they would do. In increasing VAT and the USC we would drive people out of the country, proposals Sinn Féin has conveniently decided to ditch. Those involved in the tourism industry have not forgotten what it proposed to do. Those involved in the industry in County Donegal are acutely aware of the benefits of the 9% VAT rate and the damage an increase in the rate would do to Ireland. They are also acutely aware of the travel tax and the other initiatives Sinn Féin opposed. Sinn Féin has seen what the Government has done. It is aware of the number of people now employed in Irish industries and the opportunities that have been created for them to rear their children in an environment which five years ago we never thought it would be possible to create. The alternative is stark; it is one in which the country would be sent hurtling back into the Stone Age.That is a place I do not believe anybody in this House wants to go.

I want to compliment the Ministers, Deputies Donohoe and Noonan, everybody that has worked in government and those in opposition who have behaved responsibly on this. This is a good budget. It will make a big difference as we grow the economy and society into the future. I compliment the budget and commend it to the House.
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	72	I understand I am sharing time with Deputy John McGuinness. This is a new and unusual situation for our party to be in based on the outcome of the last election, the position we found ourselves in of not being able to form a Government and yet being absolutely conscious that the people had given everybody in this House a mandate to form a Government and to govern. Our position was to support and facilitate a minority Government. This budget comes from part of that process specifically based on the confidence and supply agreement. To be fair, this budget is different from last year's budget. The budgetary process was somewhat more transparent. However, I want to put it on the record that if we are to go forward and facilitate future budgets, there needs to be greater transparency. My party had its normal parliamentary party meeting last Tuesday week, at which stage we were talking about an anticipated budget of in or around €1 billion. Later that week it became €1.2 billion, and on budget day it became €1.3 billion. The confidence and supply agreement set out our key principles and objectives and what our policy areas were. However, that was not a fair position to have left us in, that €200 million or €300 million of additional funding was going to come up in the budget at short notice. The processes need to be better than that if we are to have a meaningful input in the future. I took it badly personally because I was interested in contributing in a meaningful way, in particular having been involved in the housing committee and so forth. I want to say that at the outset. The process for future budgets needs to improve significantly. I want to acknowledge that this budget is different and its emphasis is different. We set out in the confidence and supply arrangement that expenditure in comparison to tax cuts would be at a ratio of at least 2:1. That has been surpassed in this budget. We talked about the whole area of fairness. Budget 2016 last year was a budget of €1.5 billion. This year's is somewhat less, as a budget of €1.3 billion. From the point of view of fairness, I want to put this on the record because it matters. In budget 2016, a pensioner received an extra €3 a week, which was about €150 per annum. Somebody who was on disability allowance, carer's allowance or other payments received nothing extra. However, if one was on a salary of €70,000, the USC cuts were worth almost €900 a year. If that is compared with this year's budget, the pensioner receives a fiver a week, which is about €250 extra a year. The disability allowance and carer's allowance received €250 extra a year. The person on €70,000 a year is receiving an improvement this year of about €350. It is a much fairer outcome. That is not to say that the increases are huge, but there is an element of fairness in this budget that was not in the last budget. The people on lower incomes, whether they are dependent on social welfare or lower incomes, are doing somewhat better than they had done in previous budgets. When I talk about fairness and the confidence and supply agreement, there was an element in it that there was supposed to be no shocks, surprises or so forth. Yesterday, the leader of the Labour Party asked the Taoiseach when the social welfare increases would come in and actually be paid. I was quite surprised to hear that there was no specific answer given. We have been led to believe in our party as part of the agreement and discussions that those payments would commence in the first week in March. I think that is unfair. If somebody is a worker, they are going to see their benefits, no matter how small they are and whether it is USC or so forth, from 1 January. They will see it from the beginning of the year and yet the Government is asking other categories of people to wait until March. There is an inherent unfairness in that and I believe that should be reviewed. I say that before the Social Welfare Bill is published and before we get into the depth and discussion that will go with it. In one week, between last week and budget day, the budget increased from €1 billion to €1.3 billion and I believe the additional funding should be looked at again to commence those payments on 1 January. I will refer to that a little further along as I go. Obviously the budget is underpinned by and based on economic growth. Targets are set out quite clearly in it. One of the biggest challenges and risks is around Brexit. Much talk has been made about it. Much talk has been made about Article 50 being triggered next March and a couple of years of negotiations. However, we need to get real. Brexit is happening today. Companies up and down this country, whether they are small companies, large companies or foreign direct investments, are making their decisions now. They are not waiting on this to be triggered in March and two years of negotiations. I listened to the news and sort of laughed at it this morning. It is the first tangible sign of Brexit in the UK as there is no Marmite on the shelves of Tesco because of a dispute over increases. In the real world out there, the issues around Brexit are happening and companies are making their decisions. There are opportunities to attract new companies and to secure the ones we have. My concern with the budget was that I would have liked to have seen additional resources made available to our State companies over the next couple of years, both to attract further direct investment that might be considering relocating out of the UK and to make sure that we secure the companies we have for all the right reasons. Yesterday, in the Taoiseach's speech, he stated:To help farmers deal with the fallout of Brexit the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, has announced a new loan fund of €150 million which will support highly flexible loans for up to six years for amounts up to €150,000 at an interest rate of 2.95%. It will be available to livestock, tillage and horticulture farmers. These loans will enable farmers to improve the management of their cashflow and reduce the cost of their short-term borrowings.I understand from the previous day that this is to be done through the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland. I am not a farmer so I reflected on it and thought of two things. Because this is an intervention targeted at one cohort, is that fair within the State aid rules? If we think it is important and imperative to do so for farmers, should we not be doing exactly the same for our SME sector? I would like that to be further explored. I believe there is merit in having a look at it. The whole issue of housing is something that I and other colleagues have been very involved in. Before the formation of Government, there was an all-party committee and we looked at things in some detail. I am not going to have an awful lot of time, so I want to refer specifically to just a couple of issues. The first issue is the grant available in terms of a tax rebate. The issue has to be looked at and the concern is whether it simply drives up prices. The aim all along was to assist a particular cohort of individuals who are working and have the capacity to repay a mortgage, but because they are in the rental sector at the moment, cannot save for the deposit. While the measure might address that element, it seems to be a very broad brush stroke and has the real capacity to increase the cost of housing. In my view, I am disappointed that there was not further detail on supply-side measures in the programme. There are two things that I wish to respond to specifically. We have met and had presentations from the Irish League of Credit Unions. It has been in negotiations with the Central Bank and the Department of Finance to make funding available through special purpose vehicles that would allow off-balance sheet funding for the construction of houses by approved housing bodies and local authorities. There was no mention of that in the budget or in the attached documents from the Minister. That is a key component that we need upfront. I was disappointed that it did not materialise in the budget. There was one element that really took me aback from the point of view of underachieving and not setting the bar high enough. I do not know if any of the Deputies present have looked at this, but CSO figures published earlier in the year show that up and down the country, there are hundreds of thousands of vacant properties. I am not suggesting for a moment that every one of them is suitable for occupation or whatever. However, based on this year's budget, the plan for the Minister and the Department is that funding of €6 million will be provided in 2017 to deliver 150 units under a new repair and leasing initiative, which will allow local authorities to provide grant funding to property owners to bring vacant properties up to a standard which can be leased for social housing. At a time of crisis when we need to front-load our initiatives, 150 properties are inadequate in my view.The figure is inadequate, given that there are thousands of such properties. In terms of a return on investment, 150 properties would not accommodate those in emergency accommodation. I know that it is only one element, but it is not half ambitious enough; therefore, we need to revisit the issue as soon as possible.  A series of additional funding measures was listed under the heading of "Compliance Measures" in the budget 2017 document. My concern is that the measures are conservative and background information on how the figures were calculated has not been supplied or, if it has - the fault might lie with me - I have not seen it. Approximately 10% of the €1.3 billion is to come from these compliance measures. I would like further information on them because, when one examines them, the section 110 and fund changes are expected to yield approximately €50 million, the measures to tackle offshore evasion are expected to yield €30 million, while the provision of increased resources to confront the issue of non-compliance is expected to lead to a yield of €50 million. As a former member of the Committee of Public Accounts, I know that when we have delved into figures in detail, the returns have been far greater. This issue should be examined because it underpins the basis of budget 2017 and reflects back to the fact that the increases in social welfare payments will not kick in on 1 January, as they should.
#JohnMcGuinness	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-party	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-dob	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	73	Budget 2017 is a case of too many cooks spoiling the broth. The money has been spread too thinly across the economy and citizens have not really gained that much financially. The other shocking part about the budget is that it makes no effort to deal with the structural issues we all face in constituencies and which are, therefore, faced by citizens. The €5 increase in social welfare benefits will mean nothing to many once the local authority deals with the increase in the context of differential rent. The increased income will mean a reassessment of means and part of the increase will be taken back by the State. This issue should have been tackled. For example, the local authorities could have been instructed that for those in a particular age group or income sector they need not take the increase into account. This could have been done, but it was not.  The other issue is that of medical cards. The medical card system is still a fiasco. Those who apply for a medical card are asked repeatedly for the same information. They supply the information required when they submit an application also on request. Despite this, they are still told it was not received. This is a structural issue. Furthermore, every cent of income in the household is examined. If the system was a little more reasonable in the case of those who have little or nothing, many applications for a medical card would be approved. This may present a difficulty in managing the economy generally, but we have to think of those who we are serving, many of whom have a serious difficulty in engaging with the State. They may not be IT literate and may have difficulty in completing forms or collecting the information required owing to their age or medical circumstances and this prevents them from receiving an early response to a medical card application. The onus is on us to ensure we make life easier for them. Similar to what I said about the €5 increase, the Government could have set different standards for the assessment of applications for a medical card. It could have allowed those most in need of one to escape the heavy bureaucratic hand now placed on every single citizen making such an application.  The disability sector has been neglected entirely in budget 2017. In my constituency funding is required for St. Patrick's Centre on Kells Road in Kilkenny to alleviate the problems in balancing its books, problems caused by under-funding for a number of years. There has been no structural change in approaching these long-term problems which will cause difficulty for service users and further difficulties for the State, but nothing has been done to solve them. It is the same old story; it is not new politics. In fact, an overall examination of the budget shows that it is proof that there is no new politics. It is the same old story, year in, year out, with window-dressing here and there to give the impression that we are very busy doing things differently, but nothing could be further from the truth. Let us face up to it: unless we get stuck in and bring about the necessary structural changes, the position will still be the same next year.  Deputy John Curran mentioned the credit unions. They have €7 billion on deposit which they want to put to work in the economy, but the Government and the bureaucracy surrounding it are stopping them from doing so. Why should they - the friends of the people - not be allowed to engage in the funding of the construction of houses or local businesses? What would be so wrong with that? In a time of great need for cash, there are those who say they have some and ask for it to be matched. They want to be allowed to do the work that is needed, but there is no immediate response. It is almost as if there is no crisis. There are 3,500 people on the housing waiting list in County Kilkenny alone, yet there has been no real response. There seems to be no great urgency to deal with the matter. Again, structural change is required. Perhaps a Minister might turn around or reverse the legislation or regulations governing the credit unions, engage with the Central Bank and allow it to happen.  There was no groundbreaking news for business in budget 2017. There was a €400 increase in the tax credit for the self-employed, but it is to be spread over 12 months. The Government needs to move beyond this and see what the real problems are. If a self-employed person goes broke an individual or a family is affected but there will be no income relief. There is no incentive for indigenous Irish businesses to create jobs. They need help and we should be giving them a vote of confidence. The self-employed created 800,000 jobs in better times. They have the capability and the ability to do exactly the same again, but they need the State to understand they are too heavily policed in terms of red tape and bureaucracy and do not have the necessary flexibility to respond to the issues of the day because they may not have the funding or the support of the State to do it.  There are jobs available in the hospitality sector and many other small businesses. An initiative to help them could have extended the life of a business on the high street and the main street of towns and villages. It could have given an individual the confidence to start a business or reopen a unit that had been closed down or gone out of business. The budget shows no vision or strategy for entrepreneurs in seeking to revitalise the communities we represent. It is as if we did not listen to the Small Firms Association or other such organisations. These organisations, like the credit unions, are willing to put their money where their members' mouths are and do something for the economy, but we ignore them. We did it in successive budgets and in the era of new politics, given that we now have a budgetary committee and so on, I would have thought these issues would have been teased out, but they were not. We have received no response.  There is still €45 billion of bad debt in the banks. Nothing has been done to help those in debt and to give those with the ability and the capability to do business and get on with their lives a chance to perform again in the economy.Until such time as we instruct the Central Bank, the bank we own, to perform that very task and deal with debt, our economic difficulties will continue. The same applies in the case of mortgage holders and we must also face up to that issue. Little or nothing has been done for families who are in debt and cannot bring it under control. They are being threatened with homelessness because local authorities cannot respond to the issue. Nothing in the budget suggests we have heard their story and responded to it. That is where the budget fell down. It maintained the status quo and did not address individuals and business owners who need help to get on with their lives. This is a shame because it demonstrates that there is no new politics and there has not been a response to the citizens of the State.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	74	Budget 2017 aims to make sure everyone - the employed and self-employed; retired people and people with disabilities; carers and those who cannot work; people living in urban and rural areas; and the young and old - benefits from the recovery. It is a prudent budget in which there are no giveaways and the changes are modest. Nonetheless, more than 840,000 people will benefit from the first increase in weekly social welfare payments since 2009 and 650,000 people will benefit from the €5 increase in the State pension.  The social protection package ensures the recovery will benefit everyone, with no one left behind. It sets out to make work pay through reforms to the PRSI system, including a new deal for the self-employed, and introduces a number of targeted measures to assist lone parents, farmers and school children. From March onwards, there will be a €5 increase in the headline weekly rate of the State pension, with proportionate increases for those on reduced rates and qualified adults. The programme for Government commitment is that pensions will increase above the rate of inflation and this measure delivers on this commitment. The Fine Gael manifesto commitment was to introduce a €25 increase in the pension over five years and we are well on track to deliver on this commitment. Pensioners will also benefit from the reductions in prescription charges being introduced by my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris. In the area of taxation, pensioners with savings will benefit from reductions in DIRT. In addition, the Christmas bonus will also be payable to pensioners in December of this year at an increased rate of 85%. The headline rate of weekly benefits for adults aged under 66 years will also increase by €5 a week. This is the first increase since 2009. Approximately 840,000 working age people will gain from this increase. "Working age" is a technical term and most people do not know what it means so allow me spell it out. It covers people in receipt of more than 30 different payments, including invalidity pension, disability allowance and blind pension; illness and partial capacity benefit; occupational injury benefit; widow’s, widower's and surviving civil partner’s pensions; one-parent family payment; back to education allowance; maternity, paternity and adoptive benefit; farm assist; carer's benefit and carer's allowance; pre-retirement allowance; supplementary welfare allowance; back to work enterprise allowance; jobseeker’s benefit, jobseeker's allowance and jobseeker’s transition payment; and employment support payments such as community employment, Tús and the rural social scheme. I note that under many of the proposals made by the Opposition parties, many of these groups would not have received anything and others would have received an increased payment of less than €1 per week. I was strongly of the view that everyone should receive the same increase in the same month. The €5 increase in weekly benefits is permanent and will apply from March. While it would have been preferable to apply it from the start of the year, to afford to do so would have required excluding certain groups, which I could not countenance, or the introduction of an increase of less than €5, which I did not want to do. If we are to recover fully and build a more prosperous country, it must be on the basis of social cohesion and a united society, not one in which groups are divided against each other, young or old, sick or healthy, workers or unemployed, disabled or able-bodied people. I have been encouraged by the understanding reaction of people to the delay in the implementation of the increase in payments to ensure their neighbours, other family members, friends and colleagues could benefit to the same extent. In total, almost 1.5 million people will benefit from the modest increases in the weekly rates of payment. The precise date in March will be announced on the publication of the social welfare Bill in two weeks. A social impact assessment of the social welfare budget package, which uses the ESRI SWITCH model on a non-indexed basis, was published today. It finds that people in the lower income quintile gain most from the budget 2017 measures in percentage terms. The ESRI recognises explicitly that this was as a result of the inclusion of the weekly rate increase for working age rates of payment. The budget is, therefore, a progressive one that provides modest gains for all. The ESRI analysis includes the tax package and it finds that while everyone experiences modest gains from the budget, as a result of the social welfare package and the inclusion of non-pensioners and pensioners, those on the lowest incomes gain the most in percentage terms. This is true for deciles and quintiles.  The self-employed is a diverse group which makes a big contribution to society and the economy. Budget 2017 expands the new deal for up to 380,000 self-employed people who pay PRSI at the S class. This group includes farmers, professionals, taxi drivers and tradesmen who will have new benefits extended to them from next year. They will also benefit from an increase in the earned income tax credit and the extension of entrepreneurship supports. From March onwards, class S contributors will be able to avail of treatment benefit for the first time, which includes free eye and dental exams, and contributions towards the cost of hearings aids and contact lenses required for medical reasons. In addition, and more significantly, self-employed contributors will be eligible for the invalidity pension. For the first time, this will give the self-employed access to the safety net of State income supports if they have a serious illness or injury that prevents them from working without having to go through a means test. As a result, self-employed people who become ill or are injured and cannot work will no longer be told there is nothing for them because they have savings, assets or partners with a job. They will be able to avail of the same non-means tested payment as employees. This will be available by the end of 2017, most likely in December.  There will be no PRSI rate increase in 2017. Some people called for self-employed persons to have the option of paying a higher rate of PRSI to receive more benefits. On this occasion, I have decided to extend benefits without asking the self-employed to pay an additional contribution. These measures are all part of the Government’s policy of making work pay and encouraging self-employment and entrepreneurship. A range of dental and optical benefits will also be restored. These will benefit all PRSI paying employees and the self-employed, benefiting approximately 2.5 million people. Subject to successful negotiations with dentists and opticians, which I hope will be easier than the negotiations with general practitioners, the free scale and polish of teeth and free glasses from opticians will be restored by the end of next year. The budget also includes a package of measures supporting lone parents to encourage them into the workplace and education and help to reduce their child care costs. All lone parents on the one-parent family payment, the jobseeker’s transition payment and jobseeker's allowance will benefit from the €5 increase in the weekly rates of payment. A new €500 annual cost of education allowance will be made available to back to education allowance recipients with children from the next academic year in September. This will help all parents, not only lone parents, to return to education. The income disregards for the one-parent family payment and jobseeker’s transition payment will increase by €20 from 1 January 2017, subject to the passage of the social welfare Bill. This will partially reverse previous reductions and encourage single parents to remain in or return to work. The increase will benefit lone parents earning more than €90 per week. For those earning €110 per week or more, it will increase the combined social welfare and earnings income by up to €15 per week. The single affordable child care scheme being provided by the Government will also significantly reduce the cost of child care for lone parents and is a step change in State support for child care.  The focus on children in the budget is on the provision of services, rather than income supports. Ireland already has the third highest child benefit payment in the western world. Where we fall down is on the cost of education and child care and access to services such as health and speech and language therapy. For this reason, resources will be focused on these areas in future. The budget includes the child care package I outlined, the extension of medical cards to all recipients of domiciliary care allowance and measures in education, for example, an increase in the number of teachers and special needs assistants and better and new school buildings. For my Department, the main budget provision for children is increased funding for school breakfasts.This includes extending the school breakfast programme to the new DEIS schools from next year. We are also opening the free breakfast programme to non-DEIS schools and up to 35,000 children in non-DEIS schools will benefit from free school breakfasts. This is in recognition of the fact the majority of children who are disadvantaged do not attend DEIS schools and very often attend a school in the parish next door. School breakfasts have been shown to increase attendance and improve concentration. There is also a special increase of an additional €10 in payment for guardians who take care of orphans or children who have been abandoned by their parents. As part of the Government’s commitment to rural Ireland, I am announcing the total reversal of cuts to farm assist, a programme which helps more than 8,000 farm families. The introduction of additional income disregards for farmers with children further ensures that farm families will benefit. At a time of falling farm incomes, it is essential we strengthen the safety net for farmers who are on the margins. Even farmers who do not qualify for farm assist have the reassurance that there is a strong safety net for them, should they need it. This is particularly important given, as I said, it is a time of falling incomes. Many of the farmers who benefit from farm assist live in remote parts of the country, with very limited prospects for off-farm income. In recognition of the crucial work undertaken in rural communities under the rural social scheme, an additional 500 places will be made available next year. This will bring the total number of places up from 2,600 to 3,100 in 2017.

The human tragedy which is unfolding in Syria, in the Mediterranean and, most recently, in Haiti is a backdrop to our contributions which we should all be mindful of in the course of this debate. I am pleased to say that Ireland is playing a front-line role in the international community’s efforts to address many of these challenges. Ireland took a lead role in last year's successful efforts to agree a new set of global Sustainable Development Goals to 2030. This year, Ireland was again asked to take the lead at the UN in discussions on the global migration challenge. Our naval personnel are to the forefront of essential search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean. Our peacekeepers are deployed in Lebanon, Syria and Jordan, helping to maintain stability in areas critically affected by the conflict in Syria. Irish volunteers and agencies are to be found across the world in the most difficult operating environments. These efforts are backed up by unprecedented levels of humanitarian assistance to the region. In recent days, I and the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, approved the airlift of vital emergency relief supplies to the besieged city of Mosul in Iraq and to the people of Haiti in the aftermath of a violent hurricane. We announced further funding of €7.5 million for the Syrian people, which will bring our total humanitarian funding for Syrians since this horrific conflict began to €62 million by the end of this year. This is our biggest humanitarian aid commitment for many years and we stand ready to do more where we can. Our hearts go out to the Syrian people and we strongly support the UN’s efforts to bring this grotesque violence to an end. We want those responsible for the carnage dealt with by the International Criminal Court. For the second year, the total allocation to official development assistance, ODA, has been increased. For 2017, the Government is allocating a total of €651 million for ODA, an increase of €10 million on the 2016 allocation. Of that, €486 million will be managed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for the Irish Aid programme, with a further estimated €165 million coming from other Government Departments and Ireland’s share of the EU development co-operation budget. Of course, it is Brexit which formed the immediate backdrop to this budget. In recent months, there have been considerable discussions in government about the potential impacts of Brexit and how we could best Brexit-proof the budget in an environment and backdrop where much remains to be clarified, in particular by the United Kingdom, and where a complex and multi-layered set of negotiations lies ahead. Our goals as a Government in these negotiations, and my particular goals as Minister, are as follows: to protect and advance the enormous gains made through our own peace process; to prevent a hard Border reappearing on this island and ensure the circumstances necessary for this island economy to flourish; to encourage an outcome which retains the closest links between Ireland and Britain, on the one hand, and the UK and EU, on the other; and to ensure a prosperous and well-functioning EU with a strong and prosperous Ireland at its heart. To this effect, a number of important steps have been taken or are under way. In respect of Northern Ireland, as I have made clear, the protection of the peace process is a central focus for the Government in terms of the negotiations ahead. I have spoken repeatedly of my commitment to protecting the invisible border across the island of Ireland. We are working closely with the Northern Ireland Executive. At the North-South Ministerial Council plenary meeting following the referendum, Ministers from North and South agreed to a Brexit-specific work programme between the Northern Ireland Executive and the Irish Government, including a full audit of key North-South work programmes. Our next plenary is on 18 November in Armagh. Last week, the Government approved a proposal that the Taoiseach and I convene an all-island civic dialogue on Brexit to give an opportunity to those affected by the vote to make their voices heard, both directly and through their representative groups and organisations. It will also provide an opportunity to map the challenges presented by Brexit and how they might impact on different elements of society and the economy on an all-island basis. The main output will be a report and a series of recommendations which will be used to help inform the Government's position on the issue of the negotiations. In preparation for the negotiations that lie ahead, a new EU division has been formed in my Department, headed by a highly experienced Second Secretary General and staffed by experienced officials reassigned from the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Given the complexity of these negotiations, measures are being taken also to reinforce the Ireland-UK, legal and trade divisions of my Department. This will be augmented by additional resources in our key missions in Europe, in particular in Brussels, Berlin, Paris and London. From a trade perspective, we are all acutely conscious of the importance of the UK market to Irish exporters. However, I have been working to intensify our focus on other markets. I believe we have the capacity for much greater market penetration in other EU member states and I am focused on that, but we are also looking beyond Europe’s borders. The next meeting of the Export Trade Council, which I chair, will take place on Tuesday and will focus on the Asia-Pacific region. I will shortly bring a memorandum to Government to advance the programme for Government commitments to introduce cross-sectoral whole-of-government strategies for Asia-Pacific and the Americas. Just one month after the referendum result, I joined the Minister, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, to announce an expanded international trade mission programme of 68 events to the end of this year, including 26 ministerial-led trade missions. Last month, I undertook an engagement with Enterprise Ireland in New York and, in the weeks ahead, I will be leading trade missions to France, the UAE and Saudi Arabia. In last few weeks, our mission network has supported three ministerial visits to the Asia-Pacific region, where high level political visits are crucial to deepening and strengthening our trade and investment relations. Our missions will continue to support and facilitate the ambitious programme of trade missions planned for the rest of this year in co-operation with Enterprise Ireland, whose work I greatly value. Earlier this year, I launched the economic diplomacy strategy that seeks to build on the consolidation of the Department's trade role in recent years by establishing a network of commercial attachés to extend the range and impact of our embassies’ activities in support of trade. This is being put in place in Mexico, Brasilia, Buenos Aires, Bucharest and Jakarta - locations where economic opportunities exist to be explored and where either there is no State agency presence at present, or, if there is a presence, it is a relatively light one. I use all opportunities as trade Minister to promote Ireland as a country to invest in and to trade with. I am just back from the UN General Assembly where I gave a strong message that Ireland will remain at the heart of Europe, will continue to be an English speaking gateway to a market of 500 million people and will continue to offer a business-friendly environment and a talented and adaptable workforce. I undertook a similar set of meetings at the Asia-Europe summit in Mongolia in July. I have engagements in Europe and Asia in the coming weeks where I will continue to promote our strategic interests. The budget allows my Department to continue with the innovation agenda for our passport services. Our modernisation process is underpinned by two drivers: a better service for Irish citizens and the need for ongoing adaptation to protect passports from exploitation by criminals. This year saw a huge rise in demand for passports, driven by a number of factors. There was a rise in the number of people travelling abroad, undoubtedly encouraged by the steady and sustained growth in our own economy and increasing confidence.In the period January to August this year, in excess of 600,000 additional trips were taken overseas by Irish residents by comparison with the same period last year. That shows an increase of some significance. The big increase in travel contributed to a big increase in the demand for the passport services. Added to this, the outcome of the UK referendum on EU membership led to a strong growth in passport applications from Northern Ireland and Great Britain. The overall increase in demand from Northern Ireland in the first nine months of this year compared to last year is 25%, with a notable increase from July onwards. In respect of applications from Great Britain, passport applications for the period January to September this year are up 40% by comparison with the previous year, having surged from July onwards and with demand in August 2016 almost 120% higher than in the same month last year. Meanwhile, we have a responsibility to protect the integrity of the Irish passport by ensuring that it cannot be exploited by criminals who target travel documents as a means of facilitating illegal activity, including money laundering. We have been using technology to improve our offering to Irish citizens. This time last year, I launched the passport card, a credit-card-sized travel document that can be used to travel to 31 countries within Europe. I am pleased that an additional €4 million has been allocated to the passport reform project in this budget. In the context of the budget, a priority for my Department will be protecting Ireland's strategic interest in the forthcoming Brexit negotiations, with a particular focus on the peace process. Other priorities include advancing Ireland's trade interests and continuing to modernise our passport service to ensure we can provide an effective and efficient service.Debate adjourned.

#MauriceQuinlivan	unknown-#MauriceQuinlivan-party	unknown-#MauriceQuinlivan-dob	unknown-#MauriceQuinlivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	81	Yesterday my colleague Deputy Pearse Doherty, Sinn Féin's spokesperson for finance, described the budget as profoundly lacking in any vision. I totally agree with him. It lacks any vision or any attempt to sketch out the most basic contours of what a fair Ireland could look like and what we might achieve. The Government, which remains in power only as long as Fianna Fáil deems it politically useful to further its own lust for power, squandered a real opportunity to produce an imaginative and progressive budget. Such a budget would have begun to grapple seriously with the enormous deficit we have in our shambolic public services. Instead, what we have is a budget that fails to tackle some of the most basic yet fundamental inequalities in our society. Any attempt to put in place the building blocks of a universal health service free at the point of access and based on need is obviously now not even on the back burner. It is totally off the agenda. There was no attempt to deal with the issue of educational disadvantage, class sizes, third level funding or the restoration of the Traveller education grant. With regard to capital spending on infrastructure, the budget has failed miserably. Bizarrely, the big-ticket item for the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in the absence of the announcement of a single new project is an allocation of €25 million in additional funds for the regional and local roads programme. As noted by my colleague Deputy Imelda Munster, our spokesperson on transport, "€25 million is a pathetic allocation for road improvements on secondary and regional roads." By the Minister's and his Department's own admission, we need €3 billion to bring regional and local roads up to a reasonable standard. Therefore, we need €580 million per annum to keep the network in proper condition. The Minister's allocation of €275 million per year will actually ensure that our roads continue to deteriorate after almost a whole decade of neglect. This is another example of the Government's disinterest in the maintenance and provision of infrastructure outside the greater Dublin area. The bottom line is that when we start to talk about investment in key public services, investment in infrastructure, capital spending, public transport, housing, education, training etc., Fine Gael and those propping it up do not seem to get it or care. All of the services I have listed above are considered necessary and, indeed, normal in European countries except, it seems, Ireland. It seems the political classes who run this State, including Fianna Fáil, could not care less about children sleeping in emergency accommodation, working families living in homeless shelters or the hundreds of thousands of workers who are left to eke out a meagre living while working long hours in poor, precarious working conditions. This is the very same political class that did, of course, look after itself. The Taoiseach and Ministers are in line for a huge increase in their wages, and Deputies are expecting a wage rise of €5,000 over the next two years. Sinn Féin opposes this.

#MauriceQuinlivan	unknown-#MauriceQuinlivan-party	unknown-#MauriceQuinlivan-dob	unknown-#MauriceQuinlivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	83	We will introduce legislation to change that if we get the opportunity. The pay hike came exactly the same week that the Government, including the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, announced it had accepted the recommendation of the Low Pay Commission that workers on the minimum wage should get a 10 cent increase. How fair is that? Deputies are expecting a raise of over €5,000 and we offer those on the minimum wage 10 cent. It is difficult to find words to describe this paltry and disgraceful recommendation other than to say that it is an insult to workers and a supreme example of the gross hypocrisy at the heart of our political establishment. This hypocrisy and gross indifference continue when it comes to young people who happen to find themselves on jobseeker's allowance. If Fianna Fáil's phoney concerns for young jobseekers were genuine, it should have raised them while writing the budget for 2017 with Fine Gael. It is a bit rich for Fianna Fáil to be crying crocodile tears now over the tiny increase young jobseekers will receive when it itself had a central role in negotiating and drafting the budget. This is a Fianna Fáil-Fine Gael budget; one should make no mistake about that. Fianna Fáil agreed to the budget that was announced this week, including the increase for jobseekers. Perhaps Fianna Fáil has only now realised that this is an issue.  Sinn Féin remains consistent in its call for the full restoration of the jobseeker's payment for all recipients regardless of age. In our alternative budget, we included a €40 increase in the payment for the under-26s as part of the restoration. I did not see this in Fianna Fáil's half-hearted, uncosted so-called "alternative budget". Does that party believe it is acceptable to abandon young people, some of whom are our most vulnerable? I have first-hand experience of the impact of poverty and the neglect of young people on communities and society. Forty thousand of the young people on the live register are under 26. Of them, 1,625 live in Limerick and are depending on the State for their income. Shame on Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael and the Independents who support them for producing this pathetic budget. On the allocation to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, budget 2017 saw a 10% increase in the Department's capital allocation to bring it to €555 million. This includes €52 million supposedly to support job creation and innovation and assist Irish companies to respond to Brexit. This is simply not enough. As pointed out by a number of speakers already, Brexit is happening now. Jobs are at risk as we speak. Most stakeholders will state the currency challenges and drop in sterling have already threatened 7,000 jobs in the food export sector. The IDA has received an increase of 22%, bringing its allocation to €137 million, with a view to establishing and progressing advance factories and potentially building factories in Dundalk, Limerick and Galway. That is very welcome but it is merely the tip of the iceberg.We have a major problem in this country with uneven spatial development with the result that the greater Dublin region is overdeveloped at the expense of the development of the rest of the country. What we need is a major capital investment programme in infrastructure across the whole country. This is not rocket science. For example, we need a proper motorway between Limerick and Cork, which is not mentioned in the Government's budget. This is a critical piece of infrastructure which everyone in Cork, Limerick and the regions says is needed for spatial strategy and spatial building. We also need to know when the much-heralded broadband programme will be rolled out. How will we ever attract foreign direct investment to the regions outside of the greater Dublin metropolitan area if we do not invest in these crucial projects? I want to put on record my disappointment with the retention of the 9% VAT rate for the hospitality sector. This sector employs some of the lowest-paid workers in the country and is characterised by precarious and flexible - in the worst meaning of the word - work practices. It is now making huge profits yet continues to refuse to engage with the trade unions to set decent pay and conditions for the sector. As detailed in our alternative budget, Sinn Féin would have removed the 9% rate for hotels but left it for pubs and restaurants. In the interest of fairness and decency, the Government should have done the same. The move to increase the self-employed tax credit is welcome. My party would have gone further, increasing it to €1,300, as detailed in the fully costed pre-budget submission we made. This is a fairness issue, and I am disappointed that the increase represents a dragging of feet on it. The tax credit, like other credits, should be tapered off so there is no open-ended gain for the higher earners. There are other provisions in this budget that are also found in the Sinn Féin alternative budget. Where the Government does the right thing we will support those measures and make sure they are implemented. When it comes to tax and the USC, the measures announced in budget 2017 fail the test of fairness, fail to help those in need of a break, fail our public services and lay the seeds of another economic disaster. These are the wrong choices and they will further delay job creation and sustainable labour market development.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	84	This budget, which we had anticipated and hoped would bring some good news, is disappointing. There are some measures in it that Sinn Féin looked for, as the previous speaker said, but unfortunately, they are very few and far between. There are a number of questions to be asked about the budget. Has it reduced the cost of living for those on low and middle incomes? Has it put money into their pockets? The answer to both questions is "No". Another question must be asked: will the budget improve the crisis in our public services or even deal with it in any substantial way? No. It fails that test. Will it create jobs and address the lack of investment in badly needed infrastructure such as housing, hospitals, roads and water services? Again, it fails that test. The budget is a disappointment. It has failed to address key issues such as housing, the crisis in our health services and water services. Provision is not even made for the abolition of water charges, which the party sitting to my left promised to do prior to the general election. We have an underinvestment in infrastructure, and that is a fact. The figures are there. The EUROSTAT figures show that we are almost at the bottom of the pile in this regard. The proposed increases in expenditure on health are minimal and will do little to sustain our hospitals, such as Midland Regional Hospital Portlaoise, which are stretched to breaking point year in and year out. There are 560,000 people on the hospital waiting list. What do we get? A sum of €15 million through the privatised National Treatment Purchase Fund - €15 million taken out of the system to deal with the hospital waiting list crisis. We welcome some measures proposed in the budget. Sinn Féin has been very clear and puts a lot of emphasis on the fact that if we are critical of a proposal, we will try to address it and put forward clearly thought out, costed alternatives that work in other countries. This is not pie-in-the-sky. We set out very clearly a substantial investment in health, capital investment and day-to-day spending in health to address the shortfall in staff - in nurses and doctors - and all the other areas that need to be addressed. We set out a clear housing programme. What does the Government do? It gives rebates to people who can purchase houses for as much as €600,000. Are they middle-income earners? Measures such as this drive up the price of houses. This is straight out of 1977 Fianna Fáil economics or maybe even boom-time, 2006 or 2007 Fianna Fáil economics. It is a replay of that. Regarding broadband, an area about which I am very concerned, the Minister responsible has not given a definite date for the completion of the procurement process. It was supposed to be completed this year. Then, in answer to a Dáil question I submitted a few weeks ago, he said it would not be rolled out until next year. Two days ago the Minister could not confirm on what date in 2017 it will happen. In the midlands, in Laois, south Kildare and counties such as Offaly, we are very concerned about this. We need broadband to create and sustain jobs and for economic development. As I said, we set forward very clear commitments on social housing, in which we need to invest. We need to bring down the cost of housing, and measures need to be brought in to deal with the cost of land. That is for another day, but we need to deal with it. Regarding the cost of living, there is no point in giving €1.97 extra per week to those on €20,000 or €2.93 extra per week to those on €30,000 if the money flies out of their pockets or is taken back in other ways. We set out a number of areas in our budget proposal that we would address, and the cost of living is the key issue. We would abolish property tax and water charges and end the motor tax instalment penalties, which disproportionately affect low-income earners. Regarding measures for the self-employed, we propose an increase in tax credits to €1,300. We welcome the fact that the Government has increased them to €900. That is a good move by the Government, but it needed to go further to bring parity with PAYE workers. We proposed extending medical card cover to children with disabilities. We looked for that and the Government did it. A reduction in prescription charges needs to be revisited. The Government failed on that. We proposed to increase the school books grant and tackle third-level fees, which were increased four times by the last Government, even though it promised not to increase them. Ruairí Quinn signed the famous pledge. The fees have now risen to €3,000. We wanted to reduce them, and we costed that. Regarding rent controls, for God's sake, I have two Independent Ministers in front of me, and if they do one thing, they should try to get it into their heads that we must bring in rent controls. The rent threshold limits were increased recently, which is welcome, but we told the Government at the time, and we have been saying for five years, that if they are increased without bringing in rent controls, people will still become homeless. The last case that came through my constituency office door the other morning before I came to the Dáil was that of a family paying €600 per month in rent. They had a letter in their hands stating that the rent was now €850 per month. That is way over the limit. It is €240 over it. There are a number of areas the Government needs to address, and this budget fails that crucial test on employment, public services and fairness.

It could have been about cutting the cost of living and improving our public services and infrastructure. Ar an drochuair, a mhalairt a bhfuair muid. The budget is not about what is best for our people, economy and services. It will not end the crisis in health and housing, it will not deliver tax fairness and it will not end water charges. The Government, with the support of its friends in Fianna Fáil, has crafted a budget that will benefit a wealthy minority that will reap the rewards in the form of tax breaks for landlords and a return of €20 million in capital acquisitions tax to a few thousand people, all to the detriment of those most in need. Plus ça change. A better way is possible. Sinn Féin brought forward proposals that would invest in our future, lift the burden on working families, ensure tax fairness and deliver homes, health care and education. The announcements made regarding the provision of disability services are miserly. There is no mention of an increase in personal assistant hours or funding for housing adaptation grants. There is no investment in our neurological services.Those with neuro-rehabilitation needs have been ignored for too long and they deserve to lead full and meaningful lives by giving them quality, tailored rehabilitation and support. It is for that reason that Sinn Féin, as part of our alternative budget proposed an additional €3.412 million for neuro-rehabilitation teams and transitional services.  I refer to the issue of broadband. I note with concern the strong indication from the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, that there will be further delays in the procurement process of the national broadband plan, which is totally unacceptable. When the national broadband plan was initially announced in 2012 the Fine Gael and Labour Party Government indicated a completion date of 2018. The latest indication of a delay in awarding the procurement contract is just the latest in a string of delays to the national broadband project. All we have got in budget 2017 is another miserly €15 million. Just over a year ago, I raised the rural broadband scheme with the then Minister, Mr. Alex White, emphasising the difficulties faced and the disadvantages involved for broadband users and aspiring users in rural areas. He told me:The Government recognises that high-speed broadband network deployment is of strategic importance for growth and innovation in all sectors of Ireland's economy and society. On 29 September last, the Government approved an allocation of €275 million for the national broadband plan which will provide the initial stimulus required to deliver the State intervention. Combined with commercial investment, this will ensure 85% of Ireland’s premises have high-speed broadband by 2018, with 100% coverage by 2020.Now the Minister cannot confirm the procurement process will be complete by this date, which means it is likely that the roll-out process will not have even commenced by 2018. The provision of high-speed broadband to every home in the country would significantly benefit the economy. The Government has failed to ensure broadband is available to all the families and businesses across rural areas, so much so that we have the most pronounced two-tier coverage in Europe. Ireland sits in 20th place in Europe for national broadband connectivity and this situation is hampering job creation and development in many parts of the country - in particular in rural areas and certainly, as I know only too well, across the counties of Cavan and Monaghan. It is unacceptable and I have chosen to major on that point as so many of the others have been covered by colleagues over the three days of this debate. Ireland cannot afford further delays to broadband roll-out, as the Acting Chairman will know all too well.

During the negotiations leading up to the formation of the minority Government, I emphasised the importance of creating sustainable social and economic growth and greater equality through investing in services, as I believe this is the formula to tackle inequality and to drive the economy more fairly. I hope and believe this budget is better for my contribution to it as the only Independent woman in Cabinet and fairer to our citizens because of the collaborative involvement of the wider Parliament. I proposed a 4:1 ratio between spending and tax cuts back in April and I am happy that we, as a minority Government supported by Fianna Fail in opposition, are moving towards this with a total budget adjustment weighted at 3:1 towards spending. I agree that the reduction of tax burden on working people, especially among the low- and middle-income earners, and self-employed through the cuts in the USC and improvement in the earned-income tax credit are needed, although the services in areas such as child care, health and education will make even bigger impact in people's lives. The ground-breaking investment in child care services which I will come back to later, along with increased spending in education, increases social welfare payments and increased health budget will outweigh the impact of any tax cuts to households on low- and middle-incomes because the enhanced public investment will provide greater potential to build a social economy with more quality jobs and equality. I welcome a number of progressive measures in this budget that are particularly opportune. I welcome the modest increase in pensions and all working-age social welfare payments including those for lone parents. These changes will not be enough, but I am certain will somewhat help to reduce poverty and income inequality. I also welcome the increase in income disregard for one-parent families and in the job seeker's transition allowance from €90 to €110. This is something I have campaigned for and I am proud that the minority Government has been able to deliver this in its first budget. I am particularly pleased with the additional €500 allowance for parents in receipt of back-to-education allowance. The continuing access to higher and further education especially for lone parents has been of particular concern to me. I am pleased to see a measure that will help to make education more accessible for lone parents. The child care package will also help to assist lone parents to achieve their career and education goals. As a Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, I am delighted that 50,000 additional children are to benefit from school meals. Food poverty is one of the saddest manifestations of child poverty. Children suffering from malnutrition as a result of poor diets and having to attend school on empty stomachs is one of the most distressing aspects of child poverty. I will continue to do what I can to combat causes and consequences of child poverty. I also welcome that the medical cards scheme is to be extended to all children in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance. These children need extra help and it is good that we can make a contribution to this. Investment in education is good our society and our economy. As an educator, I am passionate about providing all of our people with opportunities which ensure greater equality across geographic regions and socioeconomic backgrounds. For this reason I strongly welcome the increased spending in education which will allow for the recruitment of an additional 2,400 teaching posts, including 900 resource teachers. I also wish to congratulate the Minister for Finance on his effort to address further cases of misuse of our tax code by certain companies in light of the amendment proposed in the forthcoming finance Bill. However, there is scope for additional changes in this regard. The reality of being part of the minority Government means that one sometimes has to make sacrifices in order to deliver on other goals. Raising the ceiling of capital acquisition tax, CAT, is a regressive measure that will benefit a very small group of individuals who are already in receipt of a windfall regarding wealth. The relatively high CAT ceiling puts our citizens on an unequal footing when some of them can now inherit such a large amount of wealth without paying any tax on it. However, as I said, I am supporting the budget, which I believe is progressive although I do not agree with this particular regressive measure. Budget 2017 sets out a radical new approach to child care. I appreciate there has been a lot of information to digest a very short period of time in this regard. There are two new developments. First, we are targeting those on the lowest incomes; let us remember that 220,000 children woke up this morning in poverty or at risk of poverty. Each child aged between six months and 15 years from these low-income families can receive a subsidy of up to €8,000 a year. All households whose net income is below €47,500 can receive a subsidy. People on very low incomes will see their weekly contribution to full-time child-care reducing from €85 a week to about €4 a week. By anyone's standards that is radical. This creates new opportunities for these families in terms of education, training and work. More importantly it gives each child a level playing field on which to start their life's journey. In addition, we have a new universal scheme which is aimed at all children between six months and three year. They will be entitled to a subsidy of 50 cent per hour, meaning that a family with a child using the maximum of 40 hours a week will benefit by €960 a year. I am encouraged by the response to date. I greatly welcome the public, media and political debate on child care, which is long overdue.In that regard I certainly value parents and grandparents who do stay home, but people who want to go out to work have to be assisted and their families also deserve a chance to improve their lives. It is worth noting that 96% of eligible children are accessing our existing free preschools. They come from families of all backgrounds and circumstances, including with parents who stay at home. This week's announcement is just the start and it is in line with years of campaigning and my election commitments. My first actions are aimed at helping those on the lowest incomes, as well as a universal measure to support families from all income backgrounds. As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs I have specific responsibility for the provision of accessible, high quality and affordable child care for working parents. There is a lot of work to be done and I am looking forward to continuing the journey to transform Irish child care forever. With 30 years involvement in community child care in west Tallaght and as a campaigner I am keenly aware of the challenges in the sector which must be addressed. As I travel around the country meeting people on the ground there are concerns about pay, high staff turnover and the red tape and administration which the sector faces. That is why I have established a national early years forum to listen to and act on the concerns of the people providing this vital service in communities. We have taken some steps in the budget to assist providers. A total of €14.5 million is being made available. The average provider with 25 children will receive €2,400 a year as recognition for the time they must spend on paperwork and planning. We will continue working with them as the scheme is rolled out in the coming months and years. There is also a very important discussion taking place on the role of childminders. Immediately after the budget I met a number of representative groups, including Childminding Ireland, and we are working to get more childminders registered and for their role to be recognised. We have almost a year to get this right and I encourage every Member of this House, as well as the sector and those who campaign for children's rights, to have their say. As Minister, I value Deputies' inputs. I am pleased that I secured an increase in €37 million in current funding for Tusla for 2017, which will be added to the capital provision of €13.56 million already provided to the agency for 2017. This will allow Tusla to provide child welfare and protection services to children waiting to be allocated a social worker. At the moment 20,019 children have an allocated social worker. While Tusla has made progress on this, a further 5,050 children are still waiting for an allocated a social worker. I have been assured by Tusla that all urgent cases are dealt with immediately and do not go on a waiting list. Reducing the number, and eventually eliminating the waiting list, is a key priority for me and for Tusla. There will be a strong focus on adoption legislation in the coming months. The Adoption (Amendment) Bill has passed Second Stage and deliberations will commence on Committee Stage in early November. In addition, the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill will be enacted this year. Funding has been provided for the allocation of additional staff to help with the adoptions of children who will now be eligible for adoption and for an information campaign to ensure that birth parents and adopted persons are aware of the provisions of the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill. As a Minister of this Government, I recommend this budget to the Oireachtas and I hope it will deliver equality and fairness to the Irish people as that has certainly been its aim for all of us.
#JohnHalligan	unknown-#JohnHalligan-party	unknown-#JohnHalligan-dob	unknown-#JohnHalligan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	88	I welcome the opportunity to address the House on budget 2017 and in particular, the increased allocation in my Department’s innovation budget for next year. Innovation and technology are key drivers of Irish economy. Continued investment in innovation, research and development has been crucial for attracting, creating and maintaining high value jobs as well as developing and nurturing a technologically advanced workforce. I am pleased to say that in budget 2017 the Government is committed to increasing the funding available for research, development and innovation supports. My Department’s capital allocation for 2017 for investment in research, development and innovation will be €323 million, an increase of €15 million over 2016 levels. This Department of Education and Skills investment is part of the picture in terms of the wider goals set out by Government in Innovation 2020. The investments through the Department have to be considered alongside the investments through the Department of Education and Skills and other Departments. The 2017 capital allocation of €323 million will assist a range of key research funding supports and activities led in particular by Science Foundation Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the Tyndall National Institute. I will outline some of the key research and innovation initiatives that will be supported in 2017. Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, will see its capital budget increase by €5.5 million bringing it to €162 million in 2017. This capital investment will enable Science Foundation Ireland to invest in excellent and impactful research for Ireland. It will allow SFI to make the following new investments in the coming 12 months: an increase in the number of large scale research centres, additional new strategic partnerships with industry and funding of up to 50 new awards to excellent senior, mid and early-career researchers through the SFI Investigators and SFI career development award programmes. The SFI budget in 2017 will also allow it continue to support its existing 12 SFI research centres of excellence that are focused on areas of national strategic importance. In 2017, SFI will support the recruitment of eight to ten internationally renowned researchers through the SFI research professorship and SFI research funding leader programmes. A number of strategic partnerships with international research agencies will also be supported with an increased focus on UK research councils and other funding bodies, in light of Brexit. Education and public engagement are also critical, through the SFI Discovery programme. SFI will invest in projects which promote STEM, science, technology, engineering and mathematics education and public engagement. Enterprise Ireland will see its capital budget for research and development supports increase by €4.4 million in 2017 bringing it to €122 million. Enterprise Ireland’s increased capital allocation for research, development and innovation programmes will enable the agency to develop new supports aimed at increasing the ability of indigenous companies to carry out research and development, develop new products and services and access new markets. The additional capital allocation will fund a number of new initiatives including a new programme for business innovation initiatives aimed at driving company innovation towards more customer focused product and service solutions. The funding will also enable the roll-out of a small business innovation research programme, following successful pilots, to leverage the considerable national public procurement budget to drive innovation in small and medium enterprises. It will also assist in scaling up of activity under the recently launched Health Innovation Hub Ireland, and enhance the supports to help companies access non-Exchequer research funding, including through the EU Horizon 2020 programme. I am pleased to inform the House that, to the end of September, Ireland has won over €336 million in competitive Horizon 2020 funding. This figure is ahead of where we expected to be at this point in time with regard to our national target. I am pleased to announce an increase in the budget allocation to the Tyndall National Institute. The capital investment of €4.5 million will enable this fantastic institution to grow its interactions with industry substantially both in Ireland and internationally and target non-Exchequer income of up to €6 million in 2017. The funding will help the institution to build on its national leadership in postgraduate training by producing up to 30 highly skilled postgraduate researchers at PhD level for industry in 2017. The objective of this investment is to foster and enable Ireland to delve into world class innovation systems. The investment also ensures Ireland is connected and respected internationally. Ireland’s ranking in the Innovation Union Scoreboard has moved from tenth place in 2013 to sixth place in 2016, and Ireland is currently grouped with other nations known as strong innovators.
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	89	The combined 2017 defence allocation of €922 million is comprised of €692 million on defence Vote 36 and €230 million on Army pensions Vote 35. This represents an increase of €10 million within the defence Vote and €6 million within the Army pension Vote in 2017. This increased allocation will allow the Defence Forces to deliver on their operational outputs, at home and overseas. The 2017 pay allocation of some €497 million allows for the pay and allowances of up to 9,500 Permanent Defence Force personnel, 550 civilian employees and 350 civil servants. Funding of over €2 million for the Reserve Defence Force is included in the allocation.The Permanent Defence Force has conducted a recruitment campaign targeting an intake of approximately 600 general service recruits in 2016. In addition, there have been 97 officer cadets in 2016, the highest cadet intake in the history of the State. Plans are also in place to continue with general service recruitment in 2017. I am committed to ongoing recruitment in the Defence Forces to reach the established strength figure of 9,500. We will recruit significantly more personnel this year and next year than in previous years, and I have ensured the Defence Forces vote has the necessary funding to do this. A capital spending allocation of €74 million represents an increase of €7 million on the 2017 defence allocation contained in the 2016 to 2021 capital investment programme. This allocation will facilitate the investment necessary to ensure the Defence Forces have the equipment and infrastructure to deliver on all their roles as set out in the White Paper. Broad areas I identified for capital expenditure in 2017 include the acquisition of armoured logistical vehicles for overseas missions, the further development of the armoured personnel carrier fleet, the replacement of Air Corps aircraft and the replacement of naval vessels in the Naval Service flotilla. In 2017 we will also continue to invest in the Defence Forces built infrastructure, improving barracks throughout the country. Next week, we will commission the third ship in the naval vessel replacement programme. At a total cost of €199 million, these purchases represent excellent value for money and have strengthened Ireland's capabilities quite considerably. We will continue this investment and I confirm an additional ship of the same class as the previous purchases is due for delivery in 2018 at a cost of €67 million. I recognise the work of the men and women of the Irish Defence Forces. As of 1 September, Ireland was contributing 498 personnel to 11 overseas missions. This includes continued commitment to search and rescue humanitarian efforts in the Mediterranean. The work of the Irish Naval Service is a great source of pride. Its efforts in rescuing more than 13,400 migrants represent the very best of our Defence Forces contribution to international peace and security efforts. Many lives have been saved as a result of their efforts. We should also be very proud and appreciative of the overseas peacekeeping efforts of all Defence Forces in various missions. I acknowledge the contribution of the Reserve Defence Force. It is powered by a strong volunteer base and its dedication to its support role to the Permanent Defence Force is greatly appreciated and I look forward to the continued development of the Reserve Defence Force. The allocation also supports civil defence. I thank the 4,000 civil defence volunteers for their efforts in supporting front-line emergency services and the tremendous value they provide to every community in the State. There will be a €6 million increase in the provision for the Army pensions vote for 2017. Approximately 12,200 pensioners will be paid by the Department from the Army pensions vote, and the increased allocation will help address the growing demands on this vote. The increased allocation for 2017 will ensure continued provision of the necessary resources to the Defence Forces to enable them undertake all roles assigned by the Government at home and overseas. It recognises and acknowledges the high levels of professionalism and ability evident in the Irish Defence Forces.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	90	The backdrop to the budget is a housing crisis that is being felt in every part of the country. We face intertwined problems of endemic homelessness, spiralling rents, insufficient social housing and a stagnant private market. For an entire generation, the basic aspiration of home ownership is slipping away. The dream of having a place to call one's own around which one can build a vibrant family life and play an active role in the local community is disappearing. Instead of putting down roots, young people are paying up to landlords. We need to give ordinary workers who are getting going in their lives, who are newly married or who are starting a family a real chance at owning their own homes. However, the first time buyers grant announced is not the solution they need. The Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, has conceded that the first time buyers grant is not a silver bullet, but he is firing the starting gun on a new property price race. Overall, the €20,000 grant will see more money chasing the same few homes. Builders will simply boost prices to get higher profits, which they need or which their banks demand. The cost of building a new home will remain fundamentally unaddressed. A young couple will find themselves using the grant just to try outbid other couples armed with the same amount looking at the same home. This will have wider implications beyond just first time buyers. Homeowners looking to trade up are the Cinderella of the property market. These families, who have outgrown their old home or who have just escaped from negative equity, will also be hit by artificially spiked prices. Those trading up have been entirely neglected in the Central Bank rules and will now have to compete with first time buyers armed with an additional €20,000 to outbid them. The help to buy scheme or, rather, the help to sell scheme, is a demand-side solution to a supply-side problem The extremes of the scheme are the sharp end of Fine Gael's two-tiered outlook on this country. The €600,000 limit imposed is completely off the wall. It is out of sync with the reality of ordinary first time buyers. The average overall cost of providing a three-bed semi-detached house of 1,214 sq. ft. in the greater Dublin area is €330,493, including VAT. The €600,000 limit is almost double this, which effectively turns the scheme into nothing more than a mansion grant. A new home worth €600,000 would require a €98,000 deposit and an income of at least €145,000. This is four times the average industrial wage. A couple earning this when starting out in life does not need €20,000 from the State, which is struggling to tackle a social housing waiting list of 130,000 homes. It means ordinary taxpayers are directly subsidising people earning four times the average wage to buy a home worth three times the national average price of a three-bed semi-detached house. I do not agree with the scheme. I expressed my concerns to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, about the potential of the scheme a number of weeks ago. I asked him to carry out an impact assessment. This morning, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, told us this was carried out. If it was carried out, and I doubt it very much, it will have serious implications for the Cabinet and it needs to be published immediately. I beg members of the Government to examine the scheme and see the blatant unfairness of it at its extremes, by which I mean not capping the grant for houses at €400,000 and allowing the grant to €600,000. Those who can afford to buy such homes are not the squeezed middle. They are not an ordinary young couple, just married, looking to buy a semi-detached house and start a family. They are not young gardaí, young nurses or young teachers. They are not young professionals who have studied hard and worked hard while their parents paid a lot to put them through college. What the Government is financing and giving to those who can afford homes at this rate is a mansion grant. If they were considering buying a house three weeks ago for €580,000 they do not need an extra €20,000 now to pay €600,000 for it. This will undoubtedly turn a two tier recovery into a two tier property market. Those first time buyers a few years into their careers, struggling to save and pay rent will be not be served by further spiking prices on homes that will never be within their reach. I want to make clear that Fianna Fáil believes in home ownership. We believe it is good for families and good for communities. Having something to pass onto future generations and a firm sense of place is a basic and fundamental human desire.This means that the State should provide the framework and stable market to enable people to buy their own homes in keeping with their needs, but we cannot allow that dream transform into a nightmare cycle of highs and lows and booms and busts. We put forward a clear proposal in our manifesto to help first-time buyers to save their deposit. It is a gradual scheme over a number of years that would ensure prices did not increase rapidly while helping ordinary couples to get the money together to buy their first home. In contrast, the Government has gone for a big bang approach. It is an electoral Trojan horse that is using young couple’s legitimate aspirations against them.  The key issue to be addressed is supply. A total of 25,000 units per annum are needed to meet demographic demand. We need to address the cost of construction rather than turbo charge house prices. The VAT rate, finance costs, certification costs and development levies could all be reduced by direct State intervention, but the Government has not chosen to take that route. My colleagues and I are committed to playing a constructive role and will table amendments to the Finance Bill when it is brought forward. I hope the Minister and the Government are willing to engage in meaningful discussions on how we could, at the very least, improve the scheme if it is to proceed. If we do not learn from the past, we are condemned to repeat its mistakes. Let us not go back to back to the future with this proposal. We can do better and an entire generation who are renting and scrimping and saving every spare few bob deserve better, but they will not be served by this scheme. I mentioned to the Minister a number of weeks ago my concerns about the proposals being reported in the media related to the scheme. I said that at the very least he needed to conduct a regulatory impact assessment and make the findings public. If that has been done, we need to see them quickly, but I have my doubts because every dog on the street will tell us the impact the scheme will have. It will drive price increases, while the Government fails to address the supply issue. The Minister refused to consider a proposal put forward by the Housing Finance Agency under which the State would take equity in homes. In the event of an upturn, this would generate a benefit to the State and if there was a downturn, it would mean that there would be a safety net for purchasers. That would have been an acknowledgement of what happened in the past and learning from it. Instead, we have the big bang approach and populist politics. It is an effort to appease south Dublin Fine Gael voters. No mistake should be made about this. A cap of €400,000 needs to be set in Dublin city where the crisis is greatest and in adjoining counties such as Louth, Meath, Kildare and Wicklow. I plead with the Minister not to allow this to happen. The Government is sleepwalking into another crisis and price war. If the limit was set at €400,000, land prices would be fixed and if people wanted to continue hoarding land, the Minister could levy them. At least they would have to cut their cloth to the measure of the building sector which could then provide homes to meet demand. People are struggling as it is to buy homes at a cost of €360,000 or €380,000. That will not be the case after the scheme comes into force and I ask the Minister to reconsider. We will table amendments which we expect him to take seriously. We also expect him to acknowledge that what he has proposed cannot be allowed to happen.
#ThomasByrne	unknown-#ThomasByrne-party	unknown-#ThomasByrne-dob	unknown-#ThomasByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	91	I am happy enough as education spokesperson that some of the items for which Fianna Fáil has fought in the past few months have been addressed by the Government. We agreed in a confidence and supply agreement with Fine Gael some months ago a number of education policy initiatives which we wanted to have implemented. However, it has been like pulling hen's teeth or like getting blood out of a stone to get the Minister for Education and Skills to realise the importance of the issues we have highlighted. The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Helen McEntee is present. The second level mental health strategy mentions the importance of guidance counselling and the service has been allocated €2 million, one of the smallest allocations made in the budget. I had to have meetings, issue press releases and beg and remind the Minister of what had been included in the confidence and supply agreement, while my colleague, Deputy Dara Calleary, had to do the same with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. It is extraordinary. There was a similar scenario regarding third level funding. The Minister only published his action plan - an action plan for Action Man - a number of weeks ago and there were only two lines in it about third level funding. To prove his lack of vision for the entire education sector, following the exertion of significant pressure by Fianna Fáil to do the right thing for students and invest in third level, a three-year plan was announced in the budget to fund higher education, which I welcome is so far as it goes. However, the Minister had to be dragged kicking and screaming to do the right thing. There was nothing in the action plan, but because of the severe pressure exerted by Fianna Fáil and the third level sector, we have succeeded and he has been forced to address the issue of third level funding. It is a pity that that had to happen because it was the right thing to do. It is important for the country and the initiative is about action, not words. We are glad that we played a role in the making of the €35 million allocation to the third level sector, but the Minister needs to go further and take third level education seriously. His lack of vision is a danger to the education sector. The Minister and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform also belatedly addressed the issue of the remuneration of newly qualified teachers. They accepted that something would have to be done by starting the process of negotiation. We knew that this would happen because something similar had been done for firefighters, but, again, the Government had to be dragged kicking and screaming to do something. The agreement was inevitable, but instead of arriving at it promptly, it was not finalised until after the summer and, most dangerous of all, following the announcement by the ASTI that it would ballot its members for industrial action. I tried to make the Minister aware that an announcement on newly qualified teachers should be made before the ASTI ballot. Whatever happened between the Departments of Education and Skills and Public Expenditure and Reform, that message was not understood and the announcement was not made until afterwards. There is a protest outside Leinster House, which is unnecessary, because if the Government had done its job in dealing with the issue of newly qualified teachers for whom €10 million has been allocated in the budget, everything could have turned out differently and there might be industrial peace in the education sector among teachers, whom we value greatly, regardless of whatever union they are members. Fundamentally, education is about teachers and pupils. The Minister's lack of vision, therefore, is deeply worrying. Action plans and lists of items to be ticked off are not sufficient. It is not enough to say, "We are publishing this report in quarter 4 and this document in quarter 2." There must be an overall vision of what education means. Education is about providing the best prospects for young people, imparting the best rounded value system to them and informing them about what they need to know about life, how to engage in society and find a job. That overall vision will never be achieved by a box ticking exercise related to administrative tasks within the Department. Unfortunately, officials in the Department seem to be engaged in such an exercise in order that they can say they have completed all of these tasks, while the sector is left to fend for itself in many ways. The issue of reform of the junior cycle curriculum was raised at the education committee earlier. A sum of €10.5 million has been allocated for the reform programme, while ignoring the fact that half of schools are not delivering the programme. We are at this point because of the lackadaisical attitude towards the end of the previous Government and at the beginning of the current one. According to the Minister, pupils will lose 10% of their marks in the junior certificate examinations if they attend an ASTI school. The Minister of State with responsibility for mental health services can ask her officials and experts to assess what impact this will have on pupils, given the stress they will have to endure this year. It is entirely unacceptable. The reforms have to be undertaken in some schools in December. The ASTI will have to ballot its members again if the decision is to be reversed and time is running out.I understand that, from last November until June this year, when the new Government got settled in, almost nothing was done in respect of junior certificate reform or talking to the ASTI to resolve its issues. It was left blowing in the wind and children are left to suffer when this happens. The Department needs to go beyond ticking boxes but it did not even tick the box in this case. It allocated €10.5 million but ignored the elephant in the room, which was the fact that it was not being taught to half of our students, with all the consequences that entailed for them. It is simply not good enough. Fianna Fáil is disappointed with some of the items in the education budget. The Minister spoke about an extra €485 million for education, but only approximately €130 million is actually new money, the rest being for demographic change and to provide new teachers for the increased number of children in our schools. We welcome progress on the postgraduate grant, on guidance counselling and on third level but there has been no reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio this year. In line with the confidence and supply agreement we have with Government, this will have to be addressed. It is a condition of Fianna Fáil's willingness to abstain on budget votes and to allow the Government to remain in office so the Minister will have to look at it for next year. He should forget about the action plan and ticking boxes and look instead at the overall vision and practical measures to help schools. The pupil-teacher ratio is one we have identified as a priority but capitation is also in this category. If capitation was properly dealt with we would take a huge amount of pressure from schools, principals, boards of management, parents' councils and children themselves. Rather than putting out reports, many of which have been shown in this budget to be meaningless by the complete change of direction on third level, the Minister should concentrate on those issues which will have a real impact on the lives of our pupils at primary level, such as the guidance offered to students and funding for third level which will result in more teachers. These are practical items which we have been pushing and the Minister needs to draw up a shortlist of those that will work. It is a short list but it will make a difference. We are getting lot of criticism from Sinn Féin but I do not really want to talk about them. Deputy Pearse Doherty mentioned Fianna Fáil 30 times in his speech in the Dáil the other day. Our Members' ears are burning and if one did a word count of the speech one would find that Fianna Fáil was right at the centre of Sinn Féin thinking. However, Sinn Féin and Fine Gael are not at the centre of our thinking, nor should they be. The people of Ireland are at the centre of our thinking, as are the policies that will make change happen for them. It is not about party political nonsense or playacting or putting motions down that mean nothing but trying to get results. At times it is difficult to get results but at least we are trying and we can show that we are getting results. We can show that guidance counselling is back in education and that postgraduate grants for the poorest in society are back. We can show that the effort and noise Fianna Fáil made on third-level funding has been listened to and has had an impact in the form of more teachers in that sector next year. Fianna Fáil is about delivering for the people and about keeping the promise we made to the electorate and this is exactly what we have done. In an age when there is huge cynicism about politicians, keeping one's promise is something we feel is deeply important.

#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	93	Yes, I will speak for eight minutes. I agree with one point made by Deputy Byrne, namely, the one on the centre holding. There are many people on the extreme of Irish politics who would not have thought that we could have delivered a budget and who did not do anything to contribute to that process. I am grateful for the opportunity to address the House on the budget and the 2017 health Estimates. This is my first year as Minister for Health to address the House on this important matter. I am particularly pleased to be in a position to talk about a budget that will place the health service on a more sustainable financial footing and allow the Health Service Executive to set realistic and achievable targets for service areas in the year ahead. I believe the message of the people at the last election was very clear - they wanted to see the gains of a recovering economy invested in the services people depend on and I believe this budget demonstrates that the Government has listened to that message. This year, 2016, is the first in many years that the health Vote has come in on budget. This is a direct result of the Government providing an additional €500 million funding to the health Vote last July to improve the base funding of health and to break the cycle of Supplementary Estimates that had developed in recent years. The improving economy has enabled the health service to achieve much-needed budget increases in each of the past two years. The fact that it has come in on budget means we can use the funding we have received in this year's budget for services and service development, rather than to fill some black hole or overrun. The additional funding provided during the course of 2016 gave me, as Minister for Health, the opportunity to address some immediate issues facing colleagues, such as investment in a winter initiative to manage overcrowding in emergency departments, in addition to meeting commitments in A Programme for a Partnership Government. I am pleased to announce that once again the Government is asking the Oireachtas to allocate additional Exchequer funding for the health sector for 2017. The gross current budget for the health sector for 2017 is €14.152 billion. This is equivalent to an increase of €457 million on the 2016 allocation of €13.695 billion voted through the year. The provision for 2017 represents a 7.4% increase on the original voted budget for 2016, and a 3.5% increase on the final projected 2016 outturn. The health Vote for 2017 has increased by 9.4% over the 2015 outturn position, recognising the Government's commitment to providing a health service that seeks to improve the health and well-being of the people. The additional funding secured will continue to ease the pressure on the health service to provide the optimum level of safe services for patients within the budgetary limits. However, there are still real fiscal challenges facing the health service. Health care demands continue to rise due to our growing and ageing population, an increasing incidence of chronic conditions and advances in medical technologies and treatments. Accordingly, we must continue to focus on effective financial management, cost containment and cost avoidance. I am pleased to confirm that there will be no increase to prescription charges, the monthly DPS threshold or income thresholds for eligibility for medical or GP visit cards. Funding for fair deal will be maintained at an appropriate level to meet demand and keep waiting times at a maximum of four weeks. I believe this shows the Government's continuing commitment to stabilising the direct cost of health services for citizens. I am grateful to my ministerial colleagues, Deputies Noonan and Donohoe, for their support and understanding in dealing with the challenges faced by the health sector. The level of health services to be provided within the available funding will be set out in the HSE's 2017 national service plan, which is currently being prepared by the executive. However, I will outline some of the issues which will be more extensively covered in the service plan. My ministerial colleagues, Deputies McGrath, McEntee, Corcoran Kennedy and Byrne, will be setting out information related to their own areas of responsibility so I will not do so here. Under this budget, an additional €15 million will be allocated to the national treatment purchase fund, NTPF, to deliver a waiting list initiative in 2017 specifically directed towards providing treatment for our longest-waiting patients, because this is vital. This brings the funding available to the NTPF to €20 million in 2017, rising to €50 million in 2018, a total of €70 million illustrating this Government's commitment to improving waiting times for patients. In August, the HSE developed a waiting list action plan focused on reducing the numbers of longest-waiting patients. Throughout 2017, my Department will continue to work with the HSE on reducing waiting times through driving efficiencies and process improvements, with a particular focus on adherence to chronological scheduling and validating waiting lists. The NTPF is up and running now but this is not an excuse for the rest of our system to do everything it can possibly do to improve waiting times. I am delighted that the €40 million allocated as part of the additional €500 million voted in July has been provided on a recurring basis for the winter initiative. This is important because winter happens every year. This funding is crucial in enabling winter-preparedness measures across our health service and in reducing overcrowding pressures in our hospitals.In the coming winter the initiative will deliver an additional 950 home care packages, an additional 58 transitional care bed approvals weekly; an additional 55 acute beds and an additional 18 step-down beds, as well as expansion of community intervention teams across four areas of the country and minor injury services in the Dublin area. The winter pressures on hospitals cannot only be resolved by additional provision in acute hospitals. We must also drive down the number of delayed discharges. I accept that there is a need for a bed capacity review and, probably, much more investment in bed capacity, but there are beds in the health service that are being occupied by patients who do not wish to be in them and do not medically need to be in them. For this reason, the focus of the winter initiative and the budget is on home care packages, transitional care beds, step-down beds, community intervention teams and so on. We also need to put in place a new GP contract. I welcome the additional funding for acute and emergency services, which represents an increase of over €90 million on the revised allocation in 2016. The increased allocations in 2017 for acute hospitals, the National Ambulance Service and the national cancer control programme demonstrate my commitment and that of the Government to driving key policy and strategic initiatives to improve and expand acute care and emergency services for patients. This funding will enable continued progress to be made on initiatives such as the delivery of the new national children’s hospital, implementation of Ireland's first maternity strategy and the winter initiative and drive improvements and expansion in cancer care for patients, ambulance services, waiting lists and paediatric services. We are also making provision for 1,000 new nurses to join the health service. I was pleased to be able to announce today an improvement in the pay of nurses who graduated between 2011 and 2015 by way of the restoration of their increments from January next. In 2017, in line with the commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government, we will increase investment in ambulance services. The capacity report identifies significant deficits in ambulance services which we will need to address incrementally in the next few years. Additional funding provided in 2016 has allowed us to start that process and the provision of further additional funds for 2017 will facilitate the development of the intermediate care service. This service focuses on providing transport for low acuity patients, including inter-hospital patient transfers. Through investing in the intermediate care service, we aim to free up the emergency fleet for emergency calls, thus improving the service overall. On primary care services, it is proposed to progress the delivery of medical cards for all children in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance, as well as the new GP contract that is badly needed. My colleagues will outline other measures.

This will bring the total funding available to the HSE for social inclusion services to over €131 million. The Department also provides more than €6 million for drugs and local task forces. The additional funding announced in the budget will enable the HSE to continue to provide initiatives aimed at improving the health outcomes of the most vulnerable in our society, including those affected by addiction issues, those experiencing homelessness, Travellers and the Roma community, asylum seekers and refugees. It will also help to fund the national drugs strategy, the pilot supervised injection facility, services for young people under 18 years and detoxification beds for adults. The Government, in providing this €3 million, is committed to a health-led response to the drug problem. Other areas that come within my remit are housing and homelessness. I welcome the €42.4 million being provided for the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, through which approximately 45,000 people will receive direct one-to-one labour market training and support, 2,800 local community groups will be assisted, 20,000 individuals will receive educational support and 25,000 individuals will receive employment support. I am delighted to announce that €2 million is being made available for the roll-out of a new community development scheme which will be targeted at disadvantaged urban and rural areas and fund projects that seek to enhance communities, address disadvantage and improve social services at local level. My experience during the years has been that very often community groups require small levels of funding to build capacity and get projects off the ground. I hope the new scheme will be the starting block to enable communities that do not often receive funding to begin some work on the ground.
#HelenMcEntee	unknown-#HelenMcEntee-party	unknown-#HelenMcEntee-dob	unknown-#HelenMcEntee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	95	This is the first budget of the new partnership Government. It is also the first budget comprised of input from members of all parties and Independents in this House through the Committee on Budgetary Oversight. This is a new and positive move. The context of the budget is the need for fairness. We must see a matching social recovery to mirror the economic recovery and give people a sense of hope and certainty. That is why the balance of spending is 2:1 in favour of public services. Again, this spending must be prudent and sustainable or we risk giving false hope and having to cut back again if times become tough internationally.  Throughout tough economic times in this country we have continued to invest in mental health services. Between 2012 and this year, funding increased by€150 million, or 16.25%. In budget 2017 the investment of recent years in mental health services will be consolidated and increased. I am pleased to say €35 million for new services will be initiated in 2017. This is in addition to the €35 million provided in 2016 which remains in the base of the funding. As in previous years and anticipating that projects initiated next year will not all be completed in that calendar year, I have decided to allocated capital funding of over €50 million for the award of the contract for the construction of the new national forensic mental health service in Portrane, the total cost of which will be in excess of €115 million. This major capital project will include a new 120-bed hospital, two new ten-bed units for mental health intellectual disability and mental health child and adolescent services. It is a huge step in the bid to bring services into the 21st century. Overall, €74.7 million in additional funding will be spent on mental health services next year.  It is also my objective to be able to allow older people to make their own choices in as much as possible. This will require the provision of a range of services and supports to allow them to remain in their own homes and communities for as long as they can, ensuring that if and when the time comes, affordable and quality residential care will be available to them. As the Minister has pointed out, the nursing home support scheme will be funded to the tune of €940 million in 2017, which will allow waiting times for placement following approval of funding to remain at a maximum of four weeks. Overall funding for services for older people has increased to €765 million, an €82 million increase on the amount provided in last year's service plan. This funding is focused on additional provision of home care services to ensure older people can remain in their homes and facilitate the discharge of older people from acute hospitals.  Two thirds of the €40 million provided for the winter initiative 2016-17 is being spent on social care services, home care packages and transitional care beds which cater primarily for older people. The budget provides for a continuation of the €30 million provision and the provision of an additional €10 million for home care packages in 2017. Further details will be announced in the service plan when work on it has been completed in the coming weeks.  The budget matches vision with prudence and progress with sustainability. It represents stage one in the three-year agreement of the partnership Government and the collective work of all parties but most especially the work of Fine Gael and its Independent colleagues who have taken responsibility in government and are not seeking credit from the sidelines. I thank the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, and Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, for their work on the budget which I commend to the House.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	96	I welcome the opportunity to speak about this important budget. While listening to the debate in the past few days I heard many colleagues speak about the need for vision, planning and so on. A Programme for a Partnership Government and the budget are big on vision in having a comprehensive implementation plan and providing for a huge investment in health, disability and education services. These are all practical items. Being in government is not about having power but about using power to effect the changes, provide the opportunities and compassion we need and desire in our society. A Programme for a Partnership Government references a strong economy and a fair and compassionate society for everyone. The budget is about meeting that objective.  On disability services, I welcome the increased allocation provided in budget 2017 to address a number of priorities, as provided for in the programme for Government, including the additional funding of €31 million secured earlier this year. The allocation for disability services will increase to over €1.654 billion in 2017, compared to the €1.562 billion provided in the national service plan 2016, or an increase of €92 million.The additional funding includes money for pay, as well as to fund development and meet key priorities. The key priorities for me will be the provision of residential and day care places for all adults with disabilities. We must also ensure we deal with speech therapy and occupational therapy issues. These are important services which will be dealt with in the next 12 months. It was an historic moment when €10 million was provided for medical cards for children who qualified for the domiciliary care allowance. This is very important because the measure will benefit more than 6,000 children. It is important to note the major contribution of the Independent Alliance to the budget, particularly in the extension of medical cards but also in the 25% reduction in the maximum prescription charge from €25 to €20 per month for the over-70s with a medical card. We worked very closely with all of our colleagues on the investment of €50 million in the National Treatment Purchase Fund and, of course, the increase in the social welfare Christmas bonus from 75% to 85% of the full weekly payment. Those who say the budget is not full of practical ideas should note that it is riddled with practical, sensible ideas and based on having a just and compassionate society.

It is clear from the results of the first wave of the Healthy Ireland survey launched late last year that there are many threats to the health and well-being of people living in Ireland. Obesity, tobacco consumption, alcohol abuse and physical inactivity rates are leading to increases in the levels of chronic conditions and putting a significant strain on the health service. I will launch the second round of results of the survey next week to build on the evidence available on the need to take action on this front. The results of the survey are assisting us in targeting actions to promote healthy lifestyles.  I am delighted that the increase in expenditure on health and well-being initiatives is 4.9%, versus an overall increase of 3% in the health budget. This shows that the Government understands the importance of prevention and is committed to helping people to stay healthy. In 2017 we will commit €2.5 million to fund the continued extension of BreastCheck to all women aged 50 to 69 years on an incremental basis. That decision was made by the last Government and is being continued with by the Government. I am delighted that we are able to allocate €7.8 million for the expansion of the child vaccine programme to allow us to commence the rotavirus and meningitis B vaccines programme for newborns.  I welcome the increase in the price of tobacco products as this is positive for health and well-being and achieving our aim to have Ireland tobacco-free by 2025. While we have made significant progress in getting smoking rates into a downward trend, it is clear that we must continue to make progress. I recognise that many people are addicted to nicotine products. I also know that many of the people concerned wish to quit. I urge them to contact the HSE's QUIT service to avail of the supports available. I look forward to having discussions with my officials and the HSE in the coming days and weeks to agree ways by which a range of priorities can be advanced in tackling obesity, physical inactivity, smoking and alcohol consumption levels, as well as promoting sexual health and childhood vaccination. I am particularly pleased with the establishment of the Healthy Ireland fund, a major initiative that will allow the Government to support innovative, cross-sectoral, evidence-based projects, programmes and initiatives that support implementation of key national policies on tackling obesity, smoking and alcohol consumption levels and promoting physical activity and sexual health. Healthy Ireland seeks to empower people and communities to improve their health and well-being. In that regard, the fund will make a real difference. It will help us to work with our partners in other Departments and agencies to provide appropriate support and guidance on how best to address these broad determinants of health. I refer to the sugar and sweetened drinks levy, on which the Minister for Finance made a strong statement on its introduction following a public consultation process which will close on 9 January next year. A consultation paper was published on budget day, on which day the Department of Health also published the evidence that supported the policy which aimed to reduce consumption and effect behavioural change.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	98	I welcome the opportunity to speak in the budget debate in the context of where we are as a society, an economy and a people but also politically in terms of the make-up of the Parliament subsequent to the general election. It is a new dispensation for many Members and it is important to accept that we are finding our way to see how we can work to ensure stability in government, as well as ensuring we have a Government that will do the right thing for the people. In that context, it is fair to say we are trying to move the Government in a different direction. The budget is the first phase in that process. When one analyses the impact and changes in direction in the budget from those which were regressive in the past five years to one which is more progressive, one sees a welcome initiative, but, of course, it is only a step. A great deal of harm has been done to society in the past few years in the pressure exerted on families and individuals. A great deal must be done to ensure it is healed and that we will have a cohesive society which can collectively work through the various challenges confronting individuals and, more importantly, society. I would like to elaborate on the budget a great deal more than I can, but we are short on time. There are a number of issues that confront us, including Brexit and the profound implications it may have for the economy. The greatest threat to investment and business is uncertainty which diminishes confidence and the capacity of business to invest, create jobs and generate tax revenue.  The other key issues include the broader global political issues beyond our shores. Elections are to be held in France and Germany next year, not to mention the presidential election in the United States of America. There is also in the background, of course, the Apple tax issue. There are concerns about whether the decisions of the Revenue Commissioners and their questioning by the European Commission will undermine our ability to attract foreign direct investment. They are big picture issues, but they impact on our ability in the Chamber to divert scarce resources towards the areas most in need. In that context, we must be ambitious. While we are constrained by the Stability and Growth Pact, we must become imaginative about how we access funding on the capital markets to invest long-term in the provision of infrastructure. I am not only talking about roads and railways but also the expansion of the economy to ensure we will have the capacity to deal with the inevitable demographic pressures, the potential upturn in the economy and the fallout, both positive and negative, from Brexit in companies looking to have their headquarters in this country and use our facilities to access the European market. There are many challenges but opportunities also. To a huge extent the Stability and Growth Pact has tied our hands in seeking access to money, but the State can now borrow at a rate of 0.33% for a ten-year bond. This is the time for us as a people to be imaginative, brave and ambitious for ourselves and those who will come after us. We should be making long-term investments in the productive economy. However, that is an area in which the Government has fallen down to a certain extent. The capital programme and the statements that support it lack ambition. They show no creativity and imagination in setting out a vision for what we need as a people to ensure the productive capacity of the economy can be sustained in the years ahead. Much of that issue needs to be revisited. We have called for the establishment of a commission on infrastructure and public investment to analyse in a critical way what will be required in the next few years and beyond the horizon and plan accordingly. In my area of responsibility, health, Fianna Fáil welcomes the fact that the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, spoke earlier. He showed a commitment to ensuring we will have sustainable health budgets. The last five were pretend budgets; they were made up. The Government would wander in with a figure which had been plucked out of the sky to pretend that it actually had a sustainable budget to fund health care services. Obviously, it did not because we consistently and regularly had supplementary budgets. The confidence and supply arrangement between my party and the Government includes provision to ensure multi-annual budgeting. The health system cannot plan on an annual basis. It must look at what will happen in the longer term in terms of recruitment and investment to ensure it will have the necessary capacity.I welcome some of the initiatives announced. Everybody is falling over each other to take credit, but I want issues to be addressed and resolved. There are action plans for education, health, transport, disability services and a plethora of other areas, but we need action plans that can be implemented in a meaningful way. Has Sinn Féin again taken up its abstentionist policy? There is no Sinn Féin Deputy in the Chamber. Sometimes they turn up. It would be welcome if they were here now because yesterday Deputy Mary Lou McDonald referred to the National Treatment Purchase Fund in a sneering way. We had campaigned for its establishment in order to ensure the issue of waiting lists would be addressed. The people I represent do not have the luxury of having private businesspersons to fly them first class to the United States to avail of private health care and check-ups. The people Deputy Mary Lou McDonald purports to represent do not have that luxury. The National Treatment Purchase Fund was put in place to shorten waiting lists and ensure people could access health care and diagnostics in a timely manner. I do not think anyone should be condescending about the effort made in that regard. The fund is required and should be broadly supported as it will have a meaningful impact on people's lives in shortening waiting times in accessing diagnostics and seeking interventions. I look forward to implementation of the plans outlined in the budget.

Without a doubt, it is a Fine Gael budget, but Fianna Fáil agreed to facilitate the minority Government based on the confidence and supply agreement. Budget 2017 reflects much of the framework policy agreed to. Unlike other parties which threatened to plunge the country into another general election, Fianna Fáil stood up to the mark earlier this year and ensured we would have a stable Government. That meant we were able to avoid the political paralysis seen in Spain which is facing its third election this year. From the outside, Fianna Fáil has been able to apply pressure in a number of ways. One of the key ways in which this has happened is through the agreement that in the framing of any budget available funds would be split 2:1 in favour of public services, but on this occasion that push from the outside reached much further and there is a 3:1 split. This has enabled provision to be made for additional resource teachers to support students, additional gardaí to protect communities, additional CLÁR funding for rural communities and to allow a partial restoration of guidance counsellors in schools. The funding for ex-quota guidance counsellors is significant, but the remaining posts need to be restored to enable more students to benefit from this measure. It is important that young vulnerable people have this support available to them at a key time in their lives. The increase in teacher numbers is important and the measure will help to deal with the demand from a growing population, although the issue of pupil-teacher ratios has not been addressed. It needs to be dealt with, especially at the lower end of the scale in smaller schools where one teacher teaches first, second and third class. Smaller rural schools took a bigger hit in previous budgets. Is ábhar buartha dom é nach bhfuil go leor airgid á chur ar fáil do Straitéis 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge i mbliana. Anuas ar sin, baineadh 35% den bhuiséad caipitil don Ghaolainn agus Gaeltacht. Braithim go léiríonn sé seo neamh-shuim an Rialtais i gcúrsaí Gaolainne. Go forleathan timpeall na tíre, tá atmaisféar báúil, fuinneamh agus suim ann. Teastaíonn daoine a bheith páirteach sa Ghaolainn agus i gcúrsaí a chur chun cinn. Braithim go bhfuil an Rialtas ag caitheamh uatha an deis iontach sin atá ann. Tá sé riachtanach go rachadh an Taoiseach agus an Rialtas i ngleic leis agus go gceartóidís an botún atá déanta acu ansin. There is no need for uncertainty as to when social welfare payments will increase. It is not good enough. The increases should be paid as quickly as possible. The money must be available, based on the figures included in the budget. The Government should be able to clear up the uncertainty and increase the payments at the earliest possible date. The Macroom bypass project is constantly referred to as a source of anxiety for people living in my constituency. In his Budget Statement the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, referred to a number of road projects, including the Tuam and New Ross schemes but not the Macroom bypass project. Last week, when he discussed construction projects on the horizon with the CIF, he referred to a range of road schemes, including the Dunkettle interchange in Cork but overlooked the N22 road project. This is a source of serious concern for many in the mid-Cork and Kerry region. To put the matter in context, this is happening at a time when there is a disappointingly low level of investment in transport in the budget, which is causing anxiety. We are facing a mid-term review of the capital programme and the message that the Macroom bypass project must be prioritised does not seem to be getting through. It must be prioritised. The money allocated for broadband provision is important and we will hold the Government to account on the issue. Broadband provision is important for rural communities and needs to be delivered.  Tuigim go bhfuil an t-am ag éirí gairid mar sin. Scaoilfidh mé leis.
#NiamhSmyth	unknown-#NiamhSmyth-party	unknown-#NiamhSmyth-dob	unknown-#NiamhSmyth-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	100	I am pleased to have an opportunity to contribute to the debate on budget 2017. As Fianna Fáil spokesperson on arts and heritage, I welcome the modest increases in funding for the Arts Council, Culture Ireland, the Council of National Cultural Institutions and the Irish Film Board. However, we must acknowledge the reality. The arts, culture and film budget was increased from €156.5 million to €188.5 million in 2016, but it is to be reduced to €158.3 million in 2017, a cut of 16%. This is a retrograde step following the additional investment made by the State in the arts and culture sector to fund the commemorative programme this year. The same investment should have been made in the Arts Council. Fianna Fáil has a strong tradition of supporting the arts and culture sector. It has always acknowledged the impressive contribution the arts community has made to the country. We are committed to protecting the independence of the arts community and ensuring a stable, sustainable and secure funding model for the arts through progressive increases in State expenditure in line with improvements in the economy and the public finances. We are committed to enabling full community engagement to benefit from State funding for the arts and supporting the arm’s length principle to promote the Arts Council’s autonomy in distributing State funding to artists and arts organisations. We are committed to enhancing provision for the arts in the education sector and, in particular, the roll-out of local arts in education partnerships through ETBs across the country. We are committed to ensuring local authorities will implement local arts action plans which benefit local communities and artists and bring the arts directly to the people. The budget presents minimal measures to cope with the fundamental challenges posed by Brexit. In the light of this, encouraging active co-operation between the Arts Council and the Arts Council of Northern Ireland is now more important than ever. In June Fianna Fáil placed the arts front and centre in a Private Members' motion which called for sustained increases in arts funding. The motion won cross-party backing and reflected widespread public support for improved arts funding. I am delighted that an additional €5 million will be allocated to the Arts Council, with a further €2 million for the Irish Film Board and €1 million for Culture Ireland.The arts are essential to the well-being and advancement of the people and a thriving arts and culture sector can make a positive contribution to the country as a whole. Not only do the arts have an intrinsic value of their own in national life, they also represent an important economic sector in terms of employment and tourism. It is, therefore, important that further increases are secured in the years ahead. In our election manifesto we committed to year-on-year increases in funding for the arts and remain committed to this. For our part, Fianna Fáil believes rapid progress should be made in successive budgets to increase our allocation for the arts. I have previously urged more funding too for the film industry. I think we all accept that the indigenous film and television production sector has a significant cultural and economic impact in Ireland. It is a sector that has enjoyed many successes in recent years and competes well on the world stage. However, there was a growing belief that assistance was needed, particularly in the form of increased funding for the Irish Film Board. Therefore, I am pleased that we have extra funding approved in that way. There is a €1 million allocation to the Heritage Council, which is less than what I had hoped to see. While the allocation has been warmly welcomed by the chief executive, we had made a very strong case for an additional €5 million. For every €1 spent by the Heritage Council, the tourism industry generates €4.40 through increased tourism revenues. More than 75% of its annual budget is allocated to creating and supporting employment in the heritage sector. When the revised estimates were published in December of last year, additional funding was secured for the Arts Council. Therefore, if there is a repeat of this in December I hope the Heritage Council will benefit from it. Moving away from my own portfolio, we have also seen the introduction of the first-time buyers grant scheme. It will only drive to push up prices and risk another boom and bust within the sector. A reduction in construction costs has not been forthcoming. In my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, as in many counties across the country, there are not the new homes for young people and young first-time buyers to actually access this new scheme. In Cavan-Monaghan, there have been no builds for the past decade. I am sure it is the same across the country. There are a lot of builds that are one-off private houses. Houses to buy are in high demand but they are not available in Cavan-Monaghan. Therefore, this first-time buyers grant is null and void when it comes to buying new homes in Cavan-Monaghan because they do not exist. This is a huge problem. A lot of my constituents will not be able to avail of the scheme. In that way, it could be argued that it is discriminating towards young people and young buyers, particularly in rural Ireland. I have had numerous calls since budget day from very concerned young people who are trying to get their heads around the fact that second-hand houses will not be a part of the scheme and that they therefore cannot avail of it. This initiative will see first-time buyers chasing more than 10,000 new homes and apartments earmarked for construction next year. The scheme is useless without accompanying measures to increase supply. It could exacerbate the housing crisis by overheating the new builds market, which, in turn, will lead to increased house prices. I will conclude with two other observations that I have found most pertinent within my constituency, one of which is the lack of the local improvement scheme, LIS. I am disappointed to see that this has not been reintroduced in this budget. Again, it is forgetting about rural Ireland. I know that the Government may state there are discretionary funds available and that it is up to the local authorities to take the money out of that. The local authorities have suffered cut after cut over the last eight or ten years. My local authority has suffered a 48% cut on roads. There are no discretionary funds. My constituency is made up particularly of a farming community in which farmers and families depend on getting in and out of their lanes in good weather and bad. The LIS was hugely important. It was introduced in the House by my late uncle, Paddy Smyth, and that was a long time ago. As far as I know, it ran up until 2008. It is very disappointing not to see that scheme re-introduced. I am sure every Deputy in a rural constituency has had the same experience. I do not see the Brexit-proofing that I would have liked to have seen in the budget. It is of little consolation to the mushroom growers in my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan who at this time are on their knees due to the plummeting sterling prices. Jobs are being lost. Some 95% of the produce goes to the United Kingdom. One local grower told me that the cost of exporting is due to the plummeting sterling price. Given that situation, many businesses are under pressure and some have been wiped out of business.

I start from a position of being the only elected Teachta Dála in my constituency to take issue with this budget authored largely by Fianna Fáil and presented by Fine Gael. I am the only Teachta Dála who recognises that this was certainly not a budget for all, least of all those that are already struggling. Being the only dissenting voice among the compliant rhetoric of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil elected Members in my area, I feel a certain responsibility to advocate on behalf of all my constituents who feel let down by Tuesday's measures. We have heard Fianna Fáil claim in the media in recent days that their fingerprints were all over the budget. I find it startling that, although Teachtaí Micheál Martin and Michael McGrath are elected by the constituents of Cork South Central, they failed to advocate or deliver on so many of the issues that face their constituents daily. I am sure UCC students will be delighted to see the lack of investment in third level education, passed by again in this budget, despite shouting from the rooftops on the publication of the Cassells report. I am sure both the students and residents of the area will be delighted to see spiralling rents unaddressed once again, not to mention Fianna Fáil's decision to vote against rent certainty legislation that has been brought before both this House and the Seanad as recently as yesterday evening. I am sure all of those young jobseekers will be very happy with their extra cup of coffee a week they might get from the €2.70 a week increase in their allowance. Fingerprints, indeed. Smiles all around. Cork Simon Community's latest figures for August have shown an increase of 58% in the number of people sleeping rough compared to August 2015. This was the first budget involving the new Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney. He could have laid down a marker of intent but instead, like those who have gone before him, he has attempted to put a plaster over the gaping wound that is the housing and homelessness crisis. Failure to do anything to control rent increases will undermine anything else the Government does in this budget. Tá tionchar ag na cinntí a dhéanann an Teach seo ar shaolta na mílte daoine are fud na tíre ar bhonn laethúil. The announcement of a pay increase for Teachtaí Dála was audacious to say the least. For many, it would seem like salt in the wounds following on from Tuesday's budget. They have every right to be angry, with Teachtaí Dála due to benefit by €5,000 and the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, set to benefit to the tune of €11,000. Tá sé sin cothrom le leath d'ioncam bliantúil daoine atá ag obair go lán-aimseartha ar an bpá is ísle. It became clear in the run-up to the budget that it was no longer possible to ignore the outrageous burden placed on parents by the cost of child care. It has become one of the headline issues from the budget. Naturally, additional funding for child care is welcome. However, I believe it is also safe to say the money that has been allocated to the sector, an extra €35.5 million, is entirely inadequate when looked at in the context and considering the amount of investment required. In our alternative budget, Sinn Féin proposed an investment of close to €190 million in the early years sector. That would not only have provided a greater subsidy, but would also have made it more sustainable, dealing with quality and workers conditions. Child care professionals have for far too long been forgotten about and this is once again the case. If we are even to begin to take child care seriously and give a proper commitment to the funding of the early years as a matter of priority, we must invest in the backbone that ensures the child care sector stands upright. The workers themselves must be commended and the commitment they have to providing a high quality service to those children who attend their pre-school goes unquestioned.On a similar note, much greater assistance needs to be provided for childminders to ensure they can register, starting with the restoration of the childminder advisory service to ensure as many parents and workers as possible can avail of the scheme announced. Caithfimid an tacaíocht atá uathu chun a gcuid oibre a dhéanamh a chur ar fáil agus luach a chur ar an obair sin. Sinn Féin provided for workers in the form of the extension of the ECCE scheme by five weeks to 43 weeks. This would minimise the time workers would find themselves signing on for unemployment benefits during the summer months as the facilities they work in are unable to pay their wages. Sinn Féin provided for workers in the form of increasing both the lower and higher rate of capitation for preschools and crèches that would allow for extra funding to pay for both quality child care and the improvement of pay and conditions of workers in the area.  All of the above is with a long term vision of professionalisation of the child care sector and giving the workers the respect they deserve. Tá súil agam go bhfuil an fhís chéanna ag an Aire.

I acknowledge the Minister's efforts in terms of the early years sector and welcome some of the steps she has taken in tackling the crisis of child care costs for some families. However, we have a broken system that has been haphazardly plastered over year after year with ad hoc measures. It is a sector which has been ignored and sidelined, resulting in a complicated system, with parents and professionals fending for themselves to the best of their abilities. This crisis is so much more than crippling costs of child care to parents. It is a crisis of varying quality standards and a crisis in working conditions for those providing the care. Child care professionals have been doing their damnedest to maintain standards under increasingly impossible circumstances. Not unlike the treatment of nurses in the State, staff in the early child care sector, those who carry out some of the most important work for our most vulnerable citizens, continue to be treated with little or no respect. It is clear that the Government does not comprehend the scale of the crisis in the early years sector. If it did, it would have known that an extra €35.5 million is nowhere near sufficient to tackle it.  We in Sinn Féin proposed an overall package that focused on many areas within the child care sector and allocated in the region of €250 million as a first step. We proposed €111 million for a subsidisation measure that would not only assist and target those at the very low income end but would also subsidise parents who are struggling to make ends meet every month when facing crèche costs of up to €1,200 per month. Our proposal would have provided an average relief of €96 per child per week, whereas many will receive only €80 over the course of a month under the Minister's new measures. Unfortunately, the issue of quality does not seem to feature much in the Government's proposals. Our desire to see a 60% degree-led ECCE workforce by 2025 is backed by our proposal to open up the learner fund to levels 7 and 8 qualifications. This would also have benefited staff by allowing them to progress in their careers.  The elephant in the room is the crucial issue of staff pay and working conditions. We can talk all we want about the cost to parents, accessibility and quality standards, but if those who are the very backbone of the sector are burnt out, surviving on little more than minimum wage, who will be left in the sector to care for children? It is a cart-before-the-horse approach. The affordable child care subsidy announced by the Government is still based on staff earning below the living wage and signing on over the summer months for social welfare. There is no focus on the sustainability of the sector via improvements of child care professional working conditions or pay. These issues must be addressed immediately if the State expects the sector to survive. With minimum increases in the ECCE subvention, equivalent to seven days, and no increase in capitation weeks, there is a long way to go in improving working conditions. Our proposals on increasing capitation and providing an additional five weeks would have allowed for better pay and working conditions. In addition, under our proposals, all facilities seeking to avail of our early years subsidisation scheme would be required to allow the recognition of a trade union and minimum working standards and appropriate wages for their staff.  While I commend the Minister for prioritising the issue she has chosen, the truth is that parents and those working in the sector were really hoping for so much more. It comes down to investment and political choices. If we do not meaningfully engage with those working in the sector, hear what they are saying and seriously take those issues on board, the same issues will resurface year after year and the crisis in our child care sector will only deepen.

There have been some marginal improvements here and there, but mostly what we saw was Fine Gael pandering to its pet audiences in the privileged classes. In the last election Fine Gael's vote shrunk throughout the country, except in one area, south Dublin. It is clear that this demographic is increasingly Fine Gael's focus. Introducing a €20,000 grant for individuals purchasing a starter home worth €600,000 while 6,000 people languish in emergency accommodation for months on end is brutally inequitable. Giving 2,000 people €20 million as an inheritance tax break while emergency mental health services throughout the country pull shutters down at night time is callously unfair. Before the election, the Labour Party targeted Ashbourne Annie as its fictional voter. It is clear to me that Fine Gael's target fictional voter now is Rathgar's Ross O'Carroll Kelly.  Another point of note from this budget was the ability of Fine Gael Deputies to take to their feet in this Chamber and act like they are just in government. This is the sixth year Fine Gael has been in government. For six years it has presided over worsening health care, housing and education.  It is also clear that Fine Gael's marketing department has not been fired since the "Keep the recovery going" nonsense six months ago. Measures were presented to us in this budget to mitigate Brexit but they were actually, simply, repackaged measures dealing with pre-existing crises among farmers, self-employed persons and the hospitality sector. This budget will not fix the deeply unfair economic system built by Fine Gael.  Those languishing on hospital trolleys and the hundreds of thousands of people waiting on expanding waiting lists will see no respite in the budget. Education spending will be grossly inefficient and insufficient to meet demand. Buying a house, or even trying to afford rent, will be an impossible goal for hundreds of thousands of people in the State.  Sinn Féin seeks to radically change the system. We are looking to change the way things are done. We would invest €1.8 billion in public services. We would inject €462 million in the health services to bring about an additional 500 beds. We would reduce prescription charges and invest in ambulance and mental health care. We would invest €278 million in education, tackling the cost of so-called free education in the State, reducing pupil-teacher ratios and beginning the process of abolishing the punitive third level fees. We would invest significantly in child care, with a €252 million package, including an investment of €111 million to subsidise child care costs for children between the ages of six months and three years. We would scrap the water charges and the household tax to help the squeezed middle.  I heard some Fine Gael Deputies speak about families on €100,000 per year being the squeezed middle.

It backs down. The budget is a clear declaration of priorities. Money goes to what the Government sees as important. From 2008 to 2014, arts, culture and film investment saw a 76% reduction. This year it will see a further 16% reduction.  It is intolerable that we do not have a Minister in the Chamber for all of the speeches of Opposition Deputies. If a Minister needs to leave the Chamber, he or she should have cover. Otherwise, the only representatives of the Government we will have are Fianna Fáil Deputies.  Perhaps the Government sees the new ideas of the creativity sector in the arts as a real threat. Perhaps the contrast between the idealism of 1916 and the pay increases of members of the Government is enough to bury the heritage sector in cuts.Not only is the Irish language the poor relation in this budget, but it has been treated with sheer contempt by the Government. We were informed that a deal had been done by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael on the Irish language. What happened to this deal? The 20-year strategy on the Irish language, which was launched several years ago with cross-party support, set a target of having 250,000 daily Irish speakers by 2030. That strategy is now in flitters. As matters stand, Irish as a community language in the Gaeltacht will come to an end with this generation. It is shocking that the Government is presiding over this development. To ascertain the Minister's understanding of the current position with regard to achieving the 2030 target, I recently asked how many people speak the Irish language daily outside the education system. The Fine Gael Minister had no idea what the numbers were. One of the easiest ways to transmit a language is from parent to child. It costs nothing to do so. Outside the Gaeltacht, the Government spends only €20,000 per annum on this area. This is the entire amount the Government spends on supporting families who raise their children in Irish outside the Gaeltacht. This illustrates the priority the Government attaches to the Irish language. In the years following 2008, funding to the Irish language sector was cut by almost 90%. Last year, against the tide, funding to the sector was cut again and while most sectors secured an increase in expenditure this year, funding for the Irish language has been cut by a further 9%. The Irish language is a key element of our identity and the linguistic diversity of the globe. It has been a key repository of knowledge, literature, arts and the thinking of this nation for 1,000 years. That it has been flicked off the Cabinet table and thrown into the budget bin is an absolute disgrace. Ba mhaith liom ceist nó dhó a chur ar an Aire. Cén fáth nach bhfuil an Rialtas seo sásta cothrom na Féinne a thabhairt don Ghaeilge? Cén fáth go bhfuil siad ag baint airgead amach as an mbuiséad sin bliain i ndiaidh bliana? Cén fáth nach bhfuil na daoine atá ina gcónaí sna Gaeltachtaí timpeall na tíre tábhachtach? Nach bhfuil sé tábhachtach poist a chruthú i nGaillimh, i gCiarraí, i bPort Láirge, i gCorcaigh, i Maigh Eo, i gContae na Mí agus i nDún na nGall? Nach bhfuil sé tábhachtach na pobail sin a chothú as seo amach? Is é an rud is measa ná nach raibh an Rialtas sásta Aire sinsearach le Gaeilge a chur ar an gComh-aireacht. Sa Dáil dheireanach, cheap an Rialtas Aire Stáit nach raibh fiú in ann labhairt as Gaeilge. Caithfidh mé a rá go bhfuil díomá uafásach ar phobal na Gaeilge timpeall na tíre mar gheall ar an gcúlú infheistíochta sa Ghaeilge atá beartaithe sa bhuiséad seo.
#BrendanRyanDublin	unknown-#BrendanRyanDublin-party	unknown-#BrendanRyanDublin-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyanDublin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	111	In recent days, everyone has struggled to define exactly what to make of this budget. The only consensus seems to be that people do not make much of it. As far as I am concerned, it is a missed opportunity because it showed poor judgment and made bad choices. It was a missed opportunity to use the economic recovery to make bold choices about the future direction for our country. One of the better choices made by the previous Government was to introduce a VAT rate of 9% for the tourism sector. This measure helped secure jobs at a time of rising unemployment and helped the sector expand and the country to move out of recession. Between the second quarter of 2011 and first quarter of 2016, the number of people working in the accommodation and food services sector nationally increased by 31,000 on a seasonally adjusted basis, taking total employment from 114,900 to 145,900. This increase of 27% compares to an increase of 7.2% in overall employment over the same period. This indicates the measure may have been successful in terms of job creation and has made a significant impact on the competitiveness of the tourism product. However, as we have returned to stability and growth, it is time to reassess the 9% VAT rate, which was introduced initially as an emergency measure. Any extension of the measure should have been contingent on the hotels sector engaging in sectoral wage and conditions agreements with trade unions. I put this to the Minister for Finance prior to the budget in a parliamentary question. In his response, he stated:Ireland has a robust suite of employment rights legislation to protect all workers, including minimum wage legislation. These rights apply across all sectors. Other wage setting frameworks include joint labour committees, registered employment agreements and sectoral employment orders which are underpinned by recent legislation. Engagement in these frameworks is voluntary on the part of the stakeholders concerned.The 9% VAT rate is also voluntary and it is a voluntary decision by the Government to retain and continue with it. What we will continue to ask is that we leverage the benefits the lower VAT rate has delivered to the industry to improve conditions and protections for workers in the tourism and hospitality sector. The Government has made the choice not to make the continuation of the 9% rate contingent on employers engaging with these industrial relations frameworks. I urge the Minister to have a serious discussion on this matter with the hotels sector before the year is out. The 17% cut in the sports capital payment is an extraordinary move, particularly as it is included in a budget that features an announcement of a future tax on sugar sweetened drinks, purportedly for public health reasons. I will first speak briefly on the proposal to introduce a tax on sugar sweetened drinks, possibly in 2018. Before doing so, I should declare a previous interest in this area as I worked for Coca Cola for many years. My opinions on this matter are informed not by that period of previous employment but my previous occupation as a food scientist. While the Labour Party included a tax on sugar sweetened drinks in its alternative budget, I am opposed to that proposal. After announcing the introduction of a tax, the Minister for Finance proceeded to declare that "much analysis needs to be undertaken between now and then." One would expect an analysis to be completed before the announcement of such a tax. The Minister also announced that a public consultation had begun and would continue until 3 January next. However, the consultation is on the "form and practical implications of the tax" when it should, in the first instance, be on the advisability of introducing such a tax on its own. Reducing obesity requires a broad range of interventions. While fiscal measures may be part of the mix, parallel actions are required in the areas of food marketing, educational measures, physical activity, etc. A recent report by Public Health England concluded it was "unlikely that a single action would be effective in reducing sugar intakes." A 2012 report on work carried out by the Institute of Public Health in Ireland on behalf of the Department of Health concluded that the evidence of the relationship between consumption of sugar sweetened drinks and weight gain was suggestive of a positive relationship but it was not conclusive. International evidence suggests that for a tax on sugar sweetened drinks to be effective in reducing consumption, it would have to be set at between 10% and 20%. Renowned professors in Ireland differ on the matter. Professor Donal O'Shea argues in favour of a tax on sugar sweetened drinks, whereas Professor Mike Gibney argues that while the introduction of such a tax could be a politically popular move, it would not help to reduce obesity levels. What about other sweetened foods such as sweets, chocolate and ice cream? What about jam, fast foods, chips and bakery products? Other than providing a political feel-good factor for some, the proposal to introduce a tax on sugar sweetened drinks on its own will not have the desired effect. While it is appropriate that we are concerned about growing levels of obesity in Ireland, it is wrong to suggest that a tax on one ingredient in one category of food products is the answer. If it is the case, as indicated by IBEC, that such drinks account for only 3% of total calories consumed here, how could it be the answer? The introduction of a new tax will increase the cost of sugar sweetened products to consumers without having a significant effect on overall obesity levels. To return to the reduction in funding for sports capital grants, the sports capital grant scheme, while not perfect, is a very good method of providing direct investment in grassroots community infrastructure.Every euro of sports capital funding is a benefit to voluntary sports clubs and to the men, women and children all over the country who enrich our communities through healthy sporting activity and competition. People need to see tangible evidence of recovery in their pockets, in their services and in their communities. The once-off payment for the sports campus in Abbotstown is worthy but not at the expense of so many communities which will suffer when the sports capital grant scheme is opened in 2017. While this and other bad choices since he came into office have left me questioning the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport's commitment to delivering for the people through his portfolios, I will commend the Minister for the further commitment to metro north. We in Fingal want to see that project begin and to see real progress on it. I welcome the continued support for the project in this budget announcement. The Government's choices in education seem to pay no heed to its own programme for Government. Although contained in the programme for Government, it chose not to take the opportunity to reduce class sizes further. It made a deliberate choice not to continue the reduction of class sizes begun by the Labour Party in government in our last budget this time 12 months ago. Instead, the spreading of a few bob across most sectors in education will do nothing more than to keep these sectors standing still, rather than moving forward. I look forward to the Labour Party's Private Members' Bill next week which will tackle the poor choices made by the Government in the education budget. The first-time buyers help-to-buy scheme included in this budget is imbued with good intentions but, unfortunately, there is real frailty and unfairness in the detail of the scheme. The scheme will provide first-time buyers with a rebate of income tax paid over the previous four tax years, up to 5% of the purchase price of a new home up to a value of €600,000. The scheme will push up house prices, of that there is little doubt, and tax credits and rebates have demonstrated this to us on so many occasions. It is why we in the Labour Party have been against a tax credit for child care for so long. Another fundamental unfairness in this scheme, and something which runs contrary to the Government's own stated objective of attracting back emigrants who left our shores, is the fact that to qualify for the scheme, one must have paid tax in Ireland for the previous four years and the rebate is of taxes paid in this country. This is like a kick in the stomach for any emigrant who, for economic necessity, had to move away due to the crash, but has worked hard, paid their taxes, perhaps in Canada, the UK or Australia, and saved up money to put towards a deposit for when he or she comes home. This is a very real disincentive for many of our young people to ever return home. I believe the Minister needs to rethink this scheme and present a scheme that will work for all of our first-time buyers, as opposed to hiking up prices further. I want to read the Minister a message from Australia which I received on WhatsApp in recent days. It reads: "Isn't that first time buyers grant a load of crap? Punishing people who had to leave the country due to recession!" It is from my daughter, so I have to apologise for the language contained in it. It is probably her mother's influence rather than mine. Nonetheless, there is a serious matter involved here, and there are many like her. The annual budget is the best opportunity to bring in transformative change in society. A fiver a week is not transformative but that was the Government's choice. It was its choice to spread the available funds as thinly and as broadly as possible, to such an extent that it really will not impact much for many people. Instead, people will be left wondering what our Government is actually doing and what choices it is going to make on our behalf to improve our quality of life. Hopefully, they will start to think when they will get the choice to elect a new Government which is not afraid to make bold and decisive decisions, as contained in the Labour Party's alternative budget.

Since 2008, the social damage done by successive budgets has been incalculable. For the average person listening today, the budget will not change their economic situation one iota. The housing crisis, which is the crisis of our time, still rages without abate. At this very moment, there are over 1,500 families in emergency accommodation. This situation is not only completely unacceptable, but the measures in this budget do not go anywhere near challenging the fundamental issue of why so many families find themselves in this position. The announcement by the Minister of €105 million for the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme only copper-fastens the desocialisation of social housing. This will only compound the already long waiting times for people to be housed by the local authority. Essentially, what the Minister announced on Tuesday is a boon to landlordism and the construction industry. It is misleading to state that 21,000 applicants for social housing will have their housing needs met. I say this as a person who has been a council tenant, as my family have been. What is wrong with local authorities building houses? I utterly reject and find it offensive that, somehow, local authority housing and the people who seek to be housed by the local authority equate to social problems. Let me be crystal clear. HAP and RAS are not social housing; they are the privatisation of social housing by proxy. Like many in this House, I have received numerous e-mails, phone calls and correspondence in regard to home care hours. As a former home care worker myself, I know the impact home care hours can have. Some 950 home care packages simply are not enough. The health system is playing catch-up due to the lack of home care hours. Some 8% of the population aged over 65 are in receipt of some form of home care services, and the average is five hours per week, based on need and availability of resources. In 2008, 12.63 million hours were delivered to 55,000 clients whereas, in 2015, seven years later, that figure was down by 2 million. Since 2010, there has been a 17% increase in the number of those aged 65 and over, so there has been no attempt to keep pace with the demand for home care hours and packages. We can clearly see there is a gaping hole in home help hours and packages that still has not been addressed. Although the 650 home care packages are welcome, this does not go far enough, by any stretch of the imagination. There was a lot of talk in this Chamber about mental health and how the Government would address funding to mental health services. Historically, the mental health budget is 50% less than the average in Britain. In this budget, I cannot see a firm commitment to implementing A Vision for Change in regard to mental health services. Much has been made of the €5 being given to social welfare recipients, including pensioners. The ongoing age discrimination against those under 26 sends out the message that this is no country for young people. Youth unemployment stands at 16%, more than double the figure in 2007. Let us make it relative to other pay increases, namely, the pay rises of €5,000 for Deputies in this House. I want to put on record that Deputies are not worth the rise; they get enough as it is and they are very well paid. Ordinary working people who have been crucified over recent years in taxes, including stealth taxes, do not get anything like the pay rises awarded to Deputies. What makes Deputies so special? Deputies seem to think they are God's gift to pay rises. Overall, this is the crumbs from the master's table. The vested interests, the very wealthy and the corporations have not been challenged yet again. Until the Government challenges the real reasons for wealth inequality and the nature of our economic and political establishment, we will continue to firefight the scandals of the housing crisis and the two-tier health system.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	115	I am going to talk about some of the details of the budget shortly but I feel the need to respond to some of the debate that has unfolded since Tuesday.Interestingly enough, I wish to respond in particular to a number of attacks on AAA–PBP by our friends from Fianna Fáil. True to form as birds of a feather who flock together when challenged, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have waxed lyrical about the need to protect the centre in politics and about their great prudence. They have attacked what they describe as the extremes in politics, which they believe are characterised specifically by People Before Profit and the Anti-Austerity Alliance. Apparently, we are extremists. It is important to respond to that quite ridiculous charge. Notwithstanding the theatrics of Fianna Fáil today in distancing itself from some of the increasingly unpopular measures taken by the Government in the budget, particularly the proposed tax break for first-time buyers, both parties banded together to try to attack those on the left and characterise them as extremists. In a very good book called The Extreme Centre: A Warning, the author, Tariq Ali, rightly seeks to turn on its head the narrative of the centre versus the extremes. I find it very difficult to understand how a party whose policies precipitated the greatest economic collapse in the history of the State and unloaded the cost, €64 billion, onto the backs of working people, the poor, the deprived, women, children and the disabled can talk about being part of a prudent centre. It is laughable in the extreme. Nothing is more extreme than the economic collapse that Fianna Fáil precipitated in 2008. That was the most extreme event we have had since the foundation of the State. It resulted in an average drop of 20% in the incomes of ordinary people. Some 30,000 public sector workers' jobs were axed. There was a €3 billion cut to the health budget and the social housing building programme was effectively ceased. There were brutal attacks on the disabled, lone parents and public sector workers. Fianna Fáil cut the minimum wage. Levels of poverty and deprivation doubled in some categories. That is extremism. The extremism that led to the crisis was, of course, a product of the extremism characterised by the pampering and supporting of the greediest people in society. I refer to bankers on obscene salaries and to allowing them to dictate policy. I refer also to the private developers and landlords, whose naked greed for profit was supported and championed by the Government at every hand's turn. The cost was an absolutely catastrophic economic crisis. That is what I call extremism. It is very telling that the very policies Fianna Fáil championed and that led to the crisis of 2008 are now being continued or resurrected by Fine Gael, specifically in this budget, proving once again that there is not a whit of difference between the two parties. Notwithstanding the theatre that we get in here, whereby the two parties jockey for political position and posture in front of the public, their policies are always the same in reality, regardless of which is in government or whether both are in government, as is now the case although one is pretending to be in opposition. Their policies are the same and that is what we got in the budget. Faced with the worst homelessness and housing crisis in the history of the State resulting from the policies of championing the interests of developers and bankers and the vicious austerity the Government imposed, what is the answer of Fine Gael? Unbelievably, the answer is more tax breaks and subsidies for private landlords and developers. Really, you could not make this stuff up. The truth of the much-trumpeted Coveney housing plan has been exposed in its stark reality in this budget. How many nonsense figures were circulated by the Minister responsible for housing, Deputy Simon Coveney, and his predecessor, Deputy Alan Kelly? We were told 110,000 social housing units would be delivered, and then we were told it would be 140,000. In the budget, we see the reality. There are not to be 140,000 or 110,000 new social housing units but 1,500, as is evident in black and white in the expenditure report. Not even all the 1,500 units are to be local authority units. The number includes houses of approved housing bodies, acquisitions and the rapid-build things the Government is promoting rather than the bricks and mortar people want. One thousand five hundred houses will not even cater for the new applicants put on the housing list in the space of two or three months. If that is all the Government is proposing to deliver, the housing and homelessness crisis will be worse by the end of the year. The reality of the Government's housing programme is massive handouts to private developers and private landlords. Some €105 million extra is to be provided for the housing assistance payment scheme. This is money straight into the pockets of private landlords and it does not deliver one new social housing unit. In most cases, the people who will be in the housing assistance payment scheme will be staying exactly where they are, that is, in exactly the same private rented accommodation they are currently in, where they are receiving rent allowance. This rent allowance will just be recategorised as a housing assistance payment. Similarly, €134 million has been allocated for the rental accommodation scheme. Again, this is a direct payment by the State to private landlords, meaning that the housing applicants will stay exactly where they are now, in exactly the same private rented accommodation, thereby costing the public a fortune. Some €200 million is to be made available for infrastructure grants to private developers, incredibly to build on public land private housing from which they will profit. This is absolutely naked, dramatic privatisation of public land, which we will pay for, but the private developers will be the ones who will benefit from it. Some €15 million has been allocated for the famous help-to-buy scheme. This will simply increase the price of property, through bidding, for buyers, and the money will go straight into the pockets of the private developers. The scheme will not deliver any affordable or social housing. This is the reality. In that regard, it is worth exposing the double counting that is carried out consistently by the Government in respect of housing. The figure of €1.2 billion is big but the expenditure increase that the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government will get is not €1.2 billion but only €400 million over and above the figure for last year.Included in that figure is a 7%, or €30 million, cut in the money going to local government, which means libraries, local services, the people who clean the roads, cleansing departments and so on will be cut from the local government budget. Regarding health, again, we have heard fibs from the Government. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, said proudly on Tuesday that 2017 will see "the highest ever level of health funding in the history of [our] country". This is simply not true. In 2008, the health budget was €15.4 billion. If capital is included, it was €16 billion. The health budget for 2017 is only €14.6 billion. One does not have to be a mathematician to work out that this means we had a higher health spend in 2008 than is provided for in this budget. I hope the Minister will correct the record in that regard. That €14.6 billion, which is less than what was provided in 2008, represents an increase on the Estimate for last year, and again there was much trumpeting of this in the budget speech. However, there is a failure to acknowledge that €500 million of that money is taken up by the cost overrun of the health service from last year and €300 million by the pay increases provided for under the Lansdowne Road agreement. At least €300 million is necessary to stand still in terms of service provision, given the additional demographic pressures of our older population and more demand on the health system. This means the budget will actually have a negative effect - or at best a neutral effect - in terms of service delivery in the health service, and that, as we know, will be a disaster. If there are no real or genuine increases in health expenditure, the suffering of those on waiting lists, those on trolleys in accident and emergency departments and those looking for home care packages; the funding we desperately need for mental health services; and the increased funding we need for the disabled in a whole range of areas cannot be delivered through a budget that has a neutral or possibly negative effect in real terms when all the elements to which I referred are stripped out. Similarly, regarding education, there was much crowing about a €458 million increase. However, when demographic pressures are stripped out, such as the 10,000 extra students coming into the education system every year and the additional teaching posts the Government proposes, this sum will just about, if even, keep pace. Therefore, is it any surprise that there is no mention of class sizes or pupil-teacher ratios in the budget? In fact, the extra funding will only keep pace with that extra demand. I heard the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs responding yesterday to the 16% cut in the arts, a point which I think we were the first to raise on Tuesday. It should be borne in mind that this comes against a background of our having the lowest level of expenditure on arts as a proportion of GDP almost anywhere in Europe. Last year, the Government gave an extra €50 million to the arts for the 1916 centenary and then took it back again. This was at a time when the arts community was saying it would like to reach European averages in arts funding but that it wanted the Government at least to leave the arts with the €50 million extra they received last year. However, the Government took €30 million of that back in a disgusting cut when in fact we need a significant increase in the arts budget. I will give a shout out to young people. I got a letter from the National Youth Council of Ireland which asked, "[Why has] the Government [in this budget further] widened the gap between the rates for other adult welfare recipients and young welfare recipients [by only giving them €2.70 extra or €3.80 extra, compared to the fiver it has given to everybody else]?" Why has the Government widened this gap? I would like an answer to that. This is a miserable budget full of falsehoods put forward by the various Ministers in their speeches on Tuesday.
#SeanCanney	unknown-#SeanCanney-party	unknown-#SeanCanney-dob	unknown-#SeanCanney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	116	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the budget. I acknowledge the work of my colleagues in the Independent Alliance in the preparation of the budget with our partners in government and with the other Independents. The budget, as delivered, is based on the programme for Government and has demonstrated that this Government can deliver. In my Department, the budget recognises the importance of flood relief, and I have succeeded in securing additional funding to put resources in place to deliver our very ambitious programme of flood relief. I reassure the House that flood relief is high on the Government's agenda. My Department will have 12 major flood relief schemes under construction by the end of this year, compared with four projects in 2015. This marks a sign of huge progress in the area of flood relief. The €430 million capital expenditure previously announced for flood relief is intact, and we will spend €50 million more this year. I intend to continue with flood relief measures and will increase spending annually up to €100 million by 2019. I cite the fairness of this budget in implementing a suite of financial measures to help the most vulnerable people in our society. The reduction in prescription charges and the increase in the Christmas bonus to 85% are very important measures that complement the €5 increase per week in pensions across the full range of social welfare recipients. The plight of farmers has been well documented, and the measures in the budget go some way to assisting them, including the €25 million sheep grant, changes to the farm assist scheme, additional places in the rural social scheme and making available cheap finance to help farmers over this difficult period. The self-employed are also recognised in this budget. They are the backbone of job creation. The invalidity pension and dental, optical and medical appliance schemes will be extended to the self-employed, and there is also an increase in their tax credits, which is also very important. The extension of the VAT refund scheme to refurbishment works for another two years is a vital component in keeping the fledgling construction industry moving along. It will be of major benefit to builders and suppliers as well as to the craftsmen we have in this country who need that very work to keep their families fed. I also welcome the scheme for first-time house buyers, despite the utterances of Deputy Boyd Barrett. I am a little disappointed that he did not enter into the negotiations on the formation of a Government at the start of this Dáil. He would have made a fine Minister for Health or Minister for Social Protection if he had brought his ideas to those negotiations last March rather than keeping them cooped up only to splutter them out now when he sees a good budget. Finally, I accept that we cannot deliver everything required in the programme in one year. This partnership Government commits to being a caring, just and responsible Government, and this budget is a first step on that path. I hope we will produce many more caring and just budgets in the future.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	117	I thank the Ministers of State, Deputies Doyle and Canney, for sharing time. I acknowledge the budget for the diaspora being kept at the same level as last year's. This is an important acknowledgement of the ongoing work on our emigrant support programme and the other work in which we are involved in working with Irish groups throughout the world. I also acknowledge the continued commitment of the Government to increase the overseas development aid budget by another €10 million this year. I appreciate that this represents a decrease in spending as a percentage of GDP as the economy expands, but it is €10 million extra. The aid budget is now €651 million against a backdrop where, since 2011, the taxpayer has contributed approximately €4.5 billion during very tough years and extremely difficult economic times. This is a testament to the commitment of the Irish people, and we have a responsibility as legislators to continue that pattern and that pathway. However, 0.7% is still the target. If we were to reach it today, we would be talking about €930 million. That is just short of €1 billion.Everybody is realistic and realises that cannot happen overnight. I want to work with my colleagues across parties, and with the stakeholders, the NGOs and the officials in Irish Aid, on a pathway towards achieving the 0.7% target over time. I make that call today. People are aware of the many figures and statistics that are flying around. Some 65 million people have been displaced because of conflict today and 795 million are affected by hunger in their daily lives. The statistics are alarming. The Irish people understand that and know we have to do something. We need to be proactive in that work. I thank all the officials in my section and in Irish Aid for their continued work and their continued open-mindedness in trying to do things differently and work in different ways trying to link different aspects and not just focusing on development or humanitarian work in isolation. There are intrinsic linkages that they are looking to work on as well. Present in the Visitors Gallery today is Fr. Pádraig Devine, a Roscommon man, who works with the Shalom centre in Nairobi in Kenya. That centre is looking at ways to address the root causes of conflict. We have our own story to tell of going from conflict to peace in this country. We can add to that conversation. I look forward to deliberations in Nairobi at the end of November where we are bringing stakeholders together. The Shalom centre will be centrally involved in that. I appreciate that we have issues in our country. There is a commitment within the Irish psyche to continue to work and to help people who are most disadvantaged, including the 80 million children whose education is affected on a day-to-day basis. We have a commitment and a responsibility. Tá an dualgas orainn uilig. We all have a responsibility don chéad ghlúin eile. We have that responsibility to the next generation. Téann sé ó ghlúin go glúin. Tugaim m’aitheantas arís do na hAirí, na Teachtaí Donohoe agus Noonan, maidir leis an ngealltanas sa bhuiséad do chúnamh forbartha thar lear agus gabhaim mo bhuíochas freisin leis na hAirí Stáit, na Teachtaí Canney agus Doyle.

Tá sé curtha síos agam le coicíos anuas agus anois is féidir linn é a phlé. Mar atá a fhios ag an Aire Stáit, is scéim iontach tábhachtach é scéim na gcúntóirí teanga. Is é príomhchuspóir na scéime ná an Ghaeilge – ár dteanga dhúchais agus céad teanga an Stáit – a neartú mar theanga labhartha i measc aos óg na Gaeltachta. Tá an scéim riartha ag dá eagras thar ceann a Roinne. Is iad san Muintearas Teo. agus Oidhreacht Chorca Dhuibhne Teo. Táim cinnte go n-aontóidh an tAire liom nuair a deirim go ndéanann an dá eagras sin obair ar leith mar chuid dá ról chun an scéim seo a sheachadadh. Ar ndóigh, agus táim ag labhairt mar dhuine as an Ghaeltacht, níl léamh nó scríobh nó inse béil ar cé chomh fóinteach agus tairbheach é scéim na gcúntoirí teanga agus níl aon dul as againn ach an cuidiú a thugann an tionscnamh do dhaltaí ón Ghaeltacht a aithint ó thaobh sealbhú na teanga agus cothú na Gaeilge. An fhadhb atá ann, agus tá a fhios ag an Aire Stáit é go damanta maith, ná go bhfuilimid buailte leis an 13 Deireadh Fómhair agus níl an scéim i bhfeidhm go fóill. D'fhág an tAire Stáit go dtí mhí Mheán Fómhair chun an scéim a fhógairt. Ansan nuair a d'fhógair sé an scéim agus chuir sé an t-airgead ar fáíl do na heagraíochtaí, Muintearas Teo. ach go háirithe, ní raibh airgead ar fáil fá choinne an scéim sin a riaradh. Tuigim go bhfuil sé sin ceartaithe anois ag an Aire Stáit agus go bhfuil airgead curtha ar fáil leis an scéim a riaradh. Caithfidh an tAire Stáit admháil, áfach, leis an moill a chuir sé ar an scéim anseo, go bhfuil poist eile faighte ag daoine anois a bhí dífhostaithe nuair a bhí an scoilbhliain thart ag tús an tsamhraidh agus go mbeidh fadhbanna ann cúntóirí teanga a thabhairt isteach chuig chuid de na scoileanna seo. Ceann de na fadhbanna móra atá fós ann ná gur fhógair an tAire Stáit ar Raidió na Gaeltachta go raibh 13 scoil bhreise le bheith páirteach sa scéim. D'fhógair sé go raibh Pobalscoil na Rossan, Scoil Náisiúnta an Chéidigh, Scoil Náisiúnta Mhín na Gabhann agus Scoil Náisiúnta an Bhrocaigh i mo chontae féin, Tír Chonaill, le bheith páirteach sa scéim úr. Chuir sé fáilte roimhe sin agus chuirimid uilig fáilte roimhe, ach níl sé ag cur ar fáil airgead ar bith go dtí seo chuig na heagraíochtaí leis an scéim sin a riaradh.  An cheist atá agam ar an Aire Stáit inniu ná seo. An bhfuil sé chun an €40,000 – sin an t-airgead atá i gceist agus sin €3,200 ar an mheán do gach scoil – do na 13 scoil sin sa dóigh is go mbeidh cúntóirí teanga sna scoileanna sin mar a d'fhógair sé seachtain ó shin ar Raidió na Gaeltachta?

Tá sé tábhachtach do na cúntóirí teanga chomh maith agus ba cheart go mbeadh siadsan sna ranganna ag tús na míosa seo caite. Cuireadh moill ar an bhfógra ón Aire Stáit. Nuair a rinne sé é i lár mhí Mheán Fómhair, dúirt sé go mbeidh scoil bhreise sa scéim. Dúírt sé é féin é ar Raidió na Gaeltachta agus eisean an Aire Stáit le freagracht as an nGaeltacht. I ndiaidh sin, dúirt duine gur botún a bhí ann agus nach raibh cinnteacht ar bith leis. Más botún a bhí ann agus muna raibh cinnteacht ar bith, rinneadh brachán ceart de seo. Tá súil agam go mbeidh dea-scéal aige inniu, go mbeidh an airgead breise ann chun an scéim a riaradh agus go mbeidh na scoileanna breise, mar a dúirt an Teachta Ó Dochartaigh, Pobalscoil na Rosann, Scoil Náisiúnta an Chéidigh, Scoil Náisiúnta an Bhrocaigh agus Scoil Náisiúta Mhín na Gabhann, san áireamh. Táimid beagnach ag deireadh mhí Dheireadh Fómhair. Beidh briseadh ag teacht ag deireadh na míosa seo agus is dóigh nach mbeidh páistí sna scoileanna go dtí an mhí seo chugainn. Beidh airgead á shábháil ag an Roinn agus b'fhéidir gurb é sin an fáth a cuireadh moill leis seo. Iarraim ar an Aire Stáit a chur in iúl dúinn inniu go mbeidh an scéim seo ag tosú go luath agus go mbeidh daoine á chur faoi agallamh do na ceithre scoil bhreise, chomh maith le scoileanna eile, b'fhéidir, má tá na daoine ar shiúl go dtí jabanna eile. Tá an scéim seo fíor-thábhachtach. Tá sibh ag caint faoi iniúchadh anois. Ceapaimse féin go bhfuilimid ag fáil luach ar ár gcuid airgid agus Muintearas Teo. ag rialú na scéime seo.

Is deas an rud é go bhfuil beagán Gaeilge sa Teach inniu. Anois, fear eile a bhfuil go maith ag an nGaeilge, an tAire Stáit, an Teachta Kyne.
#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	121	Táim buíoch de na Teachtaí as an ábhar tábhachtach seo a ardú liom. Tá sé ardaithe freisin cheana féin ag mo chomhghleacaí, an tAire Stáit, Teachta Joe McHugh. Bunaíodh scéim na gcúntóirí teanga in 1999 chun an Ghaeilge a Iáidriú mar theanga Iabhartha i measc ghasúir bunscoile, go háirithe chun cuidiú le páistí nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge mar phríomh-theanga acu nó páistí a dteastaíonn tuilleadh cabhrach uathu chun a nGaeilge a shealbhú. Is ar ghníomhaíochtaí a thugann deiseanna chun cur leis an teanga, nó é a shealbhú, go príomha a dhíríonn an scéim. Tógann sé san áireamh scéalaíocht, rannta, drámaí beaga, cluichí, srl. Is mar thacaíocht d’fhoireann teagaisc na scoile a bhíonn siad ag feidhmiú dá réir. Faoi láthair, má theastaíonn ó scoil páirt a ghlacadh sa scéim, ní mór do bhord bainistíochta na scoile iarratas a dhéanamh leis an eagraíocht atá i gceannas na scéime sa cheantar agus an Roinn a bheith sásta gurb í an Ghaeilge teanga teagaisc na scoile.Mar go raibh an scéim ag díriú orthu siúd nach raibh mórán Gaeilge acu, bhí na scoileanna den tuairim nach raibh mórán buntáistí inti do chainteoirí líofa Gaeilge. Mar thoradh ar an athbhreithniú sin, déantar freastal ar leith ar na páistí a bhfuil an Ghaeilge ar a dtoil acu agus cuirtear breis gníomhaíochtaí faoi leith ar siúl a chuireann le deiseanna saibhrithe teanga. Cheadaigh mé suim de bheagnach €719,000 don togra seo le déanaí. Cé gur laghdú a bhí anseo ar an méid a ceadaíodh le dhá bhliain anuas, ní raibh aon ghearradh siar déanta ar an mhaoiniú don obair a dhéanann na cúntóirí féin. Is iad na costais riaracháin nach raibh clúdaithe san allúntas sin. Tuigtear dom anois áfach, ó Údarás na Gaeltachta, go bhfuil sé i gceist acu iniúchadh a dhéanamh láithreach ar struchtúr, maoiniú agus feidhmeanna Mhuintearas Teo. Sa chomhthéacs sin, tá cinneadh déanta agam airgead riaracháin a íoc leis an dá eagraíocht don scoilbhliain 2016-17 agus beidh na socruithe sin á gcur i bhfeidhm láithreach. Tá súil agam dá bhrí sin go mbeidh na cúintóirí in ann dul i mbun oibre chomh luath agus is féidir. Maidir le ceist na scoileanna breise atá luaite ag an Teachta, tá iarrtha agam ar oifig mo Roinne moltaí ina thaobh sin a chur faoi mo bhráid go luath. Tá mé sásta i bprionsabal cúnamh a chur ar fáil i gcás scoileanna breise ag lorg cúntóirí ach gach cás ar leith a bheith pléite agus aontaithe leis an Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna ar dtús i gcomhthéacs athbhreithniú níos leithne ar an scéim. Is é sin an chaoi a oibríonn rudaí do chuile scoil. Is fiú a lua chomh maith go bhfuil moltaí polasaí don soláthar oideachais Ghaeltachta curtha ar fáil ag an Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna. Tá bailchríoch á chur ar an obair sin faoi láthair agus súil go mbeidh sé foilsithe go luath. Tagann scéim na gcúntóirí teanga faoin mbrat seo agus tá sé aontaithe leis an Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna go ndéanfar athbhreithniú ar scéim na gcúntóirí teanga mar chuid den pholasaí nua seo. Ar ndóigh, bhí sé seo geallta i Straitéis 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge chomh maith.

Tá sé seachtaine caillte ní hamháin ag na páistí seo ó thaobh cúntóirí teanga, ach fosta ag daoine sa Ghaeltacht a bheadh fostaithe dá mbeadh an scéim seo riaraithe mar is ceart. Níl sé maith go leor go raibh an moill sin curtha ar an scéim. Mar a dúirt mé, níl achan duine a bhí ag obair sa scéim sin anuraidh ar fáil i mbliana siocair an moill a cuireadh ar an scéim. Dúirt an tAire Stáit go gcuirfear an t-airgead ar fáil fá choinne an scoilbhliana 2016-17. Caithfimid cinnteacht a fháil i bhfad níos luaithe go mbeidh an tseirbhís seo ar fáil do na scoileanna ag tús mí Mheán Fómhair na bliana seo chugainn nuair atáimid ag tarraingt ar an scoilbhliain 2018-19. I mo thuairim, thug daoine taobh istigh den Roinn eolas contráilte don Aire Stáit maidir leis na scoileanna breise. Rinne an tAire Stáit plé mór i dtaobh an ábhair seo nuair a d'fhógair sé, agus rud maith a bhí ann, go mbeadh 13 scoil bhreise páirteach sa scéim seo.

Níl ach €40,000 de dhíth. Fágfaidh mé mar seo é. Táimid ag caint ar €40,000 fá choinne na páistí agus na scoileanna seo. Is féidir an t-airgead sin a fháil taobh istigh den Roinn. Níl ach 26 seachtain fágtha. Iarraim ar an Aire Stáit a thuairim a thabhairt dúinn nuair a sheasann sé arís. An mbeidh na scoileanna breise clúdaithe?

Tá cúpla ceist agam go fóill. Cén uair, agus deireadh ag teacht le mí Dheireadh Fómhair, an mbeidh cead tugtha do na cúntóirí teanga dul isteach sna ranganna? Ní thuigim céard a bhí i gceist ag an Aire Stáit nuair a dúirt sé "maidir le ceist na scoileanna breise atá luaite ag an Teachta, tá iarrtha agam ar oifig mo Roinne moltaí ina thaobh sin a chur faoi mo bhráid go luath". Ba é an tAire Stáit a thug ainmneacha na scoileanna nuair a d'fhógair sé an scéim seo ar Raidió na Gaeltachta. Ní miste liom cad a tharla idir an tAire Stáit agus a chuid oifigeach. Chuir an tAire Stáit an t-eolas seo ar fáil. Caithfimid ceacht a fhoglaim ón méid atá tarlaithe. Tá an tAire Stáit sa Roinn seo ar feadh na míonna anois. Caithfimid a chinntiú, is cuma cén Aire nó Aire Stáit a bheidh ann an bhliain seo chugainn, go mbeidh na gcúntóirí teanga ag dul isteach sna scoileanna ag tús mí Mheán Fómhair achan uile bhliain.

Aontáim leis an Teachta faoi sin. Tá an ceart ag an Teachta Gallagher gur fhógair mé na scoileanna sin ar an raidió. Mar a dúirt mé ina dhiaidh sin, ba cheart dom bheith níos cúramaí ó thaobh an ábhair seo as seo amach. Tá sé ráite liom ag na feidhmeannaigh sa Roinn go bhfuil sé i gceist na scoileanna seo a cheadú. Caithfear cinntiú a fháil ón Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna gur scoileanna Gaeltachta iad agus go bhfuil siad ag múineadh trí mheán na Gaeilge.

#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	125	There could hardly have been a more blatant demonstration of the blindness of the warmongers in this House as when the leaders of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael were crying war crimes against Russia and the Syrian Government last week. When the US-led coalition started bombing the daylights out of Syria in September 2014, Deputies had nothing to say, even though the death toll tripled almost immediately. As our trade partner Saudi Arabia, and friends, continue to do daily war crimes in Yemen, indiscriminately killing civilians with tanks, combat aircraft, air to ground missiles, white phosphorous and cluster bombs, sold to them by the United States, Deputies say nothing. The Russians followed in to Syria - about one year after the French and US involvement - in order to boost their friend Bashar al-Assad. We have never, ever defended the Russian position, but neither will we defend the United States', the French or the Saudi position in Syria. I find it nauseating that people in this House will actually select who they will criticise of those who are bombing any country. As a neutral State that does not want to take part in war we should be criticising anyone who bombs anywhere. Last week the Unites States' war in Afghanistan was 15 years old. I was at a commemoration for it in Shannon on Sunday. Ireland has been with the United States every step of the way, bending over backwards for the US war machine. A group of physicists in the United States - because the US military does not count bodies, it is all just collateral damage - have researched statistics that show that up to 2.1 million civilians have been killed by the United States military since 2001 in Afghanistan and Iraq. It is horrific and Ireland has helped the United States with the use of Shannon Airport. Today, 1,000 unaccompanied minors face eviction from Calais and we are not prepared to help them. I recall Members saying in the House that unaccompanied minors would be picked out for special concern, but we have done nothing about them. To the best of my knowledge there has been just one unaccompanied minor brought in to Ireland in the last two years. Where do these unaccompanied minors come from? Only from countries the US has bombed the living daylights out of, and we allowed the US to use Shannon Airport to do so. Now we are not prepared to do anything for these people. The French have admitted they are about to clear the southern side of the camp in Calais. They cleared the northern side in the spring and 129 unaccompanied minors disappeared. I do not want to go into where we suspect they may have ended up. It is horrific. There are more than 1,000 of them in the camp and the southern side of the camp is about to be cleared by the French, despite the fact that up to eight NGOs in France are trying to take legal action to stop it. Several weeks ago, I heard the Minister state here that it was a good idea to clear the camp. It is horrific. The British have agreed to take in 300 and the French state they have capacity to cope with 276 of these minors. Can Ireland step up to the mark and do something? Can we play some sort of a role, given that we do not have clean hands because of our facilitation of Shannon Airport to the US military? I ask the Minister of State to talk to the people who make the decisions.
#CatherineByrne	unknown-#CatherineByrne-party	unknown-#CatherineByrne-dob	unknown-#CatherineByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	126	I am taking this topical issue debate on behalf of the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality who cannot be here this afternoon. As the Tánaiste recently outlined in responses to a number of parliamentary questions on this issue, we should be clear there is no official refugee or migrant camp in Calais. Calais does not fall under the EU relocation or resettlement decisions that Ireland has opted into, and therefore the people in Calais are not eligible for the Irish refugee protection programme because they are under the jurisdiction of the French authorities and have the right to apply for international protection in France. The French authorities recently announced they will close the unofficial migrant camp in Calais by the end of this year and will move the approximately 9,000 inhabitants to new accommodation in reception centres throughout the country. This is being done to protect the security of the people of Calais, to maintain public order and to ensure dignified conditions for the migrants and refugees living in the Calais camp, including unaccompanied minors. We also need to bear in mind that a defining characteristic of the people in Calais, including unaccompanied minors, has been their very strong desire to go to the UK as their ultimate destination and that this is unlikely to change. In our sincere efforts to respond to the migrant crisis, it is essential that we do not impose our perspectives or solutions upon them. In this respect, the Tánaiste and I do not see that a unilateral initiative from Ireland would be appropriate in this case, not least given the fact this is a delicate situation involving the borders between two other member states. Deputies are aware that the Government decision to establish the Irish refugee protection programme recognised the importance of prioritising family groups and addressing the position of unaccompanied children. A significant number of those who have arrived to date under the resettlement and relocation elements of the programme are children with one or two parents. Deputies are also aware that when we speak about the Irish refugee protection programme we are referring to relocation from Italy and Greece and resettlement under the UNHCR-led programme which is focused on resettling refugees from camps in Lebanon. With regard to unaccompanied minors, Ireland has formally indicated to Greece our desire to accept unaccompanied minors under the relocation mechanism, and we now have a commitment from the Greek authorities that Ireland will receive the first group of unaccompanied minors before the end of the year. Officials from Tusla, the child and family agency with statutory responsibility for the care of unaccompanied minors in the State, have recently travelled to Greece to assess first-hand the needs of these minors and to plan for their care and accommodation upon arrival.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	127	The Minister of State said Calais is not an official camp so we cannot touch it. Well my God, most places where refugees gather are fairly unofficial. The chances of people fleeing from a place because some country like the US or Russia has bombed the living daylights out of it getting to an official camp are not always great. Travellers have often set up camp on the side of the road in Ireland and they are not always official. There have been hot spots. We are speaking about Italy, Greece and, I believe, we have even looked at Lebanon. We are cherry picking. We have gone out of our way to avoid doing what we should do. We are in denial about the fact we are partially responsible for the fact these people do not feel safe in their homes anymore. It is mind-boggling that the EU is doing a deal with Afghanistan to return migrants in Europe to there. I met people from Afghanistan in the camps in the Calais and Dunkirk. My God, the thoughts of them having to be returned home are a cause of huge concern. They had fallen out with either ISIS or the Taliban, or a member of their family may have worked with the US forces. They would be killed if they went home. It is bad enough that Pakistan is in the process of expelling 3 million refugees back to Afghanistan and the west does not give a damn. Who invaded Afghanistan in the first place? It was the US in 2001, with our help through Shannon Airport. We destroyed the place. God help us and save us, do not tell us Calais is an unofficial camp. So many Irish people have been there trying to help these people survive. I have text on my telephone from a fellow called Abdul. I met him out there. He is dead. He died two or three weeks ago. He fell off a truck and the truck behind him ran over him. We could do something for these people if we cared. I wish the Government would just do something.

The Tánaiste and I share these concerns and have acted upon them. Unaccompanied minors are an especially vulnerable group and we expect the issue will remain high on the agenda at EU level. I have already stated the measures we are taking under the Irish refugee protection programme to take unaccompanied minors from Greece under the EU relocation programme. Officials from the Department of Justice and Equality and Tusla are working hard to overcome the remaining barriers with the Greek authorities. The relocation of unaccompanied minors is a complex and sensitive process involved in various aspects of European and domestic law. Any actions taken regarding this vulnerable group must have the principles of the best interests of the child and protection of the family reunification at their core. I must reiterate that all migrants in Calais, including unaccompanied minors, are entitled to apply for asylum in France, and applicants for asylum would also commence the process under the Dublin regulation by which an application may be legally transferred to another member state to have their application determined under certain prescribed criteria, including for family reunion.
#MichaelHarty	unknown-#MichaelHarty-party	unknown-#MichaelHarty-dob	unknown-#MichaelHarty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	130	I wish to speak about the review of the national ambulance service in the mid-west. This will include a review of our rapid response units. We in the mid-west are very concerned that these rapid response units will be withdrawn. Six or seven years ago, the services in the mid-west were reconfigured and acute casualties services were withdrawn from the hospitals in Ennis and Nenagh and transferred to the regional hospital in Limerick. In response to this, it was decided to introduce a rapid response unit staffed by advanced paramedics.They look after patients in their homes or at the roadside and provide urgent casualty services prior to transferring them to hospital. They were intended to make up for the lack of casualty services in Ennis and Nenagh hospitals. Unfortunately, in the reconfiguration of hospital services in the mid-west, additional services and beds were not provided in University Hospital Limerick. Consequently, there is a huge trolley crisis at the hospital which is experiencing a huge bed shortage. If the acute paramedic rapid response units are withdrawn, it will be a further blow to medical services in the mid-west. It will be a breach of trust and faith with patients and the population of the mid-west, which is approximately 440,000. Following the review of the ambulance service and the rapid response units, in particular, they need to be maintained or increased but certainly not decreased. The services the rapid response vehicles provide are essential. Paramedics provide a triage service at the site of accidents or for someone with a serious illness; they can call in the helicopter service and stream patients to the most appropriate location, either by ambulance or helicopter to Galway, Limerick or Cork, depending on the illness or injury the person has suffered. This is an important service which is much valued by the community. It has become embedded in the acute services provided in the mid-west.  The out-of-hours services provided by Shannondoc co-operative will be reduced in the near future because there is a lack of GPs in rural Ireland. This is a major problem facing the health service. The Committee on the Future of Healthcare and the Joint Committee on Health have discussed how staff can be recruited and retained, but how can doctors be expected to work and live in a rural community which has no services? No doctor and no village mean no medical service. If the Government continues to erode community services, which has been happening for the past few years, we will end up with an unsustainable service. Community services need to be bolstered, which means more GPs are required. Urgent response units also need to be added. The National Ambulance Service is creaking at the seams. A huge geographical area needs to be covered. I mean no disrespect to ambulance staff because they cannot cope because of the area they have to cover. There are significant delays in ambulances arriving. The rapid response unit is an intermediary which supplies essential services in the mid-west. If the review recommends the removal of, or a reduction in, that service, it will be extremely detrimental to the health of people living in counties Clare and Tipperary.
#CatherineByrne	unknown-#CatherineByrne-party	unknown-#CatherineByrne-dob	unknown-#CatherineByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	131	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. Unfortunately, the Minster for Health cannot be present and he has asked me to take this matter on his behalf.  I welcome the opportunity to address the House on a matter which has been the subject of speculation recently. The National Ambulance Service has undergone a significant process of modernisation in recent years and a number of key reform targets have been reached. They include the establishment of the national emergency operations centre; the delivery of improved technology to improve response times; the development of the intermediate care service to provide lower acuity hospital transfers, thereby freeing up more emergency ambulances to respond to more urgent calls; and the establishment of a permanent emergency aero-medical support service to provide rapid access to appropriate treatment for high acuity patients in remote rural areas where access by land ambulances may be difficult. In the context of the ongoing process of reform and modernisation, the National Ambulance Service continually reviews its operations to ensure the most efficient service can be delivered to the public. To this end, a local review is under way in the mid-west which is focusing on the use of a specific rapid response vehicle in the region. The available data suggest more efficient use could be made of this vehicle in the context of available resources.  Contrary to recent media speculation, there is no question but that the service in the area will not be diminished. In fact, the purpose of the review is to ensure the people of the mid-west will receive the best service possible within available resources. The Minister has been advised that the outcome of the review will be subject to full discussion at national level and that service delivery and enhancement will be an integral part of the discussions. The reform programme is taking place against the backdrop of the HIQA review of ambulance services which was published in late 2014 and the National Ambulance Service capacity review which was published earlier this year. The capacity review which was undertaken by Lightfoot Solutions, a UK-based consultancy firm, examined overall ambulance resource levels and distribution against demand and activity levels. The review found that the National Ambulance Service was presented with a major challenge compared to ambulance services elsewhere, as population density in Ireland is significantly different from that in many other countries. Outside the greater Dublin area the population is widely dispersed, with a relatively large population living in rural areas. This means that response time targets are much more difficult to achieve because of longer driving distances. The report endorses the existing policy of dynamic deployment, whereby vehicles are strategically located where they are most likely to be required, rather than statically deployed, that is, located at a particular station. It is in this context that the review in the mid-west is taking place. The review is fully in line with the National Ambulance Service's key priority to ensure the deployment of the most appropriate resource quickly and efficiently. By optimising operational performance, we are seeking to ensure better outcomes for patients.
#MichaelHarty	unknown-#MichaelHarty-party	unknown-#MichaelHarty-dob	unknown-#MichaelHarty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	132	Nobody better understands population density in rural areas, which is not the same as in Dublin. Therefore, ambulance response times cannot be the same as they are expected to be in Dublin, but that aspect does not concern us; what concerns us is the rapid response vehicles dispatched to the site of seriously ill patients. Many patients who require an ambulance do not require a blue light service and can wait for a reasonable period. I am referring to the rapid response units that attend seriously ill, traumatised patients involved in road traffic accidents and coastal fall incidents who require urgent medical attention. Such a service is needed because of population density and the size of the area covered in west Clare and County Tipperary. Casualty services were removed from Ennis and Nenagh hospitals. While a helicopter service is available to transfer seriously ill patients, it can only be called by an advanced paramedic. It is essential that the rapid response service be maintained and bolstered because those living in rural Ireland should be entitled to the same services as those living in urban areas. We pay the same taxes and should have the same service. We understand we cannot have a casualty department at every crossroads, but the rapid response unit was intended to make up for the withdrawal of casualty services, with services now being provided 60 miles away. I ask the Minister of State to ensure there will be no reduction in the number of rapid response units.

I understand his concerns, particularly as we live in a country with many roads and access is not what it should be for ambulances in rural areas. The rapid response service plays a huge part in attending to ill patients throughout the country. The diminution of the service would be a major disadvantage to people living in rural areas. I will convey the Deputy's concerns to the Minister and assure him that the Minister is very much aware of them. I will reiterate them when I meet him during the week.
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	134	I raise this issue out of sheer frustration. I was not a Member of the Thirty-first Dáil and was absent between 2011 and 2016 but the provision of primary care centres in the greater Clondalkin and Lucan areas has persisted in demonstrating a lack of progress. We are all agreed on the significance of primary care centres and, in response to various replies I have received, I understand the type of services they offer to communities such as nursing, counselling physiotherapy, social work, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy, dieticians, chiropody, podiatry and so forth. In addition to treatment, there is also health education and health awareness, which reduce the burden on acute hospitals. I am at a loss to understand why little or no progress has been made on three specific cases. The first is in Rowlagh, north Clondalkin. A reply to Deputy Micheál Martin in February 2013 states:Rowlagh / North Clondalkin was one of the 35 primary care centres announced under the infrastructure stimulus package in July 2012. Approximately 20 will be offered ... The preparatory work for the primary care centre project which precedes signing of any PPP agreements is well underway. While it is not possible, at this time, to give start and completion dates for any of the individual 20 potential locations, the best estimate is that these primary care centres will be completed by late 2016.As time went on and nothing was progressing, I pursued the issue with other questions. At the end of last year I was told it was intended to lodge planning permission in early 2016. This summer the response was that the HSE was finalising the development of the primary care centre with the Department of Education and Skills and that the agreement between the HSE and the Department of Education and Skills was subject to planning permission being granted for the development. Furthermore, the HSE had engaged a design team which had completed the preliminary design. As it stands today, there is no application for planning. Considering the fact that the Department of Education and Skills and the HSE are agencies of the State, it is appalling that since the announcement in 2012 so little progress has been made. A site is available, there is a clearly identified need but there has been no progress. The first project is the worst case because the State has control over all elements. There are two further cases, however. One is in Clondalkin village in regard to which the reply to a question of mine was that the developer had advised the HSE that he intended to sell his interest as he was not in a position to complete the development. The HSE has consented to the sale, subject to the terms and conditions of the original agreement being met, while the developer is currently disposing of his interest in the site and it is currently on the market. When the sale of the site is concluded, the HSE will engage with the new owners to establish a timeframe for the completion of the primary care centre development. Again, the HSE is sitting around passively and it may take a very long time, in the current climate, to dispose of it. The third case is in Lucan. I was told that the proposed development of a primary care centre was via an operational lease. An Bord Pleanála refused permission for the lease and the preferred developer has withdrawn. I was told that the HSE intended to explore options for the delivery of a primary care centre for Lucan. My concern for this and the Clondalkin project is that they were under a lease agreement, in partnership with developers, and the HSE is not being proactive with them in looking for a solution. It states that it intends to explore options but this work should be actively pursued. It is now six months since planning permission was refused by An Bord Pleanála. I know this is not the Minister of State's area of responsibility but I have brought it to the floor of the House because, having pursued this with parliamentary question after parliamentary question, the wording of the response has been good but the action terrible in respect of all three cases.
#CatherineByrne	unknown-#CatherineByrne-party	unknown-#CatherineByrne-dob	unknown-#CatherineByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-10-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	135	On behalf of the Minister, Deputy Harris, I thank Deputy Curran for raising this issue. The Programme for a Partnership Government commits to a decisive shift towards primary care so that we can provide better care close to home for communities around the country. Primary care centres are an integral part of this because of the range of multi-disciplinary services they can provide and the role they can play in keeping people who do not need to be in an acute setting out of hospital. I can advise the Deputy that 93 primary care centres, PCCs, are already operational, of which 50 were opened from 2011 to date in 2016. At present, there are 48 locations where primary care infrastructure is under construction or at an advanced planning stage, under three different methods of delivery, namely, 14 by direct build, 14 by public private partnership and 20 by operational lease. The mechanism and timescale for delivery of primary care centres is dependent on a number of factors, some of which are outside the control of the HSE. Delivery of primary care infrastructure is a dynamic process, constantly evolving to take account of changing circumstances, including the feasibility of implementation. Regardless of delivery mechanism, all potential primary care infrastructure is subject to suitable locations being offered or provided or available, subject to successful planning processes and GP commitment to sharing accommodation and delivering health care services with HSE staff. In addition, the operational lease mechanism is subject to market pressures such as the developers' access to adequate financing. Some of these factors are outside the control of the Health Service Executive. In Clondalkin, primary care services are provided from three health centres, Boot Road, Rowlagh and Deansrath. In Lucan, primary care services are provided from two health centres, Lucan village and Rosse Court. The planning permission for the proposed PCC in Lucan, which was to be delivered by the operational lease mechanism, was rejected on appeal by An Bord Pleanála. As a result, the HSE has withdrawn the agreement for lease and is currently investigating alternative options for the provision of a PCC in the area. The HSE's Boot Road health centre site in Clondalkin was identified for redevelopment as a PCC. However, following planning process delays and the preparation of detailed design and tender documents, the developer, who also owns an adjoining site, was unable to source the required finance to develop the entire site, as intended. A number of interested parties have contacted the HSE in regard to the development of a PCC for Clondalkin and I am confident that agreement to provide a new PCC in the area will be achieved. The HSE will ensure that the services currently being delivered from the Boot Road health centre will continue to be delivered in the area until a new PCC is developed. Purchase agreement for the planned PCC for Rowlagh and north Clondalkin, which is to be provided by direct build, is subject to planning permission being granted for the development.

She said she was confident but, having gone through the process for so long, I have a complete lack of confidence in it. I want to pick her up on one thing. The Taoiseach, in his speech to this House yesterday, said, "Funding has also been provided to increase the number of doctor training places, and to deliver on the 80 additional primary care centres around the country." There are not 80 in the plans for the moment. The Minister of State said 93 were opened between 2011 and 2016 and she is correct, but the response I received to a parliamentary question is really interesting because it shows that the momentum for primary care centres has been lost as the economy is recovering, for whatever reason. In 2012, 18 were opened while in the following year, 2013, nine were opened. In 2014, seven were opened and in 2015 five were opened while, to date in 2016, three have been opened. The words are fine but there is no momentum in the project and we are not seeing delivery. The Minister said services were being operated in various locations and she is right but they are not the comprehensive range of services, such as speech and language services, occupational therapy and so forth, that we would have in a proper designated primary care centre. That is the difference and I think the Minister knows that.These three projects have been around the block numerous times. One of them is in the full control of various arms of the State via the Department of Education and Skills and the HSE. There is a need for more urgency. The other two, which require third-party intervention because they involve lease agreements or public private partnership arrangements, have stumbled. One of them is dead in the water because An Bord Pleanála has refused it. The Department needs to be much more proactive.  There was a time when if a Deputy asked a question on primary care centres, the answer was provided by the Minister. If one asks a question in that regard now, the Minister refers it to the HSE for reply. Primary care centres, in terms of the impact they could have on acute hospital services in our communities, are not delivering in the areas of speech and language, occupational therapy and so on. All of these services are missing. There is a need for greater urgency. I reiterate that only three centres will be delivered this year. Five were delivered last year. This process has ground to a halt in the past number of years and I do not know the reason for this. This issue must be addressed. I appreciate that the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, is not the line Minister with responsibility in this regard.

I know he is frustrated but I am unable to provide any more information. However, I assure the Deputy, as I did Deputy Harty, that I will raise this issue with the Minister on his return. What is important for me is that people get a proper service. Like Deputy Curran, I work with people in areas where primary care centres are important. They make a huge difference in communities in terms of the services they provide. I agree with Deputy Curran that we need to be more proactive. For my part, I will nail the Minister down on this issue, following which I will get back to the Deputy on it.
