#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	4	Does the Tánaiste propose to make a statement on pensions?  There are two reports on the issue but no legislative proposals from the Government.  Some €9 billion, or 5%, has been wiped off the value of Irish pensions in the past month and citizens are extremely concerned as a consequence.  One should contrast the position on private pensions with that on ministerial pensions.  This issue is of grave concern.  Does the Tánaiste propose to comment on the matter and are we to have a debate on it?I have noticed some Ministers and Fianna Fáil Members talking about consensus, particularly in regard to the health service.  I understand the Government is to publish legislation on contributions towards nursing home payments soon.  The document, Guide to A Fair Deal: The Nursing Home Care Support Scheme 2008, cites a number of examples of the proposals for those entering public or private nursing homes.  This matter will be of serious concern nationwide and affect every single household at some stage or other.  In the context of seeking consensus, will the Government publish the heads of the Bill about which it is talking in order that members of all parties and none can focus on this issue which is critical for the entire population?  Will the Tánaiste agree to this in order that we can focus on the elements of the debate on which decisions will have to be made, given that people accept the principle of making a contribution towards the cost of a health service?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	5	There is no specific debate promised in the House but there is a debate taking place on pensions arising from the detailed actuarial reviews and the Green Paper on pensions.  As many as 32 written submissions have been forwarded to the Minister for Social and Family Affairs on foot of publication of that important document.  There were over 2,000 hits on the website, which demonstrates people's interest in the matter.Owing to the complexity and importance of the pensions issue, consultation on the options that should be considered in the coming months represents the best way to proceed.  The House can, with the agreement of the Whips, debate this matter at any time deemed appropriate to all Members.  A debate has already taken place in the Seanad.There has been considerable market turbulence in recent months which has affected many sectors.  It is a question of ensuring the return of market stability as quickly as possible.  That is what we are trying to achieve at European and every other level.  Clearly, the issue will ebb and flow as market sentiment changes.On the nursing homes legislation, the Bill is due to be taken in the House this session.  I must speak to the Minister for Health and Children about whether it would be helpful to produce the heads of the Bill at this stage, given that the legislation should be published in full in the coming weeks.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	6	It is due to take effect from 1 January 2008.  The Budget Statement will be presented in two weeks.  Therefore, time is limited.  Obviously, this is an issue, the full details of which every Deputy wants to see.  I thought it might be helpful if the Minister provided us with the heads of the Bill, as drafted.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	7	Will the Tánaiste tell us what the problem is in respect of the production of Government legislation?  For many in the House during all the years they have been here, there has never been such a dearth of Government legislation as we have seen in recent weeks.  Of the 21 hours of Dáil business this week, only two have been devoted to dealing with Government legislation.  Only two of the 17 Bills on the Government's list of legislation for this session have been published.  The last Bill we saw — the Roads Bill — was in the end finished off through the use of the guillotine.  What is the problem?  Is it a political problem among the parties in government about the detailed nature of the various pieces of legislation or is there a problem in respect of staffing in the Office of the Attorney General?  There must be some problem.I endorse Deputy Kenny's comments.  Will we now see a rush of Bills by the Government in the week or so before Christmas, the debate on all of which will be guillotined, without an opportunity for the House to discuss them properly?  The Labour Party and the rest of the Opposition parties have introduced more Bills in this session than the Government parties.Today, we are again facing a long debate and no legislation.  Members on the Government benches are essentially going through the motions of coming in to chat about worthy motions.  We could all adjourn to the coffee shop, sit in a few comfortable armchairs and have a chat, but we are here to deal with legislation, not just to have vague chats.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	8	The purpose of Parliament is not exclusively to deal with legislation.  In many cases, one could talk about over-regulated areas in the economy.  In my honest opinion, the question of the consolidation and repeal of legislation should be as much a part of the agenda as the issue of introducing more legislation.I do not believe in relegating important debates in plenary session when there has been so much criticism about the volume of activity delegated to committees of the House.  Given the criticism that there was very little coverage of committee sessions during which Deputies worked away at legislation and discussed important issues of State or policy, many Members validly believe that we should in plenary session discuss important issues such as climate change and energy security, key strategic issues not only for this country but also for Europe and the wider world.  That is a good development.That the efficacy of the House is determined by the level of legislation dealt with, be it good, bad or indifferent, is a very narrow view of the role that this Parliament can play in leading national debate.  A considerable number of bad and indifferent Bills have come from the Opposition.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	9	I have asked the Tánaiste several questions on a particular issue.  In the programme for Government the Government promised to introduce a carbon budget or, as the Tánaiste described it, a carbon report, to be followed by the production by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government of a detailed carbon budget.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	10	Does the Deputy have a relevant question?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	11	Can we receive the details of this?  Will one of the Government members give us the details of the carbon report today?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	12	We cannot pre-empt the debate.  No doubt, the question will be answered during the course of the day.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	13	Will they tell us how it will be laid out?I have a question about the legislation which relates to the crash in the stock market.  The Government promised to introduce the financial services regulation Bill to simplify financial regulation.  In many cases, persons approaching retirement who hold pensions and have AVCs, in which the Government encouraged people to invest, are seeing their savings being vastly reduced.  This country has the highest charges on investment and financial services products of any country.  Does the Tánaiste propose to regulate the industry in the interests of orderly economic development rather than those of the "masters of the universe" of the banking world?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	14	If there has been an example of the successful modernisation of the country it has been in the financial services sector.  This party is very proud to have been the author and implementer of that policy which has resulted in the creation of tens of thousands of well paid jobs in this country and enhanced our reputation internationally as a place in which to do business.The financial services legislation referred to by Deputy Burton is about a full modernisation and consolidation of legislation introduced over many years.  Having completed the preparations during the course of next year, I hope to bring it to the House for enactment.  In the meantime, I have set up a working group which will liaise with the industry and wider interests to ensure this exercise will improve the business climate for the further progression and expansion of financial services.The regulatory regime in place, which was introduced by my predecessor, is a model of how to modernise regulatory arrangements in Ireland and is seen to apply best practice.  There are many considerations which must be very carefully managed and handled.  This Parliament's record of enacting modern legislation is second to none.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19975	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	15	I hope that when there is the opportunity to do so, the Tánaiste's welcome for relevant debates in the House will stretch to entertaining Opposition proposals for such debates and that he is not just citing scripture when it suits him.Everyone is concerned about the worrying international trends in recent days and weeks.  In the light of this, will the Tánaiste revise any of his pre-budget forecasts in respect of the economy?  Will we know this before budget day because, obviously, it will be of importance in framing the appropriate budget we should have?My second question relates to the statement issued yesterday by the Data Protection Commissioner that he has serious doubts about the quality of data security measures in Irish public bodies.  This comes after the huge security breach in the United Kingdom.  Will the Tánaiste look at the existing legislative framework to ensure there will be tighter auditing and reportage of standards in order that we can have an assurance that there will not be such a breach in Ireland?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	16	It is true that the Deputy has always been a proponent of holding more debates in the House, yet there are members on the Opposition benches who would regard the holding of more debates in the House as in some way a dereliction of the duty of the House and consider that we should have more legislation all the time.  When the Opposition co-ordinates its position, it will help us figure out what it wants.As the Deputy is aware, the last pre-budget outlook outlined the then position based on the available evidence.  The next time we will make public our position will be on budget day, as normal.  I do not anticipate the outcome but, obviously, we will take into account all relevant considerations and updated data that become available between now and then.In respect of personal data security, public service bodies, like any other organisations and individuals holding personal data, are subject to the requirements of the Data Protection Acts 1998 and 2003 which provide for the appropriate compilation, storage and use of personal data held by them.  Among the requirements placed on organisations and individuals in respect of the management of personal data is the need to keep them secure against unauthorised access.  Specific statutory provisions provide that appropriate security measures should be taken against unauthorised access to or unauthorised alteration, disclosure or destruction of data, in particular where the processing involves the transmission of data over a network, and against all other unlawful forms of processing.  Organisations and individuals holding personal data must register annually with the Data Protection Commissioner.  This registration involves the giving of details of the personal data held.  Under our legislative framework, organisations must also designate a data controller who will have statutory responsibility for compliance by organisations with the provisions of the Acts.Regarding the issue raised about their adequacy, in October the Government decided that all Departments and Offices should review the systems and procedures in place to protect the confidentiality of personal data and prevent its improper release.  My Department is asking all Departments to report on these reviews, detailing the general systems and procedures in place, the arrangements for the transfer of data and the audit facilities accompanying such systems and procedures and how these procedures are reviewed and how it is ensured they are followed properly.  These reviews should be completed early in the new year.

It is a few weeks since the Taoiseach told the House he had sought the advice of the Attorney General on whether a referendum was required on the reform treaty and the circumstances in which it would happen.  Has the Attorney General furnished the Cabinet with a reply?  What are its terms and will the Government publish the advice?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	21	It is not normal practice to publish the advice of the Attorney General to the Government on any matter.

#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	24	In reply to a question from my colleague, Deputy Burton, earlier this year the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform gave a breakdown of the numbers of employees and volunteers submitted for vetting.  Only three sports organisations and fewer than 1,000 employees were included.  What happened to the Garda vetting Bill?  It has disappeared from the legislative programme.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	25	I cannot provide an answer this morning.  It is not on the list but I will attempt to convey a reply to the Deputy.

Is it intended to revise or repeal the Waste Management Act?  I hope the Minister will clarify the matter.  It could have serious implications for the rest of the country.  I hope the Minister is not hugging incinerators this morning.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	31	I invite the Tánaiste to respond on the Electricity (Transfer of Transmission Assets) Bill and the Waste Management Act.

In the light of the fact that thousands are attending public meetings, trying to get some information on the health implications of the proposed interconnector between counties Meath, Cavan, Monaghan and Tyrone, stretching 138 km——
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	37	That question has been answered.

It is time for the Government to come clean.  When will the Health Information Bill be published in order that we can discuss the matter?  When will the Electricity Regulation (EirGrid)(Amendment) Bill be published to afford us the opportunity to discuss the matter in the House?  I asked for time on Tuesday to discuss it.  I do not mind how it is arranged, as long as we have time to discuss this serious issue which is causing much rancour.  This House seems to be irrelevant.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	39	The Health Information Bill will provide a legislative framework for the governance of information in the health sector.  Work has commenced on the drafting of a discussion document in preparation for the regulatory impact analysis and public consultation on the proposal.  The matter is at a preliminary stage.Regarding the Electricity Regulation (EirGrid)(Amendment) Bill which will provide for a statutory underpinning of EirGrid plc to build and own an east-west electricity interconnector, analysis of all the issues involved is under way in the Department.  The strategic importance of a North-South interconnector, in view of the debate on energy security, will be discussed in the House today.  I ask Members to desist from unwarranted raising of hares in respect of the matter, particularly given the contention that placing the interconnector underground could increase the cost by up to ten times compared to the provision of pylons in the normal way.

There is a new Government and a vote by workers in the ESB threatens industrial action.  We also have a change of view on the part of the European Commission regarding the break-up of national utilities.  There was no mention of the break-up of EirGrid and the ESB in the Green Paper on energy.  A debate seems timely.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	49	There is a debate on climate change and energy security today.  If that is not an opportunity to raise the issue, I do not know what is.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	50	No. 15 in the Government legislative programme, the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill, is expected to be published before the beginning of next session.  Its purpose is described as establishing an officials compliance committee regarding the OECD Convention on Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions.  The difficulty is that the Government's White Paper on aid commits to ratification of the UN convention against all corruption.  Is it the Government's intention, as declared in the White Paper on aid, to ratify the UN convention, or is the proposed legislation a substitute?There are at least 20 international instruments that Ireland signed at the United Nations awaiting ratification.The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is the lead Department in respect of most of these instruments.  By way of being positive, is it the Tánaiste's intention to create the capacity within Departments to draft legislation rather than having it done by the Attorney General's office?  In light of the recent paucity of legislation, is the Government considering farming out the drafting of Bills in order that we might have a realistic legislative programme for forthcoming sessions?We have been down this road with previous administrations and the same old reply, namely, that additional resources have been made available to the Office of the Attorney General, is always given.  There is no point in avoiding the central point that a problem exists in the context of the drafting of legislation and this is apparent in each Department and in the Government's legislative programme.If, for example, the Government intends to abandon the ratification of the United Nations Convention against Corruption in the same way it abandoned the ratification of the UN Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrants and Members of their Families——

I am not an expert in this area but it seems that the Bill may not specifically relate to the UN Convention to which the Deputy refers.

Last night I raised a matter on the Adjournment, in the context of an article that appeared in one of the newspapers, regarding a problem, the abuse of drugs, that is proving a scourge in our cities and communities.  I went home very disappointed.  I spent a great deal of time preparing what I had to say and the Minister, in her goodness, listened to my comments before reading a prepared statement on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Carey.  As a newly elected Deputy, I was extremely disappointed that, following the amount of time I spent preparing, the Minister did not have an opportunity to reply in her own right.  That is a shame.

The role of this House is to give time to issues and go into detail on them which may not be easily addressed in a legislative discussion.  The broad issues of climate change and energy security which we address today are worthy of our time, attention and discussion.This debate is timely.  The price of oil peaked at approximately $100 per barrel during the past week and we will send representatives to the UNFCC conference on climate change in Bali within the next two weeks.  A common understanding on why we will take a position and what position we will take will be of benefit.  We need a wider debate throughout the country on these two issues, particularly climate change.  While it is a news story and has been topical in recent years, a sense may exist that it has become an old story overnight.  People feel they have heard it and are now ignoring it.The Irish people need a far greater understanding of the true extent of the challenge presented by climate change and the importance of our response.  The people need simple understanding of the significance of the science of climate change, which is now undisputed and clear.  The gap in understanding the issue is stark.  A recent survey which asked English people their views on climate change showed that in a country which is home to some of the leading climate change scientists and where the newspapers and other media take a leading role in highlighting the issue, at least two thirds of the population do not have a core belief that the science held up.  It behoves us as politicians to lead our people by understanding the science of climate change.According to the latest IPCC report we should fear allowing the world to go beyond a 2° increase in average global temperature.  This will require a stabilisation of global emissions within ten to 15 years followed by a reduction of at least 50% in emissions over the next 45 years.  This will require developed countries which are historically responsible for most of the emissions which remain in the atmosphere for at least 200 years to consider cutting our emissions by 60% to 80% over this period.This is at a time when projections show that energy use, the main cause of our emissions, is likely to increase by 50% rather than decrease.  The scale of this challenge in the remainder of our lifetimes is beyond any other challenge undertaken by mankind.  If we ignore this challenge, the threat posed is beyond any catastrophe, war, famine or natural disaster which occurred on the planet for hundreds of millions of years.  As politicians responsible for leading our people through the dramatic change ahead of us, we cannot ignore this.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	90	What about the energy conservation programme?
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	91	I will come to the energy conservation programme, but, first, I want to set out the broad facts of the issue.The reason scientists set the tipping point at 2° is because going beyond this could induce catastrophic effects which could cause the deaths of millions of people but also because of the danger that going beyond this would cause a runaway catastrophic effect such as the melting of the polar ice-cap or the releasing of methane from frozen tundra in Siberia where the temperature already increases at a multiple of the average global rate.  This methane is 20 times more potent than carbon dioxide which is the main climate change gas.  The IPCC report stated the summer melt of the ice-caps is occurring at over 10% per decade and the projections of the melt are 30 years ahead of what the models predicted.  Other possible local effects are the collapse of the Amazon rain forest and a major release of carbon into the atmosphere.  This would cause further runaway climate change.We must break certain misconceptions of the Irish people such as that this will be an attractive or benevolent prospect for the Irish climate.  It may not be felt immediately as harshly here as in other areas of the planet.  However, in a country with most of its cities by the sea, such runaway catastrophic change could lead to severe flooding in cities such as Cork, Limerick, Galway and Dublin.  This would have major consequences for us as a people.We must move away from the common response people have when asked about climate change that China and the United States Government are the problem.  They ask why should they act when every week a new coal-fired power station is opened in China.  This is irresponsible and ignores the global situation we face.  The power in China produces the goods we use.  As a leading emitter of greenhouse gases we have a responsibility to do our bit.  We cannot ignore it ourselves and then state that the Chinese Government must act.  While the Chinese and United States governments have crucial roles, if we do not lead they will not take part in the solution.We must shatter the myth that the science might not be true.  People who watched the highly irresponsible and reckless Channel 4 programme, "The Great Global Warming Swindle", immediately thought they could continue as they were and did not have to listen to all the doom and gloom.  This was the response I heard when I canvassed prior to the general election.  This irresponsible attitude must end.  We must be clear and honest with the people that the science is irrefutable and the evidence is certain, and we cannot pretend the science does not hold up.We cannot tell the people we have an easy technological solution and we will find an easy fix around the corner.  No one in the scientific community has shown or believes in an easy fix.  It is not for us to hide behind such simple, trite or unfulfilling answers to this problem.People might consider that the energy security issue undermines the climate change issue, but it does not.  It reconfirms the necessity for us to make the urgent switch away from fossil fuels.  Ireland is highly exposed with regard to the amount of fossil fuels we use.  Approximately 90% of our energy comes from imported fossil fuels.  The average in the European Union is64%.  Approximately 60% of our energy comes from imported oil.  It is increasingly apparent by the day that we can no longer guarantee the easy availability of this oil.The publication two weeks ago of the International Energy Agency's latest world energy outlook was stark in the language it used.  It stated that continuing as we are will lead to an alarming situation.  Last week, newspapers reported on comments made by the chief economist of the International Energy Agency on the simple fact that the world, which uses 85 million barrels of oil per day, will need a replacement for 37 million barrels per day in new production during the next six or seven years, one third to cope with increasing demand and two thirds to cope with the depletion already occurring in the existing oil fields.We obtain the majority of our oil from the North Sea which is depleting by 7% or 8% per annum.  According to the most optimistic prognosis whereby all goes well in Iraq, Venezuela plays a willing role and Iran and the United States do not get into a row, 25 million barrels are available from all the oil fields in the world.  The International Energy Agency shows that we will have a supply difficulty during the next six or seven years, even with the best case scenario.  This is why oil costs $100 per barrel.Already, a difficulty exists in supplying for demand.  As a people, we have to prepare for the geological certainty that supply will decrease and fail to meet rising demand.  An interesting study on the peak in global oil production was conducted by the US Department of Energy several years ago involving Bob Hirsch, who also advised us last year.  It found that rather than simply running out of oil, there will be a peak point, after which availability and supply will decline year on year.  That point may have already arrived, as Texan oilman T. Boone Pickens recently claimed on the grounds that oil supplies have been stuck at 85 million barrels per day for the past two years, or it may occur in ten or 20 years time.  However, the majority of research indicates it will occur within the next decade.  The US Department of Energy study showed that, regardless of the time of arrival, preparations should commence two decades in advance on changing the entire infrastructure because the investments required are long-term.  The cars we purchase today will still be on the road in 15 years time, the roads will be around for 100 years and our power stations will last 40 years.We can see the peak right in front of us, clear as day.  The oil company advertisements in the The Economist  indicate we are approaching an oil supply crunch.  As legislators, we have a responsibility to recognise that fact and to look beyond the next election.  We know the change is coming.  With 60% of Ireland’s energy dependent on imported oil, this is one of the most exposed countries in the world, so it behoves us to change our policies and reduce our dependence on oil.We cannot rely on gas to solve the problem.  Gas will help as an interim technology but we are equally exposed to supply issues.  Even if we bring gas from the Corrib field ashore, it will provide for half our needs for approximately six years but it will not be a long-term solution.  North Sea gas fields, from which we get 85% of our supplies, are depleting by a similarly rapid annual percentage to that of North Sea oil.  We will get a temporary fillip from Norwegian gas but that country recently made a strategic decision against connecting its largest gas field into the UK and Irish markets.  We are inextricably linked to the UK market in this area.  We will be utterly reliant on Russian gas coming through pipelines stretching all the way to Siberia.  Therefore, while gas is an interim fossil fuel we equally have to reduce our dependence on it.  We are overly dependent on it for the production of electricity and in other areas.  We cannot rely on the Russian Government to ensure secure supplies to Ireland at the end of the pipeline.That scenario requires debate on how to completely change our energy infrastructure, farming methods and transport system in order to cope with climate change, peaking global oil production and difficulties in obtaining gas for our economy.  Our response must be part of an international approach and the debate in Bali is crucial in that respect.  I attended last year's climate change talks in Nairobi, at which the issue of what comes after the Kyoto Agreement was addressed.  I got a clear sense from the meeting that the current negotiations are the most important in the history of mankind.  I also realised that the diplomats and politicians attending the meeting will not take the issue seriously until there is widespread public pressure at home.We will have to change our electricity supply systems.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, was correct in saying that extensive grid development will be required to support renewable energy.  It will be politically difficult but we will have to face the task in order to deliver on electricity.  In regard to heating, we will have to set ever higher building standards.  That will be difficult for some people in the construction industry but we will need a collective vision on it because the timeframe involved is much longer than the next four years.  The area of transport will have to be utterly transformed, which will also require changes in the planning system.  Again, that may not be politically easy but the best intentions in planning policy have produced a spread in this country and a dispersed population.  We have to make the switch to sustainable communities.  The experience of my 15-year life in politics is that none of these hard decisions has been made.  Ultimately, politicians are wedded to the status quo.  Today’s debate needs to be about the extent and nature of the changes we need to make.  I regret I did not have sufficient time to set out these issues but I will return to them in my closing remarks.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	92	I wish to share my time with Deputy Bannon, by agreement.I agree with the Minister that the need to combat global warming, or climate change, has assumed monumental proportions.  It is not as crucial for the likes of me as it is for the young people who are sitting in the Visitors Gallery.  The issue will affect their futures.  It is about time we stopped fooling ourselves by pretending the evidence is inconclusive.  Climate change is probably one of the biggest problems facing humanity and it is being brought about as a result of our own activities.In Ireland, this trend has not only continued but the rate of increase has accelerated, with potentially horrendous consequences.  Everything, from farming, through manufacturing to running our cars and heating our homes, generates the greenhouse gases that cause the problem.  The Kyoto Protocol, which set targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, is an attempt at an agreement to control the likely rise in temperatures.  Under Kyoto, a collective EU target was set of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 8% before 2012.  Emission targets were set for each country and, as an incentive for changing behaviour, a trading system was established in which the major polluters could buy and sell carbon permits.  Following the treaty, the Irish Government agreed to legally binding limits on the production of greenhouse gases and, based on 1990 as a benchmark year, agreed to cap the rise in emissions at 13% above the 1990 level by 2010.  In 1990, Ireland produced 54 million tonnes of greenhouse gases but our output has since increased by more than 30%, which means we are greatly exceeding our legally binding targets.The Environmental Protection Agency's figures for 2005 indicated that gas emissions have increased to 69.95 million tonnes.  By far the greatest increase, at more than 160%, was experienced in the transport sector.  Road transport accounts for 96% of that sector's figures.  Emissions by the energy sector increased by up to38%.  Agriculture is responsible for 28% of emissions, energy 19%, the residential sector 10%, industry 9%, commercial and institutional 4% and waste 2.5%.  It is about time we found out where the problems are arising in individual sectors.  Ireland now rates as one of the worst performers in the EU in terms of cutting our gas emissions.  This is not a pleasant record or one about which we can boast.It is a pity the debate is subject to time constraints because the House seldom has an opportunity to discuss climate change and energy security.  Unless we are prepared to face up to the facts, climate change will create a much different living and working environment and radically alter the economy, threatening our prosperity and well-being.  A year ago, the landmark Stern report, compiled by British and former World Bank economist, Sir Nicholas Stern, warned that ignoring climate change could precipitate a major economic upheaval on a par with the depression of the 1930s.  This is the prospect we face.As the Minister correctly noted, the forthcoming Bali conference will be essential in terms of setting targets for the future.  The International Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, estimates that temperatures will rise by between 1% and 4% by the end of the century.  However, a recent International Energy Agency, IEA, report which examined rapid emissions growth in China and India forecast that the world could warm by a potentially disastrous 6% by 2030.  Any increase above 2% would be likely to have a significant effect on sea levels and weather patterns.  For the first time, the IPCC also notes alarming possibilities such as the relatively rapid melting of polar ice and the future melting of ice sheets in Greenland and western Antarctica.Climate change and energy security are inextricably linked.  As the song goes, one cannot have one without the other.  The current means of providing our energy supply cannot be sustained.  As the Minister correctly noted, between 80% and 90% of Ireland's energy comes from imported fossil fuels, which leaves us extremely exposed in terms of availability and price.  We must make changes now.  By 2020 our energy use will have increased by a further 30% on current levels.  As the Minister indicated, 85% of gas consumed in Ireland is imported, principally from the North Sea where supplies are being depleted by 7% to 8% per annum.  We are dependent on Norwegian gas for as long as it is available to us.  However, Britain and Ireland have been refused entry into one of the largest gas fields in Norway located, I believe, at Troll.When gas supplies run out, including those located in the west and south-west, we will be totally dependent on Russia unless an extraordinary find is made in the meantime.  We must explore every possible avenue to change the way in which we produce energy.  The recent Government White Paper entitled Delivering a Sustainable Energy Future for Ireland must not be left to gather dust in Departments, it must be acted on.It has been a great pleasure and honour for me to be elected Chairman of the new Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security.  As an all-party committee we will not treat these issues as political footballs.  I hope the work of the joint committee will be of great benefit in dealing with the horrendous problem we face.  We also hope to secure the co-operation of members of the public by speaking in simple language and producing documents that will bring home to everyone that each of us has a contribution to make in this regard.  It helps, for instance, to switch off lights or computers when they are not needed.  Every evening we see lights blazing in Government Departments, yet politicians lecture everybody else on the need to conserve energy.Starting with small steps will lead to big things.  It is a question of education and the new committee will try to educate people in simple language and alert them to the action they can take at home, in the workplace or in terms of travel and transport.  As with Deputy McManus, rather than using my car, I hop on the DART a couple of times a week.  This is a simple step.I welcome this debate as the beginning of a process and hope the committee I chair will provide further opportunities for debates in the Chamber when it produces reports.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	93	Speaking on climate change is necessary but not futile.  We all know that on issues of this nature actions speak louder than words because alarm bells are ringing across the world.  We must wake up to the threat posed by climate change.  Having seen the reality and the movie, we must now see concerted action.  Concern among members of the public is growing as they become increasingly aware that they must modify their carbon footprints and take individual responsibility for the protection of our environment for generations to come.Erratic and extreme weather conditions have become common in recent years.  This year, Britain experienced the worst summertime floods in its history, leaving several people dead, 600 injured, requiring the evacuation of approximately 3,500 people from their devastated homes and swamping and destroying food crops.  Ireland is not far behind Britain in this respect, having this year experienced the wettest summer and heaviest rainfall recorded in June and July since records began.  At the same time, temperatures held to seasonal norms.The Minister must significantly increase renewable energy sources, in particular, combined heat and power, CHP.  In other countries in Europe, such as Finland and Denmark, significant percentages of heat demand are supplied by district heating systems and CHP stations, with 50% to 60% of homes supplied by district heating systems.  Combined heat and power stations and district heating systems provide a wide range of benefits, including improved energy efficiencies of up to 50%, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, more efficient use of bio-fuels and space savings.Converting the Lough Ree power station in my area of Lanesboro to combined heat and power and distributing the heat energy through a district heating system would make sense in today's energy conscious environment.  Such a conversion could be replicated throughout this country.  At Lanesboro, this would require converting the power station to a combined heat facility and building a network to distribute heat energy to residential, commercial and industrial users.As I stated, combined heat and power and district heating are common in many countries across Europe.  Finland and Denmark are two such countries which have significant percentages of their heat demand supplied by district heating systems and CHP stations.  District heating, the most common heating system in Finland, is used in nearly all cities, towns and built-up areas.  Some 2.5 million Finns live in homes heated by district heating.  A wide range of benefits are gained from combined heat and power stations and district heating, including improved energy efficiency in the case of the former.If rolled out, these technologies would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by distributing the heat produced in the generation of electricity to households and removing the need for these households to use fossil fuels for heating space and water.  In addition to eliminating emissions from home boilers, a CHP station which centralises the generation of heat can more easily be operated on alternative bio-fuels that distribute these fuels to households.  It would also improve air quality.The recently published reports on climate change have identified beyond doubt the significant challenges facing us all in light of global warming.  Ireland and particularly the Minister, who is at the helm on this issue, face a challenge to reduce the level of greenhouse gas emissions.  The CHP system should be an important element of the Government's response to this challenge.  Ireland can learn much from countries such as Finland and Denmark, which are leading in the implementation of CHP and district heating systems.  Scientific evidence points to the need for urgent action on greenhouse gas emissions reductions in the short and medium term.  The IPCC has indicated that in the longer term global emissions would need to be reduced by up to 70% or to 1990 levels.Two of the world's top polluters, China and Japan, agreed to what is in essence a vague pact on climate change yesterday.  Progress may seem small, but the pact will serve as a basis for negotiations at the UN meeting next month in Bali and should make it easier to negotiate a replacement for the Kyoto Protocol on limiting greenhouse gas emissions.

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	96	The Minister delivered a very different speech from the script circulated, so I will respond to the two speeches.  Nobody doubts his genuine views on climate change.  It is worth noting that thanks to environmental groups, including the Green Party, the message has been taken on board.  I am very conscious of the fact that within this House there has been a significant shift in terms of attitude and approach to what is the biggest political challenge facing us.  It is important now for the Minister to talk in terms of implementation.  It is easy for us to trade statistics and percentages across the House, but that does not lead us where we need to go.The evidence from the most recent report of the IPCC, the International Panel on Climate Change established by the United Nations, is unequivocal.  The human contribution to global warming is not in doubt.  Let us take it as given, the evidence is overwhelming.  For a long time that was not the case.  For ten years the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats tried to ignore this and deliberately bought their way out of their responsibility to face up to the challenge.  They had a kind of pollute now, pay later approach, which meant significant sums, hundreds of millions, had to be put aside to pay for carbon allowances.  We can all see now what is coming.  At Bali, a process will take place that will lead to much higher limits and targets being set.  We will have to live up to these and will not be able to simply buy our way out.  If we tried to do so, that would cause suffering to our economy and taxpayers, and, most important, we would not be playing our proper part in trying to protect the planet.Other countries are changing.  It is interesting that Australia, which refused to sign the Kyoto Agreement, has now, because of public pressure, begun to implement a ban on conventional light bulbs.  How many Ministers here will it take to change a light bulb?  These are the kind of questions we need to pose.  Both Sweden and New Zealand have already committed to becoming carbon neutral.  In the United Kingdom, as soon as the IPCC report was issued, Prime Minister Gordon Brown responded by stating he was ready to consider increasing his government's target of a 60% cut in Britain's carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 to an 80% cut.  He talks about Britain becoming a world leader in the new technological revolution to beat global warming.What, however, has our Taoiseach to say?  What do we hear from him?  The silence is telling.  Unless the Taoiseach drives this from the top, we will fail.  Whatever agreement follows the Kyoto Agreement will need to be signed by Prime Ministers.  It is not sufficient to have just Ministers for the environment on board if we are to bring in the changes needed.  In choosing to enter Government with Fianna Fáil, the Green Party had to sacrifice many of the promises it made before the election.  I understand why it entered Government, but it will not be forgiven, if at the end of its term of office, it has failed to make the breakthrough on climate change.  To reduce our carbon emissions to the necessary levels will require courage, leadership and new thinking.  It will only happen if there is a concerted effort from all the key Ministries, led from the front by the Taoiseach.The inconvenient truth is that we cannot depend on the Green Party Ministers to bring about the transformation needed.  No disrespect intended, I do not doubt their sincerity, but they will not be able to turn the tanker around unless there is a fundamental change from all the relevant Ministries.  That can only be led from the top.  For example, the Minister for Finance has been asked about the promised carbon budget.  We do not know what shape that will take and it is valid for us to ask questions on that and receive a response.  We need to know how the commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 3% per year will be accomplished.  Getting information from Ministers on these matters, including the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, can be problematic.The impression we get is that no attempt to address this matter was made in the preparation of the programme for Government; no attention was given to the structural formation required in the Government to bring about these kinds of changes, for example, the linkages between the Departments of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Transport and Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  The linkage we need to have going through Government in terms of policy and delivery does not exist.  Rather, there is a fragmentation of responsibility, which is a concern and should be addressed.The Labour Party argued for a new Department to deal with climate change and energy.  This would have had the overarching role to steer many of the requirements for administrative structures.  The new Joint Oireachtas Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security — I compliment Deputy Seán Barrett on his appointment to this significant and important committee — has no lead Minister attached to it, but a number of different Ministers will be involved.  We have been promised a high level commission on climate change, but I am not sure how it fits into our structure.  What is this commission?  Is it part of the committee or is it something else?  Will the Minister clarify that in his response?The energy efficiency action programme was launched by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, although the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has responsibility for climate change.  I am glad the Minister with responsibility for energy is in the House, although climate change is, strictly speaking, not his responsibility.  He has, however, a central role ——

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	98	That is exactly my point.  However, and this was clear to me from my short time in Government, unless we have structural cohesion, no matter how much talk there is, nothing will happen.  We need a clear structure in place where there is agreement and cohesion and where people will take responsibility.  This does not seem to be happening.  Despite the fact transport is such a creator of carbon emissions, there seems to be no direct linkage between that Department and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.Perhaps this sounds petty, but it is a good example.  The Power of One campaign is about individual responsibility, but the Minister cannot even convince any of his fellow Ministers to use cars that reduce emissions.  He says he is promoting training and accreditation schemes, but he must be aware that when it comes to the accreditation of renewable energy installers, the blockage in terms of all-Ireland accreditation, is in the Republic, not the North of Ireland.  He must also accept that the greener homes scheme, phase one, collapsed because it overran its budget and got into deep financial trouble, while the new scheme has no funding in place as far as we can see.  I hoped Estimates might be on the way, but they are not.Frankly, I think there is goodwill among the public.  We do not need to sermonise continually and in any event I do not think it works.  We have to test it and see where people are willing to make changes.  It is like the plastic bag levy, if they are given the opportunity they make the change but we need to do it intelligently.  The approach by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government where he talked about penalising cars over 1.6 litre engines even though they could be more energy efficient than smaller cars does not ring true with me and it can enrage as much as encourage.There was an issue about reducing the public sector carbon emissions to energy reduction by 33%.  That is a huge reduction.  We have hospitals and schools in need of structural improvement as well as insulation which will require a big investment of money and we do not know from where it is coming.We have great opportunities here.  We could have an electricity generation system that is completely carbon neutral.  That is a possibility.  The technology is coming.  We should try to be at the cutting edge of developing those technologies to ensure we live up to our legal and Government responsibilities but also to lead the way for other countries.

This is the first opportunity I have had to face him across the floor of the House.  Obviously the general tenor of his speech was an attempt to convince the country of the importance of this issue and it is critically important to our civilisation.  An element of his speech defends the purchasing of carbon credits.  When he was on this side of the House he would have regarded that as an outrage.

The deficiency in his speech is that I do not get a sense, after six months in Government, of somebody laying out a programme of significant actions, for what may well be a short enough Government, across the energy and transport areas which would begin to meet our commitments and lead our people in a way is environmentally sustainable.  That is the big gap I see in what I have heard and read in the rest of the speech.Transport remains the sector which consumes the most significant amount of energy, a massive 41% according to the recent SCI report.  In that area a striking amount of energy is used in the freight and road haulage industry.  I expect the Minister to bring forward significant proposals and yet today we heard nothing of what the Government might be prepared to do in that regard.  The huge energy consumption and CO2 emissions in the transport area are the result of the massive and growing dependence on the car.  The recent 2006 census figures, presented by the CSO, confirm this along with the growth in the use of the car by up to 1 million people and the reliance of schoolchildren and their parents on the car as the vehicle of choice to get to school and work.  The State's chronic under-investment in the public transport infrastructure is strongly reflected in the 2006 census findings.  I expect to hear more from the Minister and his party in regard to the slippage in Transport 21 and the failure to set out key initiatives to bring about a fundamental shift in mode of transport.For example, he was very vociferous in Opposition on the issue of county council and State body car fleets and yet after six months in Government I have heard of no initiative whatsoever in this regard, not even in regard to the Cabinet.  There are many proposals on car advertising.  SIMI, the Society of the Irish Motor Industry, was outside the Dáil over the last couple of nights talking to Deputies and spokespersons and making certain points about VRT levels and so on.  However, there is nothing in terms of a policy on, say, a carbon levy, how VRT will work or how road tax will work in the future.I commend the Minister on the introduction of smart metering from early next year but we have heard another sermon on important truths, of which we are all convinced.  However, what we seek from the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage, and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, and the Government, is a series of proactive measures to try to change our country's energy usage behaviour.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	104	Climate change is clearly an important issue and one that has attracted huge attention, both internationally and here, in recent years.  One of the key points being made here is in relation to the shortcomings in the Government's strategy to address the issue, and in relation to meeting the targets set in the national climate change strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.The Government has stated it is confident of meeting a target of an average 12% annual reduction over the next five years, but that has been called into question, as has the apparent absence of any contingency plan in the event of failure to attain annual targets.  The key to achieving the reduction targets is obviously a marked increase in other energy sources.  That is central to the strategy, and revolves around increasing the proportion of electricity produced by renewable energy sources to 15% by 2010, only three years away.  Are we on course to meet that target?Apparently, Britain and other EU states are casting doubt on their ability to meet the EU's 2020 target of 20% energy from renewables by a long way.  Yet when questioned about this last week, the Minister, Deputy Ryan, seemed confident this country will meet the 2010 target of 15% and the much more ambitious target of 33% by 2020.  I commend the Minister on his confidence and enthusiasm but many of us have yet to be convinced that sufficient is being done to ensure the targets are attained.For example, wave and tidal energy are two areas that have been pointed to as having huge potential.  There are a number of research projects going on around the coast and Sustainable Energy Ireland has granted €1.4 million to this research.  Perhaps I am wrong but would this appear to indicate that work on this sector is still of a very minor scale and that there is no real indication that energy production from wave and tidal generation will increase to the extent it must if the targets are to be achieved?  I hope I am wrong but there are many who remain to be convinced that it is being pursued on a level sufficient to ensure this will be the case.The other key source of alternative energy supply that has been identified is biomass.  Under the climate change strategy, the Government has set a target of a 30% share for biomass input into peat stations by 2020.  They have also pledged to meet a much more ambitious target for bio-fuels as a proportion of overall vehicle fuel use than the EU.  This is very laudable but the day-to-day measures being taken to achieve this must be under constant scrutiny and subject to re-evaluation if they are seen to be insufficient.For example, are the necessary measures being taken to ensure that enough energy crops will be grown here?  Does the grant system encourage both farmers and processors?   Could more be done in regard to set-aside land or the forestry sector, for example, to ensure sufficient crops are planted?  The danger is that, even if we attain the target with regard to vehicle fuel use, we will be replacing our current dependency on the import of fossil fuels with a new dependency on the import of biofuels.  It would be better for the environment certainly but would represent a major missed economic opportunity.We need to build our own strategic indigenous fuel production.  This is why Sinn Féin has argued not only for the need to promote the growing of energy crops for which this country is eminently suited, particularly to the conversion to producing a thick syrup from sugar beet for ethanol production.  The Government refused to use its golden share to make that happen and instead Greencore has laid off its entire workforce and moved into property development, speculation or whatever one would call it.  To build such plants from scratch would cost many millions of euro and there are doubts about the viability of building brand new plants in the immediate future.  The growing and processing of crops is key to meeting targets.  The question is whether those practical steps are being taken now — I am doubtful.There is also a need to promote greater energy efficiency in domestic and commercial buildings.  Indeed, I note that those responsible for the Oireachtas buildings are becoming more proactive on this issue.  For a while we received e-mails reminding us to switch off computers and so on.  This is very laudable and it is undoubted public awareness schemes have a part to play in reducing the unnecessary waste of energy.  While this applies as much to households as to places of work, I am not satisfied EU legislation regarding building insulation or the grant incentives to improve energy conservation in the home are adequate to achieve this.  This is why my party has called for the inclusion of all those in receipt of fuel allowance in the greener homes and insulation grant schemes.  While these involve a considerable initial outlay, they are cost-effective in reducing energy loss, cutting fuel bills and tackling fuel poverty.A recent Society of St. Vincent de Paul survey found that 79% of lone parents, 78% of elderly people and 81% of local authority tenants struggled to pay for energy and heating costs in their homes.  There are many reasons for this but it is proven that many people in this situation live in buildings that are badly insulated, meaning they must use more heat, which worsens their plight in regard to meeting bills.I strongly urge the Minister to persuade his Cabinet colleagues to include people in receipt of the fuel allowance, where practical, in the greener homes scheme.  As I noted, it will greatly increase the current expenditure under the scheme but would quickly prove to be cost-efficient and would reduce the level of fuel poverty by reducing expenditure among the most vulnerable categories to which I referred.It is most important that there is a strategy to deal with climate change and that important mechanisms are in place to keep it under constant review.  We need to ensure there is annual reporting to track the progress of meeting targets on the reduction of emissions.  Only in that way can shortfalls be addressed and ameliorative actions taken to ensure targets are adhered to and, if possible, exceeded.With regard to energy security, it is of course vital our offshore gas deposits come on stream.  However, this should not happen as at present where not only is there no guarantee that the gas from Corrib, for example, will be prioritised for domestic use, but the State stands to gain little in the way of revenue.  It would be the height of idiocy if such an important resource was to be used solely to benefit the companies that hold the licence and remain free to use it as they see fit, rather than it being public policy, as it is in other countries such as Norway, to ensure the national interest, in terms of security of supply and fiscal benefits, comes first.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	105	I am honoured to speak in this debate.  I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on his appointment.  I note he took a definite strategic decision to speak in global and messianic terms — I do not know who would be able to pick him up.  There was no mention of the Minister's script, which I believe was the correct option for him to take.  I cannot stand scripts.  They are the most convoluted, contrived mechanism for talking, whereas there should be plain talking.  The Minister clearly decided to talk in macro terms when he had the opportunity to do so.  While I am not complaining about the Minister as he does not decide how much time he has to speak, he was given scant time to paint a global picture.I do not wish to sound patronising in making the following point, but I find when attending political meetings that in general party members say they are glad the Green Party is in government because they somehow feel green issues will be looked after.  This is not good enough, however.  The Minister must infuse the Cabinet with his messianic zeal, as he sought to do in the House today.I wish to deal with one issue that jumped off the page at me.  I hope the Minister does not leave the House until I make my point.  We have all been weaned on the idea of the Kyoto Protocol being good, very good, but I find it fraudulent that it allows for countries to purchase carbon credits, a concept with which I have great difficulty.  While I accept I am a member of a Government party and that most parties subscribe to the Kyoto Protocol, it is wrong that countries can somehow pass up on reducing emissions in favour of buying carbon credits from unknown sources in some remote part of the world.It is stated that Ireland is not alone in purchasing credits among countries that have targets to meet under the protocol.  It is also stated that climate change is a global problem, which is the excuse given for the use of carbon credits, and emissions reductions achieved in any part of the world play an equal part in solving the problem.  That is a cop-out.  We will not work hard at emissions reduction if we can make up the difference with carbon credits from some remote, unpronounceable part of the globe, and then sit back smug and satisfied.A new Kyoto protocol is planned for the period 2008 to 2012.  I hope we will in some way begin to distance or remove ourselves from this aspect of the protocol.  I find it bogus that one can somehow shrug off what must be done because some other group or small island in a remote ocean is not using energy.  On an intellectual basis, I find this concept difficult to cope with and fraudulent.I am not sure how the Minister would make this point in a speech or script.  In global terms, we of course agree with the Kyoto Protocol, but we must recognise that the protocol was in some ways an interim, get-you-there measure that was meant to apply until we got to grips with what all this means.I lauded the global, messianic way in which the Minister spoke.  It was good to hear the macro element dealt with in this way.  However, we must present in sexier terms the global challenge which faces us all.  Talking in global terms is fine but we must present the issue so each man and woman who gets up each day and goes to bed each evening will see it affects him or her.Young children are greatly interested in this issue.  My eldest grandchild is only five years old so I do not ascribe to him any marvellous intellectual prowess.  However, I hear him talking about what he is being told in school — he tells me not to leave my kettle plugged in, which is fair enough.  At least he is getting that message, so the next generation will be that bit different.  While the Minister spoke on a macro level, I find the Power of One campaign very interesting because people can relate to it, which is the whole point.   There is no point in talking about global matters if people cannot understand what they can do in their homes every day to save energy.  The same applies to the workplace.  The subject of climate change can be made more interesting for the public on a micro level and we should be doing more about facing up to it.  This major topic relates to individuals and their ability to effect changes in this respect.  The Power of One tag is evocative.  I would like to hear the Minister's view on that strategy, which is hugely important.  We all know that we must unplug our televisions, radios and kettles as well as switching off lights.  They are mundane everyday actions but they matter a lot.  Ordinary people living in remote rural areas have a role to play in this regard, just as others do in a big emporium or plant that is conducting a large-scale business.Everyone can keep energy-saving policies at centre stage but the issue must be made attractive to the public, which is where the Power of One comes into play.  Sometimes, one may say that it is all about America and George Bush is not the slightest bit interested in climate change, which he is not.  One may say that China is not interested either, given its 18% economic growth and air pollution.  People may ask what is the use of unplugging a kettle in the face of such international examples but if everyone thought like that where would the world be?  We would not be on the path to dealing with climate change, which is undoubtedly the greatest challenge facing us.  The Minister said it was greater than any famine or both world wars combined.  We have recently commemorated world war dead and some good television programmes were broadcast, particularly on Channel 4.  In such programmes one can see, for example, how thousands died in a useless endeavour to control a hill in France.  While we are all going to die some day, it is sad to see death on such a large scale occurring needlessly.  We should take action on climate change for the sake of our children and grandchildren.  It concerns the continuity of the human race.  In a strictly historical sense, small as Ireland is, our role will be defined by how the country acted in the face of this challenge which concerns future generations.  In years to come, I do not want my five grandchildren asking what their grandmother did in Parliament about climate change.  If we do not act now it will affect them in future.  Each of us faces that challenge and it is not a burden to be borne lightly.  It is a heavy burden to which we must pay cognisance.  The Minister should address those who want to hear how they can meet this global challenge in their own individual way.  The Minister has a big task ahead of him and I wish him well in undertaking it.

Climate change and global warming constitute the greatest problem facing humanity today and I do not say that lightly.  People may say that problems such as drought are more important and approximately 1 billion worldwide do not have access to clean water.  The difficulty is, however, that that figure will double or treble if the current rate of increase in global warming continues.  People may say that poverty is a bigger problem and I am all for supporting those involved in the relief of poverty at home and abroad.  It is clear, nonetheless, that global warming will cause the poor to become poorer.  Hunger is a serious problem also but global warming will ensure that those who exist at subsistence levels will starve if it remains unchecked.  People may also say that flooding is a major problem and we have seen what happened in Bangladesh in recent weeks.  Imagine what will happen to such low-lying countries, however, if global warming continues to prompt a rise in sea levels — they will be directly in the firing line of catastrophic flooding, worse than hitherto experienced.

I was discussing the matter with a family who were in Africa during the summer and I unfortunately had to read up on malaria, which is back big time in Africa.  One must recall that we had malaria in southern Europe up to 50 years ago.  I am not saying it is heading our way but it is certainly an issue to be considered.  Such issues should prompt us to reflect that the biggest problem facing humanity today is global warming and climate change.  In simple terms, it encompasses and exacerbates all the main problems confronting us.Closer to home we have not escaped the effects and will not do so in the years ahead either.  There is clear evidence of this from the flooding that has occurred in Cork city centre and in Dublin.  There is incontrovertible evidence that flooding will become worse.  We already have unnatural weather patterns and new animal diseases as a result.  I had never heard about bluetongue until a few months ago, yet one can take it as almost certain that it will continue to spread because midges, which carry the disease, do not recognise national boundaries.  There is little we can do about bluetongue apart from vaccinating animals as a precautionary measure.  We have witnessed problems such as coastal erosion and flooding in low-lying areas.  Last summer we saw the forest fires in Greece, which can be traced as a consequence of global warming.  We have many forest areas here also.Some people take an apocalyptic view of these events and maybe they should, but I prefer to be guided by scientific evidence.  It is quite clear that global warming is already well under way and is likely to accelerate.  Recently, I was fortunate to hear Dr. Martin Manning deliver a lecture on behalf of the Environmental Protection Agency in Dublin.  He is one of the authors of the latest report by the UN intergovernmental panel on climate change.  It is scary stuff and all the scientific evidence clearly points to obvious conclusions.  The report was completed in Valencia by 150 experts who drew on international resources and expertise.  It presented unequivocal evidence on the effects of global warming on the world's climate system.  If anyone doubts this they should look at the scientific facts, which I find convincing.The first conclusion from Valencia is that in the 21st century the earth's climate will be different from anything experienced during human civilization.  Second, this is different from past natural changes in climate because it will affect humans and we are causing it.  Third, reducing carbon emissions to the atmosphere can limit the magnitude of the change.  That is as far as they would go, although a number of scary comments were made, including that scientists could not keep up with the pace of change and, therefore, could not predict fully the consequences.  It was stated at the meeting that we had an opportunity to manage the avoidable and avoid the unmanageable.  That is the challenge that confronts us.Ireland has a role to play.  I will not make political statements but our record since the signing of the Kyoto Protocol is deplorable.  It has been a scandal but that is in the past.  This debate is intended to achieve a common approach to a problem that has worsened since 1990, as the State has missed all the Kyoto Protocol targets.  A 13% increase on the then 54 million tonnes of carbon emissions produced globally was projected but it is now more than 70 million tonnes.  The targets internationally must be much lower than the 1990 baseline of 54 million tonnes.  A reduction of 60% in this baseline has been mentioned, which highlights the magnitude of the task facing us.A complete change in attitude is needed.  Above all, significant leadership is required for what should be a national priority.  That is happening in other countries.  I was particularly impressed by a Westminster committee report on the draft climate change Bill in the United Kingdom.  The UK Government is not only setting targets, it is also underpinning them in legislation.  I compliment those who introduced a Bill in the Seanad a few months ago to open the debate.  We must establish targets we can reach and underpin them with enforceable, binding legislation.  The Westminster committee made 77 recommendations on the draft Bill and it would be well worth our while to consider them.  I do not say they should be slavishly followed but there is an opportunity where we will not have to reinvent the wheel.  Advantage could be taken of the committee's research.  Its recommendations should at least be examined and considered to ascertain their appropriateness to Ireland.Deputy O'Rourke often adopts a basic common sense approach to debates such as this.  She referred to the purchase of carbon credits, a let-out in some ways.  When the State had loads of money, it was an easy let-out but it should not be.  The Government should not rely on the purchase of carbon credits — partly because money is running out — and flexible mechanisms to achieve our targets.  A political action plan, which should be underpinned with legislation, is a national priority.  The UK recommendations highlight that the plan must be led by the Prime Minister or, in our case, the Taoiseach.  The debate concerns many Departments, including the Departments of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Transport and Finance.  That the Taoiseach is merely chairman of a Cabinet committee on this issue is not sufficient.  He should have responsibility under legislation, similar to the recommendation of the Westminster committee.Major public awareness and total political commitment underpinned by legislation will result in people supporting the political action necessary to do what should have been done long ago.  However, it is not too late.  Let us start now.
#MaryWhite	unknown-#MaryWhite-party	unknown-#MaryWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	109	I welcome this debate and the opportunity to exchange views on this matter of national and global importance.  I notice the deserted look on the Labour Party benches to debate this issue  However, it is unsurprising, given that this time last week and again this morning Deputy Stagg told the House debates such as this were mere parliamentary fillers.  Given that the Deputy served as a Minister of State in the Departments with responsibility for the environment, transport and energy and communications, it is all the more disappointing he considers a debate on a crucial matter such as this to be a "motherhood and apple pie proposal".As the Minister of State conveyed to the House, this is the greatest issue facing our era.  Last week, for the fourth time, the UN intergovernmental panel on climate change stated the impact of future temperature change would be severe.  With temperatures predicted to increase by between 1.1° Celsius and 6.4° Celsius during this century and sea levels predicted to rise by up to 0.59 of a metre, the world is poised for a potent melting pot of hurricanes, storms, drought and the extinction of up to 30% of its species.  Is the Arctic about to say "Goodbye" to the polar bear as Ireland says "Hello" to the little egret?We do not need to look at the statistics and prognoses of the latest report to know adverse change is upon us.  In many of our gardens roses are still in bloom.  Swallows only left our shores for sunnier climes a few weeks ago.  One swallow does not make a summer but an autumn with many is a weather vane for the change in our climate.  Our potato farmers have experienced a summer of devastating flooding and cases of brown rot, a disease attributable, some say, to global warming.  Ireland does not need a history lesson on the effects of potato failure but I doubt many Members of the House are aware that successive repeats of the crop's failure will ultimately mean we will have to turn to maize and other crops as a substitute.  Dr. John Sweeney of the UN climate change panel who spoke recently at a conference in Kilkenny on the impact of climate change on agriculture warned that the flooding Ireland may become accustomed to might mean farm animals spending the entire year in sheds and slatted houses because the weather would leave farmers with no grass for grazing.  Professor Sherwood Rowland who discovered the link between CFCs and the destruction of the ozone layer once said: "What's the use of having developed a science well enough to make predictions if in the end all we're willing to do is stand around and wait for them to come true?"Careless use of the world's resources has brought us to an era of peak oil and irrefutable evidence of climate change and we must be ready to cope with its consequences.  A post-carbon society is our new goal.  The Green Party in government has fostered new thinking among decision-makers, householders and business people about creating an era of clean, renewable and resourceful energy, replacing the age of oil and gas and our energy supply's subservience to the geopolitical crises of the day, one in which energy will come from wind, wave, crops and sun rather than sources of greenhouse gas emissions.Deputy McManus referred to the need for implementation but she should be aware it has begun.  The Power of One campaign this year demonstrated the carbon and income levels that could be saved by an average household.  The continuation of green energy schemes and the recent announcement by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources of increases in current and capital spending next year for his Department are more than welcome.  The proposed planning exemptions for micro-renewable technologies, outlined by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, show forward thinking and innovation.  The proposed building regulations regarding energy efficiency and the recently published energy efficiency action plan are also signs of great progress.Our role in government is to elevate our concerns on global warming from the scientific and theoretical to the political and practical.  It is this determination that distinguishes the Green Party from other parties.Perhaps the start of an old anti-slavery hymn sums up the moment which is upon us: "Once to every man and nation comes the moment to decide."  This is our moment to ensure that we take the necessary measures to protect our planet and to secure both the national and global economies in the face of the greatest moral imperative of our time.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	110	I am glad we are debating this topic.  A criticism from Opposition benches was that having generalised debates avoids an obligation on the Government to set down specific targets, which would put it under pressure to try to meet them.  Whether that be on subjects such as yesterday's debate on youth issues, the motion on which was very broad, or today's debate on climate change, the preference of Opposition parties would be for a Government motion on these areas, perhaps relating to the Government's White Paper on Energy, on which it would set out clear evidence and targets in terms of ambitious thinking in this area.  That would enable us to hold a Government to account in time on commitments made and so on.  That would be preferable to having general discussion on an issue, even when it is an issue of this importance.  I want to be clear that irrespective of whether it be Deputy Stagg or any other Opposition Deputy, I do not believe any Member has a problem with debating climate change.  We need to debate it over and over again to try to change a mindset.  Our job is to promote action, offer leadership, set targets and be ambitious.In terms of this issue I, for one, am glad that the Green Party is in government.  I have no faith in Fianna Fáil, as a party leading the Government, to offer leadership in this area.  All I have to do is judge it on its record over the past decade when a huge opportunity was presented to bring about ambitious change in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  I contend also that my party, a big catch-all party, has not perhaps offered enough insistence and leadership in this area, but that must change.  This role is not solely the remit of the Green Party, but by having a Green Party in government, I hope there will be an insistence on offering leadership on this issue at the Cabinet table.  From my point of view as Fine Gael spokesperson on energy, I intend to hold the Green Party to account in that area and to push it in the right direction.In a few weeks time an important conference will take place in Bali.  I want to split my comments into two areas, one is the international aspect of this issue and the other is our responsibilities nationally.  The conference in Bali will be the 13th United Nations Climate Change Conference.  It follows 12 months of active debate and awareness raising about the fact that is now climate change.  What the UN will attempt to do in Bali is to find agreement on a structure that will lead to a post-2012 global strategy to combat climate change caused by human activity.  An international agreement needs to be found to follow the ending of the Kyoto Protocol in 2012.  This is necessary to move from what has been the first effort at international agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions under the Kyoto Agreement to a much more comprehensive global effort and commitment on emissions to effectively save our planet from the irreversible consequences of climate change.Using the correct lingo, the challenge facing the conference in Bali has been described as putting a roadmap in place for a future climate deal.  That type of US language is, I hope, an indication that the United States will take this seriously in terms of the commitments it will make at a multilateral level in the future.The key factor in any new deal at the UNCCC is that all the key contributors to CO2 emissions would show a willingness to buy into a new way of thinking on the issue.  Otherwise the effectiveness of any new deal will be limited in the same way that the Kyoto Protocol has been.  Without countries like India, China and in particular the United States signing up to an ambitious commitment to reduce CO2 emissions, we really are at nothing.  The US contributes almost a third of global CO2 emissions and the rapid economic growth in the giants that are China and India is resulting in huge increases in energy production and industrial emissions.  Without commitments from countries such as India, China and the United States, we are going nowhere.  However, there are some causes for optimism in that regard.  At the G8 summit in the summer I believe we saw the first real willingness to talk seriously about putting a framework in place post Kyoto, and that must be recognised.I want to outline the facts, as many previous speakers have done.  For many years when we have heard and even now when we hear environmentalists warn that Cork city will be flooded and that sea levels will rise by 20 ft, many of us have dismissed those people as extremists or as deliberately exaggerating to try to make a point.  The reality is that such a theory is now a fact.  The world is getting warmer, the more CO2 that is in the climate, the warmer it gets.  The significance of the consequences that will confront us if we do not reverse the level of greenhouse gas emissions being released into the atmosphere is not an abstract theory but a practical reality.The fact is that the globe is warming.  The ten warmest years in history in terms of measuring the warmth of the global atmosphere have occurred in the past 14 years.  It is also a fact that there is no scientific dispute on the general consensus on what is happening.  The only scientific argument now is how quickly it is happening and how dramatic our response must be to reverse or limit the change.  Earlier this year scientific evidence of global warming, as set out in the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, put a face on the human reality on what is likely to happen if we do not act in a significant way.The measurement or target that seems to have been set for us, which is generally accepted by most experts in this area, is that we need to try to limit the increase in global temperatures to 2°C, if possible.  If we can do that, we can potentially avoid the kind of catastrophic situation against which many are warning.  The challenge being laid down by the IPCC to achieve that target is one the enormity of which most people have no idea.  What is being asked of the world essentially is that we would reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 50% below 1990 levels by 2050.  What in essence that means for the developed world, for countries like Ireland, the United States, France and Britain, is that if we are to achieve that globally, we will have to reduce our emissions below 1990 levels by 60% to 70% or maybe even 80%.  With the level of growth and population increases in the developing world, we will need to take more pain than the people there, if we are to allow development happen at the same time as reducing emissions.  The enormity of the challenge is made even more significant when one considers what is happening in the worldtoday.In 1960, the world's population was 3 billion.  By 2000 that number had doubled to 6 billion people.  Within 40 years the rate of  population increase had been equivalent to the time it took over ten centuries to reach 3 billion, and by 2040 it is estimated that the world's population will be close to 9 billion people, all needing heat, water, light, power, transport, housing, jobs and so on.  There are close to 7 billion people on the planet and we are way above our emission targets.  This means the challenge we face on an international basis needs to be hammered home again and again.  I believe the people are leading the politicians on this issue in the western world in particular and are ripe for change.  The politicians and policy makers, in many cases, are dragging their feet.  If we give leadership on this issue in an ambitious manner, we may be surprised at the positive response from the public.I hope we will have a detailed debate on the White Paper on Energy in the not too distant future, which will give me an opportunity to highlight what Ireland can do in an ambitious way in this area over the next five to ten years.  If we are going to lobby, as I believe we should, at international level for ambitious change, we need to ensure we are not seen as hypocrites.  Ireland's performance over the past ten years has been an embarrassment in terms of promotion of renewable energy sources and as regards reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  This year we are putting aside €270 million to buy our way out of the problem.  Imagine what could be achieved if that type of funding was directed at renewable energy sources and alternatives in terms of public transport and so on, which is the type of thinking we need to have.
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	111	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate on climate change and energy security.  At the outset I find myself in agreement with one of the previous speakers, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, who said in his opening remarks that this was one of the most important debates he had contributed to.  It is a pity that the Press Gallery is absolutely empty because the issues we are debating today will have profound effects on our lives and those of our children in years to come.  A major change is taking place and while it might not be that radical in terms of tomorrow or next week, we are looking at something very significant and fundamental, and it is probably not receiving the attention, mediawise, it should.I disagree with Deputy Coveney, who would have preferred that a motion was tabled.  The problem with debating a motion is that he and I would speak along party lines, either for or against.  I prefer Deputy White's position where she said this debate should be an exchange of views where we can tease out the issues, rather than adopting hard and fast positions for or against a motion.  That is the way in which we should view today's debate.   At the outset, I remind the House that ten years ago we might have been debating somewhat differently.  People would be asking whether there was such a phenomenon as global warming and if climate change was occurring.  That debate is over and everybody recognises it is a real issue.  In looking at the age profile of Members of this Chamber, while not being rude to any of my colleagues, in our time we can physically see the changes.  Some people spoke about the dramatic events we have seen.When I started to drive, for instance, on going out at night I put a newspaper on the windscreen of the car because it was likely to be frozen.  I cannot tell when the windscreen of my car was last frozen, because it does not happen.  When did we last see snow in Ireland, as we would have on a regular basis when I was growing up?  I have plants flowering in my garden at times of the year I have never seen before and I ask my wife whether she has planted something new.  Things are different, global warming and climate change is occurring and I believe we all recognise it.I believe also that companies involved in the exploration and production of oil and gas are probably too powerful and have a vested interest in this whole area.  If we were to switch off the supply of oil and gas in the morning, as if it did not exist, those very significant and powerful companies would redirect their efforts massively into alternative sources.  However, the incentive is not there for them at the moment.  They have spent their money on oil exploration and they want a return.  We need to be mindful of that.When we talk of alternative sources, such as wind and so forth, research and development to make them truly productive and efficient needs substantial further investment.  For this country there are options, such as wind, wave and tidal power, solar and geothermal energy and so forth.  We have wind turbines, solar panels and a certain amount of geothermal energy production, but we are only scratching the surface.  It is a new feature for us, not just something on which the Government must lead.   It is something people must buy into and take a degree of personal responsibility for.  Whether it is new house that is being built and insulated better than ever before, or whatever, the public at large, as Deputy Coveney indicated, is leading.  People now recognise that something dramatic needs to be done.  As an island nation, we have not invested significantly in tidal and wave power.  What has been done so far may be regarded as small.  There could, however, be enormous potential in this area for an island nation.  I should like to see further debate, exploration and research and development in that whole area.I am conscious the Irish economy has grown very significantly in recent years.  The challenge facing us is to manage the transition from oil and gas hydrocarbons to alternative sources and at the same time sustain economic activity in this country.  It would be easy to make some of the policy changes people propose, but there would be economic consequences.  In that regard, this is where the purchase of carbon credits has a part to play, particularly during a transition period.I want, briefly, to refer to the area of bio-fuels.  Much has been said about this area of development and in this country we have embarked upon it.  I agree with Deputy Coveney as regards the growth in world population.  If we were to allow the growth in bio-fuels to replace oil for our cars, the damage globally would be enormous, because it would have enormous impact on our fuel supplies.  We debate in this Chamber and in the western world what is best for us.  We all drive our cars and go home to centrally heated houses, and we think it would be easier to get rid of oil and use bio-fuel.  That, essentially, is the background to this debate.  Taking this to its logical conclusion, we could have most of the arable land producing bio-fuels and it would adversely affect food supply.  At times this whole question of economics supporting trade baffles me.  I just do not understand it.  I cannot understand why land is set aside in the western world, producing nothing.  At the same time on other continents tens of millions try to survive on barren soil.  There is something fundamentally wrong.  I express a serious caution that we should not produce tonne after tonne of bio-fuel and jeopardise the food supply.Ireland will be fine because we are economically prosperous and have the wealth to buy in food, as well as the wealth to create the bio-fuels.  However, this is a global issue and there are other people who will suffer very significantly,  It is absolutely beyond me to understand why people who are starving and without economic significance in this world are in many ways being isolated from this debate.  I caution that the advancement of bio-fuels must not be pursued in a manner that might jeopardise food supply.  That is a separate debate but we need to be conscious of it.Times are changing and everyone within this Chamber and beyond recognises that we need alternative energy sources.  Individuals need to be aware that they must also make the change.  One frequently hears many local objections to planning applications for wind farms.  I often make the point to the objectors that they are objecting only because they can see a wind turbine but that they frequently do not object to unseen factors, such as carbon dioxide emissions.  We need to make tough decisions to allow the development of alternative sources of energy, including geothermal energy, which offers great potential.  In my area, Newcastle, County Dublin, there are some surveys in progress which, if successful, will allow whole communities to avail of a non-carbon dioxide emitting energy source.  We must make choices in this regard.  This debate should be regarded as an exchange of views on climate change rather than a debate on a strict motion.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	112	Climate change is happening already.  Even if we manage to reach our emission reduction targets and if temperature increases are limited, it will have a significant impact on Ireland.  According to research carried out in universities and other institutes in Ireland, we will experience more extreme weather events, including floods and storms.  For example, 100-year floods will become more frequent and there will be coastal erosion and less rain in summer.Climate change will affect Ireland and not just developing countries.  Specific groups will be particularly vulnerable, including the poor, the elderly, farmers, tourism employees, coastal dwellers, those living in river basins who are experiencing water shortages and those living in areas prone to flooding.  There will be a great impact on the environment, including on species and habitats.The impact of climate change on vulnerable people, including the poor and elderly, is highlighted in the draft summary report of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, launched on 16 November.  It states those affected will not just be those living in poor countries or regions especially affected by climate change, "Within other areas, even those with high incomes, some people can be particularly at risk (such as the poor, young children and the elderly) and also some areas and some activities."  Furthermore, it states: "There is increasing evidence of greater vulnerability of specific groups such as the poor and elderly in not only developing but also developed countries."The Minister, in his contribution, was speaking in global terms and in this regard it is obvious that international agreements and targets are integral to the mitigation process.  However, climate change will have an impact on local communities in Ireland, including the aforementioned vulnerable groups.  Sooner rather than later, we must prioritise measures at home to adapt to climate change such that communities will be protected as much as possible.There have been a number of important studies in Ireland on the impact of climate change and an EPA report shows Ireland will experience significant climate change impacts, most of which are now unavoidable, with widespread negative effects for the environment.We need to put in place measures today to adapt to climate change and we need to climate-proof our county development plans, prohibit urban sprawl, invest in measures that will protect communities from flooding, have early warning systems in place for extreme weather events and ensure water is available for human consumption, agriculture, irrigation and industry.  Ireland's tourism industry will have to adapt to the impact of climate change if it is to survive.  If farmers have problems obtaining water in Ireland and elsewhere, we must ask whether there will be future food shortages.  This issue was raised by Deputy John Curran.  We must find solutions to these problems now and prioritise research and development in this area.  Much excellent work has already been done by Irish researchers on the impacts of climate change.We must plan well ahead.  We are now planning housing developments that will not be completed for decades to come.  Many county councils will begin to review their county development plans next year and the new plans will be drawn up with reference to rezoned land that may not be built upon for many years, if not decades.  We must now take into account the effects of climate change and carbon emissions in plans for future housing developments.  Mitigation and adaptation are often treated as separate issues but the documentation of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change suggests that "there is high confidence that neither adaptation nor mitigation alone can avoid all climate change impacts; however, they can complement each other and together can significantly reduce the risks of climate change".Irish planning legislation is not strong enough.  It outlines that councils "may" have regard to flooding studies, the national climate change strategy and ministerial guidelines, but it is not mandatory.  They can continue to rezone to allow urban sprawl, one-off houses, building on flood plains and the development of poor public transport links.  If we allow this to continue in county development plans, all our climate change targets will just be cosmetic.The Green Party will just be spouting hot air on climate change if the Government does not put in place, as a matter of emergency, proper public transport, thereby reducing significant emissions and unsustainable development.  If it does not ensure local authorities are staffed with inspectors to ensure regulations on energy-efficient buildings are complied with, the regulations will not be worth the paper they are written on.  We must decide on where we cannot build because of the impact of climate change.  If we build in risk areas, we must invest in the necessary local infrastructure and services that will protect the communities in those areas in so far as this is possible.  We must ensure we protect the specific vulnerable groups that need special protection, including the poor, older people, children, farmers and those living in high-risk areas, including coastal areas.Deputy John Curran referred to carbon credits.  It was reported in The Irish Times yesterday that €40 million will be required next year to purchase carbon credits.  There are to be negotiations in Bali this year to set down even higher targets on the reduction of carbon emissions than those that already exist.  Therefore, the cost of credits for Ireland will increase further unless we get our act together.  Taxpayers will end up paying for carbon credits because the Government did not get its act together in the past ten years to provide public transport and prevent unsustainable development.  If it had done so, we would not be paying as much next year and in the years thereafter.The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, is proposing to set up a climate change fund through the Green Party.  He was interviewed on "Morning Ireland" yesterday and he stated he would give all his pay increases to the party.  He believes this would represent a good use of the money and wants to raise awareness of climate change.  Earlier this year, he announced a major public awareness campaign on climate change, to be conducted by his Department.  If the Department is to have a campaign, why does the Green Party need to launch its own?  This demonstrates that the Minister's proposal is just a publicity stunt.  It is badly thought through considering how he responded to the different issues raised about it on Tuesday.  It is an attempt by the Green Party — of all parties — to find ways around the legislation to prevent individuals donating over a certain sum to political parties.  It is a disgrace.A report in today's newspaper suggests the proposal not to accept the pay increases was never raised at Cabinet level.  The Green Party Members could choose not to accept their increases.  The money could remain in the Exchequer and could be used for the Government's climate change awareness campaign rather than that of the Green Party.  They could do what was done by the Labour Party, Fine Gael and Democratic Left in 1994 when the first decision of the then Cabinet was to turn down proposed ministerial pay increases.  Why are the Green Party Ministers not proposing this in Cabinet meetings if it is serious?

We are having this debate at an important time, given the major climatic changes that are taking place.  It is also a great opportunity to think, plan and change.I disagree with many of the recent criticisms of the Green Party.  I welcome the fact that there are two Green Party Ministers in the Government.  It is a progressive development.  The Ministers concerned are doing their best and, rather than attacking them and their party, we should support them.  I disagree with the Green Party on some issues but it is important that we support it in respect of issues like climate change, recycling and caring for the environment.

#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	115	I also will not listen to any old guff from some politicians about salaries.  Let us face reality.  Many Deputies regularly donate sections of their salaries to charities and voluntary groups.  They do not look for gold medals or go on RTE looking for headlines.  We do not make a big deal of it like some politicians in this House.  That is the reality, with which I like dealing.I strongly support Deputy O'Rourke's comments.  She said that at most meetings she attends, she comes across people who say that it is great to have the Green Party in government, and most people with whom I talk say it is refreshing to see the Green Party in government.  We have a responsibility to support the party.  It is not rocket science.  The Green Party has some new and radical ideas and, rather than simply attacking it every day with more guff and hot air, as has happened over the past seven or eight days, the best thing for us to do is to sit down and agree policies on the very important issues of climate change and recycling.  It is very important for us to put these issues on the record.  The two Green Party Ministers are doing an excellent job.I also raised this issue in my talks with the Taoiseach in respect of the formation of the Government.  Section 8 of my agreement with the Taoiseach is a strong section that deals with climate change and supports sensible solutions from any party that comes up with them.  I agree with many parties in this House on particular issues.  We have had the talk and hot air and are now looking for action and a solution.  I have had enough of the talks about talks so let us go on and take action.Speaking at a meeting of the intergovernmental panel on climate change, IPCC, the UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, told delegates that the humbling scenes he had witnessed were as "frightening as a science fiction movie".  He said: "In Antarctica, the message was chillingly simple: the Continent's glaciers are melting."  He went on to say: "In the Amazon, I saw how the rainforest — the "lungs of the earth" — is being suffocated."  He described the fight against climate change as the defining challenge of our age, a position I support.  We should listen to the UN Secretary General on this issue.  His observations are backed up by the science contained in the IPCC fourth assessment report, which warns of the abrupt and irreversible consequences of climate change.The message to all Members of this House is simple.  It is not just about attacking the Green Party, which we should support, but politicians must agree a deal in upcoming talks in Bali to curb greenhouse gas emissions or the world faces potentially catastrophic consequences in this century or the next.  We can do so in Bali and should do so now in Dáil Éireann and get cross-party support on this issue.  Let us stop the guff we have heard here for the past nine or ten days, which has involved attacking the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and trying to take them out when they are trying to put forward sensible policies.Ireland must try to effectively improve industrial energy, move to new kinds of power generating capacity, try to come to grips with the transportation sector and persuade people to buy cars that use less petrol or use energy-efficient appliances.  We all have a role to play.  It is not just a matter for the Government and the Minister, it concerns the broader society and community.  Whether it involves recycling or dealing with energy issues in one's home, that must be part of the strategy.  Climate change is a cross-party issue for which everybody has responsibility, which I welcome.If one looks at the details of it, one can see that climate change is increasingly seen as the biggest environmental challenge facing the world.  While the problem springs from industrialisation and the transport revolution, developing countries are among the most vulnerable to climate change.  They are the countries that will be most affected by flooding, drought and crop failures.  There is a risk that in many of these countries, the millennium development goals will soon become a receding target.What can be done?  Can issues such as the UN clean development mechanism yield adequate results?  What contribution can we expect from the European Commission's proposed global climate change alliance?  What greater level of financial commitment is needed and what will be the timetable?  How can we better integrate climate change into our development policies, which is a key issue.  I must be honest and say that in the 1980s, I was more interested in economic and social issues, particularly during the downturn in the economy, when I worked in the north inner city.  These were bread and butter issues concerning housing, poverty and unemployment.  We have now moved on from those issues and must look at development issues, as well as climate change.  It is very important to focus on those issues.It is also important that we link this to local issues.  In my constituency, the debate about the proposed 52-acre infill in Dublin Bay is an issue about which we must be very concerned.  In my community of Clontarf, I support the campaign of Dublin Bay Watch to save Dublin Bay.  I raised this issue with the Taoiseach in the talks on the formation of the Government.  It is important to connect to local issues because if we start destroying beautiful habitats like Dublin Bay, there is the danger that the immediate area could be affected.  I am talking about flooding in Clontarf.  It is very important for me to mention these issues.In respect of assisting areas, I welcome the fact that Dublin City Council is to install flood defences on the promenade.  This will consist of a levee along the centre of the grassed area and building a sea wall opposite the shops at St. Anthony's Church in Clontarf.  The old Clontarf baths are privately owned and the council proposes to put retractable gates in this area to maintain flood defences.  These are sensible proposals in respect of this issue.There is a link between local environmental issues and the international issue of climate change.  Let us accept that climate change is a reality.  The evidence is overwhelming and the scientific community is unanimous in believing that climate change is caused by human activities, chiefly the burning of fossil fuels which emit greenhouse gases.  Glaciers are retreating, the Arctic is melting, sea levels are rising, deserts are expanding and species are disappearing.  These are just a few dramatic results of our energy production and usage.  If these results are to be kept within bearable limits, the rise in global average temperatures must be kept to 2° Celsius.  According to the latest report of the IPCC, greenhouse gas emissions must peak and decline within the next ten to 15 years.  This requires a major shift in our energy and transport policy.  It is very important that we point out the importance of these policies.  One of the sensible options proposed in this House is the formation of a special committee on climate change representing all parties in the Dáil.  This is a positive development, as is the fact that it will be chaired by Deputy Seán Barrett because he will get on and do the job, refrain from having talks about talks, roll out sensible solutions and deal with the issues on a practical level.It is all very well to come in here, say what one is against and have the wider debate about climate change.  I will throw out a few sensible solutions.  There are three fundamental measures a Government can take, although everyone bears responsibility.  We should all push for an international agreement to keep the rise in global temperatures to 2° Celsius or less.  We should examine enacting a climate change law that provides for an annual carbon budget and a 3% annual reduction in Irish greenhouse gas emissions.  Another proposal, which is important for developing countries, is to support them in adapting to unavoidable change.  I will put my suggestions to the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security, to which I have had the honour of being nominated.  While discussing these matters we must face up to climate change.  We must also address energy and the radical changes we must make in the next nine or ten years.I suggest those in opposition criticising the Green Party listen to some of the sensible policies the party has.  The Opposition should support the Green Party in government, give it a break and cut out guff, hot air, heckling and point scoring.  The Opposition should listen to sensible solutions.  The men and women on the street wish to implement green policies.  Let us get on with the job.
#JohnDeasyFG	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-party	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-dob	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	116	I wish to contribute to a debate that is possibly more futile than yesterday's debate on young people.  This is a debate on whether to have a debate on nuclear energy.  We are getting used to hearing markedly gloomy scenarios on energy cost and supply from the Taoiseach and his Ministers in this Chamber.  We heard it again yesterday when the Taoiseach stated that we must get cheaper, more effective and efficient energy from electricity companies and that the issue is hugely important for the future competitiveness of the economy.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, stated electricity supply this winter could be tight, whatever that means.When people attempt to discuss the cleanest and potentially the most cost effective energy source — nuclear energy — as a solution, people around here run for the door like frightened children.  There is much footwork in the Chamber today.  In the debate on climate change and tackling global warming, if one accepts nuclear energy is the cleanest source, why are we not discussing it?I have examined the comments of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  Earlier this year he stated that with a country of our grid size there is a real difficulty with nuclear power because the most cost effective size for reactors today is too large for the Irish system.  However, according to EirGrid, the people who manage the national grid, there are several plants on the grid in the 450 MW range and new technology means that 600 MW plants are commonplace.  According to industry sources, 600 MW is the most commonly cited size suitable to Ireland's grid.  Globally, nine reactors under 700 MW are being constructed.The ESRI agreed with the Minister at the start of the year, stating that the economically feasible scale of a nuclear power station would exceed the capacity of the Irish market to absorb its output.  Last month the ESRI changed its position substantially.  It called for a comprehensive economic study to examine the cost of the Republic's ban on nuclear energy and questioned the rationale behind the Government's target to source 33% of power from renewable energy from 2020, which will require a sharp increase in wind penetration.In the latest debate about having a debate on nuclear energy the Minister stated it was extremely expensive, takes too long to build, and that we have no skills in the area.  The Minister has no idea how much this would cost because no one has undertaken a comprehensive study in this country on the cost and cost effectiveness of a nuclear plant.  The new reactors are built in 14 months, not an extraordinary period.  It is unusual to say that we have no skills in the area.  When one has a problem but no expertise, one can bring it in to solve the problem.  Our historical experience with nuclear energy is considerable.  The person who first split the atom and received a Nobel Prize for physics was Mr. Ernest Walton, from Dungarvan, County Waterford.  We have plenty experience in nuclear energy, more so than many countries.There is no scientific or economic rationale behind the Government's refusal to commission an analysis of the long-term benefits of nuclear energy for the country.  It has more to do with electoral politics.  If the Green Party cannot make difficult decisions it is an indication that the party is as politically expedient as anyone else.  There is an elephant in the room in the debate on energy.  We may not need a debate on nuclear energy but we need the Government to analyse the utility of nuclear energy as a component of our energy needs, cost and security in the next 30 years.  There is no simple answer but I ask the Government to determine its viability in the interest of the economy.We are overly dependent on fossil fuels and our sources are drying up.  In the next five years we will pay hundreds of millions of euro in fines, or carbon credits as the Government likes to say.  Some 90% to 95% of our energy is derived from fossil fuels, we are the third most dependent on oil in the European Union and are more dependent than the United States.  The EU average cost for a megawatt hour is €14.16 for domestic and €8.63 for industrial use.  Ireland's cost is €16.70 for domestic and €11.32 for industrial use.  By comparison France's price is €5.78 for industrial use, less than half Ireland's figure.  France generates 75% to 80% of its electricity using nuclear power.  Our economy is suffering and this will continue because at least 90% of our energy is being imported and both domestic and industrial users are paying above average for electricity.  Not long ago we paid 5% less than the European average.Besides setting aside €200 million to pay the fines, or carbon credits, the Green Party is considering a petrol tax and penalising gas guzzlers, namely, cars with engine sizes greater than 1.6 litres.  These include Ford Escorts and Toyota Corollas.  That measure will be really popular.  It will not be called a carbon tax, rather it will be called an increase in motor tax or VRT.  Meanwhile the Minister for Finance is saying that taxation matters are a matter for him.  While politicians jostle to justify their ideologies, our economy will have some tender moments.  The people in power are unprepared to engage in the cleanest and most cost effective source of power, nuclear energy.  That is a classic profile in political cowardice and prevarication.During the summer, the ESB indicated that, with more research, nuclear and clean coal will be options for the long-term policy mix.  A Forfás report stated that our ability to attract high levels of foreign direct investment will depend on the country's capacity to deliver a secure and uninterrupted energy supply at competitive prices and the building of a nuclear plant could be justified.  Forfás has been joined by IBEC, the ESRI and the ICTU.  We are very dependent on fossil fuels and will continue to pay a heavy price and fines as a result.The Minister says that renewables can pick up the slack but I do not believe that.  Renewables will not close the gap in energy consumption in the coming years.  The Taoiseach referred to hard decisions on energy and climate change.  At the very least we must determine the best options.  We must analyse the potential benefits of nuclear energy by commissioning a comprehensive financial assessment of the costs involved and the possible benefits to our economy and in preventing global warming.  It is not a difficult decision, it is basic government.  That is where we need to start.
#MichaelFitzpatrickFF	unknown-#MichaelFitzpatrickFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFitzpatrickFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFitzpatrickFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	117	As a member of the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security, I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  Our planet is warming up and our climate is changing because of man-made emissions of greenhouse gases.  Many human activities — manufacturing, farming, driving our cars and heating our homes — are responsible for generating greenhouse gases.  The resulting gases such as carbon dioxide and methane are contributing to a gradual warming of the planet.  This warming is already disrupting climate patterns and without strong counter-measures, it will intensify.  In Ireland we are threatened with wetter winters, increased flooding and summer droughts.  Rising sea levels will increase risks to our coastal cities, towns and villages and we will experience more intense storms.  This is the doomsday scenario that the experts are telling us will come about, unless we begin to combat the effects of climate change.The national climate change strategy sets out, in a detailed and specific way, the comprehensive measures the Government has put in place to enable Ireland to meet its targets under the Kyoto Protocol.  The strategy brings together the range of actions being taken by the Government to reduce Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions.  It provides the necessary overall Government co-ordination to meet Ireland's Kyoto Protocol commitments and builds on progress made since the original national climate change strategy was published in 2000.The strategy contains measures relating to all sectors of the economy, including energy, transport, agriculture, the residential sector and businesses.  It includes existing measures put in place on foot of the previous national climate change strategy and, subsequently, through the National Development Plan 2007-2013, Transport 21, the White Paper on Energy and the bioenergy action plan.  It also includes a series of additional measures to deliver the overall objective of putting Ireland on a path towards a low carbon economy.The strategy shows that the total contribution of measures adopted by the Government will account for 80% of the effort that Ireland will need make in order to meet its Kyoto Protocol commitments.  The remaining 20% will be made up by Ireland's use of the flexible mechanisms.  These will allow parties to the Kyoto Protocol to support the development of clean technology in the developing world in return for emissions credits.  A sum of €270 million has been allocated under the National Development Plan 2007-2013 for investment in such projects over the lifetime of the strategy.The Carbon Fund Bill will provide the necessary legislative underpinning for the National Treasury Management Agency to undertake its role as purchasing agent on behalf of the State.  The public sector will be required to measure, report and reduce its emissions.  Public sector bodies will have specific targets to reduce their emissions and will be required to indicate progress in their annual reports.  The Government will require the exclusive purchase of energy efficient light bulbs for use by public bodies by the end of this year.  It is planned that the Government will publish another climate change strategy for the period to 2020, when Ireland's post-2012 commitments are known.The current strategy sets out, on a sectoral basis, a combination of existing and additional measures that will reduce Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions by over 17 million tones of carbon dioxide equivalent in the period 2008-12.  Additional measures for the purposes of the strategy encompass policies and measures adopted since the previous projections were completed for the Government in March 2006.Ireland is playing its part and will meet its commitments under the Kyoto Protocol.  However, this is just the first step.  The international community is working towards an agreement on strengthened global action to control emissions.  This will follow on from the Kyoto Protocol.  The European Union, including Ireland, has already committed to further significant reductions in emissions by 2020.  Achieving these reductions will require sustained effort.  All of us — the Government, public authorities, businesses, farmers, families and individuals — must play a part.  Working together we can achieve our targets without compromising competitiveness, economic performance or quality of life.  We will benefit from harnessing more renewable energy, using energy more efficiently and embracing low carbon technologies.Under the Kyoto Protocol, Ireland must limit the growth in its emissions to 13% above 1990 levels over the 2008-12 period.  Measures already in place and additional measures outlined in the national climate change strategy will effectively reduce our overall emissions from almost 80 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year to our Kyoto Protocol target of 63 million tonnes.The national climate change strategy 2007-12 builds on Ireland's first such strategy and its purpose is to show clearly the measures by which Ireland will meet its 2008-12 Kyoto Protocol commitments, to illustrate how these measures will position us for the post-2012 period and to identify the areas in which further measures are being researched and developed to enable us meet our eventual 2020 commitments.We must reduce our heavy reliance on fossil fuels and expand the use of renewable energy sources such as wind, wave and solar power and biomass.  The aim is to source 15% of electricity from renewable energy by 2010 and 33% by 2020.  The strategy will promote using energy more efficiently and further reduce the CO2 output of large industrial plants through their participation in the EU emissions trading scheme.  Grant schemes are supporting homeowners and businesses to switch to renewable energy and planning changes have made it easier to install solar panels and small wind turbines.Information on how householders can save energy is being provided through the ongoing energy efficiency Power of One campaign.  Traditional, incandescent light bulbs will be phased out and the use of more energy efficient alternatives encouraged.  Smart meters which offer greater energy saving opportunities will be supplied to all electricity customers.While the energy efficiency of the economy has increased, Irish business and industry can and will do more.  Further efficiency gains are achievable.  Agriculture and forestry can make a big contribution to reducing greenhouse gases.  The strategy envisages considerable expansion of forestry and energy crops, continued support for these industries and incentives for farmers to become involved.  Agriculture is also a significant source of greenhouse gases and is responsible for 28% of Ireland's overall emissions.  The strategy is targeting further reductions through improved environmental management on farms, with reduced fertilizer use and better manure management.Climate change cannot be ignored.  We have the strategies in place and must now enact them in order to ensure future generations will reap the benefits.

#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	120	The Minister of State has given me another job.  Global warming is discussed on a regular basis at the Council of Europe.  My party in Europe, the EPP, has produced a draft document on climate change and it is hoped the European Union will pursue the matter further.  I congratulate my Fine Gael colleague, Deputy Seán Barrett, on his appointment as Chairman of the new Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security.  It is great to have this committee established and I hope its members will focus on their responsibilities.Global warming is a reality.  Throughout the world, we can observe the effects of rapid warming within a short period of time.  Within the past century, global surface temperatures have increased by an average of 0.74° centigrade.  In recent years, global temperatures have spiked dramatically.  As Deputy Coveney stated, 11 of the past 12 years, between 1995 and 2006, rank among the 12th warmest years of recorded global surface temperatures since 1850.  These figures speak for themselves.  To many ordinary people, 1° might not sound very much.  However, in locations such as the Arctic Circle, small changes are amplified and 1° can be significant.The effects of climate change accelerate so quickly that statistics are out of date before they are printed.  Combating climate change is the greatest challenge facing the world and following the agreement reached by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, in Valencia last weekend we can no longer ignore the warnings.  It cannot be disputed that global warming is a reality.The United Nations Secretary General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, visited the Arctic region recently to see what is happening to the glaciers.  The President of the European Commission, Mr. Barroso, also visited the region with the Danish Minister with responsibility for the environment.  We owe a great debt to the winners of the Nobel peace prize, the IPCC and the former US Vice-President, Al Gore, for their efforts in helping us understand man-made climate change and laying the foundations for the measures needed to counteract such change.An IPCC report drawn up by more than 2,500 of the world's top scientists concludes that global warming is now indisputable.  The poles are melting, the patterns of rainfall are changing and heat waves, floods, storms and droughts are all becoming more prolonged and severe.  Without radical action, the world faces major catastrophes such as Greenland's ice sheet disappearing, the Amazon rainforest becoming a dry savanna and Australia's Great Barrier Reef dying.  A great deal of emphasis is placed on Africa.  During the next 30 years, between 75 million and 250 million people there will be short of water.I will now consider what faces us in Europe and previous speakers spoke about what will happen here as a result of global warming.  One negative impact will be more frequent coastal floods and inland areas will also be affected.  In recent years, floods occurred in central Germany and Prague.  I saw this when I visited Prague a number of years ago and went to a restaurant near the Charles Bridge which had been submerged in floods the previous year and still had the marks.  Florence was also flooded a number of years ago.Coastal flooding will affect Ireland.  The area in which I live, Ballynacally, County Clare, will suffer greatly if the seas rise.  The Fergus embankments are in an extremely poor state and have been subject to flooding in recent years.  Unfortunately, the OPW will not take responsibility for maintaining these embankments.  It takes responsibility for some embankments towards Clarecastle.  However, this is not the casedown the coast on the Fergus estuary from Ballynacally, Kildysart, Labasheeda and Killimer Knockerra.The OPW is conducting a study on the condition of the embankments which will be available next year.  I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, to put the necessary capital funding in place to repair the embankments.  If this does not happen and we experience the flooding promised for the next 20 years, many low-lying areas will be flooded.  Farmers will be put out of business, the environment will be affected and houses will be flooded.Another negative impact of climate change is the increased risk of forest fires.  Many of the recent fires, particularly those in the United States, were started designedly.  We saw the impact of forest fires on the environment in Greece.  They burned out of control because of the heat waves which Greece and other countries experienced during recent years.  Africa will experience drought.  Those of us who live in rural areas know that wells are polluted or dried up.One does not need a computer to see the effects of climate change.  One need only look out the window at the garden.  Migratory birds which fly north to breed arrive three weeks earlier than usual, bats wake earlier from hibernation and flowers blossom much earlier in the year.  Every day, we hear of new diseases such as avian flu, West Nile virus and SARS.While climate change is predictable, our worst fears could be avoided with straightforward measures at little cost if the Government takes action.  Must we choose between the economy and the environment?  Previous speakers, such as Deputy O'Rourke, spoke about the little things ordinary people can do to improve the environment.  Those of us who stay in hotels see notices about towels and the excessive use of detergents.  Deputy O'Rourke mentioned turning off lights.If we think outside the box, we can effect change.  In the mid-west, the Limerick Clare Energy Agency was established in 2005 through co-investment from Limerick and Clare County Councils.  Counties Clare and Limerick have tremendous renewable energy resources.  We are fortunate that the local authorities, local businesses, rural development and third level colleges all work together to solve our climate change and energy problems.  Perhaps the Shannon Estuary has the greatest potential for development.  The wave energy of the Clare coast could make a major contribution to the regional and national electricity demand if captured.  A programme of investment of upgrades at the Moneypoint power station in Clare is already under way with regard to retrofit and scrubbers.Public transport is also important and would be improved if the western rail corridor were in place.  According to the 2002 census, 34% of households in County Clare had second cars and 83% of all households had at least one car.   We need to put a good public transport system in place.  As Al Gore has said, it is time to rise again to secure our future.A conference will be held in Bali next month and 16 Asian countries have already signed an agreement on climate change and reducing greenhouse emissions.  Let us look forward to a new beginning and a replacement for the Kyoto Agreement within the next two years.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	12769	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	121	It was reported yesterday that the Government is to spend €40 million next year on carbon credits.  Until such time as the year on year spending on credits is reduced, I will take anything said on the Government benches about this issue with a pinch of salt.As a newly elected Deputy, I find this an extraordinary week.  On two of the most important issues pertaining to Ireland, young people and climate change, we have been offered opportunities to speak at length but no legislation or other concrete proposals have been brought forward.  I thought I was elected to address these and other issues through legislation but I see this week that is not the case.  Considering these issues as only worthy of a talking shop adds to the cynicism for politics outside these Houses.I wish to speak specifically about the correlation between climate change and energy production and the demand for food.  There is a danger that the technological advances in agriculture that have dramatically increased crop yields in the past 50 years could be eroded due to the real and present danger of climate change.  Given that solar radiation, temperature and precipitation are the main drivers of crop growth, agriculture is still highly dependent on the climate.  Energy production is also a function of crop growth.  It is therefore obvious that any significant change in climate on a global scale will impact on local agriculture and thereby affect the world's food and energy supplies.It is important for this house to discuss the correlation between climate change and energy security in the context of food production.  According to an article in The Guardian newspaper, record world prices for most staple foods have led to 18% food price inflation in China, 13% in Indonesia and Pakistan and 10% or more in Latin America, Russia and India.  Wheat has doubled in price, the cost of maize is nearly 50% higher than a year ago and rice is 20% more expensive.  Next week, the FAO is expected to state that global food reserves are at their lowest in 25 years and that prices will remain high for years.  The article in The Guardian also stated:Boycotts have become commonplace.  Argentinians shunned tomatoes during the recent presidential election campaign when they became more expensive than meat.  Italians organised a one-day boycott of pasta in protest at rising prices.  German left-wing politicians have called for an increase in welfare benefits so that people can cope with price rises.There is a simple explanation for why this is happening now.  Increases in food prices stem from an increase in oil prices.  Record oil prices are forcing a flight out of food production in favour of energy production.  US farmers are leaving cereals to grow biofuel crops.  Coupled with this change, extreme weather conditions and growing demand from countries such as India and China are causing a serious spike in grain and rice demand.  It is estimated that the competition for grain between the world's 800 million motorists and its 2 billion poorest people, who are simply trying to survive, is emerging as the epic battle of our times.The Government cannot produce a motion on climate change and energy production without factoring in food production and its effect on energy security.  Climate change has already begun to have serious effects on food supply.  Therefore, policymakers in this country will need to adjust their thinking.  We can achieve self-sufficiency in the area of grain production but this must be done in a way that meets security of energy and food supply.  If the United States is seeking to reduce petrol demand by 20% before 2017, we must wake up and take note in this country.We now have a scenario where oil price increases create a demand for food for energy production.  Climate change and inclement weather patterns are forcing a spike in food prices and biofuels from grain production are experiencing unprecedented demand.  This has serious permutations for third world farmers.  Oxfam has already warned that the EU policy of substituting 10% of all car fuel with biofuels threatens to displace poor farmers in Third World countries.  Changes in climate are causing a catastrophe which is forcing the price of food upwards.  One optimistic economic analysis predicts that markets will automatically readjust to food shortages as higher grain prices make it profitable once more to grow crops for people rather than cars.If we are to be serious about this issue in Ireland, we must harness existing resources such as wind and tidal power and subscribe to a philosophy of ensuring food security.  We must encourage greater food production domestically to offset growing demand.  A growing body of opinion asserts that we can become self-sufficient in grain production.  We must examine the possibilities for both food and energy production in the future.  We must become part of the scientific analysis that seeks new crop varieties that can adapt to changing climactic conditions.  We have to encourage a slowdown in population growth globally.  However, I do not subscribe to the Malthusian analysis that population growth will outstrip agricultural growth because regulation and rational human behaviour can keep this scenario from arising.We have to wake up to the fact that if the price of oil rises further it will make fertilisers and transport more expensive, while also making biofuel crop cultivation more profitable.  In the past year alone, the cost of food in this country has risen by 4.4%.  The era of cheap food is over.  The price of milk and flour has increased by 16 and 17% respectively.  If we are to get the equation right, we must strike a balance between ensuring energy supply while also ensuring food supply.  The flight to biofuels must not come at the expense of food production.  While I do not expect much from this Government, future Governments will have to regulate human behaviour and the demand for energy will have to be curbed.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	122	I welcome the Minister and wish him the very best during his period in office.  I also welcome this debate and propose, first, to address the issue of climate change.  I do not necessarily, on this or any other subject, accept expert views uncritically on trust.  Experts tend to be passionate about their subjects, activists about their campaigns.  Nonetheless, global warming needs to be approached, first, on the basis of the precautionary principle — at any rate, many of the measures required may be good for us — and, second, on the basis that this is not an island but a country with global responsibility which must take account of global warnings, even when we may not be as directly affected as others.The following considerations present difficulties in approaching climate change in a strictly Irish context.  Climate change has occurred throughout human history and obviously it is difficult to disentangle what may be cyclical from what is contingent on recent human activity.  For example, are we saying — perhaps we are — that it would be a disaster for Greenland to return to the milder climate it enjoyed in the early Middle Ages, the Finland of the Norse sagas?In Ireland there is some difficulty in detecting substantial evidence of climate change and assessing the consequences.  I have a table from the Met Office indicating how mean air temperature has evolved during the past century and up to 2006.  It shows that the period from 1900 to 1930 was a little cooler than normal, the period from 1930 to 1960 was a little warmer than normal, the period between 1960 and 1990 was average to cooler than normal and the period from 1990 until the present has been distinctly warmer than normal.  Looking at the table it is hard to be certain what is cyclical and what is underlying change.  For example, climate change has not to date resulted in extremes in weather in Ireland.  When did the temperature in any part of this island last exceed 30° Celsius?  While I do not have the exact date, I believe it occurred some time in the late 1970s.Thankfully, although a possibility, there have been no major floods recently.  On the other hand, plenty of floods occurred across the water in Britain but perhaps that is coincidental.  One concrete change, as someone in his or her sixth decade will notice from childhood times, is that winters are undoubtedly milder.  Whereas in the winter of 1962-63 we had at least six weeks of hard snow and ice, nowadays one is lucky if snow lies for 24 hours.  Apart from certain Border drumlin areas and the mountains, Ireland is almost a snow-free country.I noted with interest, when reading Ordnance Survey reports from the 1830s, that John O'Donovan, in a letter to one of his correspondents, was convinced that summers were warmer in his youth.  We are sometimes wont to believe any few weeks of the same kind of weather is evidence of global warming.  To those of us on the campaign trail in April and May the weather seemed to be sunny day after day and we were beginning to look for sun cream.  Then there was a sharp reversal between June and August, which was followed by relatively mild weather until about one week ago.  Although people talk about drought when we have two weeks of dry weather, it is a long time since we had it.I am convinced that consistency, security and quality of water supply is a serious issue.  While problems experienced in this area are in many cases due to pressure of population increase and relatively elderly infrastructure, action needs to be taken.Many other parts of the world have been prone to weather extremes going back as far back as biblical times.  In expressing a degree of scepticism I nonetheless believe we are required to be prudent, as was the case when medical experts warned us that a variant CJD epidemic could costs tens of thousands of lives.  While the loss of life from variant CJD has been very low, this is sometimes due to human intervention to ensure the worst does not happen.  It is important if there is any danger of a tipping point being reached, to take precautions to avert such an eventuality.I agree with the previous speaker that changes in climate place a greater emphasis on local production.  Some of our patterns of activity need to be questioned, in particular, the practice of transporting food that could be produced here thousands of miles across the world.  In our domestic context, I am unhappy that rail freight transport has been virtually closed down, although I do not hold exaggerated views on what this sector could achieve.  One then has the spokesperson for the Irish Road Haulage Association complaining that his members carry 95% or more of freight and need Government assistance.  The reason they carry this volume of freight is that we have allowed rail freight transport, more or less, to go to the wall.If we want to encourage people to use public transport, we will need much greater car parking capacity.  I will repeat the comments I made on this issue in the House last week.  Capacity of Luas car parks and car parks at rail stations is at bursting point, which will limit the growth of public transport.What I find extremely irritating and must cost a fair amount of energy to produce are the fliers that drop out of every newspaper and publication one opens.  I am convinced that 95% of them go straight into the wastepaper basket.  They are an example of the wasteful society.  One of the reasons I share An Post's lack of enthusiasm for the introduction of post codes is that it would encourage the production of even more of this useless literature.It has been traditional in the past 30 or 40 years for Ministers of all Governments to travel in Mercedes cars.  While I accept that people like the most powerful cars, is this the best example to set or should the practice be reconsidered?On security of energy supply, I would like the gas supplies off the north-west coast to be brought ashore.  Every attempt has been made to try to reach some consensus.  I do not believe there is a veto.  I have some reservations about the ultra-liberalisation of energy supply.  As the Electricity Supply Board has served us well, the Government should think hard about whether we would be better off continuing to have one main supplier.  I am sorry to see climate change being used to foster and revive arguments about the need for nuclear energy.  That is neither appropriate nor necessary for Irish circumstances.

They lost the point of this debate in the sense that they were protecting the Minister and the Green Party from attack from the Opposition.I am one of those Deputies who had to go around and explain, mostly to Fianna Fáil people who were propagating the green scare, that it would be the end of agriculture if the Green Party entered government, that there was nothing to fear from the Green Party and that as we moved forward, agriculture would become greener.  I said this before the election and have been consistent on the issue in the past.  I was delighted to invite Deputy Trevor Sargent to Listowel food fair two weeks ago and on that occasion some of the farmers who had been casting doubts on him and suggesting he represented a danger for agriculture found what he had to say interesting.  I agree with Deputy Coveney that the Minister has our good will, but Fine Gael will judge the Minister on his record in four or five years' time.I agree with speakers who have said this is a problem we must all face; it is not confined to one party only.  We share a common responsibility for the issue of global warming.  Ireland must play its role, but it is a very small player in terms of the global consequences of climate change.  We contribute to the problem, but others contribute even more.  It will take joined up thinking here and internationally for change to take place and the main world leaders must display a strong political will for change.  We have seen the British Prime Minister, Mr. Gordon Brown, take a strong stand on global warming and other issues and have seen a late conversion from President Bush.  I hope similar leadership will come from President Putin and others.  Time will tell.  We will judge the impact of the Green Party in time, but I know the Minister will show strong leadership on the issue.I looked up the most recent research to add something new to this debate.  Recently, a team of scientists from the University of East Anglia, the global carbon project and the British Antarctic survey found that atmospheric carbon dioxide growth has increased 35% faster than expected since 2000, which is alarming.  This research was published only last week.  The study found that inefficiency in the use of fossil fuels increased levels of CO2 by 17%, while the other 18% came from the decline in the efficiency of natural land and ocean sinks which soak up CO2 from the atmosphere.  The research shows that improvements in the carbon intensity of the global economy have stalled since 2000, after improving for 30 years.  We are, therefore, going backwards.  Since the Kyoto Protocol, we are regressing, leading to this unexpected growth of atmospheric CO2.  The study also states that global CO2 emissions were up to 9.9 billion tonnes of carbon in 2006, 35% above 1990 emissions, which are used as a reference in the Kyoto Protocol.One of the scientists explained one of the reasons for this decline.  She said:The decline in global sink efficiency suggests stabilisation of atmospheric CO2 is even more difficult to achieve than previously thought.  We found that nearly half of the decline in the efficiency of the ocean CO2 sink is due to the intensification of the winds in the southern ocean.Therefore, a change in weather patterns combines with man's interference to contribute to the problem.Recent scientific evidence, published a few weeks ago, confirmed the detection of the human fingerprint on changing global precipitation patterns in the past century.  Over that period, climate records indicate sizable shifts in precipitation patterns around the globe.  Looking at average conditions over broad regions of the globe, and comparing them to changes anticipated due to human influence on climate, scientists have determined that human-induced climate change has caused most of the observed increase in precipitation north of 50o latitude, a region that includes Canada, Russia and Europe, as well as in the southern hemisphere.  Human-induced climate change has also made important contributions to the drying observed in a broad region north of the equator that includes Mexico, Central America and northern Africa.  These shifts may have already had significant effects on ecosystems, agriculture and human health, especially in regions that are sensitive to changes in precipitation, such as the Sahel region in northern Africa.  The modern scientific evidence, therefore, demonstrates clearly that we are failing in our responsibility.I draw the Minister's attention to some specific issues.  We can all look back at the records of what we ourselves have done on this issue.  I refer to a debate in the Seanad in 1986 on the Air Pollution Bill.  In that debate I pointed out that scrubbers should be installed in Moneypoint.  At that time, Ireland was succeeding in reducing sulphur dioxide emissions into the atmosphere and was achieving one of the lowest levels in Europe.  In 1980, for example, the sulphur dioxide emissions were 217,000 tonnes.  In 1983, this had reduced to 140,000 tonnes, because of the use of natural gas.  We were getting it right back then, but we have now gone in the opposite direction, despite the various initiatives taken, but never fulfilled.An Foras Forbartha was also in existence at the time.  The scrapping of that organisation in the late 1980s was a retrograde step.  It has never been replaced.  It predicted at that time that sulphur dioxide emissions would increase.  I notice, however, that it was only in 2004 that the ESB decided it would pay €368 million for modernisation equipment.  That is what it will cost us, but if we had put in scrubbers in the early 1980s, they would only have cost between £40 million to £80 million, approximately €100 million.I heard Deputy Deasy, who was in a sense criticised by Deputy Mansergh, speak about nuclear fuel.  While there is a problem with nuclear waste, the major issue concerns the disposal of carbon, as we will continue to be hugely dependent on coal.  It is important, therefore, to look at how we dispose of carbon.  I understand it is placed in old oil wells and on the seabed.  As a country, we cannot be expected to pay for research and development into its disposal.  Perhaps the Minister will refer to this issue.As regards the proposed natural gas link on the Shannon Estuary, the Minister will be aware that there is local opposition to the project, based mainly on safety issues and the evidence available from other countries.  The project represents an important departure, locally and nationally.  Perhaps the Minister will allay the fears of those genuinely concerned, many of whom are in favour of the project.  However, they have concerns about safety.  If the Minister were to visit that part of the country and meet them, it might help to ensure opposition to the plant, the level of which appears to be increasing, will wane.Some good research work has been done by an American, Hoff Stauffer, entitled, "New sources will drive global emissions".  He has said the sources currently used will have outlived their usefulness.  What we should be looking at are autos and appliances which ensure reduced emissions.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	126	I join my colleagues in welcoming the fact that time has been made available by the Whips to discuss this important issue.  The debate follows the establishment of the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security, of which I have the honour of being Vice Chairman.  I look forward to working with my colleague, Deputy Barrett, and other committee members during the term of this Dáil and discussing many of the issues raised in this debate.There is no doubt that in the past year the issue of climate change has come into the public's consciousness much more than heretofore when it was seen as an issue that did not affect us and had no impact on our daily lives.  One year on there is greater recognition of its impact.  Many are willing to put the funny weather down to it.  The Government has led the debate on the topic, despite some of the comments heard from the other side of the House.I particularly welcome the national climate change strategy, published in April this year.  It is a comprehensive document and sets out how we will meet our targets and responsibilities under the Kyoto Protocol.  It brings together the range of actions being taken by the Government to reduce Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions.  It sets out how we will co-operate internationally with a view to achieving further reductions in emissions across the world.  It affects everybody and everybody has a role to play.  It is important that the joint committee consider it on a cross-party, non-political basis.  It is also important to recognise that such a strategy is not new; it follows the document published in 2000.Despite what Deputy Deenihan said about our moving backwards on our commitments, one has to look at the way in which the country has developed economically and industrially during the past ten years.  When one places the development of the country and its transformation beside our increased emissions, one has a fair perspective.The national climate change strategy looks beyond the Kyoto Protocol scenario.  It shows that the total contribution of measures adopted by the Government will account for 80% of the efforts that Ireland will need to make to meet its Kyoto Protocol commitments.  The remaining 20% will be made up by our use of flexible mechanisms which will allow us and other parties to support the development of clean technologies in return for emissions credits.  Companies, governments and community organisations need to pay far more attention to the idea of carbon credits and how they can be used to offset our daily usage of energy necessary for living and business.  Many companies are now beginning to do this in their policies and in the context of CSR and other issues.The National Treasury Management Agency which has done such fantastic work in debt management and pensions management will assume the State's responsibilities in the area of carbon funds.  I look forward to it exercising its skills in dealing with the issue.  The public sector will have to lead the debate.  The House will be forced to make decisions in conjunction with planning authorities and local authorities in the next year or so.  The Government has started by adopting a number of practical measures which may not grab headlines but will lead to a reduction in energy usage.  I have in mind the smart metering project which the Minister announced in recent weeks and to which there was a huge reaction in my constituency office from persons seeking information on it.  The meters indicate the times when it is good to use electricity, when it will cost more, as well as current usage in one's home.  Sustainable Energy Ireland is running a pilot programme and the sooner it is introduced in every house, the sooner the people will become involved in making their contribution.The Government has moved to require all State bodies to exclusively use energy efficient light bulbs by the end of this year.  In that regard, I note the HSE dispute about light bulbs in the south has been resolved.  Let us hope there will not be another in regard to the installation of energy efficient light bulbs.  What we have to do is challenging but its impact, in terms of what we take for granted, will be extraordinary.The strategy shows that through a combination of existing and additional measures, we will be able to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by more than 17 million tonnes in the next four years.  Additional measures encompass policies adopted in March 2006.  The quantified reductions include some 13.6 million tonnes from domestic actions and 3.6 million tonnes credited to the Government.  They also involve investment on behalf of the State in developing economies, thus strengthening our role in supporting such economies.The key practical measures under the national climate change strategy will affect all of us.  It is hoped 15% of electricity supplies will be generated using renewable sources  by 2010, increasing to 33% by 2020.  The renewable sources include wind energy.  There will also be a new national ocean energy strategy.  Across the country we have already seen opposition to the introduction of wind turbines, to which a conservative approach has been adopted by some local authorities.  It is important to bring forward a national policy on wind energy to assist in meeting our targets.There is a need to support combined heat and power projects, an area in which business will have a role to play in reducing energy output.  There is no doubt that combined heat and power projects can help to do this but they are expensive and there is still a lack of awareness about their effectiveness.  An awareness campaign undertaken by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment could be assisted.The easy target in tackling climate change is transport.  The investments to be made under Transport 21, which we debated last week, to encourage and make it more attractive for people to use public transport are welcome.  The more people we get out of their cars and SUVs onto public transport the better.  We have taken huge strides, particularly in our cities.  It is important we continue those strides in rural areas.  I would like to see further support given to rural transport projects.  It never ceases to amaze me that our city colleagues complain about the DART, buses and matters about which we in rural areas know little.  The Departments of Transport and Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs have made a substantial investment in rural transport projects which are voluntarily run within communities.  This is taking many cars off the roads as well as allowing people to retain their independence in their communities.  We need to see more investment, which could be included under this heading.CIE, as the biggest public transport provider, is being required to move to biodiesel.  Many people are interested in using biofuels in their cars but availability is restricted at present.  We need a further debate in the House, perhaps at committee level, on the growth of biocrops as opposed to the growth of food crops.  This will be one of the major challenges facing the entire climate strategy in the next year to 18 months as we make a choice between energy and food.  We already have enough challenges on the food side without this further one.In recent years the Government has pushed the building and construction sector towards cleaner emissions levels.  The revised building regulations published earlier this year by the Minister, Deputy Gormley, aim for a 40% improvement in current thermal performance standards.  With the new building energy rating certification which was introduced in 2007, a variety of companies are already involved in training people to inspect energy ratings and educating people about energy rating in their homes.  I had the pleasure of working with one such company in my town.A number of issues arise with regard to energy protection.  As a Deputy for County Mayo, I am only too well aware of the issues in regard to the Corrib gas field.  Much work, investment and time has gone into assuaging concerns in regard to the safety of that project.  Huge investment in terms of people power and Government time has also been made.  It is time we proceeded with the project.  Many outside experts have accounted for its safety and the country needs the energy supply from it.I reiterate the concerns expressed with regard to the separation of the ESB.  The old ESB had a community focus, even regarding a matter as minor as that of Christmas lights, which the ESB used to provide at a highly discounted rate.  Such matters must now go to tender because of the competitive market.  In the rush to liberalisation, we need to ensure community participation and focus is retained.In the coming period I look forward to the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security having the chance to discuss these issues.  The final commitment in the strategy is that it must be reviewed each year by this House through that committee, which will ensure the House has a role in maintaining our obligations.

Prior to becoming a Deputy three years ago, I became involved in an environmental issue which led me to believe we must take our environment seriously.  That issue involved hazardous waste which was not being managed properly and caused grave concern in my area.The major change in recent times is with regard to the number of young people who are aware of climate change throughout the world, particularly in our country.  They have not experienced a hard winter such as was experienced 20 years ago and I am not sure what they would think if they did.  Eight or ten years ago, we were told Ireland would be covered in sand because we would have no rain but that has not happened.Fine Gael believes the twin challenges of climate change and the need to adjust our energy usage patterns are the most urgent facing Ireland and the world.  Addressing these challenges is a priority for Fine Gael.  The unsustainable growth in greenhouse gas emissions needs to be halted and reversed if our climate is not to be irreversibly damaged.Fine Gael is disappointed the Government has failed to meet Ireland's responsibilities under the Kyoto Protocol and our greenhouse gas emissions are twice the overall target.  Ireland's biggest contributor to CO2 emissions is the transport sector, which contributes 33% of Ireland's energy related CO2 emissions, a share higher than any other sector, including industry.  Years of underfunding and underdevelopment of Ireland's public transport sector has led to Ireland becoming car dependent and to the growth rate in consumption of fossil fuels in the transport sector since 1990.  Fine Gael is constantly promoting the fast-tracking of high capacity commuter public transport services into Dublin and other cities.  We will reform vehicle registration tax through the establishment of a system of energy efficiency labelling for vehicles, with lower rates of VRT for those cars with more efficient engines.Fine Gael supports the Stop Climate Chaos call to action.  The Government must meet its commitment to reduce by 3% per year greenhouse gas emissions and to produce one third of all energy from renewable sources by 2020.  Any slippage from these targets is unacceptable because this is the best chance to tackle climate change.The current environmental topic in my county concerns EirGrid's proposal to put a 400 KV power line through Meath, which is meeting a serious challenge.  I have not witnessed such a challenge previously, despite having been involved in football and farming.  Some 24 local groups from counties Cavan, Meath and Monaghan have gathered, night after night, to address this subject.  They are totally opposed to the idea of this cable being laid overground, particularly as the public has not received enough expert advice on health.EirGrid has acted in a poor fashion in the way it went about developing the project.  It advertised the details of the project in the newspapers six weeks ago and it was up to local people to find out about it, whereas the Government was aware of the project last March.I am disappointed because when I asked the Minister a parliamentary question as to when the Meath-Cavan 400 KV power line project was first submitted to his Department for consideration and when his Department approved the decision for EirGrid to proceed with the project, his reply stated that the Minister has no responsibility to the Dáil in this matter, which falls within the remit of EirGrid and the Commissioner for Energy Regulation.

The people of Meath are confused at this stage because the Fianna Fáil Deputies in Meath have made public statements that Fianna Fáil wants the line put underground but the Government will not allow it.  The Minister, Deputy Cowen, also commented this morning.  I am not sure who is in government.I hope the Minister will meet the groups involved.  The people of Meath want the extra power supply but they are clearly saying they want the power line put underground.  Nine miles of cable was put underground in Cork last year and this has also been done in other countries.  Power lines will be laid from Wales to Ireland and from Rush to Dunshaughlin, which are to be put underground.  Why can lines in the rest of the country not be put underground?While this will build slowly, there is no doubt it will become a national issue.  I am surprised by the fact that 300 to 400 people are attending meetings in every parish.  They include people from Fianna Fáil, the Green Party, Sinn Féin, the Labour Party and Fine Gael.  To a person, they are saying they have had enough and want answers.  The manner in which Eirgrid tried to ram this down our throats is not acceptable.

#ShaneMcEntee	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-party	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-dob	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	149	EirGrid keeps saying it is going overground and it refuses to provide a proper costing.  Fine Gael wants a proper costing undertaken to ensure people know what is happening.  It appeared in a newspaper six weeks ago that they are going to ride roughshod over County Meath, but it is unacceptable and will not happen.  Members of the 23 different committees will not accept what happened in Shannon or in some Departments lately.  They are a united bunch and the issue of the cable must be addressed in a proper fashion.  People must be given the rights and wrongs of the matter.  This morning, Fianna Fáil's deputy leader said it was too dear but money should not come into it if there are questions about public health.  I hope the Government will clarify who is in charge and what Fianna Fáil is doing.  What is Fianna Fáil at this stage?Everyone, and young people in particular, are keen for Ireland to play its part in reducing global warming.  Fine Gael will support whatever must be done in that regard.  I did not intend to become involved in an argument with the Minister over EirGrid but I ask him to take a keen interest in the matter because it will land on the steps of the Dáil within the next month or six weeks.  Nobody should underestimate what the people of Meath will do to ensure this does not happen.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	150	I have every confidence that the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, will deal with the issue the Deputy has raised.  It was a bit like question time here for a while but it is worthwhile to have such exchanges.Like all other speakers, I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate but the time for talking has run out.  It is time for action.  Those who argued that this was not an important discussion now have their answer because there has been a tremendous involvement in the debate, which I welcome.Some speakers referred to the involvement of the Green Party in Government and I add my voice to those who have welcomed that involvement.  They are good colleagues, including my constituency colleague, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  They have a solid parliamentary party with whom we are working well and we will make a difference.  I commend the Taoiseach for having the foresight and vision to form and lead this Government very effectively.  We do not recognise that often enough.  The timing was right for the involvement of the Green Party in Government.Some months before the election, Deputy Ryan and I participated in a discussion at a local primary school in Knocklyon.  Local TDs were invited but we were the only two who managed to make it on the day.  We had an extensive discussion with the sixth class pupils.  One of the questions posed concerned the possibility of Fianna Fáil and the Greens being in Government.  The Minister will recall that I said it was a possibility and it was certainly approved by those young students at the time.  We are where we are and I welcome the Greens' involvement.  We are collectively determined to move on this issue.  I am also pleased to have been involved with the Minister in the formation of the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security, on which all parties will play an important role.We have a responsibility as individuals to act on climate change but a joined-up approach by Government is the only option available to us to effect real change.  That is happening.  Achieving reductions in emissions will require a unified effort.  This debate is important in that every political party, Department, local authority and individual must become aware of the impact of their choices and actions.  We have heard that fact emphasised throughout today's debate.Just this week, the UN intergovernmental panel on climate change met in Valencia, Spain.  The UN Secretary General warned that the risk of a big rise in sea levels due to the melting of the Greenland and, possibly, Antarctic ice sheets may be larger than previously expected.  This could eventually result in a rise in sea levels by several metres.  For Ireland specifically, this means we are threatened with wetter winters, more flooding and summer droughts.  Rising sea levels will increase risks to our coastal cities and towns and we will have more intense storms.  The effects of climate change are now blatantly obvious to all of us.The Government has taken a serious approach to this issue in producing the National Climate Change Strategy 2007-12.  The strategy's purpose is to show clearly the measures by which Ireland will meet its 2008-12 Kyoto Protocol commitment and to identify the areas in which further measures are being researched and developed to enable us to meet our eventual 2020 commitment.As regards energy use, we must reduce our heavy reliance on fossil fuels and expand the use of renewable energies, such as wind, wave, solar and biomass.  The aim is to source 15% of electricity from renewable energy by 2010 and 33% by 2020.  The strategy will promote using energy more efficiently and further reducing the CO2 output of large industrial plants through their participation in the EU emissions trading scheme.As regards our homes and workplaces, the Government has progressively introduced higher energy conservation standards through building regulations.  It will build on these and will introduce building standards that are 40% more ambitious in thermal performance than current ones.Grant schemes are supporting homeowners and businesses to switch to renewable energy, while planning changes have made it easier to install solar panels and small wind turbines.  Information on how householders can save energy is being provided through the ongoing energy efficiency campaign, the Power of One.  Mandatory building energy rating certification for all buildings offered for sale or lease is being introduced.  This will give clarity on a building's energy performance and will provide an incentive to upgrade its energy efficiency.  Traditional, incandescent light bulbs will be phased out and the use of more energy efficient alternatives encouraged.  Smart meters, which offer greater energy-saving opportunities, will be supplied to all electricity customers.Greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector are growing faster than from any other sector.  There are more cars and trucks on our roads and we are choosing bigger, less fuel-efficient vehicles.  The expansion and improvement of public transport will continue to encourage a switch from private cars.  In addition, VRT and road tax will be altered to reward the purchase and use of more fuel-efficient vehicles.  The use of bio-fuels will be increased to 5.75% of all fuel used by 2010.While the energy efficiency of the economy has increased, Irish business and industry can and will become more efficient.  Low-carbon technologies will create business opportunities for Irish companies.  The Government will work closely with business through the energy agreement programmes, bioheat and combined heat and power programmes, and through support for eco-efficient technology.The well established schemes in support of waste prevention, minimisation, reuse and recycling will be expanded.  There is also a plan in place for the use of waste biomass in energy production and of waste-to-energy projects.Programmes will be further developed across the public sector to achieve energy savings of 33%.  Public sector vehicle fleets will move to a bio-fuel blend.  In addition, traffic lights and pedestrian lights will be made energy efficient.  A scheme to introduce biomass heating in schools will also commence this year.  Emissions associated with all official air travel by Ministers and civil servants will be offset.I would like to refer briefly to the innovative research on biomass being carried out at the University of Limerick, which is supported by the Shannon Development Authority.  That research is focused on the production of biomass through photosynthesis.  Their view is that there is a need to focus on solar power and the process of photosynthesis to produce biomass, from which biofuels are primarily derived.  In all discussions internationally about the need to reduce our CO2 emissions there is very little mention about the vital role of photosynthesis — the natural counteraction, which recycles CO2 productively, to make food and fuels.  It may be a solution of the future to process biomass and produce everything which comes from oil, except toxicity.  The programme for Government pledges to continue to support research in the biofuel and biomass areas in order that we can respond to new opportunities quickly.  Therefore, there are areas yet to be explored further.With regard to our EU involvement, the Kyoto Protocol required the EU 15 member states to reduce their aggregate emissions by 8% on 1990 levels during the 2008 to 2012 Kyoto Protocol commitment period.  New member states have individual targets under the protocol.  The new report from the European Commission, Progress Towards Achieving the Kyoto Objectives (COM (2006) 658), shows that, based on the latest available research in 2004, the EU-15, as it was then, have a gap of almost 8% to close to reach their targets.  Ireland's distance to target is 12.4%, based on 2005 data.  The report estimates that the EU-15 will reach their target only by using additional measures, carbon sinks and the Kyoto Protocol flexible mechanisms to purchase allowances.  Based on 2004 data, seven EU-15 countries are further from target than Ireland: Austria, at 29%; Denmark, at 19%; Finland, at 14%; Italy, at 19%; Luxembourg, at 28%; Portugal, at 14%; and Spain, at 33%.I look forward to hearing the outcome of the talks in Bali, Indonesia, later this month, as it is hoped they should set the agenda and a timetable for a post-2012 plan, with real and affordable ways to deal with climate change.  I reiterate the need for a joined-up approach to tackling climate change.  The Government has adopted a very clear cross-departmental approach with the Cabinet sub-committee on climate change, which involves many Departments.  The programme for Government commits Ireland to achieving ambitious energy efficiency savings of 20% by 2020 and 33% for the public sector.  The draft energy efficiency action plan published recently by my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, commenced this process.  We all need to work together towards achieving the savings identified in that plan.The Power of One campaign is an exemplary scheme, urging individuals to make small changes which lead to major differences.  Many Members referred to this.  This year the Christmas lights on Grafton Street are energy efficient bulbs, saving 75% more electricity than ordinary bulbs.  As the UN Secretary General stated recently, "Inaction now will  prove the costliest action of all in the long term."  Ireland is well positioned to give the much needed leadership at global level, ensuring we tackle the issue of climate change head on and leave a safe and sound legacy for future generations.
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	151	As the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Protection, Deputy Barrett, stated, it is good that young people are in the Visitors Gallery listening to the debate because this concerns their future.  In many ways we are trying to put the brakes on the train and drive in the opposite direction.  Students from my alma mater, De La Salle, Wicklow, visited the House earlier, a school also attended by three of my sons.  It was made official last week at the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change conference that mankind's lifestyle is leading to climate change because of the way energy is harvested from the ground.  The Minister referred to a Channel 4 programme and positive feedback which makes us feel comfortable that climate change is not happening.  Such programmes are counterproductive in the effort to reverse what has happened.  The current agreements may not be strong enough to affect the rate of change which is advancing faster than most of us believed heretofore.Ireland has exceeded its Kyoto Protocol target which was based on a legal agreement and the Government has embarked on buying carbon credits.  While €270 million has been set aside for this purpose, the figure could reach €1 billion if the Government does not get its act together.  The penalty clauses that await it down the line should not be underestimated.  This money could usefully be used in researching and applying best and newest technology.  Many of the statistics relating to climate change are several years old.  The Power of One campaign is welcome but the issue is greater than simply changing a light bulb.Efforts have been made to develop a coherent energy policy but small-scale practical technology is missing to supply the energy needs of small businesses and communities.  We must go back to the grassroots.  The agriculture sector contributes 28% of greenhouse gasses and this is difficult to counter because the greatest contributor is dairy cattle which produce butter, milk, yoghurt and other products needed in a world with a vastly increasing population.  Private enterprises such as Keenans provide diet nutritionists to administer advice worldwide.  With a properly managed diet, the emissions of the world's dairy herd could be reduced by 30%.  Keenans is a market leader in this regard and such initiatives are more valuable to a small country than the Power of One campaign.  The Minister should take this on board.The land held by the agriculture industry holds the greatest potential to deal with our energy dependency issues.  A debate on the use of land for food or fuel is on the way.  For example, Bord na Mona is eating into its peat reserves annually but its land is the most suitable for biomass production through planting willow which could be renewed.  The Government needs to consider this.  The energy generated from peat could be recommissioned, which means the State could retain this resource because eventually our peat reserves will run out.  In addition, biomass production would not damage the environment.  The initiative to provide energy through turf in the initial stages was way ahead of its time.  Unfortunately, the beet sector, through which 60,000 hectares could have been retrieved to produce ethanol fuel, was abandoned by the previous Government.I have examined what the US agriculture committee is doing.  It uses farm energy calculators, anaerobic digesters and considers research on conserving fuel and energy, wind and solar power initiatives, which do not compete with land for food.  These initiatives must be examined because energy can be produced without compromising our food supply.  The Departments of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and Communications, Energy and Natural Resources should fund Teagasc research to support targeted grant aid programmes for the agriculture and food sectors to kick start innovation needed to reduce our dependence on fossil fuel; improve efficiency of energy use by assisting in the calculation of farm estimates; provide electrical energy usage comparisons, efficiency guides and current energy savings cost guidelines; promote the development of agriculture alterative energy sources to run agricultural machinery, appliances, motors or buildings; use small-scale solar appliances which are used currently and underestimated; use anaerobic digesters; wind powered technology and biodiesel.The Minister referred to transport costs.  I am not sure that the correlation between transport and our planning laws is the only reason for the increase in this regard.  The greatest contributor to the increase in transport costs are goods being transported by trucks throughout the country, but such costs could be reduced by the provision of an enhanced rail service.  The statistic on waste mentioned is interesting.I do not believe that the logic for the use of 400 kVA or MW lines has not been thoroughly thought out.  There is no doubt there is power loss in the use of long lines.  The longer the line, the greater the power loss.  Upgrading the network to take in more wind power generated on a regional basis has not been examined.  The all-island energy status project will take five years to bring to fruition.  We will have only mainline feeds through high voltage lines throughout the country.  Has the option of regional power supplies which could be run cross-Border and create an all-island energy supply been examined?  EirGrid seems to have adopted a logic that the only way to achieve this goal is by running high power lines, feeding off new and not so new power plants throughout the country.Has the development of alternative and renewable energies on a regional basis, given the advances and potential capacity that exist, through incentives by way of modulation of farm payments to encourage people to get involved in such projects been examined?  I am not sure that this debate has been thrashed out to the fullest extent.  Regardless of the emotion of the cost involved, is there another way we could proceed?

It is a good job I know the Acting Chairman a long time, and I have not mentioned Tallaght, though if he wishes, I will do so.  I am sure he will manage to do that yet.It is important that this detail is thrashed out.  I appreciate that my contribution has strayed into a question and answer session with the Minister.  There is an argument in this regard.  Two members of my family work in ESB and Eirtricity and they would both put forward arguments that this matter has not been fully thrashed out and that there is an alternative way before we plough on with the scenario that has been outlined.There are many difficulties and question marks over the position of EirGrid.  There are many positives in terms of what can be done with that company, but the process must be transparent.  The way in which people are appointed to it must be examined to ensure people have confidence in it.

#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	163	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate on climate change and I thank the Minister for being present.  Climate change is without doubt one of the biggest challenges facing humanity in the 21st century.  Man-made greenhouse gas emissions are its main causes.Under the Kyoto Agreement, Ireland made a commitment to limit the increase of greenhouse gases to 13% above our 1990 levels but we have broken that commitment.  Current levels of Irish greenhouse gas emissions are more than 25% above 1990 levels, and we need to take serious measures to address that.I am disappointed that the Government will now have to spend at least €40 million next year to buy credits that will allow pollution in the Republic to exceed limits set in the Kyoto Agreement.  It is both costly and environmentally unsustainable to continue to buy our way out of international agreements we have entered into on climate change.The operators of Wind Energy Ireland, a consortium of business people and businesses who wish to establish offshore wind energy projects are preparing at present to invest €4 billion in these projects but they need co-operation from the State.  EirGrid, the State company responsible for managing the electricity grid, would have to upgrade and make significant changes to the grid to facilitate this expansion of offshore wind energy capacity.  What plans has the Minister to upgrade the national grid?  It is estimated that if this development took place, the savings to the State would amount to approximately €235 million per year and that the electricity produced would meet the electricity needs of approximately half of the State's households.  This Minister might address this issue when replying.I welcome the appointment of Fine Gael Deputy Seán Barrett as chairman of the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security and wish him well in this demanding and challenging role.It is stated that the transport sector in Ireland has been responsible for 33% of our energy-related CO2 emissions, which is higher than the emissions produced by any other sector here.  Final energy use in the transport sector has been the fastest growing rate of all sectors.  Growth of 8% was recorded in 2005.  Energy use in transport has been more than 99% dependent on oil products, all of which are imported.  This needs to be urgently changed in the future.  Additional efficiency gains would have been made if not for the purchase of larger cars by families.  We need to tackle the growing trend of the purchase by households of large-scale jeeps and vans.Under the National Climate Change Strategy 2007-2012, the Government has made the following key commitments.  One is to hit the Kyoto target of 13% above 1990 levels of greenhouse gases for the period 2008-12 and to cut emissions to 20% below 1990 levels by 2020.  The current level is 25% above 1990 levels, which is worrying.  We have much work to do to achieve these targets.  Some 15% of electricity is to be generated from renewable sources by 2010 and 33% by 2020.  Biomass is to contribute up to 30% of energy input at peat stations by 2015.  A sustainable transport action plan is to be published in late 2007.However, there are problems with the Government's commitments.  The national climate strategy scores poorly on costings.  For instance, there is no analysis of how much it would cost to produce 33% of our energy from renewable sources.  This would involve mostly wind energy and the cost of producing a new network infrastructure.  My party is firmly committed to the green agenda and renewable energy sources.  However, a detailed cost plan should accompany Government promises in this area.  There is very little detail on how the Government plans to reduce Ireland's emissions by 3% each year into the future.  An uncosted plan to switch to renewable energy, improve efficiency and public transport is not good enough.  There is a contradiction in Government policy on a carbon tax.  There is no mention of it in the national climate change strategy but the programme for Government states "Appropriate fiscal instruments, including a carbon levy, will be phased in on a revenue-neutral basis over the lifetime of this Government."  Will the Minister advise as to the whether the Green Party involvement in the Government will mean that the climate change strategy, which was agreed in April, is now redundant?My party believes that the twin challenges of climate change and the need to adjust our energy usage patterns are the most urgent facing Ireland and the rest of the world.  We believe in an efficient, vibrant and competitive energy market where supply is secure and the need to reduce consumption is always recognised.Climate change is such a serious issue that it is time for the Government to establish a Department of environment and energy, which would co-ordinate policy in this area.  We have paid too high a price for interdepartmental inertia, which has given us ten years of rising emissions and missed opportunities.  My party in government would establish a centre of excellence for alternative energy, charged with ensuring Ireland develops a world class alternative energy sector.  We would incorporate Sustainable Energy Ireland, as it exists, into the centre of excellence, to be located within an existing institute of technology, with outreach points in other academic institutions throughout the country.  It would have specific responsibility to encourage, incentivise and develop the alternative energy sector, with the objective of replacing a major percentage of energy imports and securing supply.The Minister needs to improve grant aid initiatives for householders who wish to convert existing home heating norms to renewable energy technology in their homes.  We also need to ensure the energy performance in buildings directive is implemented in full and in a timely fashion.  We need to work towards ensuring that 30% of all new buildings are green and powered by renewable sources of energy.  As regards electricity, Fine Gael would move towards generating 33% of Ireland's electricity needs from renewable sources by 2025.  We would target an increase in renewable energy production to 17% by 2012 as an interim measure and legislate for the complete separation of the ESB from the national grid, while keeping both in State ownership, to ensure a level playing field for all energy suppliers.The potential for wind energy in this country has not been realised.  My party would ensure there was interconnecting infrastructure with other electricity markets to allow for significantly increased generation from wind.  As regards bio-fuels and the role of agriculture, it is time for the Minister to remove all excise duty on bio-fuels produced from all renewable energy crops.  Fine Gael in government would make available establishment grants for producer groups comprising up to 50% of set-up costs, subject to a maximum of €300,000 per group.  We would examine the current rates of payment under the existing energy crops scheme and whether the sugarbeet crop should be included in the scheme to facilitate development of the bioethanol industry.  We would initiate a public competition for the establishment and operation of a number of bio-fuel processing plants, strategically located in selected locations.  Capital start-up grants for these plants would initially be given to enable them to become established and begin viable processing operations.  We would also initiate a public awareness and promotion campaign to encourage the growth of bio-fuels.As regards VRT, it is certainly time to reform vehicle registration tax through the establishment of a system of energy efficiency labelling for motor vehicles, with lower rates of VRT for those cars with more efficient engines.  My party in Government would create a market for bio-fuels by legislating to provide that all motor fuels must include a blend of fuel from renewable sources.  The EU has set a binding agreement of increasing the penetration of bio-fuels in transport to 10% by 2020.  Fine Gael in government would accept this target and aim for an increase to 5% as an interim measure by 2012.It is time for the Government to take action on climate change.  We all have a positive role to play in our daily lives regarding energy conservation, but certainly the Fianna Fáil-Green Party coalition in government needs to drive policy in reducing CO2 emissions and help save our planet.  I look forward to the Government ensuring we meet out Kyoto commitments in the future and that we stop paying unnecessarily for carbon credits, wasting taxpayers' money.

It was not in vogue much, however, during the recent general election campaign.  I do not believe a question was raised by anybody, certainly as regards any of the areas I had an interest in — I had a passing interest in it at the time.As a matter or urgency we need to recognise the extent of the problem.  Global warming is here.  Some of the actions we take may stall its onset or improve matters somewhat.  There is a considerable body of scientific opinion, too, which challenges the consensus and argues that global warming is inevitable, follows its own sequence and will naturally correct itself over time.  Therefore, I do not believe we should waste too much time worrying about it.  What we have to do, however, is make a contribution——

They point out and prove their case.  In order to fully assess a situation it is important to hear what the other fellow has to say as well.  That is why we have debates in the House.

#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	168	I do not, actually.  The point I was going to make before I was interrupted is that we have a moral obligation to make a contribution.  We need to challenge our carbon footprint and we need to address those issues.  We in our economy cannot change the world, despite the fact that sometimes we are led to believe we can.However, there are various ways and means by which we can go about giving a good example to everyone else.  We can improve our economy and become self-sufficient.  We said all those things before.  In a previous incarnation the Minister and I were in the business of looking at those issues.We can be positive.  Transport and agriculture are two of the worst areas in so far as methane gas emissions are concerned.  However, I am not so sure about the authenticity of the statistics.  The transport sector, for example, changes from time to time.  There has been an enormous change in the whole area of after-burning and reburning as regards internal combustion engines in the last five years.  The motor industry has a responsibility, and I fully accept that.  It is difficult to anticipate a situation whereby any country can survive without some transport, whether with electricity powered rail systems or roads on which electric engines are used.  However, that is an area for future development, with enormous potential and it can make an impact worldwide if replicated.I can never understand why no one ever addresses the whole question of local authority sewerage systems throughout the country.  They are never mentioned in statistics but emit colossal amounts of methane gas.  No one ever says a word because Governments are responsible for failing to provide the necessary funding to ensure this does not happen.  The Minister knows this, of course, but if anybody doubts what I am saying, he or she should go to Kill, County Kildare, where there is a major dump, and listen to the complaints of the people in the area.  They are being virtually poisoned by the amount of methane gas emanating from that facility.Worse still, if one drives into Leixlip, County Kildare on any night, one gets the unmistakable nauseating smell of methane gas emanating from the local sewer.  There have been plans to alleviate that for the last 15 years.  We have been told in that time that the solution was imminent and that it would be addressed "next week".  The Minister's colleague has indicated in recent times that it would be dealt with now.  My impression is that it will not, but it is a serious incursion in an area that can be addressed.  The technology is available, so why do the authorities put off until tomorrow what they could do today?  After all, Ireland is one of the wealthiest countries in the world, according to some experts in this House.  I cannot understand why a decision is not being made in an area where a definite effect can be achieved in the shortest possible time, yet nothing gets done.  I bet that taxes the imagination of the Acting Chairman, as someone who has to listen to all types of argument in this House from time to time.  It taxes mine and everybody else's as well.Another area I am concerned about is the whole question of supporting sustainable energy houses.  The SEI, as mentioned by the last speaker, had a laudable system of grant aid.  No sooner had the Government's members sat in their ministerial cars, or cycled in front of the squad cars on their bicycles, than the Minister came in with a slash-hook and sliced the grants in two halves.  In one fell swoop, the Minister became a slasher and sliced the grants in two halves.

Maybe he has been too tied up with the incinerator or its alternative.  I and others tabled parliamentary questions recently on the decision made in the past 12 or 14 months to locate a landfill in the Bog of Allen.  Doing so would affect carbon trapping and sequestration.  Bogland is supposed to act as a reservoir for carbons and the development of vegetation therein is ideal for this purpose, yet we are to stick a landfill site in the middle of the bog.  It is but one of many that is to be located in the bog and this will have major consequences.  How much hypocrisy can we take?Carbon sequestration is affected by the kinds of trees we grow, the number we grow and the location in which they are grown.  I am sure other speakers stated our bogland would be ideal for growing trees.  Some tree species are four times better than others at trapping carbon but I have never seen this theory promoted in any quarter in Ireland.  It is a simple matter and everyone could plant the efficient trees in their gardens.  Such a tree would not take up the entire garden but would make a positive contribution to carbon trapping.We must differentiate between fuels that are carbon-neutral and those that are not.  Transporting fuels half way across the world is hardly the most efficient way to proceed.  We can and must grow our own and biofuel production must be balanced with food production.  The European Union has a very strong role to play in this regard.  I do not refer to a cute role whereby the Union would off-load food production to third countries and pretend it could not produce it itself.  The Union can balance food production with fuel production.  Let each member state have its own share of the spoils and let us not exclude certain industries, such as the sugar beet industry, as we did last year.  I tabled a parliamentary question last week and received a reply with a graph indicating massive reductions in Italy, Poland and elsewhere.  The Minister should have studied this.  There was no reference at all to the United Kingdom or France in the reply.  I wonder what happened in this regard.We need to be serious and realistic about climate change.  We can make a positive contribution but should not state it will be disastrous and advocate moving to high ground, nor should we believe we can solve the problem ourselves.  For God's sake, will the Government take a leading role by allocating money for the inefficient, outdated, unworkable, badly designed sewage treatment schemes throughout the country that are causing considerable pollution, without eliciting any comment at all, and those emitting considerable amounts of methane gas?  It is possible to trap methane gas.  Once, when in another jurisdiction, I saw a sewage treatment system in operation and thought it was a swimming pool.  One does not see too many of those in Ireland.  It was a positive feature in the landscape, made a major contribution to the environment and was aesthetically pleasing.I thank the Acting Chairman, Deputy Charlie O'Connor.  I am sorry I did not mention Tallaght in my contribution, but I will mention it the next time.

I welcome in particular the contributions of Deputies Martin Mansergh and Bernard Durkan, which honestly reflected the uncertainty of many inside this House and beyond about the science of climate change.  This suggests to me that there is still work to be done on the science.  Increasingly, friends ask why they were not told more about it.  Perhaps there is a job to be done in this regard.  Perhaps I will sit Deputy Durkan down to chat about this further——

#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	175	——because the story needs to be told and cannot be ignored.It is useful to discuss the carbon credits system.  The flexible mechanisms system refers to the carbon development mechanism, or CDM, as it is known by those involved in the Kyoto process.  A number of Deputies raised this matter and in that regard I am happy to clarify the position I enunciated while in Opposition and which I will reiterate in Government.  My position is one of support for the flexible mechanisms because they are part of the Kyoto process, which is the only international solution we have.  It is part of a flexible approach on the path towards an annual reduction in carbon emissions.  There is clear agreement on all sides that we cannot rely on such mechanisms as the mainstay of our response.  If they were regarded as such, they would be highly inappropriate as a form of strategic direction.  Using the mechanisms as part of an overall integrated response is the correct approach.  I supported this approach in Opposition and do so now in Government.The international target demonstrates a stark need to effect much more radical change than we believe is necessary.  Deputy Coveney's contribution was one of the few that conveyed the scale of change in question.  The carbon development mechanism will be discussed and approved by the majority of signatories to the Kyoto Protocol and the international agreement on climate change at the negotiations in Bali.  In this regard, we must be aware that the European Union sets as a target a 30% reduction in 1990 emissions, through international agreement, by 2020.  This presents a considerable challenge for Ireland.Consider the commitment to achieve an average reduction of 3% per annum, as outlined in the programme for Government.  If a 3% reduction is achieved from 2008 onwards, Ireland's level will be approximately 14% below 1990 levels in 2020.  Our current level is approximately 25% or 26% above 1990 levels.  Within a European burden-sharing agreement, the level of 14% below 1990 levels is the level to which we are expected to commit.  The Taoiseach has already signed up to this agreement at Heads of Government level but achieving our target will not be easy.To answer the question justly asked by Deputy Terence Flanagan, I fully support the national climate change strategy, as set out.  However, given that the 30% European target is set, the strategy recognises that even if we achieve an annual reduction of 3% on foot of current policy, there still will be a 16 million tonne shortfall.  This is why we need a debate.  As Deputy Coveney stated, the level of change required is way beyond what the average person understands to be necessary.I welcome the discussions on the electricity grid.  In this regard, I particularly welcome the knowledgeable contribution of Deputy Andrew Doyle.  One of the benefits of the all-island approach to electricity is the launch of a single electricity market.  I hope to be able to launch, within a number of weeks, an all-island grid study that will indicate exactly what is required to develop the transmission network so as to meet radically higher renewable electricity targets as part of our overall response.  There will be sensitive and difficult areas throughout the country, even in local distribution grids, where we will need to develop renewable energy resources.  That is why it is important for us to look at that overall level and at each project on the basis of a broad national issue rather than always on a purely project-by-project basis.In response to the point raised by Deputy Deasy, the committee chaired by Deputy Barrett may be the perfect venue for the discussion of nuclear power if people so wish.  I will leave it at that.A number of people, including Deputy Deenihan, raised the issue of the ESB.  First of all, I agree with, commend and add to his comments regarding the chairman of the ESB, Tadhg O'Donoghue, who today announced his resignation as and from the end of January.  I commend Mr. O'Donoghue on the enormous and invaluable work he has done over the past seven years in steering and directing that company.  Such work has been hugely valuable to this State and is greatly appreciated by everyone with a knowledge of how much Mr. O'Donoghue has given.Following on from the very good work that has been done for years in the ESB, I see a huge and important role for the ESB in this area.  Far from anyone looking to break up or diminish the ESB, I believe it will have such a central role in helping to achieve so much in the areas of energy reduction, demand management and energy efficiency in its supply, network and generation business that it has a crucial role in this new green future.  I say to the ESB that it has a role to play in becoming one of the best green utilities in the world.  It can develop that expertise here to help solve our problems and can also apply it abroad in the process.  No break up or diminution of the ESB is planned.The issue of the transmission assets has already been decided upon.  They are already separated out into Eirgrid, which is responsible for their management.  That has been the case for several years.  The transmission assets followed that as night follows day but there is no diminution of the management, role or purpose of the ESB in that particular process.  I hope that this general vision of the future of the ESB is one that will get widespread support in this House.I previously mentioned heating, its importance and our role in setting significantly higher building regulation standards which might help us meet the targets.  The greener homes scheme will also continue to be amended and extended and new technologies will be brought in.  The role is not to continually support projects but to give them a volume of supply which makes economic sense for them.  One then moves on and uses the same sort of planning on other technologies on a rolling, continuing and evolving basis.Likewise, it will be hugely important for us to develop scale and transparency in the insulation support schemes we are planning to introduce next year.  These schemes will help to fulfil the basic premise of delivering energy efficiency first and foremost, as well as looking at the sort of supply systems one uses.I agree with the comments of many Deputies that we must be careful about bio-fuels and that such fuels will not be the panacea for our transport system.  However, there is a strategic value for both farming and the country in having our indigenous fuel supply from bio-fuels if we can develop it.I must return to the point I made about why planning is so important.  It seems that we certainly need a range of changes in transport, be it in rail freight or other areas, where we can try to reduce our emissions.  The fundamental change on which we must also agree is a collective change in every council of this country regarding how we plan our communities .  First and foremost, we must reduce the length of trips and then look at the mode of transport people have.The role of agriculture was also raised by speakers.  I was surprised that the debate featured very little mention of the peak oil issue as opposed to the issue of climate change.  Given that this country is utterly dependent on oil, which costs $100 per barrel, for 60% of its energy, I was surprised by the lack of interaction in respect of this issue.  Agriculture is an area where this issue raises its head.  The Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Sargent, tells me that for every calorie of food produce we create, we spend ten calories of energy input to get it in the form of fertilisers, transport, pesticides and processing, all using oil.  Agriculture faces a major policy issue in a world where oil becomes a depleting resource.Farmers also have a huge opportunity and will be at the forefront of our response to this.  They have an important role to play in leading our country, using their knowledge of how to cultivate and grow crops to plant new specialist crops which will provide us with a range of different products that oil might previously have provided, be they materials, heating or bio-fuels.  That is a far more attractive future for farming than one reliant on certain vague and limited livestock markets where the price is particularly poor and volatile and where one trades on an international market over which one has no control.I see a great role for farming in delivering a far more diverse range of crops which provide for this new energy future and in the process, reduce our emissions, recognising that farming accounts for 28% of our emissions.  It will not be easy but it is possible and the farmers of this country have more to gain from a green-led Government than any other group because we are looking to them to lead and to provide for our future, our food, our energy crops and the good and proper use of our land, which, ultimately, is our greatest natural resource.A response will be made to Deputies from the Labour Party who are concerned about the specifics.  Today's debate was not one for specifics.  Going back to my original comment, I believe it was a necessary debate to ascertain the level of concern, awareness and acceptance of some of the science and energy security issues before us.  We will have an opportunity for a debate on the details in the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security and I look forward to Deputy Barrett's leadership of this committee.There is no lead Minister, which is deliberate.  My colleagues and I will be available on any occasion to discuss matters.  It is better to have a cross-Government approach to this issue where Deputies can call in the Minister for Transport and ask what he is doing to face this energy future when he looks at the peak oil situation.  Alternatively, they could call in the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and ask what she is doing to deliver this future.  She would be the lead Minister on that day.  Equally, they could call in the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley.  I am willing and available to provide resources and skills to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security to do the valuable work it needs to do.  Likewise, a Cabinet sub-committee on climate change and energy security has been set up to address this issue.  It will provide cross-Government support.I have one clear message.  We could resort to doom and gloom on this issue and be merchants of despair.  There are reasons to be concerned and afraid.  The picture before the Irish people is one of opportunity.  We may lead the world in response to this issue and would benefit from that.The Taoiseach quoted Edmund Burke in his address to the House of Commons earlier this year.  According to Burke, "nobody made a greater mistake than he who did nothing because he could only do a little."  That saying applies equally in this area.  It is in our economic interest to make the change because we are exposed to global peak oil and gas insecurity.  It is in our moral interest to give us a sense of purpose, achievement and direction.We have achieved the main political objectives of the past 100 years.  We have achieved independence and economic security and have even solved some of the problems in the North that we thought would never be solved.  What must we solve today?  This issue is one we must address.  We must lead our people, protect them from an insecure future and provide them with a bright opportunity to shine internationally.

The European Commission is mandated to negotiate these conditions on behalf of the European Union and, through its Food and Veterinary Office, FVO, monitor the compliance of third countries it has approved for trade with the Union.  Where there are risks to public or animal health in the Community, arising from disease outbreaks in approved third countries, safeguard measures are invoked banning or restricting imports from the affected country or regions.I publicly welcomed the publication of the latest FVO report by the European Commission.  The report should be very helpful in the overall process of ensuring equivalence.  My Department has requested the EU authorities to arrange for a discussion of this report at the EU Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health.  A further mission to Brazil is being arranged for this month by the FVO.  It is vital that the FVO report on its findings at the earliest possible date and that the European Commission take whatever action is necessary to protect the interests of EU consumers and producers.I have consistently pointed out to the Commissioner and my colleagues in the Council of Ministers that produce imported from third countries must meet standards equivalent to those required of Community producers.  In this context, I have been in regular contact with the Commissioner who has assured me that the Commission will not hesitate to take action if a product imported from a third country represents a risk for EU consumers, livestock or plants.

It is as simple as this — if she is not with us, she is against us, meaning Irish beef producers and consumers.  Those with responsibility at European level must be informed and the debate must be led at a political level.  Does the Minister find the report worrying, particularly that the Brazilian state veterinary service had no systematic audit system in place for animal health and that no criteria for such an audit had been established?  I ask this in respect of the need to ensure a level playing pitch for Irish food producers and the beef sector and to ensure safety for consumers.  This is the case, notwithstanding that the issue had been flagged in a previous Food and Veterinary Office report.  Is it not worrying for consumers that cold stores in ports dealing with beef destined for Europe were not audited and that there was a lack of adequately trained staff in the state veterinary service?  The list of findings against the state authorities in respect of requirements clearly outlined in previous reports is startling.  Will the Minister become an advocate for change in order that we can speak to DG SANCO and Commissioner Kyprianou, with whom the Minister deals regularly?  Must we put up with a situation where the Brazilians are continually given another chance to get their house in order?

A further mission has been undertaken, while the Commissioner met the Brazilian authorities and the Minister.  I gave an undertaking to speak to the Commissioner again once he had received the report on the outcome of the mission.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	196	On Tuesday night I returned from the 34th international conference of the Food and Agriculture Organisation, FAO.  I am aware of the issues raised in the FAO's food outlook November 2007.  The FAO forecasts high international prices for all major foods and feedstuff this year.  Of particular note are the conditions on world cereal markets.  Supplies are much tighter than they have been for years, as unfavourable weather conditions in some of the main cereal producing countries, reflecting the latest UN climate change report, hampered production and the low levels of stocks worldwide have not been sufficient to meet demand.There is increasing competition for cereals to meet demand from China and other parts of Asia, as well as demand for grains used for feedstuffs and the emerging liquid biofuels industry.  Other factors making an impact on international cereal prices are increased input costs due to rising petroleum and freight rates, reflecting a pending peak in oil production.Rising output prices are a double-edged sword.  Depending on the combination of factors, higher output prices could give rise to higher farm incomes in this part of the world but some of the increase will be offset by rising input costs, especially feed costs, and unfavourable exchange rate movements.Given current market conditions, some level of food price inflation is inevitable. While consumer food price inflation in Ireland has increased, particularly in the past month, it remains below the overall rate of inflation of 4.8%.  This trend of rising food prices is common across EU member states, where food price inflation has increased in recent months.  Retail prices are also affected by a variety of other factors, including the cost of wages, services and other materials.In order to help alleviate some of the market difficulties, the Council of Ministers decided in September to set the obligatory set-aside rate at zero for autumn 2007 and spring 2008 sowings.  This is expected to lead to an expansion of EU grain production by at least 10 million tonnes next year.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.Irish cereal farmers, following the decoupling of direct payments from production, are now in a position to respond to market signals.  With the cushion of the single payment, they can focus on supplying markets, concentrating on minimising production costs and maximising their incomes.My Department continues to operate a range of services aimed at improving the efficiency, quality and viability of cereal production.  These services include seed certification, seed testing, recommended lists of varieties etc.  In addition, Teagasc provides comprehensive research, training and advisory services for cereal producers.  The value of all these support services is reflected in the fact that Irish cereal producers have consistently achieved some of the highest yields in the world.  I am satisfied that the outlook for cereal growing in Ireland is positive and that cereal producers here are well positioned to respond to the challenges ahead.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	12769	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	197	I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  I was motivated to table my question on the basis of the growing concern that food price inflation is increasing.  Christmas is approaching and expenditure on food is quite extensive.  There have been increases in the range of 16% to 17% in respect of staples such as milk and, in particular, flour.  There is major potential for growth in the cereal sector to meet this demand.  I accept there are global permutations that will affect how matters pan out for the industry here.  Grain farmers want to see an increase in production to meet domestic demand.  This is particularly the case if one considers the rise in bio-fuel production.My question inquired about the practical solutions the Government will be putting in place to facilitate the increasing trend towards the cultivation of grains.  I have not received an answer in that regard.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	198	Time constraints only permitted me to provide part of the reply.  However, the Deputy will have noted my reference to the zero rate for set-aside.  It was difficult to justify how land could be set aside when there are shortfalls in grain production.  In many ways it is bizarre that grain production rates fell between 2002 and 2006, while there was an increase in total value.  I hope that next year we will be able to look back at what happened this year and see an increase in both value and acreage.  The 2006 figure for output is 1.355%, while that for 2007 is 1.53%.  There will be quite a significant rise.  The latter is reflected in the value of the grain produced.Market forces, which can be a problem at times, will, in this instance, provide the boost we need.  The Department is encouraging — our efforts in this regard are bearing fruit — people who have not used the plough for many years to get back behind it and increase their tillage production rates.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	200	I referred to the EU figure of 10 million tonnes in respect of set-aside.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	12769	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	201	The Minister of State also referred to figures of 1.355% and 1.53% in respect of output.  These represent minuscule rates of increase and the rate of inflation in respect of food will far outstrip them.  I suggest that those rates should be increased considerably to meet demand.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	202	My Department, my ministerial colleagues and I will be doing everything possible to encourage more people to increase their tillage and cereal production rates.  There is also a need to think laterally in respect of this matter.  A considerable amount of cereal produced is required for both human and animal consumption.  The development of animal breeds that are able to thrive on a diet which is more grass-based, thereby reducing feed inputs, is another route we must take in order to insulate ourselves from the wider global reality of increasing grain prices.  There is a need to increase grain production and also to deal with other issues.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	203	I will not have time to read the entire reply but I presume it will be included in the Official Report.The national disease control centre, NDCC, of my Department brings together a range of veterinary, scientific, administrative and legal expertise available throughout the Department.  Meetings of the NDCC's management committee are frequently chaired by me or, in my absence, by the Secretary General.  The management committee has been particularly effective in planning and managing my Department's response to various disease threats, whether in respect of to avian influenza, foot and mouth disease or bluetongue.  The committee's essential role is to assess the threat posed by developments on any disease front and to make recommendations to me regarding the adequacy of my Department's contingency arrangements.In addition to the range of expertise available within Department, the NDCC also has ready access to expert advice from the national parks and wildlife service of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and BirdWatch Ireland, as well as expert meteorological advice from Met Éireann and epidemiological expertise from the centre for veterinary epidemiology and risk analysis at UCD.  With regard to avian influenza and foot and mouth, I can also draw, as required, on the advice provided by an expert advisory group chaired by Professor Michael Monaghan of UCD.The implementation of effective biosecurity measures, both nationally and at farm level, is a critical component of our contingency plans.  My Department has frequently provided biosecurity advice and has continually encouraged farmers to apply the highest standards of biosecurity at farm level.Based on the advice available, from various sources, the immediate risk of an outbreak of avian flu, foot and mouth disease or bluetongue is regarded as relatively low at present.  In respect of avian flu, we are close to the end of the current migration season and there is very little migration between Ireland and Germany, France and the Czech Republic, with which the strain of the virus found in England has been associated.  While the most recent case of foot and mouth disease in England was confirmed on 30 September, the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs issued a statement this morning in which he said that, following an incident involving live foot and mouth virus at the Merial laboratory plant at Pirbright, an inspection team, of which the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, DEFRA, was part, had concluded that "while it was possible that live virus had entered the contained drainage system — they are assured that the live virus had not been released to the environment".Additional information not given on the floor of the House.A full report is to be provided to the chief veterinary officer in the UK, after which DEFRA will consider what further action needs to be taken.  Given the link between the original outbreak and the Pirbright site, we are obviously maintaining close contact with DEFRA and the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development in Northern Ireland in respect of this situation and we await the outcome of the inspection report and any further actions considered appropriate by DEFRA.With regard to bluetongue, the risk is principally associated with the introduction of an infected animal or through infected midges.  While animals may now be imported from bluetongue-affected areas, the conditions under which this may happen are very restrictive and are intended to significantly reduce the risk of an infected animal being imported.  Meanwhile the Department's vector surveillance programme shows that the level of vector activity has declined very significantly in recent few weeks.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the respective disease situations will continue to be monitored closely and I will apply any revisions to our contingency arrangements made, where appropriate.Central also to our contingency arrangements has been the excellent level of co-operation between my Department and the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development in Northern Ireland.  Both Departments have a shared commitment to the maintenance of an all-island approach to the disease threats posed and have collaborated very closely in the adoption of identical control measures.  I am satisfied my Department has in place the necessary contingency arrangements, including sufficient legislative powers, based on our expert assessment of the current level of risk of a disease outbreak.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	204	I welcome the Minister's assurances in respect of avian flu, foot and mouth disease and bluetongue.  We have just concluded a debate on climate change.  I am sure the Minister is aware that the World Organisation for Animal Health has concluded that many of the threats we face in the context of animal disease have arisen as a result of climate change.  The equine industry in this country is currently under threat from swamp fever.  The latter was largely unheard of here before 28 cases arose in 2006.  West Nile fever has been found in Italy and France, rabies has been discovered in Finland, anthrax has appeared in Azerbaijan and there have been cases of glanders disease — by which humans can be affected — in Iran.There is a need for increased vigilance.  While I appreciate the expertise that is available within the Department, it is our contention on this side of the House that there is a need not merely to react to threats but also to maintain constant vigilance in respect of this issue.  The latter would be best facilitated by establishing, on a statutory basis, a biosecurity unit to monitor all threats.  Will the Minister consider establishing such a unit?  It could, similar to the way in which the Food Safety Authority of Ireland works in tandem with the European Food Safety Authority, act in conjunction with international experts.  This is a growing threat.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	205	Although I agree it is a growing threat, my view is that we are adequately resourced within the Department.  We use the expert advice that is available and we can meet within 30 minutes.  The latter is the most important aspect of our reaction to issues such as those under discussion.  Expert advice and opinion has always been available in respect of any matters that might arise.  We also have tremendous contingency plans to deal with many of the diseases to which the Deputy refers, as well as those which are currently a threat to the European Union.In addition, we have at our disposal diagnostic capabilities and we have invested over €200 million in a new laboratory at Backweston.  At present, we have the necessary resources and requirements.  I am not persuaded that we need a new stand-alone facility with statutory powers.  Immediate expertise is available to me within the Department.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	206	It is a false sense of security to state we are in a position to meet within half an hour as this is a reaction to an event.  Does the Minister agree that rather than constantly reacting to events such as bluetongue, foot and mouth disease and avian flu, we need a standing committee, preferably on a statutory basis, of people who constantly evaluate threats with which those of us in this House are entirely unfamiliar?  People with expertise would monitor trends, take steps and advise the Minister on what must be done.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	207	This is carried out and we have risk analysis and forward planning for new diseases which may arise.  This is not a reactionary policy.  We have a contingency plan in the event of many diseases coming through.  Regrettably, we have had experience with some of these.We cannot be complacent.  This is an evolving policy area and risk analysis will advise me accordingly.  The level of preparedness of the Department is more than adequate to deal with the outbreak of a disease.  This is not to state we are not preparing for new diseases.  Surveillance work is carried out at academic, laboratory and veterinary level.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	208	The Leas-Cheann Comhairle will be interested to hear that I will be in Wexford tomorrow to visit an abattoir with the owner and staff.  The regulation of local abattoirs is the responsibility of local authorities, who report to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland on this matter.  Under new EU regulations, collectively known as the hygiene package and which came into operation on 1 January 2006, 189 local abattoirs are approved by local authorities.  Under the hygiene package no distinction is made between local abattoirs and other slaughter plants.  Product from all approved establishments, regardless of size, may now be exported provided it is accompanied by appropriate certification.Local food production is an interest of mine and is becoming increasingly important to the diversity and strength of our food industry.  The growth in recent years in the number of farmers' markets, which now amount to more than 130, new interest in farm shops and more publicising of the region from where food and food ingredients come all demonstrate that as our globalised world becomes smaller, people are taking an interest in local produce.Last week, as part of a renewed focus on local food production, my Department hosted the first national conference on local food in conjunction with Bord Bia.  The conference was attended by approximately 300 delegates.  It built on a series of regional food fora and was an opportunity to present new research on what consumers understand by local, to explore national and international case studies on successful development of local foods and to look at retailer interest.  A guide developed by Bord Bia on selling through farmers' markets, farm shops and box schemes was also launched at the event.Following on from this initiative I will meet with local authorities in January to discuss the scope within their remit for developing the food economy in their areas.  A central part of this will be the scope to support abattoirs with regard to specific activities under the marketing and processing scheme operated by my Department.
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	209	On his way to Wexford, the Minister for State will pass a number of Wicklow abattoirs which have been closed.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	210	I am conscious of that.
#PJSheenan	unknown-#PJSheenan-party	unknown-#PJSheenan-dob	unknown-#PJSheenan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	211	Will he open them again?
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	212	It is hoped a couple of them will be re-opened.The number of licensed abattoirs ten years ago was 426 as opposed to the figure of 189 mentioned by the Minister of State.  The hygiene package has done nothing to aid small abattoirs to re-establish.  Grant aid is available for those who want export certification.  Will grant aid and revised regulations be provided for people who do not want or need export certification?  The regulations governing the supply of local food by a list of quality assured and quality monitored suppliers to local abattoirs should be different to those for large multinational processors who take their raw material from a range of sources throughout the country.Local authorities will not have the wherewithal to hone in on this.  We need specific revised regulations whether this means amending the hygiene package or introducing new regulations specifically governing non-export abattoirs.  I hope the experience of the Minister of State in Wexford tomorrow will highlight this and he will learn something on his visit.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	213	There is a lot to be learned there.
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	214	I make this point with respect to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	215	And my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Browne.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	216	Do not forget him.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	217	I identify with the frustration on this matter.  Small abattoirs have particular difficulties which are different to those of large factories.  We must deal with the hygiene package, which is an EU package and aims to establish hygiene requirements for EU citizens which everybody will agree should be of the highest standard.  Regardless of whether exportation is involved, every EU citizen is entitled to a level of hygiene and safe food.  This is the bottom line of the hygiene package.  The health check will simplify regulations but I do not want to wait for it as it will not be in place for a couple of years.The Leader programme, county enterprise boards and the Department's marketing and processing scheme have a role to play.  Unfortunately, the amount of money is not as much as I would like it to be and Deputy Doyle will have a similar view on this.  The craft butchers' association made a submission to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food which takes account of many of the points made by Deputy Doyle with regard to small abattoirs and this is being considered.
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	218	A logical way to deal with this is to ring-fence a certain amount of grant aid for small abattoirs without export certificate requirements.  The validity of grant-aiding large processing plants already making money and which are moving towards creating a cartel is questionable.  We discussed climate change earlier and this raises the matter of food miles.  This is part of a bigger picture.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	219	The marketing and processing scheme is designed specifically for small abattoirs and they will be favoured.  The issue should not be confused with regard to exporting.  We are discussing the standard and whether an abattoir exports is a matter for its marketing strategy.  This concerns a standard which allows them to export if they are in a position to do so.  It neither requires an abattoir to export nor distinguishes between exporting and non-exporting plants.The craft butchers' association will be important in formulating the policy.  I hope my visit to Wexford will bring the same level of reality which Deputy Doyle brought to the debate.
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	220	My Department has completed a comprehensive review of the Forestry Act 1946 and the draft heads of a new forestry Bill have been prepared which will update and consolidate the 1946 Act.  The draft scheme of the new forestry Bill will be submitted to the Government shortly for approval to be sent to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting.The proposed legislation will address many of the issues raised during the extensive consultation process undertaken by the Department.  The new forestry Bill will introduce a regulatory framework to support the development of a modern, multi-functional, sustainable and high quality forestry sector which enshrines the principles of sustainable forest management and protection of the environment.  The proposed Bill will, among other provisions, introduce a simpler and more streamlined felling licence system, allow for change of land use from forestry to other sustainable uses and provide a statutory basis for forestry guidelines and forest management plans.My Department has engaged in an extensive consultation process as part of its review of existing forestry legislation.  The consultation process commenced in May 1998 with the establishment of a legislative review group with responsibility for, inter alia, evaluating the operation of the Forestry Acts, identifying and assessing the strengths and weaknesses of existing forestry legislation and making recommendations regarding the legislative framework.  During the course of its work, the group engaged in widespread consultation and sought the views of the general public, along with various public and private sector organisations.In December 2005 a consultative group was established by my Department during the final stages of the review of the Forestry Acts.  This group comprised representatives from the Irish Forest Industry Chain, the Tree Council of Ireland, the Irish Farmers Association, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the National Council for Forest Research and Development and the City and County Managers Association.  Specifically, the consultative group was asked to consider what operational issues needed to be included in any new Act and assess and evaluate submissions and make decisions on their content vis-à-vis inclusion in primary legislation.Additional information not given on floor of the House.The establishment of the consultative group coincided with advertisements in the national newspapers seeking final submissions from interested parties.During the overall consultation period between 1998 and 2006, 26 separate written submissions were received.  A dedicated website, upon which regular updates were posted detailing the deliberations of the consultative group, was also established to keep those interested in the process up to date with developments.In May 2006 a special public seminar was held to allow all those organisations, groups and individuals who had participated in the consultation process between 1998 and 2005 a chance to present and clarify their submissions in person directly to the consultative group.  The group examined all the submissions received during the consultation phases and considered all the comments raised at the public seminar.  The proposed general scheme of the Bill reflects the results of the deliberations of the consultative group and represents a broad consensus on the issues involved.
#PJSheenan	unknown-#PJSheenan-party	unknown-#PJSheenan-dob	unknown-#PJSheenan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	221	I thank the Minister of State for his lengthy reply but he did not provide me with many details.  I will set out three objectives.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	222	I would prefer the Deputy to ask a question, it being Question Time.
#PJSheenan	unknown-#PJSheenan-party	unknown-#PJSheenan-dob	unknown-#PJSheenan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	223	What will the proposed Bill do to increase the total area classified as woodland or to achieve the Government target of 17% cover by 2030?  Will it change the obligation on replanting, which is perceived as one of the biggest obstacles to increasing forest cover in the private sector?  Will it have any implications for COFORD?
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	224	The principal features will be simpler and streamlined felling licensing, formal structures for forest management, a statutory basis for forestry guidelines and changes in land use from forestry to other sustainable uses.  An appeals mechanism will be put in place for the first time and forest owners will be protected.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle and I had issues in that respect in the past where adjacent developments took place and forests were felled without any contact from the Department.  Forests will be protected through measures on disease-free status and land acquisition.  The Minister will have an opportunity to grant compensation if she so wishes.In my former role as Minister of State with responsibility for forestry, I established the wide-ranging industrial liaison group.  It was a difficult task to persuade the group to convene initially.  The Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, has continued this dialogue and she has reached the stage at which the heads of the Bill have been prepared and are ready to go before the Government early in the new year.  The Bill will reflect the views of all the stakeholders.
#PJSheenan	unknown-#PJSheenan-party	unknown-#PJSheenan-dob	unknown-#PJSheenan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	225	The Minister of State is not grasping the nettle.  Yesterday, the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, launched a study on forest planting levels.  I am shocked that the Government has proposed yet another delaying tactic in terms of a consultancy report.  I will quote from the press release she issued seeking this consultancy report.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	226	The Deputy should not quote from statements during Question Time.
#PJSheenan	unknown-#PJSheenan-party	unknown-#PJSheenan-dob	unknown-#PJSheenan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	227	The press release stated, "Mary Wallace T.D., Minister of State with responsibility for forestry matters at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food today announced the appointment of Mr. John Malone to undertake a study on the factors affecting the rate of afforestation in Ireland".  What bearing will that have on the forthcoming Bill?  It is time to tell the Minister of State to get off the fence because every squirrel in the forest knows the biggest obstacle to reforestation is the planting obligation.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	228	The lady in red knows that too.  She made a promise during the election.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	238	The provisional agenda for the next meeting of the Council of Agriculture and Fisheries Ministers, scheduled for 26 and 27 November, indicates that it will deal with both agriculture and fisheries matters.  As regards agriculture, the Commission will present its communication to the Council and the European Parliament on preparing for the health check of the CAP reform.  It will also present its proposals on reform of the support system for cotton and suspension of import duties in the cereals sector.  A proposal for a regulation on the definition, description, presentation and labelling of spirit drinks will be put to the Council for adoption.  A significant proportion of the Council will be taken up with trilateral meetings on the proposed reform of the common organisation of the wine market.In so far as the fisheries sector is concerned, political agreement will be sought on a proposal to establish a multi-annual recovery plan for bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean.  In addition, the Commission will provide information to the Council on several issues, namely, the EC-Norway annual consultations for 2008, the proposed action plan for simplifying and improving the Common Fisheries Policy and the proposed strategy and related proposals for the Community to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.It goes without saying that all matters discussed at the Council are of concern to Ireland.  As preparations for the Council are continuing in the Council working groups, COREPER and the special committee on agriculture, the nature of discussions in the Council and the issues of particular concern to me may change depending on the outcome of negotiations at official level.At this point, I have a particular interest in hearing the Commission's presentation of its communication on preparing for the health check of the CAP.  The Council meeting will be the first opportunity for the Commission to present its paper to Ministers, which was published earlier this week.  My view is that the main focus of this health check should be on simplification and policy stability and I note the assurances already given by the Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Ms Fischer Boel, that further fundamental reform of the CAP is not envisaged at this point.  I will convey these views to the Council and I am looking forward to participating in detailed discussions on this dossier in the coming months.
#PJSheenan	unknown-#PJSheenan-party	unknown-#PJSheenan-dob	unknown-#PJSheenan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	239	I cannot understand what the Minister means when she refers to proposals for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council on the definition, description, presentation and labelling of spirit drinks.  Anyone who drinks in this country or anywhere in the world is aware of alcohol content because it is printed on the label of every bottle sold.  Any wine with an alcohol content of less than 14% is not worth drinking because it is only paint stripper.  There is no need to label spirit drinks.Will the Minister indicate how many European countries have engaged in the decommissioning plan?  As far as I can tell, the only country to have done so is Ireland.  She will want to have the relevant information when she goes to Brussels.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	240	The main agenda matter for the meeting is wine reform which, although not particularly consequential to us, will have significant implications for EU wine growers.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	241	With climate change, it will become important to us.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	242	The first paper on the health check is very important to us.  The Deputy will be surprised at the difficulties that have arisen in terms of labelling spirit drinks and the implications it could have on our production.  A number of new member states were insistent that the word "vodka" could not be used in Ireland, which was traditionally the practice.  Although these matters have implications for Ireland, this specific issue has been resolved.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	12769	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	243	On the CAP health check, on the Order of Business yesterday I asked for a debate on these issues on the basis that they will be subject to the co-decision procedure.  While it is a legislative proposal and does not specifically relate to the House, it has major potential implications, both positive and negative, for our agriculture sector and the rural economy.  Will the Minister consider arranging a full debate on this issue, notwithstanding that it will also be addressed in the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food?  The importance of this issue warrants a debate.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	244	I concur with the Deputy that a debate would be fruitful, whether in the Chamber or the committee system, as I would welcome an opportunity to hear the views of Members.  The Department is establishing a consultative group of stakeholders to advise me on the health check.  We also have a specific one on milk quotas.  I am sure we could raise the matter with the Whips.  Once we have the Commission's proposals, legislation will be proposed in early spring with a view to completing the process at the end of 2008.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	12769	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	245	I have already raised the issue with my party Whip who indicated such a debate would be unlikely.

#TomSheahan	unknown-#TomSheahan-party	unknown-#TomSheahan-dob	unknown-#TomSheahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	255	——deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, the Minister has much work to do.  I have met fishing groups around the country and it is clear the Irish fishing fleet is the most regulated in Europe.  Our European counterparts who are plundering our waters——
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	256	The Deputy should ask a question.

I hope she will have a strong input into the strategy.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	258	As the Deputy is aware, the competent authority will be my Minister of State.  It is more the pity that so few questions were tabled on fishing but perhaps this is a matter for consideration in future.  The Deputy is correct that a strategy is being prepared and the Minister of State has been part of that process, having met representatives of other member states on a number of occasions.  The issue at stake is equivalence and the rules and regulations imposed on Irish fishermen should be imposed in a similar fashion on fishermen in other member states.  It is unfortunate that this has not been the case to date.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	259	I thank Deputy Sherlock for attending the local food conference held in Mullingar last week.  The Government is committed to supporting local and regional food and measures in this area are contained in both Towards 2016 and my Department's Agri-Vision 2015 action plan.  Bord Bia, which operates under the aegis of my Department, has worked closely with other State and local agencies to exploit the growing opportunities for markets, providing a guide to farmers' markets, advice and mentoring assistance.Raising awareness of local food is crucial for many reasons, including lower energy demand, an issue discussed during the earlier debate on climate change and energy security, food safety and freshness issues, market potential and impacts of climate change.  In this regard, my Department and Bord Bia held a series of regional food fora throughout the country from late 2005 to early 2007.  The aim was to increase awareness of emerging market opportunities and encourage best practice in developing regional and local excellence in food.  The events were attended by producers, relevant State agencies and Departments with a remit in this area.As a follow up to the successful regional fora, my Department and Bord Bia recently held a national conference in Mullingar on the topic of local food.  This was the first national conference to be organised on this topic and almost 300 people attended, representing producers, retailers, consumers and agencies.  The aim of the conference was to raise awareness and understanding of local food as defined by the consumer, highlight the benefits to producers, retailers and the consumer and offer practical information and advice to those wishing to sell in their local areas.The research to which the question refers was undertaken by Bord Bia and included both qualitative and quantitative research into consumer attitudes to local food.  The research was presented at the national conference on local food and will prove useful for producers wishing to serve the local market.  It will provide local producers with an insight into consumer behaviour regarding local produce.  To assist producers wishing to serve their local markets Bord Bia has also produced a guide entitled Selling Through Farmers' Markets, Farm Shops and Box Schemes in Ireland.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.This guide, the first of its kind, provides practical and in-depth advice for small food producers to maximise the potential from these routes to market.In addition, Bord Bia recently launched Bord Bia Vantage — a centre of excellence for small business, which has at its core a website.  This is the first website to provide comprehensive information specifically designed for small food businesses to help them grow their business and build sales.  The vantage model is designed to assist businesses at all stages of development from those starting up who require general advice to those requiring a more focused high impact sales and business development programme.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	12769	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	260	I note the Minister of State was in Germany last month, Mullingar last week and Wexford this week and will, I understand, travel to Rome next week.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	261	This week.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	12769	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	262	He is increasing his carbon footprint.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	263	I tried to take a train to Wexford but it would have left me there for just half an hour.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	12769	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	264	Perhaps the Minister will take a boat to Rome.  I thank him for his response.  With 29% of respondents in a survey indicating a willingness to purchase local food, it is clear that farmers' markets have scope to tap this market.  However, given that most people will shop at one of the multiples, it is necessary to target these food retailers.  While the work being done by Bord Bia is without equal, one of the issues to arise from the conference held last week was the need to build a relationship between Bord Bia and the larger multiples.  I ask the Minister of State to be cognisant of this when formulating Government policy.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	265	I am not, as the Deputy may have implied, always on the road.  I met representatives of all the multiples as soon as I took office, recognising the need to secure access to market for local producers.  We have a great deal of work to do to deliver the outcomes Deputy Sherlock and I would like in this regard.  As I indicated in Mullingar, notwithstanding the research referred to in the question, one of the difficulties is that the word "local" in this context is not legally defined and many people are not as local as they claim to be.  This confuses the issue.I will recommend that produce features a harvest date to assist consumers.  For example, if a person finds broccoli from north County Dublin beside broccoli from California, it will be obvious from the harvest date that the product from my constituency will be fresher than that from the United States.  We need to develop this and other areas to ensure real communication takes place on what "local" means, as confusion reigns on this issue.  With 93% of respondents to the survey indicating a desire to buy local produce to support the local economy, it is important we avoid disappointing members of the public.  To this end, we must ensure the word "local" means local.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	266	It is important, in the first instance, to emphasise that I have never had discretion to raise the age thresholds for BSE testing as these are fixed at EU level.  I have, however, been a constant advocate of change and have taken and continue to take every opportunity to impress upon Commissioner Kyprianou the overwhelming case I believe exists to raise the age limits.  My officials have also taken similar opportunities to press the case for change.My contention that the age limits should be raised is supported by any analysis of the existing surveillance programme.  In 2006, more than 10 million tests, of which 8.5 million were in healthy slaughtered animals, were carried out throughout the EU with just 285 or 0.003% positive cases detected, of which 62 were in healthy slaughtered animals.  Since 2001 some 4.7 million tests have been carried out in Ireland.  As the House will be aware, the number of cases being identified here has fallen dramatically since 2001, when there were 333.  This compares with 41 last year and 20 to date this year.  The existing requirement that all bovines over 30 months of age slaughtered for human consumption must be tested, with all casualty animals over 24 months and all fallen stock over 24 months, is provided for under Regulation (EC) 999/2001.In recent months the European Commission has proposed changes to the existing testing regime, the most recent of which were proposed at a meeting of chief veterinary officers in October.  They were since discussed at a meeting of the TSE working group in Brussels earlier this month.  The proposals now tabled by the Commission represent a vindication of my efforts in the past three years.  I look forward with optimism to a successful conclusion to the current discussions.The current options in respect of healthy slaughtered animals are to test all cattle aged over 42 months; to test all cattle born before 1 January 2002 and 50% of those born since and aged over 42 months; or to test all animals born before 1 January 2004 and none of those born since.  It is also proposed, under each option, that, in respect of emergency slaughtered cattle and fallen stock, all cattle over 36 months would be BSE tested.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	267	I thank the Minister for her long reply.  However, all farmers want to know is when this unjustified charge and their difficulties with selling cattle on date will be removed.  These are the issues at stake.  The price of animals is being downgraded without justification, simply because they are over a certain age.  The meat goes through the same process, but there has been no change, despite the fact they have been seeking it for years.  When will the Minister succeed in getting it?  When will she make the case that farmers, especially those involved in the beef sector, are under severe pressure?  They do not need factories to avail of any excuse against them.  Will the Minister give us the date and time for when the problem will be solved once and for all?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	268	I have continued to pursue this issue vigorously, but a number of member states do not wish this to happen.  The decision that will be made will apply EU-wide.  In that regard, the paper was received and discussed in October.  I had hoped and expected that this would be introduced at the end of this year——
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	269	We were promised before the general election it would be.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	270	Unfortunately, many of my EU counterparts will not agree.  We now have three proposals.  I have put forward our view as to what we wish to have and this is being pursued vigorously by me and my veterinary staff.  I have spoken to the Commissioner to expedite the matter and will continue to keep the pressure on him.  While I would love to be able to give a definite date, I cannot do so.  However, I will do everything I can to expedite a decision.  We will be as forthcoming as possible on the matter.  I agree wholeheartedly with the Deputy, there is no health reason that these tests should be carried out now.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	271	In view of the significance of this issue to farmers, given the previous issue relating to the Food and Veterinary Office report and in the light of the forthcoming referendum, farmers must be convinced that the European Union can deliver for them.  Given the level of apathy and hostility in the farming community to the treaty, as evaluated by recent opinion polls, does the Minister believe it is imperative that between now and the holding of the referendum in early 2008 we convince farmers that the Union can deliver for them and that it will not hinder them, put them out of business or take money from their pockets?  It is important we get this issue across to Commissioner Kyprianou and President Barroso.  At a political level, we need to forge alliances in Europe that will be seen to deliver for us.  I appreciate what the Minister says, that she can only advocate but cannot make the change.  Efficient advocacy works by building relationships with other like-minded states.  Ireland is the only state that will have to put the Lisbon treaty to the people and we will need assistance at a political level to have it delivered.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	272	I have formed many political alliances around the table and used them extensively.  They are not just in the agriculture area, but also in the fisheries area.  We have good political alliances and continue to hold bilateral discussions.  I will meet the forthcoming Presidency in Slovenia on Tuesday and Wednesday to discuss these issues and did the same in previous presentations and preparations.I agree that in some instances farmers do not see the European Union as a support mechanism, but as a hindrance.  However, we must not forget that the Union continues to provide €1.3 billion through the single farm payment, for example.  I have continued to pursue the issues at stake vigorously.  As the Deputy knows, when it comes to public health, change can be complicated and difficult on the basis of what happened a number of years ago in other member states.  There is a reluctance to move forward and press ahead.  Perhaps some member states wish to be less progressive than us.As I said, I have given an assurance to farming organisations that we will continue to press vigorously on the issue, as have farming organisations within the European Union.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	273	The farm improvement scheme was launched by my Department in July with funding of €79 million as agreed under the partnership agreement, Towards 2016.  I announced the suspension of the scheme on 31 October, as applications received thereunder had reached this level of funding.  I had made it clear at the time of the introduction of the scheme that it would be closed when the financial ceiling had been reached.  This was also explicitly provided for in the terms and conditions of the scheme.  The applications received under the scheme up to 31 October will be processed by my Department up to the level of funding available.  I have no plans to reopen the scheme to further applications prior to the review in 2008 of Towards 2016 as provided for in that agreement.The revised farm waste management scheme which was introduced by my Department in March 2006, rather than the farm improvement scheme, was the principal measure designed to assist farmers to meet their obligations under the nitrates directive.  A standard grant rate of 60%, 70% in the four zone C counties, is available to farmers who complete works under that scheme.  Some 48,580 applications were received from farmers under the scheme and, to date, almost 35,000 approvals have been issued by my Department to farmers to commence work which work must be completed and supporting documentation submitted by 31 December 2008.
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	274	Does the Minister accept that some of those who signed up for the REP scheme cannot complete their works and that not all of them will be covered under the farm waste management scheme?  There are two choices available to them, one of which is to defer their REP scheme entry.  If in year one, most have to comply with their housing need target.  Otherwise, they will have to proceed without the grant and not to the standard preferred.  Some feel as if there is a gun to their heads.  I am aware of individuals who submitted valid stamped applications one week before 31 October, but who were told they would be excluded.  When their application was receipted and accepted, they presumed it was valid and felt they were in the comfort zone, even after the Minister had announced she was closing the scheme.  Subsequently, they have heard their applications may not be not accepted.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	275	To clarify, I was given €79 million and it was agreed that the existing farm waste management scheme was to have priority to deal with the issue of nitrates.  It was, without shadow of a doubt, one of the best schemes ever introduced, besides being flexible and catering for farmers with fewer than 20 livestock units to farmers with investments of over €120,000.  It was agreed by both politicians and farmers that we had to deal with the nitrates issue and that this was the most important scheme.With regard to those farmers who had applications under the farm improvement scheme submitted and stamped before the end of October, they are within the scheme.  I hope, once we get through all the applications and ascertain their bona fides — I heard some farmers threw in applications just because they heard the scheme was going to close, whereas others may have been under greater pressure to address various issues — we will be able to provide greater clarity for those applications submitted between 21 and 31 October.  Anybody who is within the system and has been accepted and whose application has been stamped will be reviewed but we have await the financial implications and then look at the priorities.
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	276	Does the Minister have a timeframe?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	277	Yes, the beginning of next year.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	12769	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	278	I am not satisfied with that answer because this was a demand-led scheme and was open to all comers.  If somebody gets an application in on time it is as valid as any other application.  I do not see why the Minister can discriminate against those people who applied within those timeframes but, because the budget line is suddenly cut, are not to be considered.  I ask the Minister to review the decision on the basis that if we encounter serious changes in agriculture into the future then it will be a matter for farmers to improve their holdings and their facilities.  This is a wonderful scheme in terms of what it seeks to achieve but there should be more flexibility on the part of the Government to allow at least those people who got in before the cut-off to be considered.  The word "review" is a very broad term.  It is not a concrete term and it gives no solace to those farmers who applied on time.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	279	There was agreement in the partnership talks that the amount would be €79 million.  I cannot exceed that €79 million.  That is all the money that is available.  Given the economic circumstances my priority has to be delivery, in a short period, of the farm waste management scheme.In regard to the people who had made an application which was stamped by the Department we do not know yet whether they are valid because they have to be examined up to 30 October.  I would hope to have adequate resources to look after those.  At this moment in time I await the information from all the local offices as to my liabilities.  Then and only then can I look at what the real priorities should be in a more targeted approach under that scheme.  We will do our utmost to facilitate people if we can at all.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	280	I was just reading from a text message I have here arising from my membership of the IFA.  The message states that IFA never agreed to any upper limit.   That is the message it sent out to all its farmer members.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	281	The IFA can produce all the money.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	282	This is a problem for many farmers and one they did not expect.  What can I tell a young farmer in his 20s, whose father dropped dead at 50 years of age, for whom it took some time to get his application in for an urgent dairy grant?  How will he survive in the difficult situation in which he finds himself?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	283	As the Deputy knows, taking individual cases to the floor of the House is not appropriate.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	284	Does it make the Minister feel uncomfortable?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	285	It does not make me feel uncomfortable.

The amount of money available is not finite, it is €79 million.  That is all the money that was made available under the farm improvement scheme.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	289	It was marketed up to 2013.

If there are additional resources available when the Department looks at priorities, issues such as that would have to be given priority.  I remind members of the Fine Gael Party——

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	298	The programme for Government has set a target of increasing the amount of utilisable agricultural land area under organic production from its current rate of less than 1% to 5% by 2012.  Even though this is a challenging target I believe it is attainable.My Department offers substantial incentives to promote the growth of the sector.  The new organic farming scheme, introduced under the rural development programme for the period from 2007 to 2013, is aimed at encouraging producers to respond to the market demand for organic food.  Rates of payment under the scheme are some 17% higher than comparable payments under the previous rural environment protection scheme, REPS 3.  One significant change this time around is that we are allowing organic producers to obtain organic support payments without having to join REPS.  This should encourage small-scale horticultural producers to convert to organic production, and also conventional tillage producers to convert part or even all of their holdings.  As a further incentive to encourage non-REPS farmers solely involved in tillage production to convert to organic farming, there is an additional payment of €240 per hectare available in the in-conversion period, up to a maximum of 40 hectares, provided they grow green cover crops.As well as payments to farmers, my Department also offers significant development grants both to farmers and to processors under the schemes of grant aid for the development of the organic sector.  The current schemes were launched last June and they provide grant aid for investments by farmers and processors in equipment and facilities.  The schemes provide grant aid of 40% of the cost up to a maximum grant of €60,000 in the case of on-farm investments and €500,000 for investments off-farm.I am pleased to note that Teagasc has appointed an additional three specialist organic advisers to strengthen its advisory role.  This development, allied to the expanding demonstration farm programme, should further facilitate producers considering the organic option.Expansion at production level cannot happen in isolation.  It needs a market to support it.  The most recent initiative in this regard is the three-year organic marketing plan 2006-09, produced by Bord Bia in consultation with the organic market development group.  The objective of the plan is to develop the organic sector in Ireland for existing suppliers and new entrants.

The marketing of organic food is currently the area in which we have to drive improvements because the incentives, if one is taking to the organic certification bodies, are quite solid and are appreciated.  It comes down to ensuring that gaps are filled when it comes to shortcomings in marketing.  For example, Flahavans are looking for organic cereal producers in Ireland to meet their need.  There are areas that have to be developed.  In the course of my travels, referred to earlier, in Italy, Austria and Germany——

When I came into the Department I asked about this matter and I was told that a dedicated official was going around the country to examine, inspect and ensure that what was being sold as certified organic, actually legally, was certified organic.  I felt that person was being run off his or her feet.

I will reconsider the matter to ascertain how the work is progressing.  At present we are evaluating whether it is possible to do all this with the two people involved.  There has been an increase in the powers of those two individuals as the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, introduced the statutory instrument which provides increased powers to inspectors to confiscate produce and ensure it is inspected.  Those powers were not previously in place, which allowed certain lax practices to take hold.I would of course agree that not all farmers' markets are organic.  Any that falsely claim to be organic are in breach of the law.  It is important that consumers, if they are buying products which are said to be organic, ask for the certification which they are entitled to see to reassure themselves.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	12769	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	310	When funding of this nature is allocated to growers, is the labour inspectorate involved in inspecting facilities where the potential for abuse of labour standards exists?  Given that moneys are expended by the taxpayer and it has been documented that exploitation has taken place within this industry, is there interdepartmental co-operation on the issue of exploitation of labour in the sector?
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	311	I have been very concerned by reports regarding abuse of labour law.  I am also conscious of increasing labour and energy costs in the sector which have brought pressure but which have been somewhat alleviated by the influx of non-nationals into the sector.  This has meant we need to be extremely vigilant to ensure the competitive nature of the sector is not pursued at the expense of anybody in a vulnerable position in our country.With this in mind, I met on a number of occasions the Minister of State, Deputy Billy Kelleher, who has responsibility for labour law, and with whom I plan to meet again.  I am hopeful I will be in a position to report progress and that we will have a system in place whereby there is not just an informal relationship but strong and clear lines of communication so that nobody who is in breach of any labour law will be in receipt of State aid.

Durkan — the need to review the refusal of a primary medical certificate to a person in County Kildare; (2) Deputy John Perry — the need for cross-Border co-operation in the provision of the full range of cancer care services covering all the midland and Border counties; and (3) Deputy Leo Varadkar — the need to appoint a boundary commission to redraw the local electoral boundaries.The matters raised by the three Deputies have been selected for discussion.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	315	I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this matter and thank the Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Smith, for coming to the House to reply.The Leas-Cheann Comhairle and the Minister of State will be familiar with this case.  In the past ten or 15 years I have repeatedly raised the issue of primary medical certificates and the qualification they entitle to the bearer.  There are considerable discrepancies with regard to those who qualify and those who do not.  The rules are extraordinarily rigid, yet constituents will on occasion point out that they know somebody who has a primary medical certificate but is in a position better than or equal to the position of the constituent.  I wish to raise one such case.The qualifying guidelines state applicants must be wholly or almost without the use of both legs; wholly without the use of one of their legs and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that they are severely restricted as to movement; or without both hands or without both arms.  We do not have be medical experts to work out that persons would qualify in such extreme circumstances.  However, it is extraordinary the guidelines do not refer to persons with the use of one arm and one leg.In the case to which I refer, the applicant, who was an athletics coach, had a severe stroke.  He is not in the business of exaggerating his condition but his brain is working perfectly, he has a functioning role in society and wants to travel to work but cannot afford to do so.  The stroke severely restricted the use of one side of his body, as often happens in such cases.  As a result, he has had to stop work.I raised this issue on the Adjournment in June last.  The person wrote a plaintive letter to me on 5 November in which he referred to the number of occasions on which he had been examined.  In each case the examination consisted of a chat and a kind of walkabout, followed by a medical conclusion — I cannot understand how it works in this fashion.  He appealed his case and was called to the health centre on 28 August last and was again unsuccessful, despite the fact that the community health doctor did not physically examine him in any way.The applicant knows a number of other people in the area who have qualified for such certificates who are no worse or better off than he, although he has had to come to that conclusion without a medical examination.  Let us not forget he is an athletics coach and has some knowledge on these matters.  He would like to return to work and continue to make a contribution to society.  He can do so but he has repeatedly been refused a certificate.I do not blame the Minister of State for this situation.  Will he contact whatever bureaucrat is in control?  Once and for all, we need to liberalise the system, let a little clarity into the arena and allow the decision to be made that where persons are severely restricted on one side of the body, the certificate will be awarded.  There are countless similar cases.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	316	I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter.  It is not the first time I have heard him speak on this issue and the need to improve the scheme.The disabled drivers scheme dates back to 1968, when relief from road tax was made available under section 43 of the Finance Act of that year for persons with a disability meeting specific medical criteria.  Since then, the scheme has been extended and amended on a number of occasions.The benefits of the scheme for qualifying persons are set out in the legislation.  They consist of full relief in the year of purchase of an adapted vehicle of vehicle registration tax, and VAT subject to limits of €9,525 for a qualifying driver and €15,875 for a qualifying passenger or organisation.  In the case of passengers, there is a requirement that the adaptation to the car must amount to at least 10% of the cost of the car.  In the case of both drivers and passengers, the vehicle must be retained for at least two years.  Second, there is relief from excise duty up to a maximum of 600 gallons per year, or 900 gallons in the case of an organisation; and third, exemption from road tax.The average total annualised value of these benefits is estimated at around €5,500 per claimant.  In the year of purchase of a car, a claimant receives benefits relating to the purchase of the car, fuel relief and road tax.  In the other years, the benefits received are fuel relief and road tax.  Regulations also provide for the inclusion in the scheme of non-profit organisations involved in the transport of persons with a disability.In terms of the overall scale and scope of the scheme, the most recent data available from the Revenue Commissioners shows that the total number of claimants in the system in 2006 was around 11,000.  This was made up of approximately 4,500 drivers and 6,500 passengers.  In 2006, the total cost of the scheme, excluding road tax, was €59 million — an increase of some €9 million on 2005.  When road tax is included, the total cost in 2006 is estimated at over €67 million.The statutory basis for the current scheme is section 92 of Finance Act 1989.  The 1994 Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, made under the 1989 Act, set out the medical criteria, certification procedures, reliefs available to eligible persons, appeal procedures, and other matters.  Given the generosity of the scheme, strict medical criteria are set down for qualification.  The scheme is not open to all people with a disability.  It is available only to people with certain serious permanent physical disabilities, which result in considerable mobility difficulty.Deputy Durkan has already referred to the medical eligibility criteria for the scheme, as set out in the legislation.  It is a fundamental requirement for admission to the scheme that the applicant meets the specified medical criteria and is in possession of a primary medical certificate to that effect.  A person who is deemed to satisfy the criteria is issued with a primary medical certificate by the senior medical officer of that HSE administrative area.  Possession of this certificate qualifies the holder to claim the benefits of the scheme either as a qualifying driver or a qualifying passenger.In some cases, the persons concerned do not appear to the senior medical officer to meet the criteria and so the relevant certificate is refused.  Where the medical certificate is not granted, the legislation provides for an appeal procedure operated by the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal.  The board is an independent body whose decision is final.  The board's members are appointed by the Minister for Finance on the nomination of the Minister for Health and Children.Considerable efforts have been made in recent years to improve the level of service concerning appeals.  There is still some work needed in this regard, but following a period of difficulty in organising sufficient meetings of the Medical Board of Appeal, the Tánaiste reconstituted the board in early 2005.  Since that date, the panel of doctors has been incrementally expanded from three to 15 members.  This has facilitated more frequent meetings of the board, thus enabling progress to be made in reducing the backlog of appeals that had arisen.A special interdepartmental review group has reviewed the operation of the disabled drivers scheme.  It examined current benefits, qualifying medical criteria, Exchequer costs, relationship with other schemes and similar schemes in other countries.  The report also made a number of recommendations, both immediate and long-term, referring respectively to the operation of the appeals process and to options for the future development of the scheme.In respect of the long-term recommendations, which included the qualifying disability criteria, the issues raised are complex and difficult, as is clear from the interdepartmental review group's report, and they raise fundamental questions about the scope and purpose of the scheme.  However, given the scale and scope of the scheme, any possible changes can only be made after careful consideration and with regard to the existing and prospective cost of the scheme, and available resources.  The key challenge is to seek to ensure that the current scheme is managed effectively and efficiently, and that any changes introduced ensure the effective use of resources in promoting access and participation for persons with a disability.At the outset I should have stated that I am replying on behalf of the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Cowen, who is unavoidably absent.With regard to the particular case that Deputy Durkan outlined, I ask him to send the details to me and I will forward them to the Tánaiste for his further consideration.  We all know of particular cases that seem to meet the criteria, but at times it appears difficult to make progress with them.  This can be so with individual cases I have come across.  I ask the Deputy to communicate with me in that regard.

#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	318	I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for affording me the opportunity to raise this important issue.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Smith, who will reply to the matter.One of the benefits of the peace process has been the growth in co-operation between North and South over the past decade.  Co-operation is ongoing and expanding in many areas of economic and social development including trade, education, training, public administration, communications, agriculture, the environment and tourism.  There are many benefits associated with investing and developing cross-Border activities.  These initiatives receive considerable financial and political support from the Irish and British Governments, the EU and international bodies.  Cross-Border co-operation is delivering real and practical benefits to the midland and Border counties.  As a Deputy for a Border region himself, I know the Minister of State will fully concur with this point.We already have some co-operation in the area of health care.  Under EU regulations, a cross-Border worker is entitled to sickness and maternity benefits in both states.  Other aspects of cross-Border health care co-operation include accident and emergency services, road traffic accident mobilisation and planning for major emergencies, co-operation on the purchase of high technology medical equipment and cancer research.  Health promotion is an area of active co-operation involving research projects and joint conferences.Cross-Border co-operation in the provision of health care services will help strengthen opportunities for people to access quality health care services, especially where people have better geographical access to services on the other side of the Border.  Cross-Border health care services that operate on a patient voluntary basis can be budget neutral between the co-operating jurisdictions.  That matter should be examined further.  Working together to expand the range of co-operation in the health care area will strength the sense of partnership for the mutual benefit of all.The HSE proposal for eight specialist cancer care centres means that there will be no cancer care north of a line from Dublin to Galway.  That is appalling.  The front page editorial in last week's Sligo Champion asked:  “Did nobody look at the map and ask what’s wrong with that picture?”  The proposed removal of cancer care services from the midlands and Border counties runs totally counter to all the Government’s talk of regional development, seeing the region as having an important and interdependent cross-Border dimension.  The proposal is further evidence of the Government abandoning the entire midland and Border counties area and the reinforcement of the growing east-west divide.The Minister for Health and Children spoke in the Dáil of her recent meeting with Northern Ireland's Minister for Health, Social Services and Public Safety, Mr. McGimpsey.  She confirmed that she had a good discussion on co-operation in cancer care between Altnagelvin and Donegal.  I welcome this proposed co-operation and I can see many advantages in cross-Border co-operation in health care.  I call on the Minister for Health and Children to take up the issue of cross-Border co-operation in health care with Mr. McGimpsey, to explore fully the possibilities of extending co-operation to include the provision of the full range of cancer care services covering all midland and Border counties.  In particular, she should fully explore the provision of specialist cancer care services from Sligo Hospital to patients from County Fermanagh.  This possibility has not been previously analysed.  Following such a review, the case for continuing specialist cancer care services in Sligo Hospital will be fully justified.Pending the outcome of such a review, I ask the Minister to direct the HSE — and especially Professor Keane who has now taken up his appointment — to defer any further planning for the transfer of cancer care services from Sligo Hospital to Galway.  There is outrage in the county over this proposal.  As a Deputy representing a Border area, I recognise the opportunities for County Fermanagh, which should be considered for inclusion in the scheme.  Its population base contributes to the demographic case for a specialist centre in Sligo.  I call on the Minister to defer the instruction given to Sligo Hospital to transfer the oncology facility to Galway.  I am appealing to the Minister of State to impress upon the Minister, Deputy Harney, the need to take immediate action on this important issue.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	319	I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children.  I welcome the opportunity to set out the current position regarding the restructuring of cancer services, with particular reference to Sligo General Hospital.  Professor Tom Keane took up his position on Monday as national cancer control director to lead and manage the establishment of the national cancer control programme and I wish him every success in the implementation of the programme.  The key objective of the programme is to ensure equity of access to services and equality of patient mortality and survival irrespective of geography.  This will involve significant realignment of cancer services to move from the present fragmented system of care to one consistent with international best practice in cancer control.  The decisions of the HSE on four managed cancer control networks and eight cancer centres will be implemented on a managed and phased basis.The HSE has designated University College Hospital Galway, UCHG, and Limerick Regional Hospital as the two cancer centres in the managed cancer control network for the HSE western region, which includes Sligo.  The national quality assurance standards for symptomatic breast disease services provide that each specialist unit should manage a minimum number of 150 new breast cancer cases per annum.  Sligo General Hospital had 65 such cases in 2005.  Many locations will feel they are losing out but we must be clear about the need for this change.  People in the west and south have a poorer survival rate for common cancers, including breast cancer, than the remainder of the country.  The designation of cancer centres aims to ensure patients receive the highest quality care, while at the same time allowing local access to services, where appropriate.Sligo General Hospital has a dedicated inpatient oncology unit, comprising 15 beds, and a dedicated day services unit comprising eight beds.  Where diagnosis and treatment planning is directed and managed by multidisciplinary teams based at the cancer centres, then much of the treatment, other than surgery, can be delivered in local hospitals such as Sligo.  Cancer day care units will continue to have an important role in delivering services to patients close to home.  The HSE is putting in place a structured programme of quality assurance, support and information services to underpin the reorganisation of services to ensure cancer patients will receive quality services as close to home as possible.Patients from Sligo needing radiotherapy continue to be referred to the radiation oncology department at UCHG for treatment.  The HSE has informed the Department that, in 2006, UCHG treated almost 1,000 radiation oncology patients, 107 of whom were from counties Sligo and Leitrim.  The Minister met Minister Michael McGimpsey of the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, Northern Ireland, on 5 October last.  The potential for further cross-Border co-operation and collaboration on cancer care, and specifically provision of a satellite centre for radiation oncology in the north west, linked to Belfast City Hospital, was discussed.  Consideration of a satellite centre in the north west will have regard to populations in Border counties such as Donegal, Derry and parts of Fermanagh and Tyrone.  It was agreed both Departments would progress this issue through the joint North-South feasibility study on the potential for future co-operation.The Government is committed to making the full range of cancer services available and accessible to cancer patients throughout Ireland in accordance with best international standards.  The developments I outlined will ensure a comprehensive service is available to all patients with cancer in the western and midland regions, including County Sligo.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	320	I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this issue.  The need to hold a boundary review of local electoral areas is clear.  A review has not been carried out since 1998, which was based on the 1996 census.  The boundaries are, therefore, 11 years out of date.  Since then two constituency reviews for European elections and two for the Dáil elections have been carried out.At a recent conference, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government suggested such a review would be carried out and completed by spring 2008, while the Taoiseach suggested it might be completed by next May or June.  However, in reply to a number of parliamentary questions I have tabled in this regard, I have not received a clear written commitment from the Government to carry out such a review.  A boundary commission has not been appointed and time is running out.  Local elections are not far away and parties need to organise and hold conventions.  I would like a written commitment that the commission will be appointed in the next few days rather than a vague statement about consideration being given to its establishment.Section 22 of the Local Government Act 1994 provides for the Minister to vary the number of councillors on local authorities.  The population has increased dramatically in a large number of local authority areas.  For example, in my area, Fingal County Council, the ratio of councillors to people is 1:10,000, which compares with 1:1,000 in County Leitrim.  The population has also increased considerably in County Wexford and additional seats are needed in Gorey, but perhaps they should not be provided at the expense of New Ross.  Will the boundary commission or another body be given authority to vary boundaries?What terms of reference will be laid down for rural areas?  Currently a significant anti-democratic bias favours such areas.  For example, Carrigaline has double the population of Bantry in County Cork but Bantry has five seats compared with six in Carrigaline because, when the previous boundaries were drafted, rural areas were favoured over urban areas.  It is unjustified that people who live in suburban Cork should have less representation on Cork County Council than those living in rural Cork.The key issue in Dublin West is the Mulhuddart ward, which comprises half my constituency.  The ward has a population of 58,000 and has four council seats.  However, its population is more than that of the Howth, Malahide, Portmarnock wards combined, yet they have seven seats.  This is an example of rotten boroughs, which is why a boundary review is needed as soon as possible.  Clarity is also needed on whether the number of councillors will be increased, the terms of reference of the commission and whether urban votes will be worth less than rural votes.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	321	I am replying on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government who is away on Government business.  I thank Deputy Varadkar for raising this issue and for the opportunity to brief the House on the issue of review of the local electoral area boundaries in advance of the 2009 local elections, which is a matter of interest to many people.The last review of local electoral areas was carried out in 1998 based on 1996 census data.  The recommendations from the two committees that carried out the review were duly implemented and had effect for the local elections held in 1999 and 2004.  Prior to that review, local electoral areas were last reviewed in 1985 based on 1981 census data.  Unlike for Dáil and European Parliament constituencies, however, there is no statutory or constitutional requirement to review local electoral areas at particular, or any, intervals.  The main legal provisions concerning boundary committees are set out in the Local Government Acts 1991 and 1994. Section 24 of the 1994 Act specifies that the Minister may by order, subject to Part V of the 1991 Act, divide a local authority into local electoral areas.  Section 32(2) specifies that, before deciding whether to make an order under section 24 of the 1994 Act in relation to a local electoral boundary, the Minister shall request a boundary committee to prepare a report.  The committee shall, if so requested, prepare and furnish to the Minister a report in writing which shall include its recommendations and the Minister shall publish the report and shall have regard to it in deciding whether to make the order.The question of a review of local electoral areas before the next local elections needs to be considered in the context of the recent census results.  As the Deputy correctly points out, significant development has occurred in many suburban areas and county towns in recent years.  While the population nationally increased by 8.2% from 2002 to 2006, changes in population were much greater in certain areas.  For example, in Fingal County Council an increase of 22.2% in population was recorded, while in neighbouring County Meath the increase was 21.5%.  It is clear, therefore, that a comprehensive revision of local electoral areas is needed in some parts of the country.As the House will be aware, a constituency commission to review Dáil and European constituencies was established in April, upon publication of the census results.  The commission presented its report to the Ceann Comhairle on 23 October last.  It is desirable that the outcome of this review should be available prior to a review of local electoral areas.  This is important because boundary committees should take due account of the desirability, where possible, of aligning local electoral area boundaries with Dáil constituency boundaries.We are all agreed that local electoral areas need to be reviewed.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is putting in place the detailed arrangements for these reviews and will announce details of his intentions in this regard very shortly.Speaking as a public representative and not on behalf of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, there must be a weighting in respect of rural areas in the drawing up of boundaries and the alignment of seats.  In my county, which is not the most rural one in the country, it can take an hour to travel by car from one end of an electoral area to another, vast areas of which are not highly populated, and some of the terrain is mountainous and difficult.  Perhaps in some of our more urban centres of population, a local councillor could walk around his or her electoral area in a short time.  I accept that it is much more difficult to travel around parts of counties Donegal, Mayo, Kerry or Cork than it is to travel around inland Cavan, but nevertheless it could take an hour to travel from one part of an electoral area to another in my county.The issue is not as simple as considering the population as the sole factor.  In fairness to everybody involved, all the issues of the people who deserve representation, the geography of an area and the time factor in the distance to be covered should be taken into consideration in finalising boundaries.

This is a comprehensive study of the sheep industry which sets out a Development Plan for the sector contained in 37 recommendations. I decided that the best way to implement these recommendations was to set up an Implementation Group comprised of representatives of all sectors in the industry, including the relevant state bodies. It was chaired by Mr. John Malone, former Secretary General of my Department, who was also the chairman of the Strategy Group.The recommendations address issues such as welfare and quality assurance which are dealt with in the report of the Implementation Group presented to me earlier this year. Accordingly I have no plans at present to introduce a ewe scheme similar to the suckler cow scheme.Sheep farmers are major beneficiaries of various schemes being operated by my Department. Under REPS 4, a new supplementary measure aimed at sheep farmers has been introduced. A budget of €28m a year has been allocated to fund the proposed new supplementary measure at an overall cost of over €170m for the period to 2013.

While the scheme is 100% Exchequer funded, Ireland was required to seek State Aid approval from the EU Commission before the scheme could be introduced. This State Aid approval was given on the basis that the rate of payment was calculated using the costs to farmers of carrying out the various measures under the scheme.  There is therefore no possibility of providing incentives as any such payment would constitute a production aid and would contravene EU law.I expect the scheme to prove very attractive to all suckler farmers.  The scheme gives special recognition to young trained farmers under 35 years of age, in that they will not be required to undertake the training element of the scheme.

It confirms my concerns about the labelling of the origin of meat which I have frequently referred to in this House and indeed have brought up at European Commission level.I am a strong supporter of the Quality Assurance Schemes operated by Bord Bia. These schemes, which are voluntary, offer the consumer assurances on quality and information on origin and are backed up by independent audits.  Members of the scheme can use the Quality Assurance logo on products sourced from quality assured farms.  A range of meats products is now covered by these voluntary Bord Bia schemes.The Minister for Health and Children has overall responsibility for the general food labelling legislation.  Responsibility for enforcement of labelling legislation rests with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) through its service contracts with my Department, the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, Marine and Natural Resources, the Health Services Executive, the Local Authorities and the National Consumer Agency.EU beef labelling legislation requiring country of origin labelling of beef has been in place since September 2000.  As this legislation did not cover beef sold by the catering trade I collaborated with the Minister for Health and Children to have national legislation enacted to require that all beef sold or served in the retail or catering sector is now required to carry an indication of the country of origin.  This legislation is enforced by the FSAI.Regarding the labelling of poultrymeat, there are EU Regulations which provide for the labelling of unprocessed poultrymeat at retail level. The Regulations require such poultrymeat to be labelled with the information regarding class, price, condition, registered number of slaughterhouse or cutting plant and, where imported from a Third Country, an indication of country of origin.In relation to other meats, I have signalled my intention to have legislation brought forward to require the country of origin to be shown on poultrymeat, pigmeat and sheepmeat sold in the retail and catering sectors.  A draft of such regulations was prepared by my Department and is currently being finalised by the Department of Health and Children.  A public consultation process has taken place.  Following consideration of any views received it will be necessary to submit the draft regulations to the European Commission for approval.There is also the issue where a primary product can enter Ireland and processed in some way thereby allowing it to be branded as an Irish product is known as "substantial transformation".  This terminology originates in WTO, Codex and EU legislation governing the EU Customs Code and therefore can only be amended at EU level.  I have been concerned that this arrangement could, in certain circumstances, be used to mislead the consumers as to the origin of the raw materials used in certain products.  I am not satisfied with the current legal position and have raised my concerns at EU Council level.

The proposed legislation is being reviewed in the light of comments received and will be forwarded to the EU Commission.  The commencement date for the legislation will depend on the Commission's response and possibly that of other Member States.In the proposed legislation ‘origin' will be defined as the country where the animal was reared and, if different, the country of slaughter.  This will have to be indicated on meat and meat products containing over 70% meat.  Regardless of the nature, extent or location of processing or packaging that has gone into the manufacture of the product the requirement to show actual country of rearing and slaughter of the animal will remain in place and this will not be superseded by any misleading interpretation of the ‘substantial transformation' concept.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	326	Detailed EU legislation lays down the conditions that Member States must apply to the production of and trade in products of animal origin as well as to imports of these products from third countries.It is a requirement that animal products imported from third countries meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production in, and trade between, Member States. All such imports must come from third countries or areas of third countries approved for export to the EU.My Department has responsibility for operation of public and animal health control in the area of third country import of food of animal origin, including meat. These are carried out in co-operation with Customs Service. Import control forms a part of the EU's integrated policy of guaranteeing that the food produced and placed on to the market is safe and that animal and public health is not put at risk. They are a part of the EU's hygiene package the implementation and monitoring of which is carried out by the relevant competent agencies under Service Contracts by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland since 1999.The EU Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) carries out inspections to ensure that only establishments that meet hygiene and health standards equivalent to those operating within the EU are approved. Where the FVO considers that public health requirements are not being met, an establishment may be removed from the EU approved list. If outbreaks of animal diseases occur in a third country approval to export to the EU is suspended for the infected regions of the country, or the whole country, as appropriate, until the disease risk has been eliminated.I have consistently pointed out at EU level that produce imported from third countries must meet standards equivalent to those required of Community producers. In this context I have been in regular contact EU Commissioner for Health Mr. Markos Kyprianou. The Commissioner has assured me that the Commission will not hesitate to take the appropriate protection measures if a product, imported from a third country or produced in the domestic market represents a risk for the health of EC consumers, livestock or plants.I should add that in WTO discussions in the Council, I have always emphasised the need to take account of the non-trade aspect of market access, which I regard as a crucial element in the overall negotiations.I have already publicly welcomed the publication of the latest FVO report by the EU Commission. The report should be very helpful in the overall process of ensuring equivalence. As I indicated at the time of the publication of the report my Department has requested the EU authorities to arrange for a discussion of this report at the EU Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health.A further mission to Brazil is being arranged for this month by the EU Food and Veterinary Office. It is vital that the FVO report on their findings at the earliest possible date and that the EU Commission will take whatever action is necessary to protect the interests of EU consumers and producers.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	327	In respect of the threats posed by the recent confirmation of avian ‘flu in England and the outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease and bluetongue, my Department has in place a series of robust contingency arrangements and I have available to me, through my Department's National Disease Control Centre (NDCC), a wide range of expert veterinary, scientific, administrative and legal advice.My Department places a particular emphasis on the importance of strict biosecurity, particularly at farm-level and has consistently impressed upon farmers the need for such measures and continues to offer advice in this regard.  Such advice has been published and sent to farmers and poultry flockowners in leaflet and booklet form as well as having been published in the national newspapers and posted to the Department's main website as well as our dedicated avian ‘flu, FMD and bluetongue websites.There are very different risks associated with the various diseases and different control and mitigating measures are appropriate to deal with those risks.  Because of the most likely means of introduction, there are limitations to the measures that can be taken to maintain the country's current disease-free status, for example in relation to the threat posed by migrating wild birds in regard to avian ‘flu or infected midges in regard to bluetongue.What we have consistently endeavoured to do is to assess the risk of any disease introduction and to implement control measures that are reasonable and proportionate to the risk analysis.  To that end, the Management Committee of my Department's NDCC is responsible for the day-to-day response to the various disease threats and has, at its disposal, access to a wide range of advice and expertise both from within and outside the Department.In relation to avian ‘flu and these other diseases, my Department keeps all developments in relation to the spread of the respective diseases under review and, where appropriate, the NDCC Management Committee recommends the introduction of additional controls.  In addition, my Department has developed comprehensive Contingency Plans in respect of each of the diseases.Based on the advice available, from various sources, the immediate risk of an outbreak of either avian ‘flu, foot-and-mouth disease or bluetongue is regarded as relatively low at this time.  In relation to avian ‘flu, we are close to the end of the current migration season and there is very little migration between Ireland and Germany, France and the Czech Republic, with which the strain of the virus found in England has been associated.  The most recent case of FMD in England was confirmed on 30th September.In relation to bluetongue, the risk is principally associated with the introduction of an infected animal or through infected midges.  While animals may now be imported from bluetongue-affected area, the conditions under which they may do so are very restrictive and are intended to significantly reduce the risk of an infected animal being imported. Meanwhile the Department's vector surveillance programme shows that the level of vector activity has declined very significantly in the past few weeks.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the respective disease situations will continue to be monitored closely and any revisions to our contingency arrangements made, where appropriate.Central also to our contingency arrangements has been the excellent level of co-operation between my Department and the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development in Northern Ireland.  Both Departments have a shared commitment to the maintenance of an all-island approach to the disease threats posed and have collaborated very closely in the adoption of identical control measures.Based on our expert assessment of the current level of risk of a disease outbreak, I am satisfied that my Department currently has in place the necessary contingency arrangements, including sufficient legislative powers.  Should any of the disease threat assessments change and it be considered that additional measures are appropriate, I won't hesitate to introduce such measures.

The 2007 harbours and coastal infrastructure programme was announced earlier this year but no applications for funding were received from Cork County Council in respect of the above locations.  I have recently invited applications for funding under the 2008 fishery harbours programme and any application received from Cork County Council for the above locations will be given due consideration.The piers at Bantry and Baltimore come under the Harbours Act, 1946 and, as such, are under the control of Baltimore and Skibbereen Harbour Commissioners and Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners, respectively. The harbour authorities under the Harbours Act, 1946 are the responsibility of the Department of Transport.

I clearly stated, at the time of the launch of the Scheme, that it would be suspended when the financial ceiling provided for the Scheme had been reached and this was also explicitly provided for in its terms and conditions.  I have no plans to reopen the Scheme for new applications prior to the review in 2008 of the terms of Towards 2016 as provided for in that agreement.

The European Commission is mandated to negotiate these on behalf of the European Union and, through its Food and Veterinary Office, to monitor the compliance of third countries it has approved for trade with the EU. Where there are risks to public or animal health in the Community, arising from disease outbreaks in approved third countries, safeguard measures are invoked banning or restricting imports from the affected country or regions.I have already publicly welcomed the publication of the latest FVO report by the EU Commission. The report should be very helpful in the overall process of ensuring equivalence. As I indicated at the time of the publication of the report my Department has requested the EU authorities to arrange for a discussion of this report at the EU Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health.I have consistently pointed out to the Commissioner and to my colleagues in the Council of Ministers that produce imported from third countries must meet standards that are equivalent to those required of Community producers.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	331	The bluetongue virus (serotype 8), which emerged in northern Europe in 2006, re-emerged this year and, in September, an outbreak of the disease was confirmed in Britain for the very first time.  Cases of the serotype 8 strain have now been confirmed in nine European countries.Since August 2006, my Department has been updating its legislation and developing contingency arrangements, in the first instance, to minimise the possible introduction of the disease to Ireland and, secondly, to deal with an outbreak in this country.  In both regards my Department is working very closely with the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development in Northern Ireland in the development of an all-island approach.As part of its contingency arrangements, my Department has produced a comprehensive Bluetongue Contingency Plan for Ireland.  The contingency arrangements are kept under constant review and revised as appropriate by reference to the developing disease situation or in the light of legal or other developments, particularly at EU level.In terms of minimising the risk of the disease being introduced to Ireland, my Department has had in place a ban on the importation of live susceptible animals from bluetongue-restricted areas in Europe.  Since 1 November, however, a new Commission Regulation allows for the possibility of movement of susceptible animals from bluetongue-restricted areas under defined conditions that are detailed in the Regulation.  However, imports of such animals from Great Britain remain banned under FMD-related measures.My Department has advised importers of live animals to assess carefully the risks involved in importing animals from bluetongue-restricted areas and to import animals from such areas only where absolutely necessary.  My Department is also finalising a risk analysis on all possible routes of introduction of the disease.  Arising from that risk analysis, I will consider whether any additional mitigating controls ought to be put in place.I am also committed to working with the various stakeholders in relation to the threat posed and officials of my Department have met each of the farm bodies to brief them on the current situation and to hear and discuss their concerns.  Those lines of communication will remain open.There is no vaccine yet available for the particular strain of the disease that is present in Britain and across northern Europe.  Three pharmaceutical companies are currently involved in the development of an inactivated vaccine. I understand that such a vaccine may become available by the summer of 2008 though, even then, there will production issues and a huge demand for the vaccine given the cattle and sheep populations of the countries affected to date.My Department has been in contact with the three companies involved in relation to the timeframe for the availability of a vaccine and the provision of an adequate supply to ensure that we can put in place a comprehensive and effective vaccination programme.  The logistical arrangements associated with securing and administering the vaccine are currently being actively considered within my Department.  In the absence, to date, of a vaccine, the Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible, at this stage, to predict what the cost of the vaccine or of a comprehensive vaccination programme will be.Furthermore, my Department is actively involved with the European Commission and the other Member States in relation to the possibility of developing an overall Community-wide vaccination strategy.  The Commission has scheduled a bluetongue symposium to be held in Brussels on 16th January 2008 and, in preparation for that, the first in a series of working group meetings took place earlier this month, at which my Department was represented.I have also discussed the current disease situation in continental Europe and in Britain with my colleagues in the European Agriculture Council and earlier this month discussed the matter with Minister Gildernew during the North South Ministerial Council, in the context of the development and maintenance of an all-island approach.  Furthermore, at a recent Agricultural Council meeting, a number of Ministers called on the Commission to develop a bluetongue control strategy and I strongly support this approach.

I am aware that different Local Authorities charge different rates/levies in respect of a development contribution. I will be in contact with my colleague the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government about this matter. I should hope that such levies/charges would not be such as to restrict investments in the horticulture sector.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	333	I am, of course, very concerned about the level of safety on our farms.  Last year 18 people died on Irish farms (8 of these people were aged over 70) and this year to-date 10 people have died.  It is estimated that there are some 3,000 injuries on farms each year.  I strongly support the work of The Health and Safety Authority (HSA), which is charged with overall responsibility for promotion of workplace health, and safety.The Farm Safety Partnership, an advisory committee to the HSA that is made up of representatives from the Department of Agriculture Fisheries and Food, Teagasc and other farming groups, supports and co-ordinates the majority of research and promotional activities in relation to farm safety.  On a practical level the HSA stand at the ploughing championships featured machinery safety demonstrations and provided advice on a range of farming related health and safety issues. A Code of Practice for the Prevention of Accidents and Occupational ill health in Agriculture was launched by the HSA at the ploughing championships in September 2006. The aim of the Code of Practice is to provide practical guidance to farmers and to help improve the level of safety and health in the agriculture sector.My Department in conjunction with the Department for Labour Affairs circulated some 160,000 copies of the Code of Practice to all farmers in late November/early December 2006. Teagasc, the statutory body responsible for training in the agriculture sector, are providing half-day training courses for farmers on how to complete the Code of Practice. This course is run in every County and Teagasc aim to provide training for 9,000 farmers on the Code of Practice in 2007.  I would strongly urge farmers to attend this course.There is also serious concern at the number of elderly farmers suffering accidents on the farm and to highlight this issue, the Health and Safety Authority issued leaflets on "safety and elderly farmers" at the Ploughing Championships this year.We are also concerned with child safety on farms and the HSA, together with Teagasc has developed a new child safety book. This was launched by the Minister for Labour Affairs at the Ploughing Championships this year.  This free book illustrates the hazards, which may be encountered on a farm, and again I would strongly urge all farming parents to read the book with their children and thus ensure that the safety message gets across.The provision of training is of utmost importance and especially in the area of Health and Safety. A twenty-hour training course is mandatory for all participants in the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS).  My Department has ensured that one module of this training is devoted to Health and Safety in farming.Finally, I would stress to all farmers the need to follow the guidance of the Health and Safety Authority and take ownership of the Code of Practice for the Prevention of Accidents and Occupational ill health in Agriculture.

This follows on from their recently published report — ‘The Environmental Impacts of Planting Broadleaved Trees on Acid-sensitive Soils.'Afforestation on such land is currently subject to strict controls because trees, especially evergreen trees, have the ability to scrub pollutants from the atmosphere which, when washed down onto acid soils may cause increased acidification of watercourses.  This policy is kept under review in the light of ongoing national and international research findings.There are, of course, many benefits associated with planting trees and it has been suggested that planting portions of acid-sensitive areas, up to a threshold, with native species will provide significant benefits for biodiversity and riparian zones.  The COFORD report examined national and international data on this subject and called for further studies which are now underway or planned.   I believe this is an area worth investigating in the Irish context.

The Deputy will be aware that I have no role in setting the level of retail poultry prices.I have, in recent times, worked with my EU colleagues, both at Council and bilaterally, to put in place steps aimed at improving the situation and ameliorating some of the difficulties being caused by the increased cost of inputs. These steps include a suspension of the obligation to set 10% of arable land aside and the EU Commission is also examining ways of synchronising the authorisation process for Genetically Modified feedstuffs between the EU and the US, to try to improve the efficiency of these arrangements.

The research was presented at the National Conference on Local Food, held in Mullingar on 13th November and organised by my Department and Bord Bia. The research will prove useful for local producers wishing to serve the local market, as it will provide an insight into consumer attitudes and behaviour regarding local produce.To assist producers wishing to serve their local markets Bord Bia has also produced a guide entitled ‘Selling Through Farmers' Markets, Farm Shops and Box Schemes in Ireland'.  This guide, the first of its kind, provides practical and in-depth advice for small food producers to maximize the potential from these routes to market.The Minister for Health and Children has overall responsibility for the general food labelling legislation.  Responsibility for enforcement of labelling legislation rests with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) through its service contracts with my Department, the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, the Health Services Executive, the Local Authorities and the National Consumer Agency.EU beef labelling legislation requiring country of origin labelling of beef has been in place since September 2000.  As this legislation did not cover beef sold by the catering trade I collaborated with the Minister for Health and Children to have national legislation enacted to require that all beef sold or served in the retail or catering sector is now required to carry an indication of the country of origin.  This legislation is enforced by the FSAI.Regarding the labelling of poultrymeat, there are EU Regulations which provide for the labelling of unprocessed poultrymeat at retail level. The Regulations require such poultrymeat to be labelled with the information regarding class, price, condition, registered number of slaughterhouse or cutting plant and, where imported from a Third Country, an indication of country of origin.In relation to other meats I have signalled my intention to have legislation brought forward to require the country of origin to be shown on poultrymeat, pigmeat and sheepmeat sold in the retail and catering sectors.  A draft of such regulations was prepared by my Department and is currently being finalised by the Department of Health and Children.  A public consultation process has taken place.  Following consideration of any views received it will be necessary to submit the draft regulations to the European Commission for approval.The EU Commission is currently reviewing the whole area of food labelling and in that context my Department contributed to Ireland's submission which was co-ordinated by the Department of Health and Children.  Within this submission Ireland explained why it felt that origin labelling should be compulsory for all meat.  As well as direct contact with the Commission on this I have also raised this matter in the Agriculture Council and I will continue to press for progress, as I believe consumers are entitled to full information on the origin of food products.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	340	In an effort to ensure that consumers have full information on origin of food products, I have signalled my intention to have legislation brought forward to require the country of origin to be shown on poultrymeat, pigmeat and sheepmeat sold in the retail and catering sectors.  A draft of such regulations was prepared by my Department and is currently being finalised by the Department of Health and Children.  A public consultation process has taken place.  Following consideration of any views received it will be necessary to submit the draft regulations to the European Commission for approval.The Bord Bia Quality Assurance Schemes are voluntary and plants that are members of the schemes can use the logo on product sourced from Quality Assured farms.   Bord Bia promotes and encourages the use of the logo, which provides consumers with assurances on quality and information on origin.  However, it remains a voluntary scheme.There is food safety legislation in place to obligate all food business operators to trace the food they are handling, that is to know where the product came from and to whom it is being sent.The Minister for Health & Children has overall responsibility for the general food labelling legislation.  Responsibility for enforcement of labelling legislation and food safety legislation rests with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) through its service contracts with my Department, the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, Marine and Natural Resources, the Health Services Executive, the Local Authorities and the National Consumer Agency.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	341	On 12th November, the UK Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) announced that it had confirmed avian ‘flu in turkeys on a farm on the Norfolk/Suffolk border and, on the following day, confirmed that it was the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain.  A second case was confirmed on the 19th of November on one of four premises on which all poultry had been culled, having been identified as ‘dangerous contacts.'The total number of poultry culled on the originally infected premises and the four ‘dangerous contacts' was approximately 28,600. The epidemiological investigation as to the origin of the disease is ongoing and all avenues into the possible source are being investigated. Defra had confirmed that the strain of the virus found on the originally infected premises is similar to that found in Germany, France and the Czech Republic during the summer.Immediately after the case on the 12th, and on a number of occasions since, the Management Committee of the National Disease Control Centre (NDCC) in my Department met to review the situation in the light of the information available.   Meetings of the Committee are frequently chaired by me or, in my absence, by the Secretary General of my Department.In response to the outbreak in England, and consistent with the introduction of a ban on bird shows and gatherings in Britain, my Department and the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) in Northern Ireland, banned the participation of birds from Britain in any shows, exhibitions and other gatherings on the island of Ireland.  This is further evidence of the all-island approach that has consistently been taken, and to which we remain committed, in the face of various animal health threats, including foot-and-mouth disease and bluetongue.  Contact between the two Departments is being maintained at both political and official levels.My Department also republished biosecurity advice to poultry flockowners in the national newspapers and is in the process of writing to all registered flockowners reiterating that advice.  In addition, my Department is currently processing grant applications from some 430 poultry flockowners who have installed water chlorination facilities to ensure that any virus contained in the water supplies to their poultry houses is deactivated.  This measure will significantly reduce the risk of the virus being spread to commercial flocks in the event of the disease being introduced by wild birds.My Department has also been in touch with those other agencies on whose assistance it would rely in the event of an outbreak in this country, including An Garda Síochána, the Defence Forces, the Civil Defence as well as with the Department of Health and Children.  Expert ornithological advice is being provided by the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government as well as by BirdWatch Ireland.I have at my disposal a range of veterinary, scientific, ornithological, administrative and legal expertise and, with my officials and on the basis of the expert advice available to me, continue to keep the situation under constant review and to keep the risk of the introduction of the disease to Ireland under constant assessment.  The current expert ornithological advice suggests that we are close to the end of the current migration season and the wild bird population will remain stable unless there is a particularly severe weather snap.  Furthermore, it is considered that the numbers of wild birds moving between the east coast of England and Ireland would be small.Having reviewed their contingency arrangements, my Department and I remain satisfied that the existing range of contingency arrangements, including legislative powers, is adequate to deal with the current threat.  If at any time it is considered that additional control measures ought to be introduced, either in the light of any new information from Britain or in the context of any reassessment of the risk to this country, I will not hesitate to introduce such measures

It is represented on the inter-Departmental team established to oversee implementation of the National Climate Change Strategy.There is no evidence at this time to suggest that there is likely to be any major threat to our staple fruit and vegetable crops due to major changes in farming practices as a result of climate change. Indeed the impact on horticulture crops in Ireland is generally likely to be positive in the short to medium term.  Accordingly there is not a need at this point in time to plan for food shortages in Ireland.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	343	The application of both organic and chemical fertilizers has shown a decline in recent years as farmers have sought to use them more efficiently and economically.  The high level of participation in the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS), which sets limits on fertilizer use, is also likely to have been a factor.  The European Communities (Good Agricultural Practice for Protection of Waters) Regulations 2006 were made by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to give further effect to several EU Directives including Directives in relation to protection of waters against pollution from agricultural sources (the Nitrates Directive), dangerous substances in water, waste management, protection of groundwater, public participation in policy development and water policy (the Water Framework Directive).  The Regulations specify maximum levels for nitrogen and phosphorus in relation to most horticultural crops.Regarding pesticides, the procedure for authorisation of a plant protection product by the Pesticide Control Service of my Department, includes an assessment of the minimum rate of application necessary to ensure effective control of a pest or disease.  This rate is stated on the approved label of the product authorised and users are required to apply the product in accordance with the label instructions.A proposal for a Commission Directive on the sustainable use of pesticides is currently under consideration by both the EU Council and the EU Parliament. The proposal aims to reduce the risk from the use of pesticides and is designed to further enhance the high level of protection for man, animals and the environment achieved through the regulatory system for pesticides.  While Parliament has adopted a position, Council has not yet completed a first reading of the legislative texts concerned.  My Department is actively participating in the ongoing discussions at Council.

The report should be very helpful in the overall process of ensuring equivalence. As I indicated at the time of the publication of the report my Department has requested the EU authorities to arrange for a discussion of this report at the EU Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health.A further mission to Brazil is being arranged for this month by the EU Food and Veterinary Office. It is vital that the FVO report on their findings at the earliest possible date and that the EU Commission will take whatever action is necessary to protect the interests of EU consumers and producers.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	345	I propose to take Questions Nos. 35, 50 and 57 together.Earlier this year, I introduced a new National Energy Crops payment of €80 per hectare to help kick-start production of energy crops in Ireland. It is intended that the €80 payment will be available for 3 years. It is currently subject to a maximum ceiling of 37.5 hectares per producer over the 3-year period. EU State aid rules limit the amount of aid that may be paid to individual beneficiaries to €3,000 over any period of 3 years. My Department has been pursuing with the European Commission an increase in this ceiling.The buoyant market for biofuels and the introduction of incentives at farm level, including the €80 premium contributed to an increase in the area devoted to energy crops in 2007. The area of oilseed rape, which is used to produce biofuels, increased from 5,000 hectares in 2006 to 7,500 hectares in 2007. As regards 2008, an increase in the area devoted to conventional cereal crops in Ireland and elsewhere is likely in response to the current high grain prices. However, it is expected that oilseed rape will continue to be a popular crop in 2008 as, in addition to the market demand and the incentives available, many farmers grow it as a "break" crop in tillage cropping situations to help fight crop diseases, improve soil structure and increase yields.In a single market situation, biofuel feedstocks including oilseeds are traded freely within the European Union. The €80 payment is being paid as a top-up to the EU Premium available under the EU Energy Crops Scheme. Eligible applicants under this Scheme automatically qualify for the €80 National premium. The rules governing the EU Energy Crops Scheme provide that aid can only be granted in respect of areas where production is covered by a contract between the farmer and the processing industry, except where the farmer undertakes the processing himself. Furthermore applicants must deliver all raw materials harvested to a collector or first processor who will take delivery of them and ensure that an equivalent quantity of these raw materials is used within the European Community for the manufacture of energy products.In 2007, a total of 550 farmers are potentially eligible for the National Energy Crop Premium. My Department has made initial payments to 437 farmers, which are worth approximately €341,000. Payments to the remaining applicants will continue as further cases are cleared.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	346	The Sheep Strategy Development Group issued its report in June 2006. The report made a number of recommendations for action to secure the future of the sheep industry in Ireland. There are a total of thirty-seven recommendations covering the areas of production, breeding, research, advice, processing, marketing and policy formulation. Following the issuing of the report, I set up an Implementation Group to oversee the implementation of the recommendations contained in the Strategy Report. The Implementation Group completed its work in April of this year. Most of the recommendations in the report fall to be implemented by the industry itself and it is too early at this stage to assess their impact.The recommendations are supported by my Department through assistance for breeding and management, processing facilities, mechanical grading, quality assurance and health and welfare. In addition and in line with the Group's report, sheep farmers are major beneficiaries of various schemes being operated by my Department. Under REPS 4, a new supplementary measure aimed at sheep farmers has been introduced. A budget of €28m a year has been allocated to fund the proposed new supplementary measure at an overall cost of over €170m for the period to 2013.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	348	I propose to take Questions Nos. 38 and 42 together.I have constantly pressed and continue to press for an increase in the age-limit for the testing of healthy slaughtered animals for human consumption.  The existing requirement that all bovines over 30 months of age, slaughtered for human consumption, must be tested along with all casualty animals over 24 months and all fallen stock over 24 months is provided for under Regulation (EC) 999/2001.In recent months, the European Commission has proposed changes to the existing testing regime, the most recent of which were proposed at a meeting of Chief Veterinary Officers in early October and these were since discussed at a meeting of the TSE Working Group in Brussels earlier this month. I believe that the proposals now tabled by the Commission represent a vindication of my efforts over the past three years and I look forward with optimism to a successful conclusion to the current discussions.The current options under discussion are, in respect of healthy slaughtered animals: to test all cattle aged over 42 months; to test all cattle born before 1 January 2002 and 50% of those born since and aged over 42 months; and to test all animals born before 1 January 2004 and none [or a minimum sample size] of those born since.Ireland is among a number of countries that have expressed support for the third option.  While any of the options will result in a very significant decline in the amount of testing of healthy slaughtered animals, the third option will result in far fewer tests over time and provides a definite end-date by which time testing will no longer be required.Consideration of the various options is continuing at various levels in Brussels and it is  too early to say when agreement may be reached on a particular option and when, therefore, a change may be made to the existing testing regime in Ireland.I am confident that Ireland's performance in recent years in significantly reducing the incidence of BSE will ensure that we will be able to meet whatever criteria are determined to allow Member States to avail of the revised surveillance requirements.  Both my officials and I will continue to press for an early resolution of these discussions with a view to having the Irish surveillance programme revised as quickly as possible and in a way that significantly reduces the burden of testing with a view to its ultimate elimination for animals slaughtered for human consumption.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	349	The Minister for Health & Children has overall responsibility for the general food labelling legislation.  Responsibility for enforcement of labelling legislation rests with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) through its service contracts with my Department, the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, the Health Services Executive, the Local Authorities and the National Consumer Agency.The particular issue referred to in this question is where a primary product can enter Ireland and processed in some way thereby allowing it to be branded as an Irish product is known as "substantial transformation".  This terminology originates in WTO, Codex and EU legislation governing the EU Customs Code and therefore can only be amended at EU level.  I have been concerned that this arrangement could, in certain circumstances, be used to mislead the consumers as to the origin of the raw materials used in certain products.  I am not satisfied with the current legal position and have raised my concerns at EU Council level.The EU Commission is currently reviewing the whole area of food labelling and in that context my Department contributed to Ireland's submission which was co-ordinated by the Department of Health and Children.  Within this submission Ireland again raised the matter of the unsatisfactory nature of the concept of substantial transformation and the possibility of it being used to disguise the origin of products from the public. I believe that the concept of substantial transformation needs to be more clearly defined and I will continue to urge the Commission to address this problem.In the meantime my Department has been involved in consultations with the Department of Health and Children on drafting new regulations to require operators in the retail and catering sectors to provide country of origin information on poultrymeat, pigmeat and sheepmeat as is the case with beef.A public consultation on the proposed regulations has recently taken place on the website of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.  The proposed legislation is being reviewed in the light of comments received.   Thereafter the draft legislation will have to be forwarded to the European Commission. The commencement date for the legislation will depend on the Commission's response and possibly that of other Member States.In the proposed legislation ‘origin' will be defined as the country where the animal was reared and, if different, the country of slaughter. This will have to be indicated on meat and meat products containing over 70% meat. Regardless of the nature, extent or location of processing or packaging that has gone into the manufacture of the product the requirement to show actual country of rearing and slaughter of the animal will remain in place and this will not be superseded by any misleading interpretation of the ‘substantial transformation' concept.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	350	The restrictions that were imposed on forestry planting in areas of the country that were designated as acid-sensitive were done so because the underlying geology in these areas is acidic.  Afforestation on such land is currently subject to strict controls because trees, especially evergreen trees, have the ability to scrub pollutants from the atmosphere which, when washed down onto acid soils may cause increased acidification of watercourses.  This policy is kept under review in the light of ongoing national and international research findingsThere are, of course, many benefits associated with planting trees. Planting portions of acid-sensitive areas, up to a threshold, with native species can provide significant benefits for biodiversity and riparian zones.  COFORD, the National Council for Forest Research and Development, published a report on this recently, ‘The Environment Impacts of Planting Broadleaved Trees on Acid-sensitive Soils.'I welcome the debate around the issues highlighted in the COFORD report and I believe this is an area worth investigating further.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	351	Country of origin labelling is one of the requirements under the EC marketing standards for a range of fresh fruit and vegetables.  In accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1182/2007, which shall apply from 1 January 2008, all fresh produce covered by the reformed common organisation of the market for fruit and vegetables may only be sold to consumers if the country of origin is indicated.  My Department carries out regular inspections of fresh fruit and vegetables to ensure that regulated produce offered to the consumer is accurately labelled.Unlike the food items mentioned above, horticultural planting materials do not require a designation of origin. However certain species which pose particular plant health risks are traceable through the EU plant passport system. In addition all planting material from third countries must be covered by a phytosanitary certificate and be inspected on entering the Community.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	352	Council Directive 2000/29/EC (commonly referred to as the EU Plant Health Directive) deals with protective measures against the introduction into the European Union of organisms harmful to plants or plant products and against their spread within the Community. It sets out the range of timber and timber products that are subject to plant health control.Whether or not a timber import or wood packaging is subject to control is dependent on the risk of a potentially harmful forest pest being associated with the import. This is in turn is determined by the species and origin of the import, and the nature of the commodity. The documentary and treatment requirements for import of controlled timbers are set out in the Directive.Where a timber import is subject to control, officials from the Forest Service of my Department undertake documentary, identity and plant health inspections and where appropriate may take enforcement actions to maintain the favourable pest and disease status of the national forest estate.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	353	My Department has a multifaceted strategy in place to assist the development and viability of the pig industry.The main current concern for the sector is the erosion of profit margins due to the very high cost of feeding stuffs. I have, in recent times, worked with my EU colleagues, both at Council and bilaterally, to put in place steps aimed at improving the situation and ameliorating some of the difficulties being caused by the increased cost of inputs. These steps include a suspension of the obligation to set 10% of arable land aside. The European Commission is also examining ways of synchronising the authorisation process for Genetically Modified feedstuffs in the EU and the US to try to improve the efficiency of these arrangements.I will continue to pursue appropriate measures aimed at addressing current income difficulties. A scheme of financial assistance for the private storage of pigmeat was put in place in recent weeks.  This was adopted by the European Commission in response to a request from me and some other Member States. I have also impressed on the Commission the desirability of export refunds for fresh and frozen pigmeat and this will be kept under consideration.An area of major importance for the future of the pig sector is the question of compliance with legislation on the protection of the environment. This will have significant cost implications as well as giving rise to operational complexities for producers. I have established the Intensive Livestock Group to assist the pig and poultry sectors to find solutions to manure disposal problems arising from the nitrates regulations. Pig producers and processors and Teagasc are represented on the ILG. The work of this group is continuing.Pigmeat features prominently in Bord Bia's programme of promotion on the home and export markets. I have asked the Bord to intensify its national pork and bacon promotion campaign and additional funding is being made available for this. The Bord Bia quality assurance schemes are also a good tool in maintaining consumer confidence and, in this context, the pigmeat scheme is well established and managed.On the export front, Bord Bia's marketing initiatives cover pigmeat. The sector is often involved in overseas promotion drives which occasionally involve the participation of pigmeat exporters.  My Department maintains an extensive scheme of controls on the hygienic production of pigmeat and on the operational procedures that are required to underpin the certification of pigmeat for markets worldwide.I am working with the Minister for Health and Children towards the introduction of legislation to provide better information to consumers on the origin of pigmeat and other meats.  The public consultation on the proposed regulations has been completed and the comments received are being examined. Following that, the draft legislation will be notified to the European Commission.Other relevant support actions include the extension of the farm waste management scheme to the pig sector and the programme of financial assistance for the transition to welfare-friendly sow housing as well as programmes for the monitoring and control of animal diseases.Needless to say, all aspects of my Department's strategy for the pig sector require the involvement and co-operation of the people in that industry to succeed. My Department will continue to work closely with the representative associations for pig producers and processors, and any other bodies relevant to the subject in question, to develop and implement measures to ensure that the Irish pig sector goes on to retain its important contribution to the rural economy and export earnings.

Discussions on the proposals are likely to continue until the end of 2008.In relation to the preparation of position papers, my officials have been engaged in preparatory analysis for the Health Check and in contacts with the Commission and other Member States on the key issues.  It is clear that all proposals will need to be carefully scrutinised to ensure that they support a viable, stable and sustainable policy framework for the continued prosperity of Irish agriculture.In addition to the internal analysis in the Department and contact with other Member States, I am also establishing a Consultative Committee drawn from the main industry stakeholders to advise me on the main issues arising.  This Group will work in parallel with the recently established Consultative Committee on Milk Quota issues and the output from both groups will feed into Ireland's position in the negotiations.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	355	The implementation of the Nitrates Directive is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  The European Communities (Good Agricultural Practice for Protection of Waters) Regulations 2006 were made by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government following a comprehensive consultation period involving input from stakeholders and other interested parties and the proposals, including prohibited periods for fertiliser spreading, were specifically agreed with the European Commission as part of Ireland's Nitrates Action Programme.The prohibited periods for fertilizer application are set out in the Regulations, as are the other factors that farmers are obliged to take into account when considering fertilizer application outside of those periods.  I believe that the terms of Ireland's Action Programme are as favourable as it was possible to achieve in discussions with the European Commission, having regard to the requirements of the Nitrates Directive and the need to protect water quality.

The European Commission is mandated to negotiate these on behalf of the European Union and, through its Food and Veterinary Office, to monitor the compliance of third countries it has approved for trade with the EU. Where there are risks to public or animal health in the Community, arising from disease outbreaks in approved third countries, safeguard measures are invoked banning or restricting imports from the affected country or regions.I have consistently pointed out to the Commissioner and to my colleagues in the Council of Ministers that produce imported from third countries must meet standards that are equivalent to those required of Community producers. In this context I have been in regular contact with the Commissioner and he has assured me that the Commission will not hesitate to take action if a product, imported from a third country represents a risk for EU consumers, livestock or plants.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	361	The promotion and development of renewable energy in Ireland, including bioenergy, are matters in the first instance for the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  The role of the Department of Agriculture and Food is to support the supply side of the bioenergy market by encouraging the production of feedstocks.  In relation to funding, €14 million was made available in Budget 2007 for measures to support energy crop production.  A further €1.2 million was made available for a new Wood Biomass Harvesting Scheme.  In March of this year, the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources published a National Bioenergy Action Plan to develop Ireland's bioenergy resources to 2020.  The Action Plan, which is a comprehensive strategy to increase deployment of Ireland's resources in the transport, heat and electricity markets, is being implemented by a number of Departments and State Agencies.  My Department is implementing certain measures, which I will outline, to increase the share of bioenergy derived from the Agriculture and Forestry sector.In February 2007, I launched a new Bioenergy Scheme to provide establishment grants to farmers interested in planting willow and miscanthus for bioenergy (heat and electricity) purposes.  These crops can be pelleted and used in domestic and commercial biomass boilers to generate heat and electricity.  Establishment grants are payments to cover part of the costs of establishing the crop.  Aid is being provided at a rate of 50% of establishment costs, subject to a maximum of €1,450 per hectare.  Some €8 million has been allocated to this Scheme over the period 2007-09.The EU Energy Crops Scheme was introduced in 2003 as part of the mid-term review of the Common Agriculture Policy.  The Scheme provides farmers with an EU premium of €45 per hectare to grow energy crops intended primarily for use in the production of bioenergy.  The €45 Premium is payable on a maximum guaranteed area of 2 million hectares per annum across EU Member States.  When this threshold is breached, the Premium is reduced proportionately.Farmers who are eligible for the €45 EU Premium can also qualify for a new National Energy Crop Premium, which is worth €80 per hectare.  It is intended that the €80 payment will apply for three years and will be subject to a maximum ceiling per producer over the three years.  The current maximum area per producer over the three-year period is 37.5 hectares.  My Department is pursuing EU approval to increase this hectarage ceiling.  In Budget 2007, €6 million was made available for this measure up to 2009.My Department is supporting research into bioenergy projects through the Research Stimulus Fund Programme.  The Programme facilitates research that supports sustainable and competitive agricultural production practices and polices and contributes to a scientific research capability in the agriculture sector.  Under the 2005 and 2006 calls for proposals, five projects were selected that relate directly to biofuels and energy crops and received total grant assistance of €1.5 million.  Under the 2007 call for proposal, some €4 million is being made available over the next four years for research on the farming aspects of bio-energy production.My Department in co-operation with COFORD and Teagasc supports the development of the wood energy sector through a range of measures aimed at creating an effective supply chain from producer to end users.  Support includes 100% grants and attractive premiums for up to 20 years to encourage the establishment of new forests on agricultural land.  The value of the premium for farmers can be as much as €574 per hectare, per annum, depending on the species planted.  An additional payment of up to €200 per hectare per annum, on top of the normal forestry premium, is available for five years for farmers who are in REPS and who establish high nature value forestry under the new Forest Environment Protection Scheme.Funding is also available for individual projects and initiatives which focus specifically on wood energy.  Examples include the Clare Wood Energy Farm Forestry project and the Forest Link project in Donegal.  In addition, the Wood Biomass Harvesting Machinery Grant Scheme provides up to 40% grant aid towards the purchase of wood chippers.  My Department has already made offers of funding to the value of €600,000 under Phase 1 of this Scheme and a further €600,000 is available in grant assistance under Phase II launched in the past fortnight.  The estimated energy output from the woodchip produced by these machines would be enough to heat the equivalent of around 400 hotels.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	362	The implementation of the Nitrates Directive is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  The European Communities (Good Agricultural Practice for Protection of Waters) Regulations 2006 were made by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government following a comprehensive consultation period involving input from stakeholders and other interested parties; and the provisions of the Regulations, including the deadlines for compliance with requirements relating to storage facilities, were specifically agreed with the European Commission as part of Ireland's Nitrates Action Programme.  Those deadlines are not linked to the availability of grant aid.  A revised Farm Waste Management Scheme, introduced by my Department in 2006 with the approval of the European Commission, was designed to assist farmers in meeting their obligations under the Nitrates Regulations.  A standard grant rate of 60% (70% in the four Zone C counties)  was available to farmers under the Scheme.  48,580 applications were received from farmers under this Scheme and, to date, almost 35,000 approvals to commence work have issued to farmers.  The remaining applications are either still under consideration, are awaiting the receipt of full planning permission or are explained by the receipt of multiple applications from a single farmer.The Farm Waste Management Scheme, rather than the Farm Improvement Scheme, was the main measure designed to assist farmers to meet their obligations under the Nitrates Regulations.  A standard grant rate of 40% was available under the Farm Improvement Scheme.  I have recently announced that applications under that Scheme have reached the level of funding available and that, as a result, the Scheme is closed to new applications for now.  REPS is a voluntary undertaking.  It is a condition of the current Scheme, and has been a condition of previous Schemes, that all necessary animal housing and organic fertiliser storage facilities to meet REPS requirements be in place before the first winter after acceptance into the Scheme.  I have no plans to waive this requirement.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	363	The high grain prices experienced across the world have resulted in an increased interest in sowing cereals.  In addition the very good autumn weather has encouraged farmers to plant winter crops instead of waiting till the spring.  2007 was a difficult year for producing seed in Ireland, because of the very wet summer.  In response to this a derogation was obtained from the EU Commission to allow for the marketing of wheat seed at a lower germination rate of 80% as compared to the normal 85%.  However, the Seed Trade chose not to avail of this.  Preliminary information indicates that winter plantings are expected to be up around 30% to 118,000 ha from 90,000 ha planted in 2006.  This increase was enabled through higher imports (1,500 tonnes as compared to 324 tonnes in 2006). and the planting of 2,500 tonne of spring oats seed.  The availability of seed for spring planting will be tight.  The amount of barley and wheat seed harvested from seed certification crops was 10% less than last year.  This may not necessarily result in a 10% decline in seed availability as in each year the Seed Companies have flexibility in deciding how much of the seed that is harvested enters the Certification Scheme.  In addition it is known that companies are making enquiries as regards importing seed from the UK.  Seed prices are on average €100 a tonne or 15% higher than last year.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	365	The Sheep Strategy Group, which was chaired by Mr. John Malone, produced its report in June 2006.  The report contained a number of recommendations for action to secure the future of the sheep sector.  I established an Implementation Group, also under the chairmanship of Mr. John Malone, to oversee the implementation of the recommendations contained in the Malone report.  The Group reported in April of this year.  Most of the recommendations in the report fall to be implemented by the industry itself and it is too early at this stage to assess their impact.  The recommendations are supported by my Department through assistance for breeding and management, processing facilities, mechanical grading, quality assurance and health and welfare.  In addition and in line with the Group's report, sheep farmers are major beneficiaries of various schemes being operated by my Department.  Under REPS 4, a new supplementary measure aimed at sheep farmers has been introduced.  A budget of €28 million a year has been allocated to fund the proposed new supplementary measure at an overall cost of over €170 million for the period to 2013.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	366	A total of €350 million was provided for the Farm Waste Management Scheme and related measures, such as the Farm Improvement Scheme, by the 2007-2013 National Development Plan as part of an overall package of measures amounting to €8.6 billion of public funding for the agri-food sector as set out in that Plan.  I am satisfied that sufficient funding will be made available for the Farm Waste Management Scheme in my Department's estimates for 2008 to meet all the financial commitments which arise under that Scheme during the course of that year.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	367	My Department accords a high priority to maintaining Ireland's high status in relation to animal health and welfare in the context of protecting consumers and in view of the economic and social importance of agriculture to the country. It remains essential that we anticipate future possibilities wherever possible and maintain the capability of dealing effectively with any threats in this area, from wherever they emerge.  A comprehensive approach to these threats involves the following measures — the continued operation of schemes to reduce and eventually eradicate diseases of significant importance such as TB and Brucellosis; an intensive programme of measures to eradicate BSE; and measures to deal with threats from or actual outbreaks of other diseases.With regard to Bovine Tuberculosis, the Eradication Scheme, which complies fully with the relevant EU legislation, has been successful in reducing the level of this disease from 17% in the 1950s to 0.4%.  While efforts are continuing to achieve a sustained reduction below that level, further progress is constrained by the presence of a wildlife reservoir of infection.  In this regard, my Department operates an active wildlife and research programme.  The incidence of Brucellosis has been falling progressively in recent years.  For example, the number of laboratory positives has fallen from 6,417 in 1998 to 212 in 2006 while in the same timeframe, the number of herds depopulated dropped from 328 to three.  This progress has been maintained into 2007.This animal traceability system and the Animal Health Computer System are essential elements in supporting the Department's policies in relation to animal health and welfare activities and consumer confidence.  These systems bring the benefits of modern technology also to the administration of the Department's various programmes, including the management of the TB and Brucellosis eradication schemes.  The Animal Health Computer System has been extended also to facilitate the creation of a national database of all registered keepers of domestic poultry and captive birds as part of the Department's response to the threat of an outbreak of Avian Influenza.There is a long history of co-operation between the administrations North and South on animal health issues.  The administrations have traditionally shared information at local and national levels on disease control and surveillance issues.  The importance of agriculture on the island of Ireland and the potential threats posed by diseases require that both Governments are involved at the highest level in protecting and enhancing the animal health and welfare status of livestock.  The establishment of the North South Ministerial Council (NSMC) provided a framework for the development of an all-island animal health policy.  The main objectives of the NSMC are to foster co-operation and to devise a common, unified animal health strategy for the island as a whole.  This involves the co-ordination of animal health policies and the development of joint strategies for dealing with animal diseases.The programme of work, mandated by the NSMC, is being progressed through a series of working groups at official level.  The remit of these groups includes TB and Brucellosis, TSEs (BSE and Scrapie), veterinary medicines, other Zoonoses and animal diseases, disease surveillance, animal welfare, import and export of live animals and animal products, animal identification, traceability and cross-border aspects of fraud.  Since 2001 the structured arrangements have been valuable particularly in our dealings with the recent outbreaks of foot and mouth disease, Bluetongue and Avian Influenza in England.  In addition progress has been made in relation to policies on animal identification and on a variety of animal diseases including T.B, Brucellosis, BSE and Scrapie.The achievement of an all-island animal health strategy involves complex dialogue and negotiation over a range of areas between the Irish, Northern Irish and British authorities and will require the agreement of the European Union ultimately.  The ultimate objective of an all-island animal health and welfare strategy continues to be the attainment of arrangements that facilitate the free movement of animals on the island.  I am committed also to reviewing and where necessary prioritising the work of Working Groups and to progressing a range of issues by various deadlines.  I have put in place an agreed policy document setting down a common chapter for dealing with foot and mouth disease and at present work is continuing on the finalisation of common chapters in contingency plans for Bluetongue and Avian Influenza as well as specified work on identification of sheep, electronic data sharing, trade aspects and common approaches to scrapie, genotyping and salmonella.I am pleased to state that I hosted the first North/South Agricultural Sectoral meeting in Donegal on the 9th of this month since the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly.  Together with my colleague, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív, I met the Northern Ireland delegation which comprised of Michelle Gildernew MP, MLA, Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development and Arlene Foster, MLA, Minister of the Environment.  The free movement of animals on the island continues to be the ultimate aim of the animal health and welfare strategy and that the way forward is through co-operation and the development of complementary policies.  I believe we should continue to utilise the structured arrangements that are in place to progress matters.

I have no plans to reopen the Scheme prior to the review in 2008 of the terms of Towards 2016 as provided for in that agreement.   This review will take stock of the outcomes achieved in relation to the overall goals and the opportunities to refocus and reprioritise.  The Farm Waste Management Scheme, which provided a standard grant-rate of 60% (70% in the four Zone C counties), rather than the Farm Improvement Scheme was the principal measure designed to assist farmers to meet their obligations under the Nitrates Directive.  A total of 48,580 applications were received from farmers under the Farm Waste Management Scheme prior to the closing date of the end of 2006 and, to date, almost 35,000 approvals have issued to farmers to commence work under that Scheme.

On receipt of the Deputy's query, reviews for the years 2004 to 2006 inclusive were processed by Revenue and PAYE balancing statements for each of these years, together with cheques in settlement, will issue to the taxpayer in the coming days.  The taxpayer's tax credits for the year 2007 were also updated to include the home carer tax credit and an amended certificate of tax credits and standard rate cut-off point issued to the taxpayer on 20 November 2007.  The taxpayer's standard rate cut-off point was correctly shown on the certificate that issued on 12 February 2007 and therefore remains unchanged.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	371	The Deputy may recall that I have answered Parliamentary Questions on this issue over the past year, including on 4 July 2007 and in recent weeks.  The 2003 EU Energy Tax Directive incorporated special derogations which allowed specific excise duty reliefs to be applied in a number of Member States.  In the Irish context, these derogations allowed for reduced rates to apply to fuel used for public transport services which includes school transport services.  While these derogations expired on 31 December 2006, Ireland, along with other Member States, sought retention of its derogations beyond that date.  However the European Commission, which is the deciding authority, has to date refused all such requests.  The Commission maintains that, in keeping with the EU Energy Tax Directive, Member States must apply at least the EU minimum rates of excise on fuels in such circumstances and that any further favourable excise treatment is not allowable.  In this regard the Commission's decision was published on its website in March 2007.  At the Commission's behest my officials have indicated that Ireland will avail of the forthcoming Finance Bill to make the necessary legislative changes to conform with the Directive.  In the circumstances, the relevant line Departments who have primary responsibility in this regard are, in conjunction with my Department, exploring alternative non-tax support mechanisms that could be put in place where appropriate to maintain the assistance currently being provided, subject of course to compatibility with EU state aid requirements.  In the interim the reduced rates applicable to fuel used will be maintained.

I am informed that information specifically attributed to housing is not readily available for all of these taxes.  However, the Revenue Commissioners have supplied the following information:  In 2002, the residential stamp duty net receipts were €349 million and the VAT estimates were €1,436 million.  In 2003, the residential stamp duty net receipts were €528 million and the VAT estimates were €1,874 million.  In 2004, the residential stamp duty net receipts were €752 million and the VAT estimates were €2,327 million.  In 2005, the residential stamp duty net receipts were €945 million and the VAT estimates were €2,841 million.  In 2006, the residential stamp duty net receipts were €1,311 million and the VAT estimates were €3,247 million.  The residential stamp duty net receipts for 2007, to the end of October, were €902 million and the full-year VAT estimates are €3,501 million.Stamp Duty from residential properties is shown on a Revenue net receipts basis.  Revenue net receipts differ from Exchequer receipts due to accounting and timing issues.  Precise figures for the VAT take from the residential housing sector is not possible, as the information furnished on VAT returns does not require the yield from particular sectors of trade to be identified.  However, based on data published by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the estimated yield from this sector, which includes VAT on repairs and maintenance, is as I have outlined.  Finally, the Department of Finance will, in the context of the forthcoming Budget, publish estimated out-turn figures for 2007 and the budget day tax forecast for 2008.  In this regard it is important to note that November is an important month for tax receipts, with over 22% of total tax profiled for the year expected this month.I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that a breakdown of Capital Gains Tax by asset type is not available.  However, it is possible to provide a proportional breakdown by reference to asset types of the aggregate consideration underlying chargeable gains, that is, the total amount on which CGT is payable for the years 2002-05 broken down into broad asset categories.  These figures refer to the total selling price prior to allowing any offsets or deductions and they do not reflect whether sale of the asset gave rise to a gain or a loss.  This is not a breakdown of the actual yield from residential property as, for example, disposal of a principal private residence (which is exempt from CGT), will be reflected in these figures but not in the yield.  Just under 20% of disposals detailed on Form 11 as broken down by this aggregate consideration of asset value were from residential property in each of the years from 2002 to 2005.  Data for the tax year 2006 is not yet available as the income tax returns for that year were not due for filing until October 2007.  Similarly, 2007 data will not be available until late 2008.

These figures are provisional and subject to revision.  The numbers availing represent income earners who were in a position to absorb at least some of the home carer tax credit and thereby give rise to an Exchequer cost.  They do not include the numbers of potential claimants whose entitlements to other tax credits were sufficient to reduce their liability to tax to nil without reference to the home carer credit.  The numbers availing of the credit are rounded to the nearest hundred as appropriate.  A married couple who has elected or has been deemed to have elected for joint assessment is counted as one tax unit.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	377	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the most recent basic data on incomes available from which information of the type requested by the Deputy could be derived are in respect of the income tax year 2004. If the effective rate of income tax for each income earner with gross income in excess of   €250,000 in 2004 is calculated as the percentage of total tax liability to gross income some 937 income earners in this income category, or 10 per cent of the total, had an effective tax rate of 15 per cent or lower. The corresponding percentage for income earners with gross income in excess of €250,000 in 2003 was 10 per cent. These figures take account of Deposit Interest Retention Tax paid. Gross income is income before adjustments are made in respect of capital allowances, interest paid, losses, allowable expenses, retirement annuities etc. but after deduction of superannuation contributions by employees. A married couple who have elected or have been deemed to have elected for joint assessment is counted as one tax unit.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	386	The Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006 provides a clear legal framework to repay recoverable health charges for publicly funded long term residential care.  All those fully eligible persons who were wrongly charged and are alive will have their charges repaid in full.  The estates of all those fully eligible persons  who were wrongly charged  for publicly funded long term residential care and died since 9 December 1998 will have the charges repaid in full.  The scheme does not allow for repayments to the estates of those who died prior to that date.Recoverable health charges are charges which were imposed on persons with full eligibility under the Health (Charges for In-patient Services) Regulations 1976 as amended in 1987 or charges for in-patient services only, raised under the Institutional Assistance Regulations 1954 as amended in 1965.  It is not my intention to extend the parameters of the health repayment scheme.

I have allocated additional revenue funding of €8 million to the National Cancer Screening Service for this year to meet the additional costs involved in national roll-out.  The full complement of 111 staff for roll-out has been approved.  I have also made available an additional €26.7m capital funding for the construction of two new clinical units and the provision of seven additional mobile units and state of the art digital equipment.  Construction commenced on the static site at the South Infirmary/Victoria Hospital in Cork in November last year and final hand-over of the building is scheduled for the end of this month.  The expansion of the BreastCheck programme to the Southern region covers counties Limerick, Kerry, Cork, Waterford and Tipperary South Riding.  The screening sequence for roll out to individual counties will be dictated by BreastCheck's management and operational considerations such as maximising uptake, most efficient use of mobile and static units and radiographic personnel.
#MarieHoctorFF	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-party	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-dob	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	388	The proposed new nursing home support scheme aims to remedy the inequities that exist in the current system. At present, people face greatly different costs depending on whether they are in public or private nursing homes. In addition, individual contributions in public places are based on a flat rate regardless of an individual's wealth, whereas State support for individuals in private places is based on means-testing. This means that many people in private nursing homes get no support, and even with subvention, people can face costs they cannot afford. The result is that some people are forced to sell or mortgage their homes to pay for care costs.In contrast, the new scheme will ensure that long-term residential care is affordable for all who need it. Contributions during a person's life will be affordable and they will not have to sell or mortgage their house to meet the contribution. Furthermore, a person's family will not have to contribute towards the cost of their care.Under the new scheme, people who require long-term residential care will contribute up to 80% of their assessable income, whether for public or private nursing home care. Depending on the amount of a person's assessable income, there will also be a contribution of up to 5% of a person's assets.The portion of the contribution relating to non-liquid assets, such as a person's house, may be deferred. This means that it does not have to be met during the person's lifetime and can be payable on settlement of the person's estate instead. The deferred contribution will be based on the actual number of weeks spent in residential care and on the cost of care and, consequently, may be less than 5% per annum. I would take this opportunity to emphasise that no one will pay more than the cost of their care. In addition, where the deferred contribution applies to the principal private residence, it will be capped at a maximum of 15%, or 7.5% in the case of one spouse remaining in the home while the other enters long-term residential care. This means that after three years in care, a person will not be liable for any further deferred contribution based on the principal residence. It also means that 85% of the value of the principal residence may be maintained for the beneficiaries of the person's estate. This is not something that can be guaranteed at the moment.A person or his/her family can also choose to pay the deferred contribution at the time when care is being received instead of allowing it to be levied upon the estate if they so wish.Where a spouse or certain dependants are living in the principal residence, the deferred contribution in respect of the residence can be further deferred until after the death of that spouse or dependant, or until such time as a person previously qualifying as a dependant ceases to qualify as such.The final details of the Bill are being addressed at present. The Minister proposes to publish the Bill as soon as possible, following Government approval.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	398	I propose to take Questions Nos. 95 and 96 together.As the Health Service Executive (HSE) has operational responsibility, under the Health Act 2004, for the management and delivery of health and personal social services, the issue of revised reimbursement prices for community pharmacy under the GMS and community drugs schemes, following the announcement by the HSE on 17 September 2007 of new wholesaler arrangements, is being managed by a HSE-led team which includes representation from my Department.I have previously outlined in detail to the Oireachtas the legal provisions under competition law which prevent the Health Service Executive (HSE) from negotiating with the Irish Pharmaceutical Union (IPU) on fees, prices or margins for their members.  When it became clear that the HSE could not negotiate with pharmacists or wholesalers on fees or margins, a detailed, fair and transparent consultation process, including independent economic analysis and public consultation, was carried out to inform the final determination of the new reimbursement pricing arrangements for drugs and medicines under the GMS and community drugs schemes.  These new arrangements were announced by the HSE on 17th September 2007.  The independent economic analysis was carried out by Indecon Economic Consultants and was published by the HSE on 13 November 2007.  All aspects of the Indecon analysis were considered by the HSE in making its determination.In regard to the new reimbursement prices, the main wholesaler companies have confirmed to the HSE that they will charge community pharmacists the same price for these drugs and medicines as pharmacists will be reimbursed by the HSE for these products.  Furthermore, there are no changes planned by the HSE to the operation of the GMS medical card and community drugs schemes, and all patients continue to receive their entitlements in the normal way.My Department understands that the HSE has not received formal notification from any community pharmacist regarding cessation of services under the GMS or the various community drugs schemes.  They will be required to give three months notice in writing of any intention to cease providing this service.My Department has received correspondence from the Irish Pharmaceutical Union and other interested parties concerning the new reimbursement pricing arrangements for drugs and medicines under the GMS and community drugs schemes.  Officials from my Department have met with the HSE on a number of occasions to discuss wholesaler/pharmacy issues.To address concerns expressed by the IPU, on behalf of community pharmacists, about the implications of the legal advice on competition law on their right to negotiate fees through the Union, a process of dialogue was established, chaired by Bill Shipsey SC, to explore ways in which concerns raised by the IPU about the implications of this legal advice might be addressed.  Despite suspension of this process during the recent withdrawal by individual pharmacists of methadone services, there has recently been renewed engagement between the Irish Pharmaceutical Union and the HSE under the auspices of Mr. Shipsey.  I am also exploring, in consultation with the Attorney General, the other relevant Government Departments and the HSE, the best way of progressing the development of a new contract with pharmacists.

Details of these organisations and the circumstances which brought about their establishment, abolition or transfer are outlined below.New or Transferred Bodies.  The Advisory Board for Irish Aid, which replaced the Irish Aid Advisory Committee (see section below), was established in August 2002 to provide general oversight and advice to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State for Overseas Development on the strategic direction of the Government's programme of assistance to developing countries.The Development Education Advisory Committee (DEAC) was appointed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in 2003 following the recommendations of the Ireland Aid Review Committee.  Its purpose is to advise the Minister, Minister of State and Irish Aid on policy regarding development education.The Díon Advisory Committee was set up in response to concern about the situation of Irish emigrants in Britain in 1984.  The Committee advises the Government and makes recommendations on Emigrant Services funding to voluntary organisations that work with vulnerable Irish people resident in Britain.  In February 2003, these responsibilities were transferred to the Department of Foreign Affairs from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.The Hunger Task Force was established in September 2007, in line with the recommendation of the White Paper on Irish Aid, to identify the contributions that Ireland can make to international efforts to reduce hunger.  The Task Force has been appointed for a period of six months, after which it will present a final report to the Minister of State with responsibility for Overseas Development.Bodies abolished, replaced or transferred.  The Irish Aid Advisory Committee (IAAC) was in existence between 1993 and 2002.  Its purpose was to provide advice to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the strategic direction of the Government's programme of assistance to developing countries.  In 2002, as stated above, it was replaced by the Advisory Board for Irish Aid.The National Committee for Development Education (NCDE) was established in 1994 to promote development education throughout all sectors.  It was abolished at the end of December 2002 following the recommendations of the 2002 Ireland Aid Review Committee and was succeeded by the Development Education Advisory Committee.The Agency for Personal Service Overseas (APSO) was established by the Government in March 1974 to promote and sponsor temporary service in the developing countries of the world.  The activities of APSO were formally integrated into the Development Cooperation Division of the Department of Foreign Affairs on 1 January 2004.The Irish Refugee Agency was created in 1991, under the aegis of the Department of Foreign Affairs, to assist with the integration of Vietnamese refugees in Ireland, and it subsequently assisted with Bosnian and Kosovar refugees.  In 2001, following the recommendations in the report of the Interdepartmental Group on the Integration of Refugees in Ireland, the Government decided to replace the existing structures for dealing with refugees (including the Refugee Agency) with the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA), under the aegis of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.The Cultural Relations Committee (CRC) was established in 1949 under the aegis of the then Department of External Affairs, and was transferred from the Department of Foreign Affairs to the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism in 2002.  The role and function of the CRC was to advise the Minister of Foreign Affairs on the administration of the annual Grant-in-Aid voted by the Oireachtas for the development of cultural relations with other countries.

The main vehicle for such capital funding is the Arts & Culture Capital Enhancement Support Scheme (ACCESS), under which over €75 million has been granted to 107 arts and cultural facilities to date, since the scheme commenced in 2001.  This scheme has played an important part in increasing access to and participation in the arts, particularly in rural communities and the current round of the scheme will run until 2009.In addition the sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, allocates funding to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country.  A figure of €63.092 million is available in my Department's budget for 2007 to fund payments to sporting and community organisations under this programme.  When applications for funding under the 2008 Sports Capital Programme are invited through advertisements in the national newspapers it will be open to any group in the areas referred to by the Deputy to make an application should they have a project which complies with the terms of the programme.While I have no specific function in relation to the provision of youth facilities, the programmes and schemes funded by my Department provide facilities that offer ideal opportunities for that sector to capitalise.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	408	The State pension (transition) was introduced in 1970 when it was known as the retirement pension.  It was designed to bridge the gap between the standard social welfare pension age, which at that time was 70 years of age, and retirement at age 65.  Because of the purpose for which the scheme was introduced, a key qualifying condition was that a person had to be retired in order to qualify for a payment.  Retirement was defined as not engaging in insurable employment, which today means earning less than €38 per week.  The social welfare pension age was subsequently reduced in stages until it reached 66 years of age, which means that the retirement condition is now only effective for 1 year.I consider it important that those who wish to continue in employment after normal retirement age should, as far as is possible, be facilitated and supported.   Longer working can play an important role in ensuring that our pensions system is sustainable in the future and it can also be beneficial to the individual.  There are additional costs involved in removing the retirement condition but I am keeping the position under review with a view to implementing the change when resources permit.The retirement condition associated with the state pension (transition) is only one aspect of a much broader agenda which will need to be addressed if we are to create the conditions where people can continue in employment past what we now regard as normal retirement age.As the House is aware, I published the Green Paper on Pensions on 17th October and this includes an examination of all the issues surrounding retirement age, the barriers faced by older workers who wish to remain in employment and the incentives in this regard which can be considered.  A consultation process on the Green Paper is now under way and will remain open until mid 2008.  The Government will respond to the process by publishing a framework for future pensions policy and I expect that this will happen towards the end of next year.

On receipt of their response the case will be referred to an Appeals Officer for early consideration.The Social Welfare Appeals Office is an office of my Department that is independently responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	410	There is no specific scheme for proprietors of businesses that have collapsed.  Such persons may qualify for the jobseeker's allowance which is a means-tested scheme.  To qualify for a jobseeker's allowance a person must be unemployed, be under 66 years of age, be capable of and available for work and be genuinely seeking employment.There are no statistics available on the number of persons on jobseeker's payments who were formerly proprietors of businesses that had collapsed.  Self-employed persons, whose overall income is below the rate of payment appropriate to his or her family size, may qualify for a jobseeker's allowance payment while continuing to engage in self-employment.  In such circumstances the person's income from self-employment, less businesses expenses, plus any other income from savings, investments or from property will be taken into account in the means test.  There are currently some 1,800 self employed persons in receipt of jobseeker's allowance.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	411	I propose to take Questions Nos. 109 and 110 together.The Government discussion paper, "Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents," put forward proposals for services for lone parents including the expanded availability and range of education and training opportunities for lone parents; the extension of the National Employment Action Plan to focus on lone parents; focused provision of childcare; improved information services for lone parents and the introduction of a new social assistance payment for low income families with young children.  The new social assistance payment would see the ending of the concept of qualified adult within the social assistance code and the introduction of individualised payments.It would also see the qualified adults on assistance payments with children under 8 years of age would move to the new payment.  Former QAs whose youngest child reaches 8 years of age or those with no children, but of working age, and not in employment, would be eligible to apply for jobseekers allowance or another appropriate payment.  As with lone parents, facilitators will have been working with them to ensure that they have the education, training and employment supports necessary to return to work at this time.The proposals for reform in regard to QAs relate to social assistance payments only.  Social insurance payments are contributory based, with payment being made in respect of the claimant and his/her family when contributory conditions are met.  When the new proposals are introduced, I am proposing a lead-in period of up to 5 years, whereby those currently on social welfare schemes, including QAs, will be able to remain on their current scheme.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	412	Supporting and recognising carers in our society is, and has been, a priority of the Government since 1997. Over that period, weekly payment rates to carers have greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer's allowance have significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer's benefit and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.The primary objective of the carer's allowance is to provide income support to low income carers. Carer's allowance, in line with other social assistance schemes, is means tested.  This ensures scarce resources are directed at those in greatest need.The carer's allowance means test is one of the more flexible tests in terms of the assessment of household incomes.  The means test has been significantly eased over the years, most notably with regard to spouse's earnings.  Budget 2007 provided for an income disregard for a couple of €640 per week.  This ensures a couple can earn in the region of €36,000 per annum and still receive the maximum rate of carer's allowance and the associated free travel and household benefits.  This measure surpasses the Towards 2016 commitment to ensure those on average industrial earnings continue to qualify for a full carer's allowance.In addition, the rates of carer's allowance have been increased to €200 per week for those aged under 66 and to €218 per week for those aged over 66.  The introduction of a weekly payment for carers along the lines proposed would effectively represent the abolition of the means test for carers allowance and this would have substantial cost implications.  The view of some support and health organisations is that it would be much more beneficial to carers if additional resources were invested in the type of community care services which would support them in their caring role, such as additional respite care facilities, more home helps, public health nurses and other such services.People who are providing someone with full time care and attention who do not qualify for carer's allowance due to the level of their means may be eligible for the weekly carer's benefit payment, eligibility for which is based on social insurance contributions in addition to the full time care and attention condition.In June 2005, the respite care grant was extended to all people providing full time care and attention regardless of their means or social insurance contributions.  Since then, the grant has also been paid in respect of each care recipient.  Budget 2007 increased the level of the grant by €300 from €1,200 to €1,500 per year in respect of each care recipient.I will keep the supports for carers from my Department under review in order to continue to improve the schemes and ensure commitments on income support are delivered.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	413	Rent supplement is subject to a limit on the amount of rent that an applicant for rent supplement may incur.  These rent limits, provided for in Regulations and effective from January 2007 to June 2008, are set at levels that enable the different categories of eligible tenant households to secure and retain basic suitable rented accommodation, having regard to the different rental market conditions that prevail in various parts of the State.  Setting maximum rent limits higher than are justified by the open market would have a distorting effect on the rental market, leading to a more general rise in rent levels.  This in turn would worsen the affordability of rental accommodation unnecessarily, with particular negative impact for those tenants on lower incomes.Notwithstanding these limits, under existing arrangements the Health Service Executive may, in certain circumstances, exceed the rent levels as an exceptional measure, for example: where the person concerned is entitled to an income disregard and has sufficient income to meet his or her basic needs after paying rent, taking into account the appropriate rate of rent supplement that is otherwise payable in the case where there are special housing needs related to exceptional circumstances, for example, disabled persons in specially-adapted accommodation or homeless persons, where the tenant will be in a position to re-assume responsibility for his/her rent within a short period.This discretionary power ensures that individuals with particular needs can be accommodated within the scheme and specifically protects against homelessness.  The current rent limits we set following a broad consultation process and included consultation with the HSE, the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Private Residential Tenancies Board and voluntary agencies working in this area.There are currently over 58,700 rent supplements in payment of which over 23,800 have been awarded since the current rent limits were set in January 2007.  These statistics show that rented accommodation is available within the current rent limits.  All limits will be reviewed again next year.  Any revision found to be necessary will be implemented from 1st July 2008.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	414	The Bereavement Grant is a payment designed to assist families in dealing with death and funeral expenses.  It is a scheme that relates specifically to those who have made PRSI contributions and is payable on the death of an insured person, his/her spouse and dependent children under age 18 or under age 22 if in full-time education.Budget 2007 extended the bereavement grant to the next of kin of deceased recipients of disability allowance aged between 16 and 22 years.  Where there are insufficient PRSI contributions to qualify for bereavement grant a person may receive assistance under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  Under this arrangement, the HSE may make a single payment to help meet exceptional expenditure, for example, for funeral expenses, which a family could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their income.I have no plans at present to extend the scheme in the manner proposed.  However, the bereavement grant will continue to be examined in the context of the objectives of the scheme and budgetary resources.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	415	The numbers and costs of legal opinions commissioned by the Pensions Board for the specified periods are: 2005 — 28 external legal opinions; total cost €118,160.10; 2006 — 26 external legal opinions; total cost €98,355.30; 2007 to date — 18 external legal opinions; total cost €60,292.69.The Pensions Board is a statutory body established by the Pensions Act, 1990.  It regulates occupational pension schemes and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts in Ireland as part of its statutory role to monitor and supervise the operation of the Pensions Act.  The Board is responsible for regulating almost 101,000 occupational pension schemes with assets in the region of ninety billion euro and active membership of some 800,000 as at November 2007.  These figures exclude additional voluntary contribution only schemes, death benefit only schemes, frozen schemes and schemes in wind-up.The Board is also responsible for supervising the activities of 10 PRSA providers in relation to approximately one hundred and twenty thousand individual PRSA contracts, with current PRSA assets under management in excess of one billion euro.Given that pensions issues are technically complex, and that legal certainty is a requirement of the work of a regulator, it is sometimes necessary to seek an external legal opinion.  All external legal opinions commissioned by the Pensions Board are taken from a panel of six solicitor firms based on competitive tendering.

The net disposable income of the person concerned has not changed in the last number of months.  The reason the rent is in arrears is due to the non payment of rent by the person concerned.The Executive have further advised that the person concerned, has been advised by the Community Welfare Officer (CWO), to contact the local Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS), which provides assistance to people who are over-indebted and need intensive help and advice in coping with their debt problems.  The CWO has advised the person concerned to discuss the matter with MABS in order that an appropriate budgeting strategy can be implemented.Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on my behalf by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive, an exceptional needs payment (ENP) may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which the applicant is unable to meet out of his/her own resources.There is no automatic entitlement to this payment. Each application is determined by the Executive based on the particular circumstances of the case.  Eligible people would normally be in receipt of a social welfare or health service executive payment. Non payment of rent is not a case for making an exceptional needs payment.

In consultation with various parties, that Unit is currently developing a new awareness campaign which will begin its roll out early next year.  This campaign may combine local elements within the broader message.No specific funding is available from my Department to support the production of a community based drugs awareness film and, broadly speaking I would favour a coherent approach involving an overall message through the Health Promotion Unit.  Having said that, it is open to community groups to approach the relevant Local or Regional Drugs Task Force for their area in regard to any proposals they have.

The European Communities (Good Agricultural Practice for Protection of Waters) Regulations 2006 were made by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government following a comprehensive consultation period involving input from stakeholders and other interested parties and the proposals, including prohibited periods for fertiliser spreading, were specifically agreed with the European Commission as part of Ireland's Nitrates Action Programme.The prohibited periods for fertilizer application are set out in the Regulations, as are the other factors that farmers are obliged to take into account when considering fertilizer application outside of those periods.  I believe that the terms of Ireland's Action Programme are as favourable as it was possible to achieve in discussions with the European Commission, having regard to the requirements of the Nitrates Directive and the need to protect water quality.

The European Commission is mandated to negotiate these on behalf of the European Community and, through its Food and Veterinary Office (FVO), to monitor their compliance in third countries it has approved for trade with the EU.  This approval is on the basis that the Commission adjudges the third country's controls offer an equivalent level of guarantee for the protection of animal and human health to those being operated in the Community.  Where there are risks to the public or animal health in the Community from disease outbreaks occurring in approved third countries Safeguard Measures are invoked restricting or banning imports from the affected country or region until the risk has been eliminated.I have consistently pointed out at EU level that produce imported from third countries must meet standards equivalent to those required of Community producers.  In this context I have been in regular contact EU Commissioner for Health Mr. Markos Kyprianou. The Commissioner has assured me that the Commission will not hesitate to take the appropriate protection measures if a product, imported from a third country or produced in the domestic market represents a risk for the health of EC consumers, livestock or plants.

The report should be very helpful in the overall process of ensuring equivalence.  As I indicated at the time of the publication of the report my Department has requested the EU authorities to arrange for a discussion of this report at the EU Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health.A further mission to Brazil is being arranged for this month by the EU Food and Veterinary Office.  It is vital that the FVO report on their findings at the earliest possible date and that the EU Commission will take whatever action is necessary to protect the interests of EU consumers and producers.I have consistently pointed out to the Commissioner and to my colleagues in the Council of Ministers that produce imported from third countries must meet standards that are equivalent to those required of Community producers.

According to the most recent information, presented to a meeting of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health in Brussels on the 20th November, foot-and-mouth disease in Cyprus has been confirmed on the basis of serological tests in six sheep flocks and clinical signs in one flock.The test results carried out by the Community Reference Laboratory in Pirbright were positive for the O type of the virus with further refining tests continuing. The last outbreak of FMD in Cyprus was in 1964. Epidemiological investigations into the source of the disease are also continuing.All of Cyprus has been declared a "high risk zone" and no live cattle, sheep, goats or pigs, or products from these animals can be exported from the whole of Cyprus, with the exception of certain heat-treated products such as Halloumi cheese which can still be exported.  In line with EU legislation, the Cypriot authorities have culled the sheep in the affected flocks and established a 3 km protection and 10 km surveillance zone around the infected holdings. Within these zones, stringent movement restrictions apply, surveillance has been stepped up and biosecurity measures have been strengthened. An EU Commission Decision has been taken confirming the measures taken by the Cypriot authorities.  The EU Commission has also sent 2 experts from its emergency veterinary team to Cyprus to provide technical on-the-spot support.

As part of the control procedures under EU legislation governing these Schemes, the application was selected for and was the subject of a ground-eligibility and a cross-compliance inspection involving animal identification and registration, which was conducted on 23 August 2007.During the course of the cross-compliance inspection, it was found that the movement of two animals from the holding was not notified to the Cattle Movement Monitoring System (CMMS) database, which resulted in a 1% cross compliance penalty being recorded. During the course of the ground eligibility inspection, discrepancies were found with a number of parcels. Department staff returned and conducted a further eligibility inspection with Global Positioning System (GPS) surveying equipment on 25 October 2007 and as a result of this inspection the claimed area of 32.02 hectares was reduced to 30.95 hectares. The person named was informed of these findings on 7 November 2007.Where the total area found is not sufficient to support the number of entitlements held, the penalties are applied as per the Terms and Conditions of the scheme, as provided for in the governing EU regulations. In this case, as the number of entitlements held by the person named is 26.51, payment will issue in full in early December, less the 1% cross compliance penalty.If the person named is not satisfied with the result of the inspection, he may seek a review by contacting his Department Local Office; however, to date no such request has been received. He also has the right to appeal the outcome of any such review to the Agriculture Appeals Office.

Dublin.  All animals bound for rabies quarantine must enter the country at Dublin Airport and be accompanied under strict conditions to the quarantine station.  I am arranging for a review of the current arrangements.Once the EU Pet Passport system was introduced in 2004 the need for rabies quarantine in Ireland was greatly reduced as dogs and cats originating in a range of qualifying countries, including all of Europe, USA and Australia, can now enter Ireland without quarantine once they have been properly prepared.  The numbers entering quarantine thus declined substantially.  The EU system is due to be reviewed in 2008 with the possibility that travel for pets will be made even easier.  In these circumstances it is unlikely that additional quarantine facilities will be required or that the substantial investment required to upgrade kennels to quarantine standard would be justified.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	432	I believe that there are and will be major benefits for producers and consumers arising out of the on-going implementation of the reformed CAP.As part of the 2003 reforms the introduction of the full decoupling of direct payments under the Single Payment Scheme ensures that farmers now have the ‘freedom to farm' and that the CAP is geared towards the demands of the market and consumers. The Single Payment Scheme is linked to food safety, animal welfare and environmental standards.  Irish farmers receive some €1.3 billion per annum in Single Payments while consumers are guaranteed a supply of safe food, produced to high animal welfare and environmental standards, at reasonable cost.The AgriVision 2015 Action Plan which I published in March 2006 sets out my vision for a competitive, consumer-focused and knowledge driven agrifood sector which will contribute to a vibrant rural economy, society and environment and which exploits opportunities in non-food areas. In addition to a broad vision statement, the Plan sets out over one hundred and sixty specific actions to be implemented for the development of the sector.  It was drawn up in the light of the 2003 CAP reforms and the likelihood of a more liberalised trade policy under a new WTO agreement but also against the background of other changes which will impact on the sector such as lifestyle changes, the emergence of technology and research and development as market drivers and structural changes in the farming and the retail sector.My main concern, in respect of the 2003 CAP reform, is to ensure that there is a period of stability to allow farmers to implement the changes necessitated by decoupling and to adapt to the market needs in a stable policy environment.  In this connection, next week the Commission will present its communication on preparation for the Health Check of the CAP to EU Agriculture Ministers and I note the assurances given by Commissioner Fischer Boel that further major policy changes are not contemplated at this stage.It is in this context also that the ongoing WTO negotiations represent a significant challenge. The outcome of the negotiations will determine the levels of protection and support that the EU may provide for the duration of the next agreement.My overriding objective in the ongoing negotiations is to ensure that the terms of the agreement can be accommodated within the framework of the reformed CAP. This represents the limit of the EU Commission's negotiating mandate in these negotiations and I will continue to insist that this mandate is respected.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	433	I appreciate the concern at the current problems in the pig sector and I will continue to pursue appropriate solutions. At both EU and national level, measures are being taken to alleviate the difficulties.The EU Council of Agriculture Ministers has, in response to the pressures on the international cereal and feed markets, agreed to suspend the obligation to set 10% of arable land aside.  This will ensure that more arable land is available for cereal cultivation in 2008.A scheme of financial assistance for the private storage of pigmeat has been in place since 29 October 2007.  This was adopted by the European Commission in response to a request from me and some other Member States. I have also impressed on the Commission the desirability of export refunds for fresh and frozen pigmeat and this will be kept under consideration. Within the framework of the EU common agricultural policy, I will continue to ensure that pig producers' problems are highlighted with a view to suitable action.At national level, pigmeat features prominently in Bord Bia's programme of promotion on the home and export markets. I have asked the Bord to intensify its autumn pork and bacon promotion campaign in order to ensure that the market remains firm over the coming months. Additional funding is being made available for this. The Bord Bia quality assurance schemes are also a good tool in maintaining consumer confidence and, in this context, the pigmeat scheme is well established and managed.I am working with the Minister for Health and Children towards the introduction of legislation to provide better information to consumers on the origin of pigmeat and other meats.  The public consultation on the proposed regulations has been completed and the comments received will now be examined. Following that, the European Commission's approval of the legislation will be sought.Other relevant support actions include the extension of the farm waste management scheme to the pig sector and my Department's programme of financial assistance for the transition to welfare-friendly sow-housing.

The potential of different tree species to sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere depends mainly on their rate of growth.  Some conifer species grow rapidly and will begin to sequester considerable amounts of carbon early in their life.  Other species, including some broadleaves, grow more slowly and do not sequester the same level of carbon until later in their life.  Generally, as trees reach maturity, there is little difference in the total amount of carbon dioxide sequestered, when all species are compared.

This three-year plan will guide our medium term activities to enhance the capability of the sector, and will be implemented and reviewed in the shorter term through our annual business planning processes.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	436	The Irish rendering industry produced 152,000 tonnes of meat and bone-meal (MBM) in 2006.The use or disposal of this material is strictly controlled under Regulation (EC) No. 1774 of 2002. No MBM is currently being imported.The bulk of MBM produced continues to be disposed of by way of export for incineration. Approximately 127,000 tonnes was exported during 2006.Of the remainder, approximately 5,000 tonnes was co-incinerated in the manufacture of cement in this country in 2006; 19,000 tonnes was put into storage for future use or disposal; and 1,400 tonnes was used in the manufacture of petfood.My policy is to encourage alternative uses of MBM in Ireland and I am aware of proposals to use MBM in the production of fertilizer and also in the generation of electricity. There is a growing interest in using biomass including MBM as a carbon neutral co-fuel in peat-burning electricity plants. Promoting the increased use of MBM in peat stations would deliver financial benefits for the industries involved, reduce disposal costs and represent a significant bioenergy contribution from agriculture. In the recent ‘National Bioenergy Action Plan' the Government has targeted 30% co-firing in peat stations by 2015.

In the short-term, the soaring world demand for grain is likely to lead to an increase in the area devoted to conventional cereal crops in Ireland and elsewhere in response to the current high grain prices.  More long-term projections are difficult to forecast at this stage.  Much will depend on the rate of development of production and consumption patterns for biofuels over the next number of years.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	438	There can be any number of causes for over fishing, but most are either directly or indirectly a result the over capacity of the Irish and European fleet as a whole.  With fish stocks declining, leading to reduced quotas, a significant imbalance exists between the available fish resources and the catching capacity of the fleets.  Essentially current quota allocations are below economic viability levels if the current capacity levels remain.  Such over fishing means that the quantity of fish caught and removed from the stock biomass exceeds the levels that can be fished sustainably.  The reduced stock size in future year's leads to reduced quotas.  This has been recognised at both European and national level and decommissioning schemes have been introduced in many Member States to take capacity out of the fleets.In Ireland, the national strategy for the seafood industry as set down in Steering a New Course — strategy for a restructured, sustainable and profitable Irish seafood industry 2007-13, recommends the removal of up to 35% of capacity of the polyvalent and beam trawl segments of fleet (18 metres and over).  This is additional to the capacity removed in 2005/06 under the national scheme in place at that time.  It also recommends that a comprehensive analysis be carried out to determine the eligibility, urgency, scope and cost of a scheme for the whitefish under 18 metres fleet.  In relation to the large vessels in the Refrigerated Sea Water segment of the fleet, the strategy recommends that an industry led restructuring of this fleet be carried out.  I am currently finalising details of the planned decommissioning scheme for the over 18 metres vessels in the polyvalent and beam trawl segments, which I hope to launch shortly.

The 2006 landings of 267,817* tonnes are 11% below the 1997 landings.  This reduction in total landings is primarily driven by decline in landings of the main small pelagic species: horse mackerel, mackerel and herring.  The decline in landings for those species is due to reduced abundance, increasing conservation requirements and commensurate reductions in the European Commission Total Allowable Catches available to Ireland.Over a similar period the total EU landings also show a declining trend. The total EU landings in 2005 (the latest year for which the data is available) were 4.1 million tonnes**, which is 23% below the 1996 landings.YearLandings (Tonnes)1997299,9721998335,3531999300,4832000309,2112001314,6052002277,9112003293,1792004315,3792005287,0722006267,817% change-11 %*This represents all landings of Irish vessels world wide.**This represents landings of EU vessels in the North-east Atlantic (FAO Area 27).

The Single Payment Scheme is linked to food safety, animal welfare and environmental standards, and consumers are guaranteed a supply of safe food, produced to high animal welfare and environmental standards, at reasonable cost.Irish exports of agri-food products have grown steadily in recent years to reach record levels of over €8bn in 2006.  These exports are now increasingly concentrated in the high-value EU market.  For the future, the question of food security may indeed be an issue.  However, it is worth noting that the EU is by far the largest player on the world market and while imports of certain commodities into the Community may have increased, Ireland will remain a significant net exporter.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	441	The Minister for Health & Children has overall responsibility for the general food labelling legislation.  Responsibility for enforcement of labelling legislation rests with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) through its service contracts with my Department, the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, the Health Services Executive, the Local Authorities and the National Consumer Agency.  Breaches of food labelling legislation should be reported to the FSAI.EU beef labelling legislation requiring country of origin labelling of beef has been in place since September 2000.  As this legislation did not cover beef sold by the catering trade I collaborated with the Minister for Health & Children to have national legislation enacted to require that all beef sold or served in the retail or catering sector is now required to carry an indication of the country of origin.  This legislation is enforced by the FSAI.Regarding the labelling of poultry meat, there are EU Regulations which provide for the labelling of unprocessed poultry meat at retail level.  The Regulations require such poultry meat to be labelled with the information regarding class, price, condition, registered number of slaughterhouse or cutting plant and, where imported from a Third Country, an indication of country of origin.In relation to other meats I have signalled my intention to have legislation brought forward to require the country of origin to be shown on poultry meat, pigmeat and sheepmeat sold in the retail and catering sectors.  A draft of such regulations was prepared by my Department and is currently being finalised by the Department of Health & Children.  A public consultation process has taken place.  Following consideration of any views received it will be necessary to submit the draft regulations to the European Commission for approval.There is also the issue where a primary product can enter Ireland and processed in some way thereby allowing it to be branded as an Irish product is known as "substantial transformation".  This terminology originates in WTO, Codex and EU legislation governing the EU Customs Code and therefore can only be amended at EU level.  I have been concerned that this arrangement could, in certain circumstances, be used to mislead the consumers as to the origin of the raw materials used in certain products.  I am not satisfied with the current legal position and have raised my concerns at EU Council level.The EU Commission is currently reviewing the whole area of food labelling and in that context my Department contributed to Ireland's submission which was co-ordinated by the Department of Health & Children.  Within this submission Ireland again raised the matter of the unsatisfactory nature of the concept of substantial transformation and the possibility of it being used to disguise the origin of products from the public.  I believe that the concept of substantial transformation needs to be more clearly defined and I will continue to urge the Commission to address this problem.  In that same submission we also explained why we felt that origin labelling should be compulsory for all meat.  As well as direct contact with the Commission on this I have also raised this matter in the Agriculture Council and I will continue to press for progress as I believe consumers are entitled to full information on the origin of food products.

The European Commission is mandated to negotiate these on behalf of the European Community and, through its Food and Veterinary Office (FVO), to monitor their compliance in  third countries it has approved for trade with the EU. This approval is on the basis that the Commission adjudges the third country's controls offer an equivalent level of guarantee for the protection of animal and human health to those being operated in the Community. Where there are risks to the public or animal health in the Community from disease outbreaks occurring in approved third countries Safeguard Measures are invoked restricting or banning imports from the affected country or region until the risk has been eliminated.On direct import into the EU all consignments of animal products must undergo documentary, identity and physical checks in accordance with EU rules at an EU approved Border Inspection Post. These checks confirm that the products have been sourced from a third country approved  to export these products to the EU and come from an approved establishment in that country, that they are appropriately labelled , packaged and have been health certified in accordance with EU requirements by the competent authorities of the exporting country. On release from a BIP each consignment must travel under a Common Veterinary Entry Document (CVED), including information on the identity and origin of the consignment, to a Food Business Operator who, under EU Hygiene of Food Regulations, is authorized to place the animal products on the market for human consumption. These regulations also provide that the identity of the Food Business Operator placing the products on the market appear on a label in order to guarantee food safety and for the purpose of traceability in the protection of animal and public health.

The purpose of the programme is to enable highly qualified American students to attend third level institutions in Ireland for post graduate studiesThe George Mitchell Scholarship Fund Act was enacted in December 1998 and it empowered the Minister for Education and Science to establish the fund in the United States and enter into agreement with persons to manage and control the fund.The agreement for the management of the fund was signed with the US-Ireland Alliance in March 1999. The income from the Fund provides for the establishment and administration of the Programme as well as two scholarships per annum. The US-Ireland Alliance also secures additional funding from other sources which enables the programme to expand the number of scholarships offered annually.

This is the first phase of investment under the Government's National Development Plan which will involve over €4.5 billion being invested in school buildings over the next 7 years. This year alone will see construction work that will ultimately deliver over 17,500 school places.My Department closely monitors the flow of projects on a regular basis in order to match with the flow of funding under the National Development Plan. While my Department has a devolved approach to delivery at local school level, there is still regular contact with many of these schools about the timing of when projects can proceed. The priority is to ensure that funding is targeted, in the first instance, at those projects in the rapidly developing areas that deliver most in terms of additional school places.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	449	The National Educational Welfare Board is developing a nationwide service on a continuing basis that is accessible to schools, parents/guardians and others concerned with the welfare of young people.  For this purpose, Educational Welfare Officers (EWOs) have been deployed throughout the country to provide a welfare-focused service to support regular school attendance and discharge the Board's functions locally operating through 5 regional teams, with bases in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford.  A service is provided from 26 locations nationwide.  Staff are deployed in areas of greatest disadvantage and in areas designated under the Government's RAPID programme.  In addition, the Board follows up on urgent cases nationally where children are not currently receiving an education.Educational Welfare Officers play a pivotal role in implementing the service provided by the NEWB through monitoring school attendance and working to improve it.  The EWOs also help parents that are experiencing a difficulty with getting a school place for their child.  The NEWB has advised that the matter for additional resources for all areas is kept under continuous review.  Areas are prioritized for additional service based on a combined analysis of demographic data, absence data reported from schools and other indicators of disadvantage.An additional 15 staff have been allocated to the NEWB in 2007.  These additional staff are being recruited at present.  This brings the current authorised staffing of the Board to 109 posts of which 90 are allocated to working directly in the service delivery area.  The staffing complement is comprised of 19 HQ and support staff, 5 regional managers, 13 Senior EWO's and 72 EWO's.This government is determined to do all that is possible to ensure that every child gets all the opportunities and support they need to enable them to achieve their potential and participate fully in education.  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that my Department's Estimates for 2007 includes a provision of €9.808 million for the National Educational Welfare Board.  This represents an increase of 20% on the 2006 allocation and of 50% on the 2004 level.  This substantial increase in funding is a clear indication of this Government's commitment to prioritise investment in favour of those most at risk.  Through increased investment and improved services we are determined to optimise access, participation and educational outcomes at every level of the system for disadvantaged groups.In respect of the Deputy's specific question relating to Co. Wexford, I am informed by the Board that the county currently has the services of one Senior Educational Welfare Officer and one Welfare Officer.  It is however the Board's intention to deploy another Welfare Officer in Co. Wexford when the additional 15 staff, referred to earlier,have been appointed.I will be keeping the issue of the NEWB's staffing under review in light of the rollout of services, the scope for integrated working and any proposals that the Board may put to me in relation to clearly identified priority needs.

Since then, 38 pilot projects have been established, with an additional 2 projects due to come on stream before the end of 2007. The service caters for any adult who is considering or participating in VTOS, literacy, BTEI and community education programmes. From 2006, the service has been available to survivors of residential abuse and their families.The projects are administered locally by Vocational Educational Committees in the main. Appointments to the position of Adult Education Guidance Counsellor and Adult Education Guidance Coordinator are made by the VECs or other local sponsors of the guidance projects.Where an adult guidance service involves the management of staff, the promotion of outreach, the supervision of quality standards, the evaluation of the service, and guidance and counselling, this role is that of an Adult Education Guidance Coordinator. In cases where the guidance counselling function is operated without such supervision and management duties, the person in question is employed as an Adult Education Guidance Counsellor.Currently there are 61 Adult Education Guidance Counsellors, of whom 40 are Coordinators, employed in the service. An additional 12 Guidance Counsellors will be employed in 2007 as part of an expansion of the service.

In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.The dependants of the aforementioned, who have been legally resident in the State for over five years may also apply for long term residency. This particular long term permission does not grant an exemption from employment permit requirements to any such dependants.  Time spent in the State on student conditions cannot be counted towards long term residency. While applications for long term residency are under consideration, the person concerned should ensure that their permission to remain in the State is kept up to date.An application for long term residency from the person referred to by the Deputy was received in January 2007. I understand that applications received in July 2006 are currently being dealt with. As soon as a decision is made on the case, the person concerned will be notified.

The maximum duration for which an Immigration Officer will permit the holder of a ‘C' visit visa to remain in the State is 90 days. A ‘C' multi entry visa also permits the holder to seek entry to the State up to a maximum of 90 days on each visit to the State.A wrap-around information sheet accompanies every visa application form. That sheet makes it clear to the applicant that, in general, persons granted visas for particular purposes are not permitted to remain in the State for any purpose other than that for which the visa was granted.  It is not the general policy to extend permission to remain to persons who are admitted initially for a period of 90 days or less on a ‘C' multi entry visa, save in very exceptional and unforeseen circumstances.The legal representative of the person concerned has indicated that she is due to leave the State on 9 December, 2007 to return to Thailand to marry her Irish fiancé . The Immigration Division of my Department has recently advised the legal representative that it is open to the person concerned to attend her local Immigration Office when she returns to the State to seek residency based on her marriage to an Irish national, once the marriage has taken place.

He or she is also required to declare that the information supplied is correct and complete.A ‘C' visa is granted for visits of less than 90 days. As a consequence it is not the general policy to extend permission to remain to persons who are admitted initially for a period of 90 days or less on a ‘C' visa, save in very exceptional and unforeseen circumstances.Documents submitted by the persons concerned in support of their visa application indicated that they would observe the conditions of their visa, would not become a burden on the State and that they would leave the State on the expiration of their permission to remain.The persons concerned must leave and reapply from outside the State should they wish to return.

She was notified by letter dated 20 September, 2004, that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of her and her children in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended.  Representations were received on her behalf.  The person in question applied for and was granted permission to remain in the State on the basis of being a parent of an Irish citizen child, born before 1 January 2005, in accordance with the revised arrangements announced by my predecessor on 15 January 2005, commonly referred to as the IBC/05 scheme.  This permission to remain has been renewed, the current renewal being valid until 2 November, 2010.

This income is supplemented by an annual contribution from the Exchequer into the Fund.  The Fund provides very significant funding to local authorities through general purpose grants and non-national road grants.  Grants from the Fund take account of the needs of each local authority and the income available to each authority from other sources.  The formal transfer, from my Department to the Department of Transport, of responsibility for the allocation of non-national road grants from the Fund to local authorities will be effected shortly.

General purpose grants from the Local Government Fund are my Department's contribution to local authorities towards the cost of providing their day to day services.  The general purpose grant allocation to Fingal County Council for 2007 amounted to some €32 million, which is an increase of 6.3% over its 2006 allocation and an increase of 75% over its 1997 allocation.  I consider that the general purpose allocation notified to Fingal County Council for 2007, together with income available to it from other sources, will enable it to provide an acceptable level of services for customers across its range of services.
