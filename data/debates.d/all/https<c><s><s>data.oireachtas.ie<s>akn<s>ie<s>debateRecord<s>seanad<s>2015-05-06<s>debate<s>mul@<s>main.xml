          <p eId="para_1">I have notice from Senator Marie Moloney that, on the motion for the Commencement of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2">The need for the Minster of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works to outline whether he would consider changing the tendering procurement process to allow for funding by region only to ensure jobs are kept in regional areas in light of the emphasis being put on the Action Plan for Jobs in regional areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_3"> I have also received notice from Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4">An gá go ndéanfaidh an tAire Comhshaoil, Pobail agus Rialtais Áitiúil soiléiriú a thabhairt maidir le líon na n-iarratas ar cheadúnais bainte feamainne atá le cinneadh ag a Roinn faoi láthair agus cathain a mheasann an Roinn a dhéanfar cinntí ar na hiarratais atá ar feitheamh.</p>
          <p eId="para_5"> I have also received notice from Senator Colm Burke of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6">The need for the Minister for Health and the HSE to outline details of the financial contribution made by fair deal recipients from their pensions to the overall cost of their nursing home care and the percentage of the total cost that this comprises.</p>
          <p eId="para_7"> I regard the matters raised by Senators Moloney and Ó Clochartaigh as suitable for discussion and they will be taken now. I regret that I have had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Burke on the grounds that it is a repeat of a similar Commencement matter raised on 30 April 2015.</p>

            <p eId="para_12">I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to take this matter. In anticipation of his answer, I know what he is going to say about cost savings in the public sector and note that I appreciate the need for that. Surely, however, it should not be at the expense of the small local operator. The procurement and tendering process has squeezed the lifeblood out of small operators in local areas. The contracts they had for Government and State agency buildings were their lifeblood. I refer also to caterers and suppliers to the HSE of foods, etc., stationery and office supplies to local authorities, and cleaning contractors to Garda stations and Government buildings. All of those people are suffering and the life is being squeezed out of them by the big operators with whom they cannot hope to compete. The big operators can buy all their supplies in bulk, reduce their costs and tender lower.</p>
            <p eId="para_13"> In line with the regional dimension to the Action Plan for Jobs, our aim is to keep jobs and create them in regional areas. This is an area where we are killing jobs in the regions. They have no hope. I have one man who employed 25 people. He lost a contract to clean a Government building and had to let ten of his 25 staff go. The Minister of State will probably say the new contractors will take people on, but they are taking them on at a different cost. They are paying them lower wages. I know for a fact that some people cleaning Government buildings - we are standing over this - are not paid bank holiday rates. Local contractors were available at short notice to the organisations and buildings involved and could come in if there was a flood or something else happened. They were there on the spot to deal with these things.</p>
            <p eId="para_14"> While we are claiming to make savings in the public sector by doing this, it must be asked if this is true in the longer term given that people who are let go from their jobs must claim social welfare payments. The revenue was circulating locally whereas the contractors doing jobs in the Kerry area, for example, who got the contracts through the tendering process are in Dublin. Once again, the revenue will be circulating in Dublin inside the Red Cow roundabout.</p>
            <p eId="para_15"> I ask that we look at this and instead tender by region. We should keep the tendering process within the regions thereby maintaining regional jobs. I understand that we must make savings. I am not naive. However, we should not squeeze the life out of the small operators in our local areas. I await the Minister of State's reply.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#SimonHarris" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Finance" eId="spk_7">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Deputy Simon Harris)<recordedTime time="2015-05-06T14:35:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_16">I thank Senator Marie Moloney for raising this matter. It is timely to do so as we have put in place a new structure, the Office of Government Procurement, for which I have responsibility at ministerial level. While 2014 was the year of the establishment of the office, 2015 and 2016 will be about ensuring that we have the structures right and that we put as many measures as possible in place to help SMEs. Any thoughts the Senator has in that regard - she has raised some today - will be given serious consideration. We may be able to consider that in a moment.</p>
            <p eId="para_17">On the basis of this research, the sourcing team will have a full evidence-based understanding of the market. This will allow them to make an informed decision about how to go to market and the sourcing strategy, in such a way as to deliver the optimum balance between value for money and risk.</p>
            <p eId="para_18"> I would be the first to admit that we need to do more. We are actively trying to pursue more measures to help SMEs. It is not all about value for money, although it is absolutely about value for money for the taxpayer, but not just at a headline rate. We need our SMEs to be involved. We have put a range of measures in place and I look forward to building upon them. </p>
          </speech>
          <summary eId="sum_4">The main purpose of the EU public procurement regime is to open up the market and to ensure the free movement of supplies, services and works within the EU having regard to Treaty of Rome principles including transparency, proportionality and equal treatment. This is the rationale that shapes the detailed rules set out in the EU directives governing the regime. It would be a breach of the EU rules for a public body to favour or discriminate against particular candidates on grounds such as nationality, geographic location or organisational size, and there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules.</summary>
          <summary eId="sum_5"> The new model for procurement was approved by the Government in September 2012 and envisages common goods and services such as utilities, professional services and marketing, print and stationery being procured by a new central sourcing organisation, in this case the Office of Government Procurement, with sectoral specific goods and services and minor works being sourced through the sectors health, education, local government and defence. The aim of the reform is to deliver overall reductions in the cost of goods and services, better procurement services, introduction of technical standardisation, greater levels of professionalism among staff responsible for procurement and increased performance management of the central procurement function.</summary>
          <summary eId="sum_6"> Taxpayers demand that Government secures value for money in all of its spend. The fragmented procurement arrangements across the public service have enabled suppliers to charge different public service bodies different prices for the same goods and services. This is not sustainable as the State cannot afford to continue to purchase works, goods and services in a manner that undermines the level of services it can deliver. Reforms are being carried out in a manner that recognises the clear importance of small and medium-sized enterprises in this country's economic recovery. </summary>
          <summary eId="sum_7"> We have to be transparent and equitable in our treatment of all suppliers. We spend approximately €8 billion per year on public procurement, some €23 million per day. If we are serious about economic recovery we need our SMEs to get involved and to have an equal chance in procuring and that is why I am not closing any doors in terms of measures we can put in place to help our SMEs. A couple of weeks ago there was a very useful Private Members' debate in this House when I accepted an Opposition Bill on social clauses. Nobody has a monopoly on good ideas and I am always eager to hear them.</summary>
          <summary eId="sum_8"> The guidance to contracting authorities contained within circular 10/14, which we put in place to help SMEs participate and which was launched by my Department in April 2014, encourages those bodies to break large contracts down into lots where reasonable to do so. This enables smaller businesses to compete for these smaller elements of a larger contract. This has to be done in a way, however, that does not expose the State to undue risk or significant management overheads. The OGP appreciates that, as it centralises more, there is always the risk that people feel crowded out. The OGP, therefore, is working with bodies like Enterprise Ireland and InterTrade Ireland to help educate suppliers around building consortia in order that smaller businesses may come together and win larger offerings that the State may put to the marketplace.</summary>
          <summary eId="sum_9"> Aggregation arrangements can be implemented in a manner that achieves value for money with a minimal impact on SMEs. The greater use, where appropriate, of multi-supplier frameworks can address local supplier issues while also ensuring the ongoing cost competitiveness of the framework itself. Such multi-supplier frameworks may also offer SMEs the opportunity to participate in national level contracts, thereby offering valuable reference work when competing for public procurement contracts in other jurisdictions. Although changing the tendering procurement process to funding by region only is not allowed under the EU public procurement regime the sourcing strategies developed by the OGP sourcing teams will be based on a full understanding of the supply market in question and the impacts that any new supply arrangements may have. That is where we may be able to progress the concerns made by the Senator.</summary>
          <summary eId="sum_10"> The OGP sourcing teams are made up of procurement professionals specialising in a spend category supported by customer representatives appointed by category councils. Before the OGP sourcing teams decide how they will go to the market for goods or services they will carry out a full supply market assessment. This will include consideration of three main elements: current supply arrangements, supply market competition and, crucially, direct consultation with suppliers. In evaluating current supply arrangements the sourcing teams will consider items such as customer and stakeholder requirements, supplier types, who the suppliers are, regional supply structures and arrangements, a supplier's share of public sector bodies' business, suppliers' locations, structures and sizes, and scope and length of contracts.</summary>
          <summary eId="sum_11"> In evaluating supply market competition the sourcing teams will consider items such as level of competition in the local and regional supply market, existence of barriers to entry, potential for substitute goods and services or new innovations, supply chain risks and issues, other customers buying the same items and PESTEL, which stands for political, economic, social, technological, environmental and legal trend analysis, so as to gain an understanding of opportunities and threats that might exist to competition.</summary>
          <summary eId="sum_12"> Direct consultation with suppliers is also a key means through which the sourcing teams may gain market insight through the issue of requests for information sent to all suppliers in a given category registered on e-Tenders, and through bidders' briefing sessions and-or consultation with trade and industry representative bodies.</summary>

            <p eId="para_20">Yes and I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive answer. I was delighted to hear him say that it was not all about value for money. Sometimes people can tender lower, but they do not do a better job. We had proof of that in my locality where a person tendered for a local sewerage scheme, but half way through he found he could not do it. They took my parish out of the scheme. We discovered later that he had made a terrible mess of another job, yet he still got the job because his was the lowest tender. Therefore, the lowest tender is not always the best.</p>
            <p eId="para_21"> I have been informed that while two people were working on some jobs in a local government building, that number has now been reduced to one. Yet they are trying to get the same work done in the same time, so corners are obviously being cut.</p>
            <p eId="para_22"> I thank the Minister of State for his reply which I will circulate to the local people who raised the issue with me. Hopefully we can come to some arrangement to ensure that jobs are kept in the locality.</p>

            <p eId="para_23">I again thank Senator Moloney for raising this important matter. When discussing the issue with local suppliers, she and other public representatives should bring to their attention a number of new measures we have put in place to try to help SMEs. For example, we are currently considering social clauses whereby unemployment and disadvantaged areas can be factored into decisions. We will shortly have progress in that regard, as the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, established a working group on that last year.</p>
            <p eId="para_24"> In addition, we have put in place "meet the buyer" events providing opportunities for SMEs to meet the big public sector buyers face to face. They can thereby have human conversations, rather than just talking to a machine.</p>
            <p eId="para_25"> InterTradeIreland is working on a cross-Border basis to provide supports and even grants for upskilling SMEs. I recently launched a new tender advisory service, which guarantees SMEs a quick turnaround answer to a query within a certain number of working days. Crucially, local enterprise offices have all been given training on procurements. The LEOs are the interface for all our businesses with the State and I want to see them playing a greater role. I look forward to LEOs holding many training and information days for SMEs in various communities. I would be interested in trying to bring one to the Senator's county in due course.</p>

            <p eId="para_32">Cuirim céad fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit. Táim an-sásta gur eisean atá tagtha isteach leis an cheist seo a phlé mar tuigim gur eisean atá ag plé léi go díreach.</p>
            <p eId="para_33"> I am happy that the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, is dealing with this Commencement Matter because I know this is his direct area of responsibility. We have discussed this issue previously and it would be good to get an update on it. The Minister of State will be aware of the background situation. In recent years, there has been much discussion about harvesting seaweed along our coasts. In a previous scenario, a State-owned seaweed company called Arramara Teoranta was under the auspices of Údarás na Gaeltachta. In recent months, however, that company has been sold off to a private company. That is fine in one sense, but there are concerns within the industry over how the resource itself will be managed in future.</p>
            <p eId="para_34"> About a year ago, I attended a meeting with the then Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, on the seaweed licensing regime. Concerns were raised and we met with departmental officials who told us that a number of outstanding licence applications were pending. I am not sure if any of those have been granted or turned down in the meantime. Since then, there have been quite a number of applications for licences.</p>
            <p eId="para_35">I seek clarification through this mechanism on the number of applications that are with the Department. In fairness to the officials, I know that they work very well with those making applications to make sure all of the information is available and that the t's are crossed and the i's dotted before an application is formalised and posted on the Department's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_36"> On the number of outstanding applications to be adjudicated on, I appreciate that the Department has a mechanism whereby a vetting committee goes through applications, following which there is a final sign-off by the Minister. The Minister of State might be able to enlighten us on the number of applications outstanding and the timescale envisaged for the processing of applications, be it positive or negative.</p>
            <p eId="para_37"> There are concerns about some of the applications being submitted in that there may be blanket applications covering a broad spread of the coastline but along the west coast, in particular. I have been a proponent from day one of the idea that the licensing regime should recognise the rights of those who have been cutting seaweed for a very long time. I have also proposed that these seaweed cutters come together to form a co-operative or to work with a not for profit organisation in applying for licences. I understand a number of such applications have been or are in the process of being submitted.</p>
            <p eId="para_38"> This is still a live issue along the west coast. I am sure the Minister of State is very aware of it, but it appears we have not had much action on it on the part of the Department in the recent past in the issuing of licences. I ask him to outline where we stand on it.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Paudie Coffey)<recordedTime time="2015-05-06T14:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_39">I thank the Senator for raising this issue which I know he has raised previously. I am happy to provide clarification on some of the queries raised by him.</p>
            <p eId="para_40"> My Department plays a role in regulating the harvesting of wild seaweed. It is necessary to ensure this valuable resource is managed appropriately both to ensure it remains sustainable and that the marine environment is protected.</p>
            <p eId="para_41"> There are 13 applications for licences to harvest seaweed before my Department under section 3 of the Foreshore Act 1933. Foreshore applications, including those for seaweed harvesting, are dealt with in accordance with a scheme of prioritisation and the scale of applications varies considerably. Even within the category of seaweed harvesting the applications are quite varied, being made by both individual and commercial harvesters. The applications in hand range from very small scale harvesting of niche species to large-scale commercial harvesting.</p>
            <p eId="para_42"> The applications are at different stages of processing. Some were received very recently and are undergoing preliminary review, while others are at a more advanced stage. Within this overall context, it is not possible to give an accurate indication of when determinations will be made on the outstanding applications. However, I can assure the Senator that all applications are being progressed and will be finalised as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_43"> Each application is being assessed in the context of the relevant regulatory framework, including the obligations that arise under the European Union birds and habitats legislation. The process includes a public consultation process and any person can make his or her views known to my Department during the public consultation stage of each application. I urge anyone with an interest to make his or her views known as part of the public consultation processes. All applications, once deemed complete by my Department, will be available to view on the Department's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_44"> I am sure the Senator will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment directly on any specific application that will ultimately come before me for determination. My Department is examining the implications of legal advice received from the Attorney General's office on the interaction of appurtenant rights with the Foreshore Act and the European Communities (Birds and Habitats) Regulations 2011. It is also engaging with the Property Registration Authority to establish the extent of appurtenant or folio rights to harvest seaweed that may apply. I assure the Senator and the House that any established right in law will not be interfered with by my Department if the applications in hand are ultimately approved.</p>
            <p eId="para_45"> As I have stated previously, the specific issue of licensing wild seaweed harvesting is under review in the context of the forthcoming maritime area and foreshore (amendment) Bill and the advice of the Attorney General's office. Pending publication and enactment of the Bill, my Department will continue to process applications under the provisions of the current Foreshore Act.</p>

            <p eId="para_46">I welcome the detail provided in the response, which is to the point. The main aspect is that the Minister has received legal advice from the Attorney General's office on the appurtenant rights. That was the outstanding issue being raised.</p>
            <p eId="para_47">Will the Minister of State indicate the timescale for the Department taking the advice on board and coming to a position on folios and the appurtenant rights in the harvesting of seaweed?</p>

            <p eId="para_48">The Department will take account of any established legal right as part of the applications process. As required, we have taken advice from the Attorney General's office. Folios on all parcels of land within one mile of the part of the foreshore that is the subject of a licence application must be identified. A folio must be examined to ascertain whether it contains an entry showing a right to take seaweed from that part of the foreshore. The process is ongoing and the Department is working with the Property Registration Authority. The process is time consuming and expected to take several months more to complete, but I assure the Senator that people's rights will not be interfered with by my Department if the applications in hand are approved.</p>

          <p eId="para_50">I acknowledge the good debate we had yesterday evening on Seanad reform and the work done by the group headed by Dr. Maurice Manning. I hope that some of the group's recommendations will see the light of day and that we will have an opportunity to discuss proposals in detail as they are brought forward. I also acknowledge the Leader's efforts to facilitate debates on a variety of topics, which reflect well on the Seanad.</p>
          <p eId="para_51"> Today the Cabinet discussed the issue of Irish Water and the additional powers for the collection of moneys owed to a utility company. This takes us down a dangerous road. It is one thing to give those powers to a State agency such as the Revenue Commissioners but it is an entirely different matter to give them to a utility company, albeit a semi-State body, which could ultimately be privatised. This proposal undermines the role of the State and gives alarming powers to an agency that lacks democratic accountability.</p>
          <p eId="para_52"> This evening's debate on the Spring Economic Statement will be useful but we need a wider debate on the issues arising. I ask the Leader to provide an opportunity for the House to reflect on a vision for Ireland over the next ten years. This would include where we go as a country, how we spend any money saved from the economic recovery and how we deal with public and private debt. Households throughout the country are dealing with the alarming consequences of private debt. Even individuals who are not in negative equity are finding it difficult to manage other types of debt.</p>
          <p eId="para_53">We are in a country which is coming out of an austerity programme but a large proportion of the population are not sharing the fruits of economic recovery. It is being felt here in Dublin but it not being felt across the rest of the country. Job creation is not being appreciated or seen in many parts of our country. Towns are on their knees and shops are continuing to close in rural areas. We have to define a vision for Ireland and the Seanad could play a role in that. I ask the Leader to reflect on it and perhaps over the coming weeks to have a day long debate on that particular issue. It would be an open ended debate with each Member being given at least 20 minutes to make a contribution which the Government would find informative and which would play a part in defining the Seanad and its role. It is a new recourse but it is one that should be used. </p>
          <p eId="para_54"> I apologise for going on, but tomorrow's election in the North and in Britain is a defining election and it will have massive implications for this State. I ask the Leader to facilitate a debate in the coming weeks on the outcome of that election, when a new Government is formed, given its implications for the European project and North-South relations. </p>

          <p eId="para_55">I also commend the Leader on organising the debate last night in the House on Seanad reform. It was an excellent debate and one in which so many people wanted to participate resulting in us having to extend the time by 15 or 20 minutes. What came out of the debate was a desire to look into and scrutinise in more detail the legislation that Dr. Manning, Mr. Joe O'Toole, Mr. Pat Magner and their committee are preparing and which they announced yesterday they were publishing. This is the detailed legislation to give effect to the recommendations of their working group on Seanad reform. I would very much like to have the opportunity in early course to debate the Bill, once we have all seen a copy of it. I am sure the Leader will facilitate that further debate. The big concern we all had, as Senator Cummins put it so eloquently, was that we want this to be the last report on Seanad reform. We want to see its recommendations acted upon and given effect. I would therefore like us to have that debate in the coming weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_56"> I also welcome the debate tonight on the spring economic statement. That sort of openended debate is important. </p>
          <p eId="para_57"> I want to ask the Leader for a debate on the report that has come out today on the projections for obesity levels in Ireland. Quite a number of colleagues have spoken eloquently on this issue for some time now, but this report sets out starkly the projected rise in obesity levels in Ireland. There are some very troubling figures, particularly when we compare Irish projections to the projections of other European countries. The Netherlands is a leader in terms of reducing levels of obesity among current generations and is projected to reduce them in the future. There are some very clear issues on which focus is required at a legislative and policy making level. These include exercise levels, physical education for school children and teenagers, access to junk food and easy access to food with high levels of sugar, fats and salt. We have already done good work in the Seanad, in the public consultation committee, on lifestyle factors and their effect on cancer prevention. We should also have a debate in early course on this particular report and on what can be done to tackle obesity and, in particular, to prevent this dreadful rise that is projected to happen among our children. </p>
          <p eId="para_58"> I ask the Leader for another debate on commemorations in the coming months. We have had some debates on this already but it would be useful to have another debate, perhaps in the early part of the autumn, as we see the Government's programme for commemorations for 2016 taking shape. I am minded to ask for the debate in light of yesterday's moving and poignant ecumenical service in memory of the children killed during the Rising. It seems no one is quite sure how many children were killed during the week of the Easter Rising in 1916 but, thanks to the work of Joe Duffy and others, we know that it was approximately 40 children. These children had been largely written out of history. No photographs remain of them. It was moving to see the remembrance service for them yesterday, which the President and Sabina Higgins both attended. I would like us to have a debate on commemorations which takes into account the tragedies of those who were killed, particularly the children, but also the social and economic context for the Rising as well as the military endeavours during it. </p>

          <p eId="para_59">I ask for a debate on the performance and evidence given by Monsieur Trichet last week. It was the most extraordinary performance by Tricky Dicky Trichet. He was elevated up on a platform. The subservient minions of the banking inquiry were seated much lower. He had no difficulty looking down his nose at them. He was introduced in the most submissive and obsequious way as Monsieur le Président. He was totally supercilious. He did nothing wrong; he was not responsible for anything at all. He was just an outside observer. Who on earth would believe that hogwash? Then there was a kind of laudatory editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i>.</p>

          <p eId="para_62">The man gave advice. Anyone giving advice with a bludgeon visible behind him and carrying a blunderbuss in the other hand, one would be inclined to take his or her advice. He said that he said nothing about the bondholders, but he did say the world knew and every central banker knew. Why did he keep his mouth shut? Does anyone believe he kept his mouth shut? I certainly do not. The late Brian Lenihan is on record as saying that he was told by the ECB that he could not burn the bondholders. Mr. Trichet said there was no phone call and that he does not know how he spun such a line. I do not believe Mr. Trichet, nor do I believe a single solitary word from his mouth. It is time we analysed what he did have to say in this country. Basically, it appears that he changed his mind. He told Brian Lenihan in the morning that he could burn the bondholders but by the evening he said no he could not, but that was to save the German and French banks. Of course it was; even an idiot could see that.</p>
          <p eId="para_63"> On the continuing saga of the referendum, there was more debate on it on television last night. The "Yes" side put up a fine performance but I did not know where the "No" side were coming from because there was a lot of guff spoken about single fathers. Apparently, there are 500,000 of them according to Mr. Waters, which sounds a bit odd but I do not know. I am not guilty. I am not a single father. The participants spoke about equality and said everyone should relax because there were equality provisions in the Constitution. Indeed, there are. I know about them, do I not? They were there when I sued this country on the subject of the criminalisation of homosexual behaviour between adults in private. Those equality provisions existed but they did not prevent the High Court and the Supreme Court saying that despite these equality provisions, there was nothing whatever wrong with putting persons like myself in jail for periods ranging between ten years to life imprisonment. How much use were the equality provisions on that occasion?</p>

          <p eId="para_64">I will follow on from what Senator Bacik said about the obesity epidemic. I am one of the people who has bored everyone for the past four years with talk of this matter. As the Senator said, the latest figures released by the World Health Organization show Ireland is on course to become the most obese country in Europe by 2030. Professor Donal O'Shea, whom most people will have heard speak on this issue, has said that Ireland is in a worse health crisis than HIV-AIDS in the 1980s and cholera in the 1800s. The new figures predict that 89% of Irish men will be overweight or obese by 2030 which puts them at the top of an overweight table of 53 countries. In the same category, it is predicted that 85% of Irish women will be overweight or obese. Even though it is a forecast, the figures are startling even if they are halfway correct. As far as childhood obesity is concerned, Irish children, especially in the lower socio-economic groups, are in effect being poisoned with high fat, high salt and, above all else, high sugar content in their foods. Legislative action must be taken as a matter of urgency to tackle this time bomb.</p>
          <p eId="para_65"> When the plastic bag levy was introduced, it immediately changed consumer behaviour. The use of plastic bags decreased by approximately 90% and well over €200 million was generated. The funding was subsequently invested in additional bottle banks and other environmentally friendly measures. By the same token, the introduction of a health related food and drinks levy would have a positive impact on the consumption of junk food. International surveys and research have shown this to be true. Meanwhile, the tax would generate much needed revenue for additional medical services and therapies for patients who suffer from chronic obesity related illnesses such as diabetes. As a State, we cannot afford such a situation to continue and I predict it will only get worse. I would welcome, as suggested by Senator Bacik, a debate on the issue in general but in particular on policy and the need for legislative measures to be introduced.</p>

          <p eId="para_66">Will the Leader of the House consider arranging a rolling debate on the proposals contained in the 2015 Seanad reform document? The time allotted yesterday to discuss the document was limited.</p>
          <p eId="para_67">No one had any great satisfaction in having four minutes or six minutes to outline a complex Bill, the hard copy of which was circulated yesterday, which meant there was not much time to study it. The Association of County and City Councils represents 1,000 councillors. The councillors are the most disenfranchised group in this. The association was established in 1947. The rights were developed over that period and they have exercised them with great caution, as everyone elected from the panels to the House knows. To get a vote is worth 1,000 votes in power. I ran for the Seanad in 1992 on the administrative panel and in 1997 I ran on the industrial and commercial panel, but failed to get elected on both occasions. I was elected to the Dáil when I first ran in 1977 and was elected five times subsequently. Comparing the Dáil and Seanad, in my experience it is much more difficult to get elected to this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_68"> Since Senator Cummins took over as Leader of the House, he has done his utmost to expand and develop the role of the House, including innovations with the Leas-Chathaoirleach, with people making submissions and other ideas the Leader has regarding European legislation. Those are all very positive things that can be done within this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_69"> With respect to the diaspora, my five siblings went abroad. My eldest sister died, but I have another two siblings in England and two brothers in America, who vote. My sister, brother and their families will be voting in tomorrow's general election in Britain. That is where they pay their taxes. Their local MP represents them, comes to their houses and canvasses them, as Deputies do here. In all the years I have been talking to them, they never once asked to be represented here. They are represented by us anyway. Let us be honest about it. Many Senators get calls, letters and other representations from abroad, and what do they do? They act on them.</p>
          <p eId="para_70"> There are grounds to have a rolling debate. As Senator Bacik said, the Bill that is to come should be debated. I do not know who is introducing it because they have no rights themselves.</p>

The most charming part of the Bill is the proposal for an ongoing committee, sitting every month, reporting to the Government in perpetuity, this great group with Dr. Maurice Manning, Mr. Joe O'Toole and others. That is rather nice job creation for someone. It is rather inventive, to say the least, to put that in, but that would be a matter for the Government to decide.</p>

          <p eId="para_75">I again very much welcome the living city initiative. I may have asked the Leader this already. It might be useful in due course when we have some more information about these special regeneration areas in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford and Kilkenny and we have the maps to have a debate if Members were interested. It is a tremendous initiative for owner-occupiers of properties originally built for use as residences prior to 1915. Many of these are well worth preserving and enhancing and for that reason alone it is welcome. There is also a retail-commercial element, which I would like to see spelt out more. I note the scheme will last for five years. I would like to see the scheme extended to many other towns and cities if possible, but those details can wait for a debate if the Leader thinks well of it and if there is enough demand for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_76"> I agree somewhat with Senator Bacik in regard to the proposed Seanad ballot paper - perhaps not the ballot paper. I was amused that we might have to download the ballot paper. I think they could get into trouble on that one, but enough of that. In regard to the Bill that the three wise men - it is a committee of more than the three wise men - have proposed for publication, without discussing the Bill, because I presume the Bill will need to be sponsored by the Government, I would like a discussion which might be a follow-on from yesterday, as Senator Bacik suggested, because we were curtailed somewhat on time.</p>
          <p eId="para_77">We might want to speak more on that subject. I did not have the time to mention a few items that I wanted to include. The former Senators' objective is worthwhile. The report is generally good but I see two huge snags in what it proposes. They could be spelled out further together with other snags other Members may have with a view to directing the measure if we were to have a discussion on the proposed Bill without dealing formally with it. I recommend that to the Leader. Also, a debate in due course in the autumn on the proposed commemorations would be worthwhile.</p>

          <p eId="para_82">-----the carrot of offering people a conservation grant has not worked and now the Government is using the stick and saying that if people do not play ball that it will put its hands into their pockets and take the money out of their bank accounts or social welfare payments. What is missing in its approach is an understanding that many people do not have the means to pay this unjust charge. That is the reality the Government does not seem to want to consider. It is disgraceful that the Minister, Deputy Kelly, and the Government are examining the possibility of taking these costs from people through the draconian means proposed. It would be much more suitable for us to have a debate on how to dismantle Irish Water and put in place a proper public utility that can deliver the needs of the Irish people, rather than putting in water meters at a huge expense to the public. I note that the plan for installing them in Galway city will be rolled out during the next few weeks. Instead of jailing people, the Government is now talking of putting its hands in the pockets of people who cannot afford to pay any more. The reason people have not signed up to Irish Water is that they do not have faith in it, they do not have faith in the Government's Irish Water policy and, in many cases, they are unable to pay for the extra costs of water, having paid for it through other mechanisms in the taxation system. A debate on the abolition of Irish Water would be a useful one to have in this House.</p>

          <p eId="para_83">I am not sure where to start or how to address what I am about to talk about but I will follow on from the comments of Senator Bacik said and Senator Noone on the report from the World Health Organization that came out this morning. I was mad as hell when I read it this morning and I have listened to commentaries on the radio today about obesity levels and where they are headed in Ireland. The report cited a likely increase from 23% to 57% in the incidence of obesity among women and a likely increase from 26% to 48% in the incidence among men. The incidence of obesity is likely to explode in 2030 not only in Ireland but throughout Europe and rest of the world. Senator Bacik spoke about having a debate on the issue but we do not need another bloody debate. We have had report after report, including Healthy Ireland; Health Eating Active Living; Action for Life - Action for Everybody, Growing Up in Ireland, Senior Cycle Physical Education and Junior Cycle Physical Education and my own Points for Life initiative which I introduced in this House three and a half years ago. Where did I get with it? Probably nowhere, other than that I got the NTSC and the Department of Education and Skills to allow me to run a pilot programme at primary level involving four schools. My report proved what we already know, not only for the past four years but for the past 15 years, which is how the health of this nation is going.</p>
          <p eId="para_84">The Department of Health is spending up to €15 billion a year, but what will the figure be in 2030? It will probably be €20 billion. We do not have a clue what we are doing to address the issue of physical activity and well-being and the obesity epidemic about which we have been told today. According to the report, there are too many obstacles and road blocks and it is time for action, not words. It has been proved in all reports that physical exercise reduces the level of cardiovascular disease and increases mental well-being, yet we are doing nothing to deal with the issue. In the Healthy Ireland initiative the need for cross-departmental support is mentioned. To be honest, that is an absolute joke. The Sport Ireland Bill 2014 is passing through the House and perhaps will be passed tomorrow. It is an opportunity to take some action under the umbrella of Sport Ireland. One invests to succeed. Sport Ireland could help us to deliver in communities, schools and voluntary clubs a really good action plan. I receive letters and e-mails on a regular basis, including one today, from schools which are dealing with problems with gymnasiums and have halls, perhaps, 9 m by 19 m, for 600 schoolchildren. They are on the following lines: "Eamonn, we have been applying for sports capital grants for the past 15 months or perhaps 15 years and cannot get anywhere." We really have to take action on this issue. The problem should be nipped in the bud in the case of children, as otherwise we are facing a lost generation. If serious action is not taken now, we will be in serious trouble by 2030.</p>

The betting companies do not care how much money a person loses or how much debt he or she gets into. On the other hand, if a person was to win a large amount of money online, they could shut down his or her account but do not mind bankrupting him or her. There is no watchdog to protect people and we have no way of knowing how big the problem is. I seek a debate on the issue in the House. With cross-party support, perhaps we might arrive at solutions and recommendations to alleviate the pain of some of those affected by it.</p>

          <p eId="para_86">Following on from what Senator Eamonn Coghlan said about the level of obesity among the population, I draw the attention of the House to an incident that occurred at the weekend. Prior to the under-21 football final between Tipperary and Tyrone the intermediate ladies football final took place between my county of Limerick and Offaly which Offaly won. It is the treatment of the ladies involved prior to the game that I wish to highlight. They show the same dedication in training as everybody else, yet they had to tog out at a location ten minutes away from the pitch by bus. They were not allowed to bring their gear bags into the ground. The half-time team talk took place in a hallway in which people were preparing food. The ladies concerned who have given so much of their time to playing for their counties did not receive as much as the match programme, even though they were playing in an all-Ireland final. That is not good enough at a time when we have such good female role models in sport. Katie Taylor is an obvious one, as is Anna Geary, the captain of the Cork camogie team who has received four all-star awards and has four all-Ireland medals and who announced her retirement at the weekend. I wish her the best of luck. What I have mentioned does not encourage anybody to become involved in sport.</p>
          <p eId="para_87"> What I really want to talk about is the march that took place at the weekend involving foreign language students in Ireland to learn English. There are English language schools located all over the capital city to which we invite people from all over the world to come to learn English and then relate their positive experiences here.</p>
          <p eId="para_88">Many of these students have clubbed together thousands of euro in their countries by going cap in hand to neighbours, friends and relatives to raise the money to go to the schools and, when they get there, the schools can close overnight with no protection for these students who are coming here to learn English. The person who organised that march at the weekend stated she had worked as an English language teacher all over the world and that while the schools are poorly regulated everywhere, Ireland is the worst in the world and we need regulation. These schools are often operated by charlatans and fly-by-nights, and while the tutors in these schools are offered some protection, there is no recompense at all for any of the students. This is not a problem that has arisen recently. This dates back a couple of years. When Deputy Ruairí Quinn was Minister, I brought it to his attention as well. Often many of these students are forced into working in poorly paid employment, for example, as au pairs, where their conditions of work are poor to say the least, and they do not seem to have anywhere to turn or to go to. Perhaps it is because they cannot vote that people are not making a big noise about it, but it certainly does nothing to enhance our reputation as a country abroad when this kind of thing happens. I seek a debate in this House with the Minister for Education and Skills to see what is being done to regulate these types of schools.</p>

          <p eId="para_89">I support the comments of my colleagues on the obesity issue. There should be a debate but it should be the commencement of putting together a practical action plan to address this issue. The figures revealed today in the WHO report are both frightening and startling, and the consequences, if we leave it unaddressed, are horrendous. Dr. Francis Finucane, a consultant endocrinologist at University Hospital Galway, suggests that the position will get worse and that if we leave matters as they are, we will be similar to the United States where one in three of those born since 2000 will have diabetes by the time they reach the age of 50. It is time to take all those reports to which Senator Eamonn Coghlan referred and start condensing them down to practical workable solutions. I agree with the Senator on the need for more investment in sports facilities in schools. There are significant sporting facilities in every rural community, town and village in this country but these are totally under-utilised. The challenge is how we can encourage more young people to use those facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_90"> I refer to another significant report that was published today by Amnesty International on the unthinkable atrocities being waged against civilians in Syria's second city of Aleppo. The report alleges that the Syrian Government forces and many rebel groups are committing war crimes every day. President Assad's Government stepped up its bombardment of Aleppo in recent weeks in response to a rebel offensive. A local journalist told the BBC that she heard the screams of children and saw rescuers struggling to pull victims from the rubble. The Amnesty report stated that Syrian Government aircraft launched continual attacks using barrel bombs, oil barrels, fuel tanks and gas cylinders packed with explosives and targeted 14 public markets, 12 transportation hubs, 23 mosques, 17 hospital and medical centres and three schools, and there have been in excess of 3,000 fatalities. Over a year ago, a UN resolution calling for an end to human rights abuses, specifically barrel bombs, was passed but the Government of Assad failed to comply with that resolution. Since then the international community has turned its back on the Aleppo civilians. I call on our Government to keep on at the United Nations and our counterparts in Europe to apply pressure to the Assad Government to desist and adhere to the United Nations resolution.</p>
          <p eId="para_91">What is happening in Syria warrants another debate in the House with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade at a convenient time because the atrocities highlighted in today's report are unspeakable and must be addressed. If war crimes are being committed, there is an obligation on the international community to pursue that issue to the international courts.</p>

          <p eId="para_92">I support Deputy Eamonn Coghlan on all the magnificent work he has done since he was elected to this House. I read part of the report online but there is a shortcut in it to many of the reports that have been published already. If much of that groundwork were implemented, it would be welcome and would contribute to the work done by Senator Eamonn Coghlan, as mentioned by Senators Catherine Noone, Michael Mullins and everyone in the House who has raised it. However, Senator Coghlan has done a good deal of the work.</p>
          <p eId="para_93"> I raise the issue of the collection of the water rates. If people can afford to pay and will not pay, they are breaking the law. I do not know a Member on any side of the House who would say that people like the Anti-Austerity Alliance or Sinn Féin Deputies and others cannot afford to pay their water charges. It is no different than any other charge. We have to pay for a plumber, a carpenter and so on. The announcement today is about keeping people who will not pay their water charges out of jail. There will be a different approach now to people who will not pay the charge and those who cannot afford to pay. Generous allowances will be made, and that will be looked at. It is time we said that those who cannot afford to pay this charge will not be asked to pay it.</p>

          <p eId="para_132">This morning I attended a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications which was addressed by the assistant Garda Commissioner, Mr. John Twomey. He instanced that changes to road traffic legislation have led to a significant improvement in road safety since 2005, when there were 396 road deaths as compared with 195 in 2014. That means there has been a reduction of more than 50% between 2005 and last year. Despite recent increases in 2013 and 2014, there has been a reduction in fatalities, with 50 deaths on Irish road to date this year, a decrease of 13 over the same period last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_133"> Without doubt, road safety is critical. In my opinion, and as stated by the assistant commissioner, we must all take responsibility for the issue. I hope the number of fatalities can be reduced further. I commend the Garda on its efforts to reduce the number of fatalities on the roads. I call for a debate in the Seanad on how we, as a body, can help reduce further the number of fatalities on the roads of this country.</p>

          <p eId="para_135">I pay tribute to Phil Farrington who, sadly, died on 3 May aged 94 years. He served in France and Germany and helped to liberate the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. Earlier this week he died at a home for Second World War veterans in Dublin. If one remembers, the call to pardon such soldiers began in the Seanad when we spoke to the then Minister for Defence, Deputy Alan Shatter. Thank goodness the Government pardoned all these soldiers.</p>
          <p eId="para_136"> I remind Senators and put on record the fact that Phil Farrington and thousands of Irish soldiers were dismissed en masse from the Irish Army because they joined the British Army, in their view, to defend us, the Irish, from the greatest threat which was posed by the Nazis who wanted to take over the country, our lives and society. These people were blacklisted, branded deserters, denied social welfare and public sector jobs, and their wives and children were treated with disdain for their entire lives. Today, I pay tribute to this man who was one of the few remaining soldiers to survive. His grandson has recalled that the effect of being ostracised by the State still had an impact right up to Phil's death, which is very sad. Thank God, the soldiers were pardoned during our time in the Seanad.</p>
          <p eId="para_137"> I heard Senator Eamonn Coghlan's impassioned speech on the issue of obesity and his call for action. I have read the newspaper article which stated that Ireland is set to be the most obese country in Europe. Normally, cool and wonderful trends start on the west coast of America which take four to five years to reach England and then Ireland. My goodness, the obesity trend has rushed across the Atlantic and, boy, have we embraced it. I agree with what the Senator had to say on the matter. I do not know what Minister we need to bring in to the House for a debate. I suggest that the Department of Education and Skills puts healthy cooking on the school curriculum five days a week, as a matter of urgency.</p>

          <p eId="para_139">The curriculum should include lessons on how to cook, not out of boxes and packets, but healthy inexpensive food that will keep people healthy and well. The Department should convey that obesity affects one's mental health.</p>
          <p eId="para_140">It will affect physical health, self-esteem and ruin the coffers of the State in years to come. We must do something about this. I wholeheartedly support Senator Coghlan's statement in that regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_141">Senator Ó Domhnaill referred to Seanad reform proposals. As the Leas-Chathaoirleach stated, we will be having further debates on the proposals before we deal with any Bill. I have copies of the draft Bill, which were furnished to me by Dr. Manning yesterday. It is a draft Bill and has not been published. I gave an indication that the House will have a further more lengthy debate on the topic. Yesterday's discussion was only a preliminary one on the report. I assure the Senator that there will be a further debate in the House in the near future.</p>
          <p eId="para_142"> Senator Ó Clochartaigh raised the matter of Irish Water. We cannot have a situation where one person is paying for water while a neighbour is not. There is a distinction between people who cannot pay and those who will not pay and it will be addressed in the legislation and proposals that come from the Government. In regard to dismantling Irish Water, I assure Senator Ó Clochartaigh that it is not on the agenda. The provision of a safe, clean water supply for all the people of Ireland is what is required and it will be provided. Brave steps have been taken by the Government to ensure that people have clean drinking water and that the supply for industry will be available. We have a situation where we are near capacity in Dublin in terms of the water supply and that will be addressed also.</p>
          <p eId="para_143"> Senator Ó Domhnaill also asked for a debate on a vision for Ireland for the next ten years. We can start with that vision tonight when we speak about the spring economic statement, which addresses the economic situation over the coming years. Listening to Senator Ó Domhnaill towards the end of his contribution, one might have been led to think the country should close up shop given all the negativity one heard. We have no intention of doing that. Calling for 20 minute contributions from Members, I found it difficult at times to get five minutes from some.</p>
          <p eId="para_144"> Senators Ivana Bacik, Catherine Noone, Eamonn Coghlan, Michael Mullins, Cáit Keane, Mary Ann O'Brien and others referred to the projections on obesity, which are very troubling. As Senator Eamonn Coghlan said in a passionate contribution, there is nothing new in the figures. It is something that has been discussed for years. We have enough reports and what we need now is action. The Senator is right, as are all the speakers. Senator Noone has spoken on several occasions on the subject also. We need legislative action if necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_145"> We are spending €15 billion on our health service, but it will be double that if we fail to tackle the whole problem of obesity. Physical exercise is very important. Senator Eamonn Coghlan should make those points on the Sport Ireland Bill also. He made the very good suggestion that Sport Ireland could be given some responsibility in the area of promoting physical exercise in schools in particular. It is something that will have to be addressed. I will ask the Minister for Health to come to the House to debate the issue with us. He has been here previously, but I will ask him to come in again in view of the recent report.</p>
          <p eId="para_146"> Senator David Norris referred to the evidence given by Mr. Jean-Claude Trichet to the banking inquiry. I am sure it will be considered at length by the inquiry committee. We can have a debate on the committee's findings when it publishes its report. I note also Senator Norris's points in regard to the referendum on marriage equality.</p>
          <p eId="para_147">He has made similar points over recent days.</p>
          <p eId="para_148"> Senator Noone referred to the recent report on obesity levels and called for legislative action to deal with the issue. Senator Leyden referred to yesterday’s debate on Seanad reform. As I stated already, it was a preliminary discussion. I note his views on the diaspora, representation with taxation and other related issues which can be raised in our next debate on this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_149"> Senator Paul Coghlan referred to the living cities initiative. This is an exciting scheme which will help rejuvenate certain areas in our cities. If there are further calls for a debate on the scheme, I am sure we can facilitate one. The scheme was launched by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, today. It provides property tax incentives for certain regeneration areas, as designated by the Minister, in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford and Kilkenny. The maps and boundaries of these areas can be found on the websites of the respective local authorities. The two types of relief are an owner-occupier residential element for properties originally built for use as a private dwelling prior to 1915 and a retail-commercial element. The scheme will last for five years from the day it is commenced by order of the Minister for Finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_150"> I dealt with the matter raised by Senator Ó Clochartaigh regarding Irish Water. I have also already addressed the matter raised by Senator Eamonn Coghlan on sport in schools. He has made proposals himself on this issue. There has been a successful pilot project but the time for talking is gone. We need action on this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_151"> Senator Kelly raised the issue of online gambling and betting. In this session there was a comprehensive debate over several days on the Betting (Amendment) Bill. The gambling control Bill is also to be brought before the House soon. I share the Senator’s concerns about this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_152"> Senator Heffernan referred to the provision of changing facilities for women at sporting venues. The same facilities should be provided for both sportsmen and sportswomen. Why arrange games with ladies togging off and having team talks in different areas to the main changing facilities? It does not make sense. Whoever arranged those fixtures has something to answer for in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_153"> The regulation of English language schools was raised by Senator Mooney last week and again yesterday, as well as by other Members. It is a matter of great importance because the reputation of the country is at stake where education is concerned. The Department of Education and Skills has worked closely with the Department of Justice and Equality and other stakeholders to assist and co-ordinate a sympathetic response through the task force formed for students affected by the closure of private language colleges.</p>
          <p eId="para_154"> The two Departments have also produced a package of reforms to the student immigration system for international education which will be brought to the Government for its approval in the next two weeks. These reforms will drive restructuring of the sector which will improve the overall quality offered to international students and protection for learners. They will also enhance Ireland’s reputation and reduce the negative impact on the Irish labour market and social protection costs. These are all strongly in line with the goals of Ireland’s international education strategy. When we have this report and the reforms are decided on by the Government in the next two weeks, we will have a debate on the matter in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_155"> Senator Michael Mullins raised the issue of the atrocities in Aleppo and the recent report by Amnesty International which was shocking. The use of barrel bombs is a despicable act. I can assure him that the Government will keep pressure on our EU compatriots and the UN to take action against the Assad government because what is happening is absolutely atrocious. </p>
          <p eId="para_156"> Senator Cáit Keane explained what is proposed in terms of people who will not pay for water. She called for a debate on child care. She also called for Sinn Féin to deal with the issue of child abuse which it has not dealt with as yet. </p>
          <p eId="para_157"> Senator Terry Brennan raised the issue of the reduction in the number of fatalities on Irish roads and outlined that we all have a responsibility in this area. He commended the Garda and the Road Safety Authority on their actions.</p>
          <p eId="para_158"> Senator Mary Ann O'Brien paid tribute to Phil Farrington, a veteran of the Second World War, who has died at the age of 94. As she rightly pointed out, it was right and proper that he and his colleagues were granted a pardon by the then Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, and the Government. I extend my condolences to the Farrington family.</p>
          <p eId="para_159"> In terms of the spring economic statement I do not think I gave the times for speakers. The contributions of group spokespersons shall not exceed eight minutes and those of all other Senators shall not exceed six minutes.</p>

          <p eId="para_176">I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin<b>. </b>The subject matter of this motion impacts on many people around Ireland who are currently indebted and at risk of having property seized by the bank on the appointment of a receiver. The purpose of the motion is to call on the Government, through the Minister of State's good offices, to act to curb the abuses and bullying which have been visited on members of the public by receivers appointed to seize property. I hope the motion will enjoy support across the House, particularly in light of comments made by the Taoiseach, reported on 22 April, that the Government will "look at regulating in this area." Ordinary members of the public have been subjected to disgraceful behaviour and intimidation by receivers and this is a matter which requires an urgent commitment to introduce regulations. </p>
          <p eId="para_177"> Colleagues will be aware that the banks are moving with gusto to repossess properties. It has been reported that the rate at which homes are being repossessed has increased by more than 500% since last year. Banks have a variety of options open to them to recover money and or property from a debtor where he or she is in default of payment terms in a loan. One such method is to recover the real property which is secured under the loan by the appointment of a receiver. </p>
          <p eId="para_178"> The motion deals with property receivers. Property receivers are often referred to as "fixed charge receivers". This title highlights the fact that they are appointed over fixed assets only. In this jurisdiction property receivers are appointed by the courts under the provisions of section 108 of the Land and Conveyancing Reform Act 2009 or under the terms of a mortgage deed. In the United Kingdom the industry reacted to the lack of standards by some individuals when undertaking a fixed charge or statutory receivership appointment. Those working in the area formed the Association of Property and Fixed Charge Receivers, NARA, in 1995. NARA states that it was formed "by a group of professionals from the property, legal and insolvency disciplines, who were often engaged in receivership appointments." In the United Kingdom, it was the people working as receivers who sought to root out the bad practices and the heavy handed tactics which had crept into the area. It was not the Government or the consumer protection regulators which were the first to act.</p>
          <p eId="para_179"> In April the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform was informed that one bank, AIB, had moved to repossess more than 5,700 homes in mortgage arrears by the end of last year. The striking aspect of these moves by the bank was the use of receivers. Of the 1,548 legal cases on buy-to-let properties, some 819 receivers had been appointed by the end of last year with 428 civil bills issued. Another 460 receivers were appointed by the bank between January and March 2015. While the focus has been on buy-to-let properties, there is nothing in law to prevent a receiver being appointed over a residential property. In regard to the moves by AIB we can expect other banks to follow the same course of action in the near future.</p>
          <p eId="para_180"> The problem in Ireland is largely one arising from the lack of regulation. Unfortunately, in a civilised society we cannot necessarily leave good conduct and prudential judgment to the better angels of human nature. I have spoken with solicitors and barristers practising in the area of debt and insolvency and they have told me that the problem is much more widespread than reported in the media. There is a thuggish and disreputable element which is content to exploit the lacuna in consumer protection legislation regarding the conduct of receivers.</p>
          <p eId="para_181"> One case I have been informed of involved a family business in north County Dublin. That family business consisted of a warehouse and a workshop which shared a yard with the family home. At midnight a van, full of what can only be described as thugs, arrived, broke into the yard and surrounded the family home while the receiver and his agent arrived behind them in a car and entered the warehouse to seize property as demanded by the banks. The receiver had clearly co-ordinated his actions with his team of hired goons.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">The family in question called on the Garda Síochána, only to be told that it was a personal debt matter and that it did not involve the criminal law. The team of heavies who arrived with the receiver were connected to a debt collection agency with links to a well-known Dublin criminal.</p>
          <p eId="para_183"> Another well-reported incident occurred recently at a property in Castledermot, County Kildare. In this incident, which was reported in the major national newspapers, a Kildare farmer, Mr. Paul O'Shea and his wife, were confronted by an outrageous display of intimidation. The receiver arrived at the family farm at about 2 a.m. reportedly with about 50 staff, some of whom were dressed with balaclavas and had German shepherd dogs. The mob arrived in ten large trucks, industrial loaders with tower lights, and a minibus. This cavalcade was also accompanied by three Garda vehicles. </p>
          <p eId="para_184"> I am sure that some Members might be tempted to take solace that the presence of gardaí was designed to ensure that the seizure of assets or property went off without any intimidation or violence. However, the very fact that such a convoy of men and machines arrived at a family farm in the middle of the night is, in itself, an act of intimidation and violence, and should raise serious concerns. It sets a sinister and disturbing precedent for intimidation tactics by receivers carrying out an order of the court. We are talking about people acting in a most unacceptable way with the indirect backing of the apparatus of State.</p>
          <p eId="para_185"> When informed of this incident, An Taoiseach stated: "Perhaps we should consider an amendment here which would regulate these court orders and ensure that they are carried out in more appropriate circumstances." He added: "We have evidence of extraordinary activity by personnel here. It is not right that people should arrive at 3 a.m. to do this." I wholeheartedly agree with An Taoiseach, but it seems to me that urgent action is needed. Not alone was there a regrettable act by way of a timeline commitment from the Taoiseach, but even the spirit of what he said seems not to have been reflected in the Government's amendment to my motion. Rather, it was abandoned. It is a rowing back and there is no sense of urgency. In fact, the Government amendment claims quite baldly that there is no compelling evidence that the sector requires the introduction of regulations to govern the conduct of receivers. How is that to be squared with the Taoiseach's apparent concern which was expressed recently?</p>
          <p eId="para_186"> There is a lack of robust protection for consumers in the law. Unlike the rules surrounding negotiations between banks and debtors over a mortgage or the detailed and extensive rules regarding consumer protection in lending contracts, the Central Bank has precious little to say regarding receivers or their conduct. For example, under the Central Bank's consumer protection code of 2012, a lender cannot phone or visit a person in connection with their loan, without their consent, between 9 p.m. and 9 a.m. on weekdays or at any time on a Sunday or public holiday. Furthermore, a lender is not permitted to call or visit a person at their place of work, unless all reasonable efforts to contact them elsewhere have failed. Despite the otherwise comprehensive nature of the code, there are no provisions regarding the manner in which a bank seeks to enforce the terms of a mortgage when appointing a receiver.</p>
          <p eId="para_187"> The Consumer Credit Act 1995, as amended, imposes extensive requirements as to the form and content of loan documentation, including documentation relating to mortgage loans, where a mortgagee is dealing with a consumer. It also imposes a duty on lending institutions to act fairly in commercial contracts, including mortgages with consumers, and prohibits misleading or aggressive practices. Again, however, there are no provisions relating to the appointment of receivers or their conduct, so what can be done?</p>
          <p eId="para_188"> Borrowers who are at the receiving end of a receiver require more robust protection both in the law governing the appointment of a receiver and in the court order governing the terms of their appointment. I insist that, despite what the Government's amendment says, the Government does have power to amend the law to provide for regulations, either under the Landlord and Conveyancing Reform Act or elsewhere in a piece of miscellaneous legislation. </p>
          <p eId="para_189"> These regulations to delineate the qualifications a receiver should have in order to allow their appointment, are nothing more than best practice in the UK. If a court order does not contain directions on how a receiver and his or her agents are to behave, we are effectively allowing them to act with impunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_190"> Under the Courts of Justice Act 1936, as amended, the rule-making authority of the rules committee is exercisable with the concurrence of the Minister for Justice and Equality. I ask that the Minister should request the rules committee of the Circuit and High Courts to craft new provisions surrounding the appointment of receivers. The result would hopefully be that such order, as is issued by the court, will delineate the rules surrounding the conduct of a receiver and his or her agents, as well as the usual particulars regarding the property to be seized. </p>
          <p eId="para_191"> Enhanced court rules would guide judges in shaping orders to be made where a bank petitioned a court to appoint a receiver in order that, for example, the receiver would only be able to call to a property during ordinary business hours. There should be no more late night calls and no more than two persons, in addition to the receiver, should attend a property, unless a particularly weighty reason is given to the court to allow more people to attend, for example, to remove contents from a building.</p>

          <p eId="para_193">I beg the Acting Chairman's indulgence to deliver two final paragraphs. </p>
          <p eId="para_194"> An order should be required setting out the maximum number of people who may attend a premises, if it is to be more than the receiver and two staff. The use of dogs, weapons or any other manner of intimidation should be banned. An order should be made that all those who attend a premises with a receiver make their identity known to the court and the borrower. There should be no concealed faces. The private security industry regulator, appointed under the Private Security Services Act 2004, obliges all security staff to wear identity badges when at work. The same principle should apply to receivers. If property to be seized is the family home or principal private residence, PPR, or adjacent to or abutting the family home or PPR, the receiver should be required to contact the occupants of the family home to make an appointment when he or she is to attend. The time should be agreed with the occupants in advance. If that is impossible, the court should appoint a particular time to be served in the notice to the occupants. No visit or seizure actions should be carried out outside that time and date. </p>
          <p eId="para_195"> The Minister of State should liaise with the Minister for Finance with a view to directing the Central Bank to introduce new rules for lending and credit institutions on the contractual terms governing the appointment and conduct of receivers under a mortgage. I am simply asking the Minister of State to concur with the spirit of what the Taoiseach has been saying and to accept that this is an area that badly needs to be subject o regulation in the public interest.</p>

          <from>Senator Gerard P. Craughwell<recordedTime time="2015-05-06T16:55:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_196">I second the motion. As Senator Rónán Mullen said, we are talking about ordinary, decent, hard-working people who find themselves in severe debt. Members of the Government have held their heads low having inherited the problem of guaranteed bank loans. They have waited until the financial crisis has passed or, at least, have given the impression that it has passed to act and now we see a plethora of repossessions all over the country. The focus will quickly move from buy-to-let properties to residential properties and we can already see signs of this happening. Scare tactics, bullying and intimidation are commonplace. In some cases, one may see large, muscly men arriving at the door of innocent householders. It is not the sort of thing one associates with what should be regulated security organisations. The use of these mobs must stop. I am not satisfied by the case being made by the Government. I am asking that an inquiry be carried out immediately to see exactly what is going on. Let us have an investigation into the practices that have occurred to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_197"> Loans were given to people who had court orders for debts. I have come across one particular case where an attempt was made to repossess the family home, yet a loan was granted to a man who had two court orders for failing to repay a debt to the company that had given him a mortgage. Therefore, he had two court orders against him for unpaid debts in one part of an organisation, while another part of the same organisation had loaned him €180,000. That is difficult to explain.</p>
          <p eId="para_198"> As my colleague, Senator Rónán Mullen said, all communications should be made during business hours. The number of people turning up when repossessions take place should be controlled. The use of dogs or weapons is outrageous. It is like something we would have seen with the Stasi. On the concealment of faces, there is no reason anybody should wear a balaclava other than to intimidate. I fully support the notion that an appointment should be made. If the occupier of a premises is not willing to accede to the making of an appointment, a court order could be made setting the time of such an appointment.</p>
          <p eId="para_199"> There has been much talk about regulation by the Cental Bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_200">Some days ago I published a five-point plan with respect to some simple steps that could be taken to assist those in mortgage distress. My first proposal was a credit amnesty. Last night, I gave an example of a man living in Maam Cross being offered a job in Galway city. Not having a vehicle to get to Galway city, he needed to borrow money. However, because he has a mortgage arrear, he is without a credit rating. I am calling for a credit rating amnesty that would apply to anybody who has no loans other than a mortgage. If the mortgage is in distress, that should be ring-fenced and taken outside the credit rating.</p>
          <p eId="para_201"> My five-point plan also referred to certificates of affordability. Those who have jobs and who are trying to recover from the mess in which they find themselves, now spend significant time filling in large amounts of paperwork to meet the demands of a certificate of affordability for the banks. I am calling on the Government to appoint the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, or a similar agency to provide certificates of affordability that could be done in a person’s own time. This could be presented to the bank and presented as a <i>de facto</i> position.</p>
          <p eId="para_202"> I also called for the need for a communications protocol. The Central Bank insisted a communications protocol should be in place for dealing with those in mortgage arrears. Communications, however, tend to be a telephone call and, if not one, several telephone calls over weeks and months. These calls always start with satisfying the security information to ensure the bank is talking to the right person. Then the customer is asked if they are aware they are in mortgage arrears, when they intend to make the next payment, how soon the bank can expect it, are they aware that if they do not make a repayment their house is likely to be repossessed. This does not smack of what I would call normal engagement with people.</p>
          <p eId="para_203"> I am looking for a dedicated customer contact before we ever get to the stage where receivers are appointed. The banks were quick enough to have personal relationship managers back in the days when there was money thrown around like confetti. We need personal relationship managers now to deal with the poor unfortunates who find themselves in debt to the banks. For those who find themselves in a position that they will never be able to repay the loan in their current circumstances, rather than throwing them out of their houses, we should use rent allowance to maintain them in their homes and take whatever legal steps to protect the family home and the Department which provides rent allowance.</p>
          <p eId="para_204"> As I found out myself in 1983 when I walked out of Galway with nothing but the clothes on my back having lost my own house, there is always a tomorrow. Things always turn. What we need to do is support people to allow them meet that turn and get away from these bullyboys who were going out under the guise of receivership.</p>

          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_210">- the resolution of mortgage arrears continues to be an ongoing issue which is being addressed by a range of different Government and financial institution-led initiatives; </p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_211">- the Statement of Government Priorities 2014-2016 recognises that high levels of personal debt continue to threaten to exclude thousands of individuals and families from the recovery and commits to the completion of a review of the implementation of the Central Bank’s mortgage arrears targets and the operation of the Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI) and to the strengthening of the independent advice service offered to distressed borrowers; </p>

          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_219">- the fact that engagement between borrowers and lending institutions has resulted in almost 115,000 sustainable restructure arrangements being put in place, as also indicated by the CBI December 2014 data; </p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_220">- the initiatives by lenders to provide borrower-focussed debt restructuring solutions; and </p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_221">- the improved take-up of ISI services in 2015 and the fact that the majority of ISI solutions result in successful outcomes for the borrower, as evidenced in the ISI statistical bulletin for Quarter 1 2015; </p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_222">notes that: </p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_223">- the Government has put in place a broad strategy to address the problem of mortgage arrears and family home repossessions, which has included an extensive suite of interventions designed to address the problem including specific Central Bank targets for the banks through the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Targets (MART), the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, extensive recasting of the personal insolvency legislation, the provision of advice through Department of Social Protection-led initiatives and the Mortgage to Rent Scheme; </p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_224">- given the personal distress caused by over-indebtedness, the effective management of the mortgage arrears issue remains, however, a policy area, by necessity, under continuous review and that more and concerted action by the banks can be undertaken to assist customers in arrears and to improve the uptake of personal insolvency solutions; </p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_225">- the Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland has produced a helpful ‘Residential Tenants’ Guide to Receivership’, which provides appropriate information to tenants affected by the appointment of a receiver to a buy-to-let property; </p>

The proposed amendment will provide that where a person is appointed as a receiver to carry out the functions and exercise the powers of a landlord under a tenancy, that person will be considered to be the landlord for the purposes of the 2004 Act; and </p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_230">- the making of Court Rules are a matter for the Courts Service and the relevant Court Rules Committees and not for the Minister for Justice and Equality; </p>

          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_233">- the Government to keep the matter under review. </p>
          <p eId="para_234">I welcome the Minister of State to the House. In listening to my colleagues and their testimonials, it is very hard to disagree or argue with most of what they said. Senator Mullen spoke about receivers turning up with dogs and all sorts of crazy things. Nobody, from the Taoiseach to the Minister, would support those kind of actions. That type of behaviour is reprehensible. I call again on those who have to repossess properties to do it appropriately and have common decency. We should not have to legislate or amend Acts to facilitate common decency. The majority in the debt-collecting business do it with as much empathy as they possibly can, by appointment and appropriately. Unfortunately, there is a significant minority which does not aspire to that kind of conduct or ethical framework with which we expect all our citizens to be treated.</p>

Many with buy-to-let properties are doing everything they can to interfere with the process, using delaying tactics and every type of a loophole in legislation and otherwise to ensure they can hold on to their assets. In some cases, they are collecting rent from the properties in cash and not writing down their debts.</p>
          <p eId="para_247"> I am more interested in the personal or family home. No Member wants to see people being put out of their own homes. That is an absolute last resort. However, when one has a situation where people do not co-operate, engage or discuss options with their lenders, there comes a point where, unfortunately, it is a last resort. It always will be a last resort. The mature action we can take tonight is to work together.</p>
          <p eId="para_248"> In my four years here, this House has a proud reputation of working together on issues of national importance. This is an issue of national importance. I commend the Senators opposite on highlighting it. The more it is highlighted, the more exposure it gets and the more likely we are likely to get sustainable, short-term, medium-term and long-term resolution.</p>
          <p eId="para_249"> I find it regrettable that I was interrupted on more than one occasion for what I consider were non-argumentative comments. However, some Members choose to do that. It is a practice in which I do not engage.</p>

          <p eId="para_252">The amendment put down by the Government side is at variance with what Senator Conway has just spoken about, however. It states “there is no compelling evidence that this sector requires the introduction of regulations to govern the conduct of receivers”. There was the case of Paul O’Shea in County Kildare where the receivers had Alsatian dogs and wore balaclavas. This was reminiscent of what the RIC, Royal Irish Constabulary, did when it evicted people 100 years ago.</p>

          <p eId="para_254">This is not an isolated incident; this is what is happening now. This long-term solution is not a solution.</p>
          <p eId="para_255"> When the Minister for Justice and Equality brought in legislation for the mortgage arrears issue, there were going to be insolvency agents and practitioners. However, any solution that could be put in place could be vetoed by the banks. Somehow or other as Senator Mullen said, asking banks and receivers to look towards the better angels of their human nature is at variance with what banks and receivers do. Receivers and banks make profits. They do not act in the best interests of anyone only the laws of profit. For my colleagues opposite to claim there is no need for regulation when people are arriving at houses with balaclavas is defying the facts.</p>
          <p eId="para_256"> Colleagues opposite claimed there was no need to ensure that the banks did not have a veto, but now the Government is suggesting taking away or curtailing the banks' veto in order to force them to do what people on this side of the House and people in the Irish Mortgage Holders Association said was necessary. Once a bank is given a veto, the bank will use the veto. As a result people have been evicted from their houses and the taxpayer is footing the bill in order to find accommodation for people who have been evicted.</p>
          <p eId="para_257"> Part of the amendment basically commends the Government on its work. It states that the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 is not the appropriate means to address this issue and proposes an amendment to another Act, the Residential Tenancy Act 2004, as the way to proceed. All of that counts for nothing because of the Government's intention to keep the matter under review. This is while the men with balaclavas are arriving at 2 a.m. Does that sound like something that needs a long-term solution? The solution is required now. There is no regulation. The reason no regulation was introduced ten years ago was that there was no need for it because receivers were not arriving with balaclavas, but they are doing so now.</p>
          <p eId="para_258"> Today we will get a reply written by the same people who probably wrote the reply when I asked how many times the former Minister for Justice and Equality met representatives of the banks to discuss the veto by the banks in personal insolvency legislation. The former Minister would not answer the question. I put it to him that the banks wrote the legislation. I asked for the minutes of the meetings he had with the banks. The banks wrote the legislation to allow them to veto solutions for mortgage holders in arrears.</p>
          <p eId="para_259"> A year and a half on, we have a crisis. It was entirely predictable and here it is. Let us predict another crisis, but in fact it has already arrived. These institutions are acting like thugs, coming in the night, not as they should under regulations. The word "guidelines" is has been used. That is all they are and nobody has to observe them. They can ignore them and tear them up. That is not good enough. There need to be consequences. People must abide by law and regulation. This is the wild west of taking property from people. There is no law. An international financial newspaper once described Ireland as the wild west of banking. That was predicted ten years before the crash and what happened is exactly what happens when there is no regulation. The banks did what they do. They make a profit. They all get a bonus and all walk off with their pensions leaving the taxpayer to pick up the tab.</p>
          <p eId="para_260"> What happens when there is no regulation dealing with the issue of people taking property? At least the RIC used to show up in daylight. Police officers would knock down the door. There was law and it was not on the side of the people. However, now there is no regulation and those concerned can show up at any hour of any day and do what they want, aided and abetted by gardaí. Gardaí observe while the mercenaries bulldoze down people's doors and take their property.</p>
          <p eId="para_261"> The Government will keep the matter under review. That will be of great solace of those who are woken in the middle of the night. I am tired of hearing my colleagues opposite bemoaning that some of the receivers have sent in thugs, it is terrible and we should do something. The place to do it is here and the time to do it is not in the future but now. However, the Government will keep the matter under review.</p>
          <p eId="para_262"> The Minister of State will not be happy with some of the wording of the amendment which states that, "there is no compelling evidence that this sector requires the introduction of regulations to govern the conduct of receivers". However, we read about it in the newspapers. Action is, of course, required now. After the Minister of State gives his response I ask him to bring it back to his colleagues and let them know that action is required now.</p>

        <speech by="#AodhanORiordan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Justice_and_Equality" eId="spk_101">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)<recordedTime time="2015-05-06T17:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_263">On behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, I welcome the opportunity to discuss the topic of mortgages and receivers.</p>
          <p eId="para_264"> This issue forms part of the overall context of mortgage arrears and it should be recognised that things are improving in this area. There has been a welcome increase in engagement between borrowers and lenders which has resulted in over 115,000 sustainable restructured solutions being put in place. In addition, this year we have seen an improvement in the numbers of people availing of the services provided by the Insolvency Service of Ireland. It should be acknowledged that the majority of solutions reached through the ISI have resulted in successful outcomes for the borrower.</p>
          <p eId="para_265"> The Government recognises that the level of mortgage arrears is a significant economic and social challenge, and is acutely aware of the difficulties some borrowers are facing in meeting their mortgage commitments. The Government is committed to continuing to address this issue as a priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_266"> The Government is fully aware that high levels of personal debt threaten the participation of individuals and families in the current economic recovery. We have already taken decisive action in a number of areas in order to assist people in mortgage arrears difficulties, such as the introduction of the personal insolvency legislation; the provision of the mortgage arrears advice and information helpline; and the provision of independent financial advice for borrowers on the terms of the restructure arrangements offered to them by their lender.</p>
          <p eId="para_267"> The Government is currently reviewing the operation of personal insolvency legislation and the independent advice service offered to distressed borrowers with a view to strengthening those initiatives. In addition, the mortgage to rent scheme - under which the borrower surrenders the property to the lender who then sells the property to an approved housing body which then becomes the landlord allowing people to stay in the family home - is being reviewed with a view to improving the scheme to ensure that it is available in suitable cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_268"> As Senators will be aware, the Government has already made it clear that it will shortly be announcing a package of measures to support the existing framework and improve the uptake of personal insolvency solutions. The overall aim of the Government's approach to this issue remains the same as it has always been, which is to ensure that a full range of options is available to distressed borrowers and to keep as many people in their homes as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_269"> The appointment of a receiver over mortgaged property is one of the remedies available to a lending institution in cases of mortgage default. It is important to note at the outset, however, that this is a remedy that applies in the main to commercial property, which may include buy-to-let residential property and farmland. It does not, therefore, apply to the principal dwellings of defaulting borrowers. It is important to bear in mind that the properties to which receivers are appointed are not those covered by the Central Bank's code of conduct on mortgage arrears which seeks to ensure that lending institutions act in a scrupulously fair manner and exercise appropriate forbearance, in the case of principal dwellings.</p>
          <p eId="para_270"> The appointment of a receiver is normally an alternative to the lender seeking actual repossession of the mortgaged property. Instead of taking possession, a receiver is appointed to manage the property. In the case of a shop, restaurant or licensed premises, the goal may be to achieve more efficient management and operation of a viable business; in the case of buy-to-let residential property, the intention is more often to collect rental income produced by the property and to divert it towards servicing the mortgage.</p>
          <p eId="para_271"> A power to appoint a receiver in cases of mortgage default is set out in section 108 of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009. It largely reproduces a much earlier provision on the same lines in the Conveyancing Act 1881. These powers are exercisable by the lender without recourse to the courts. In such cases, the receiver's role is limited to receiving income produced by the mortgaged property. The receiver is generally also required to manage the property.</p>
          <p eId="para_272"> The mortgage contracts applicable to commercial property loans normally contain more detailed contractual terms concerning the appointment of receivers. They may, for example, grant the receiver more extensive powers, such as power to manage the property, lease it or sell it. These provisions form part of the terms and conditions on which the loan is granted by the lending institution concerned and, again, may be exercisable without recourse to the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_273"> While the Private Members' motion refers to the lack of regulation exposing borrowers to oppressive and wrongful conduct by receivers, I am not aware of any widespread concerns over the matter. Receivers are normally accountants or solicitors and are subject both to the regulatory and disciplinary regime applicable to their professions and the law of the land. I do not, therefore, accept the notion that the lack of a specific licensing regime leaves the public at risk of abuse by unscrupulous receivers.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">That said, the Minister is aware from media reports - this has been referred to by Senators and in the Dáil debate recently - of particular cases in which tensions appear to have arisen where receivers are seeking to take control of mortgaged property. These appear to be isolated exceptions to the general behaviour of receivers. Let me make it clear that the Minister condemns the use of heavy-handed actions by receivers in this type of instance and deplores the use of men with dogs and balaclavas turning up in the middle of the night to effect a repossession, as highlighted in recent reports.</p>
          <p eId="para_275"> The Minister is conscious that the appointment of a receiver over mortgaged property is likely to be both traumatic and stressful for the borrowers involved or any tenant who may be living in the affected properties. In many cases, their hopes and dreams of building a successful business for themselves and their children may have been dashed by events beyond their control. In other cases, what seemed at the time like an attractive investment opportunity has not been a success and the lives of many are badly affected as a result. The Minister, therefore, urges receivers to act with tact and consideration and to avoid heavy-handed actions. They must act within the limits of the laws governing their appointment when exercising their powers. The provision of adequate information on their role and statutory tasks for those likely to be affected is particularly important. In this context, the Minister notes that the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland has produced the helpful A Residential Tenant's Guide to Receivership which provides appropriate information for tenants affected by the appointment of a receiver for a buy-to-let property. The provision of a similar guide to cover other cases of receivership would, the Minister believes, be helpful and I understand she intends to write to the federation in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_276"> Receivers must act within the law of the land. The proceedings in which they take control of property are, first and foremost, civil proceedings to which the Garda is not a party. There may be situations where gardaí become aware or are notified that property is to be the subject of enforcement proceedings and, in these circumstances, it is an operational matter for Garda management to assess whether a Garda presence is advisable so as to prevent any risk of a breach of the peace. Preserving public order is an essential task of An Garda Síochána, whether in circumstances relating to repossession, the appointment of a receiver or otherwise. Where gardaí attend in these circumstances, it is important to understand they do not generally have a role in the process itself and are not in a position to act in any way as an arbiter in the proceedings. There may be some confusion on this point in the public mind, but this is the legal position and the Garda is very clear about this when present in such circumstances. Issues of difference or difficulty in the enforcement of a court order or contractual obligations between parties are matters for the parties concerned to resolve before the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_277"> Tensions can also arise where, for whatever reason, attempts are made to obstruct receivers in discharging their duties. Where a breach of the peace occurs in such cases, provisions in public order and related legislation are applicable. Similarly, where an individual has concerns that a criminal action may have been committed by any person in the course of such proceedings, this is a matter which An Garda Síochána will investigate.</p>
          <p eId="para_278"> The Minister appreciates the intent behind this Private Members' motion but considers that it must be opposed, mainly because the remedies put forward in the motion cannot be put in place. I note that the motion calls on the Minister to amend the rules of the superior courts and the Circuit Court to include new provisions regulating the conduct of receivers appointed by the courts. The general position is that court rules are made under the relevant statutory provisions by the respective rules committees, not by the Minister for Justice and Equality. It would not be appropriate, therefore, for the Minister to intervene in the manner suggested in the motion. In addition, the House should note that where a receiver is appointed by a court, he or she becomes an officer of the court, is answerable to the court and required to act in the interests of all the parties involved. Again, the Minister would not have any function in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_279"> The Minister is aware that there is the possibility that a receiver appointed over a mortgaged property is not a member of a regulated professional organisation and, therefore, not subject to the codes of conduct and ethics which would apply if he or she was a member. In such a circumstance the Minister believes it would be reasonable to put in place some rules and regulations governing their actions. For that reason, she has asked me to inform the House that she will be undertaking an analysis of the issue to examine whether further regulations should be introduced to govern the conduct of receivers. This analysis will, <i>inter alia</i>, examine the remedies put forward in this private Members' motion. The intention is to produce a report for discussion at the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality to allow the committee, on the basis of the analysis and its own examination of the issues involved, to consider what recommendation it would make as regards action to be taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_280"> I again thank Senators for raising this issue. I look forward to listening to the rest of the debate.</p>

          <from>Senator Kathryn Reilly<recordedTime time="2015-05-06T17:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_281">I welcome the Minister of State. I thank my fellow Senators for raising this timely and concerning issue in the House. Sinn Féin agrees with the motion which it will be supporting. The receiver issue is the inevitable result of the crisis, not a crisis in and of itself. The bigger issue concerns the policies which have made the receiver king-like. Since 2011, when the Government was elected to office, we have seen the repossession crisis come to a head. Banks have started to repossess many family homes. The changes to the code of conduct on mortgage arrears have allowed banks to exert more pressure on home owners. The Government saw fit for the banks to be the moral arbiter and decide what was a sustainable solution for mortgage holders in arrears. The changes to the code of conduct on mortgage arrears allow banks to preside over a customer appeal, instead of referring it to an independent adjudicator. We have seen the weakening of services such as the MABS and the Legal Aid Board which could help borrowers in distress. The Government has brought forward insolvency laws which gave banks a veto over reasonable arrangements and allowed them to count repossession as a solution to the overall problem. Furthermore, we have the completely failed mortgage-to-rent scheme which in some counties has had no participants. The list, as many agree, is endless.</p>
          <p eId="para_282"> The Government has completely failed to protect mortgage holders such as those with IBRC and others from vultures. The use of vulture funds to take over the loan books of banks or NAMA properties is the dirty little secret. Worst of all, we have seen the removal of the protection of the family home in law. When we see a motion such as this before the House, Sinn Féin will support it, but it is incidental. If we go to the root cause of unscrupulous receivers, inevitably we will end up back with the banks, which is where this issue needs to be resolved. </p>
          <p eId="para_283"> The huge increase in the number of repossessions is a disaster. It is a crisis which has been facilitated and accepted by the Government which accepted the policies that created the crisis. The shocking number of family homes being repossessed is down to policies that have been pursued. These policies have created the environment in which hundreds of repossessions can take place and no amount of hand wringing is going to change this fact. </p>
          <p eId="para_284"> We opposed the removal of the effect of the Dunne judgment and proposed instead a better replacement. My colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, tabled legislation in the Dáil which would have protected the family home, proposed fair solutions and an independent body to force banks into accepting reasonable arrangements, but it was voted down. That was a shameful day for the Government and every backbench Deputy. </p>
          <p eId="para_285"> As a party, we opposed the softening of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears. At the time we said the Government was letting the banks off the leash. Unfortunately, that has been proved to be correct. We have proposed an independent resolution mechanism, whereby an independent body would mediate and broker an agreement between banks and customers and, crucially, be able to force the banks to accept a reasonable proposal. We want to see the personal insolvency Act amended in order that banks could not veto arrangements where a mortgage was involved. Opposition Deputies, Senators and groups working with those in debt have been calling "Stop" for years. Unfortunately, the Government is ploughing ahead and doing the banks' bidding. </p>
          <p eId="para_286"> As an election approaches, we hear the Government state it will take action. For many, these are empty promises and of no use to the hundreds of people who have already lost their homes or who will find themselves in the next couple of weeks being brought before the courts. They fear that it might be their home next. We need genuine and encompassing legislation to protect mortgage holders in arrears, not just empty rhetoric. </p>
          <p eId="para_287"> I again thank my fellow Senators for raising this important issue about receivers. Sinn Féin will support the motion. However, we need to tackle the big issue, which is repossessions.</p>

          <from>Senator Aideen Hayden<recordedTime time="2015-05-06T17:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_288">I thank Senators Rónán Mullen and Gerard P. Craughwell for raising this issue. I have raised the issue of receiverships and their conduct in the House a number of times. Although he is not present in the Chamber, I also thank Senator Sean Barrett for raising this matter on a number of occasions. In particular, he has raised it with the Minister for Finance in respect of the treatment of tenants in buy-to-let properties and the issue of the lack of a code of conduct on the treatment of tenants in properties.</p>
          <p eId="para_289"> I wish to address some of the issues relating to the specifics of the motion. We need to remind ourselves what it is about. It is about receiverships. In essence, the Minister of State is correct in that it does not concern, in effect, principal residences. One of the things that concerns me about the debate so far is that there have been many references to family homes in the context of owner occupied mortgaged properties but not in the context of rented homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">We need to be very clear. One Irish family in five lives in a rented home. It is a sector that has been growing substantially. These are family homes and if any family living in a rented home is told that it is not its home and that it is not entitled to protection, I would like to be standing beside the person who is saying this to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_291"> I am not entirely happy with the Government's amendment to the motion. It does not refer to the issue in hand, namely, receiverships, but instead talks in general about mortgage arrears. It is most welcome that the motion has been put forward. I went to the trouble of obtaining a legal opinion on what was being proposed and there are issues with the motion, as drafted. I could spend some of my time going into these issues, but if he wishes, I can supply Senator Rónán Mullen with a copy of the legal opinion at the end of the debate. One of the issues that concerns me most is what can or cannot be done with the law as it stands. One of the points that may have been missed in the motion takes into account the fact that most receiverships concern buy-to-let properties which are rented as homes. We should remind ourselves of the extent of the problem we face. There are approximately 40,000 buy-to-let properties - approximately 25% of the entire rental market - in mortgage arrears for more than 90 days. To date, approximately 7,000 receivers have been appointed for buy-to-let properties. I could not possibly accept the notion that there is no compelling evidence that the sector requires the introduction of regulations to govern the conduct of receivers. That suggests we have had no difficulties with the appointment of receivers for buy-to-let properties.</p>
          <p eId="para_292"> With this in mind, I will refer to a case study in Threshold's annual report 2013. At the time of its publication, a far lower number of receivers had been appointed for rented properties - the exact number was 503. The case involves Maria, who had been living in a rented house for five years with her four children when she received a letter addressed to "the occupier". She tried telephoning the landlord, but there was no answer. As a result, she put the letter to one side and thought no more about it. A few days later there was a knock on the door while she was getting her children ready for school. Two men told her the landlord was not paying the mortgage and that they were now taking over the property. They thought nobody was living in it and told Maria that she had to pack up and that they would be back later that day. This is an unusual case, one Threshold does not deal with on a daily basis. </p>
          <p eId="para_293"> I have raised the issue of receiverships on a number of occasions with representatives of every one of the principal banks when they have come before the finance committee. In fairness, all agree that there is a need to regulate the actions of receivers.</p>

There is definitely a scenario where there is a particular concern about the behaviour of receivers which, in many cases, flaunt the law on illegal evictions. They have put people on the side of the road. In one case I know of a woman was put on the side of the road three days before Christmas, with her stuff in black plastic sacks.

          <p eId="para_297">On a positive note, I welcome the commitment of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, to amend the Residential Tenancies Act 2004; in other words, all of the rights a tenant has under that Act 2004, including being given adequate notice, having a property maintained and a deposit returned, would be seen as the obligations of a receiver appointed for a rented property. This would improve the position enormously. I very much welcome, therefore, the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill which will bring about this change in the law.</p>
          <p eId="para_298"> I am very happy that the Minister of State has accepted what has been said. I thank Senator Rónán Mullen for raising the issue.

          <p eId="para_299">The tone of the motion deals with receivers as enforcers and nobody would condone such behaviour. I will not start by saying it is okay. The two Senators have outlined two cases, but will they confirm if they concern private or commercial dwellings? I seek clarity on what is being debated. If they do not wish to indicate whether the properties are private or commercial, will they name the accountants or solicitors involved in both cases?</p>

          <p eId="para_301">It is important that we know who and what we are talking about. If somebody reads a newspaper story, he or she can play it in any way he or she likes. The Government has opened various avenues to tackle the dire mortgage issue, as Senator Aideen Hayden indicated. I thank her for her contribution. I will not say everything the Government has done is great or wonderful and that we will dig our way out of this hole. We are not doing enough, as I said to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, 20 months ago when he introduced the insolvency legislation. I asked him what would happen if the banks did not tell the truth, act responsibly or try to help? Many people who are losing their homes seek social housing support. Although I use the term cautiously, they again become a burden on the State. I do not mean that in a bad way.</p>
          <p eId="para_302"> We have bailed out the guys who are putting people out of their houses. We must seriously consider having a veto. It is not often that I agree with my colleague, Senator Mark Daly, but we are cut from the same cloth some of the time. The absence of a veto is the problem, as Senator Kathryn Reilly said. We need an independent assessment body that would instruct the banks and this would involve a veto.</p>
          <p eId="para_303"> The bankruptcy period should be reduced to one year. We did a "Paddy" job when we reduced the period from 12 years to three, whereas in England, America and everywhere else there is a one-year period. We need to revisit that issue and if we are to put manners on some of the banks, that is how we should do it. I have two clients who were hopelessly in debt on commercial properties. I advised them to take the bankruptcy route. I am thankful that both of them are in a better place today. That is the methodology that should be used to deal with the problem. If there are bodies which are acting through solicitors and accountancy firms, they should be reported to the accountancy and legal bodies. That is where we should start. I would have no problem in naming and shaming the fellows who show up with dogs and wearing hoods. We need to have the courage to name them.</p>
          <p eId="para_304"> I welcome the Minister of State's contribution and the fact that the Minister will examine the issue. However, the Minister and the rest of us who are members of the Government parties need to do a little more than examine this issue and the mortgage crisis. My parliamentary party was promised a statement six or eight weeks ago, but I have not yet heard it. I would like to hear soon how we will deal with this issue. Senator Mark Daly has said the crisis is being experienced now. I would not in any way rely on the banks we bailed out to offer any solution. They must be told what to do and made do it. That is the only way to deal with the matter.</p>

        <speech by="#ColmBurke" eId="spk_111">
          <from>Senator Colm Burke<recordedTime time="2015-05-06T17:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_305">I welcome the Minister of State. In talking about receivers or liquidators it is important to state they must at all times act within the law. If they act outside it, action can be taken. I know that the Garda in co-operating with receivers will ensure they will at all times act not only within the law but also within the terms of a court order. That is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">It is not a case of receivers going in without the necessary backup in terms of legal documentation. If the documentation is not in order, they are in breach of the law.</p>
          <p eId="para_307"> Senator Mark Daly overlooked the point about why we were in this situation. It is because decisions were taken about lending which should never have occurred. I came across one example where a relationship had broken up and the girl had decided to hold onto the house. There was a €220,000 loan, but she did not have the capacity to repay it at any stage. To buy out her partner, a further €40,000 was borrowed and the father agreed to be guarantor for that sum. When I came across the problem, however, he was acting as guarantor for the full €260,000 without realising he had done so. We have had such cases where people were asked to sign guarantees. I have raised with the Department of Finance and the Department of Justice and Equality the issue of whether we should introduce regulations under which someone could not offer the family home as security for a commercial loan. That is one of the reasons we have ended up with this problem. I was surprised by the number of people who had had their spouses sign guarantees for commercial loans and, as a result, had put the family home under threat. There was an interesting case which involved a credit union in west Cork that had tried to take possession of a family home, but the High Court had refused to make the order. The husband had taken out a €500,000 loan to purchase development land, but it was devalued once there was a downturn in the market. The credit union then went after the family home. There were two families involved. The High Court decided that as the wives had not signed any documentation and even though credit unions had judgments against the borrowers, it would not allow these judgments to be used to take possession of the family home. When the family home is involved, the money borrowed should only be used in that respect and not for commercial loans. We need to seriously consider and deal with the issue of such loans.</p>
          <p eId="para_308"> Much emphasis has been placed on a heavy-gang being involved in repossessions. I have come across cases where it was necessary to take repossession, for instance, where people living outside the jurisdiction were collecting rents through agents, yet making no repayments to banks. At the same time, they had the gall to let these properties to innocent people. One family had moved from Dublin to Cork where they rented a property. They were there three months and their children were attending a local school when they suddenly found the sheriff knocking on the door. Even though there were judgments against the person who owned the property, the tenants had not been so advised. The bank had then obtained an order for repossession. If we want to protect tenants, we should examine the issue of tenancy. Why is it that we do not have sufficient protection for tenants? In other European countries there are 20-year leases and tenants are protected no matter who owns a property. We need to do that here. That is what happens in the case of commercial properties and where there is a lease and tenants can be protected. I do not see why we cannot do the same in the case of rented property. Many people with young families now have no option but to rent. We should, therefore, re-examine tenancy legislation to ensure that, regardless of who owns a property, the tenant is protected. If there is an order for repossession, the bank can take it over, but it should not move a tenant out if it is his or her family home and he or she has no other place to go. We need to examine this important issue. </p>
          <p eId="para_309"> It is wrong to say receivers act in a heavy-handed manner all the time. They must act within the rules and if they breach the law in any way, they are accountable and cannot overuse their powers. The law should be properly interpreted by receivers who cannot exceed their jurisdiction. I am in favour of the Government's amendment, but we need to protect tenants where families are involved.</p>

          <p eId="para_310">I welcome the Minister of State back to the House. I commend Senators Rónán Mullen, Gerard P. Craughwell and Feargal Quinn for tabling the motion. As we are all aware, the ongoing debt crisis is continuing to dominate the lives of countless people across Ireland. Unfortunately, the Government's personal insolvency legislation has been a failure to date, with an abysmally slow take-up.</p>
          <p eId="para_311"> It was interesting to hear Senator Tony Mulcahy's contribution and I agree with every single word he said. I am amazed to say I also agree with everything Senator aideen Hayden said. I apologise I was not present for other colleagues' contributions because I had a meeting to attend.</p>
          <p eId="para_312"> We have a difficulty with receiverships. As colleagues outlined, a receiver can be appointed for a property by a court or under a mortgage deed. That is fine if it is necessary to do so where every attempt by a financial institution to regain the money loaned has failed. It is sometimes as a last resort, but it is also used as a first resort by financial institutions. </p>
          <p eId="para_313"> I have been a Member of this House for almost 14 years and in that period the issue of receiverships and financial institutions' repossessing machinery has been raised from time to time. I have raised it myself. Since the financial tsunami hit this country, finance companies and other financial institutions have, unfortunately, become a law unto themselves. I am aware of many cases where bully boy tactics have been used to recover machinery and other goods from decent people who, in some instances, have paid over 90% of the money back, yet late at night or in the early hours of the morning people who can only be described as thugs arrive and use force to take back that machinery or property. The way receivers conduct themselves in some instances, although not in all, leaves a lot to be desired. Regulation is urgently needed. </p>
          <p eId="para_314"> The Minister of State should ask his senior Government colleagues to examine another aspect of receivership. I am aware of cases where property had been up for sale prior to the receiver taking control of it. It was sold for far less than it was worth before the receiver took over.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">That is happening wholesale throughout the country. We have heard about Siteserv and all these other things happening, but on every day of the week throughout the country banks are doing sweetheart deal through receiverships. First, such a policy deprives the financial institution of the full worth of the property. Second, those who have been bailed out by the taxpayer deprive the taxpayer from getting money back. That is a fact and it is wrong. It is another reason there should be very tight regulation on receiverships.</p>
          <p eId="para_316"> I have another question for the Minister of State. Did anyone ever check how much the financial institutions that are guaranteed by the State pay public relations consultants? The use of such consultants is another tactic that has been used to sully the name of ordinary decent people who got themselves into financial difficulties through no fault of their own. I would like the Minister of State to answer that question, if at all possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_317"> Bankruptcy has been mentioned and I agree that the period should be reduced to one year. The bank veto is wrong and should be changed. There are arrangements that can be put together which will see financial institutions regain quite a substantial amount of the money, in some cases but not all. However, the veto means banks will not come to a deal and that is the reality. If it takes the reduction of the period of bankruptcy to 12 months then that is what we should do. We must approach this matter in a logical manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_318"> Once again, I compliment my colleagues, Senators Craughwell, Mullen and Quinn, who tabled the motion. I thank the Minister of State for coming here on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p>

          <p eId="para_321">I want to say a few words on this important issue while the Minister of State is present. Receivership is the most important issue that affects us all, in Government and in Opposition, and anyone we know. Last Saturday, I visited a woman whose bank has refused to co-operate with her personal insolvency practitioner, a scenario which says it all. She had agreed, with the assistance of her PIP, to set up a payment and had taken in a student because she would quality for €12,000 of the money from doing that being free from tax. Unfortunately, Permanent TSB offered her just three options: to get out, give the house to the bank or sell the house. If she agreed to do so, she would be left homeless. Last week her PIP wrote the following to the bank:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_322">I find your approach to the issue astonishing. There is no argument to the fact that the debtor is in arrears but she has seen that your sole objective in this case is to recover your money and take the house.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">The fact is the house is in positive equity. It is also located in a poorer area of Dublin which is a good area and has good people living there. One option the bank gave the woman was to trade down. I do not believe one could trade down much further than Jobstown. She owns the house but all the bank has done is offer to take her house. The letter continued:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_324">The fact that the house is in positive equity now seems to strengthen your position, in your view. Your letter lists various options the debtor has but all of them involve the bank realising its money in full. You give no thought to the debtor or to the Irish taxpayer. If the debtor has to sell the property she will be forced to go on the housing list in south Dublin. The Irish taxpayer has bailed you out and you allow for nothing, which serves the stress of this situation on this woman is having to bear.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_325"> I wish to appeal this decision and the grounds for appeal are: That she has now been allowed her mortgage interest supplement; she is taking in a student for college; and she will receive the €100 per week for a period of 8 months. This will mean that she can afford the interest repayment of €407 per month, as outlined in our telephone conversation.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">This appeal was refused last week. What is the bank trying to do? Is it trying to recover a property that is in positive equity? Does it wish to sell it on? Does it want to put the woman out of her home and leave her homeless? This is only one case I know of. I wanted to mention the case while the Minister of State was present because something needs to be done quickly to resolve the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_327"> I noted that the Minister of State said "the Government has already made it clear [which I am aware of and he has done so himself] that it will shortly be announcing a package of measures to support the existing framework and improve the uptake of personal insolvency solutions". The person I mentioned availed of the personal insolvency solution but got short shift. Therefore, we need an independent analysis of receivership. The banks should not have the right to say to a personal insolvency agency: "Sorry, we are not listening to you." We must veto the banks saying such things.</p>
          <p eId="para_328"> The Minister of State continued: "The overall aim of the Government's approach to this issue remains the same as it has always been, which is to ensure that a full range of options is available". In reality, the options that are being offered at the moment are poor. In this case, the bank suggested the woman trade down even though she had offered to pay the money. Granted, she is in arrears and there is no denying that fact. She had a business but fell on hard times through suffering a separation. The Minister of State also stated that the Government's aim is "to keep as many people in their homes as possible". I will forward this letter by a PIP agent to the Minister of State because it will prove worthwhile in terms of research.</p>

          <p eId="para_330">I thank all the contributors and thank the Minister of State for his response. Of course the following is not his fault as his statement was prepared for him and he was asked to carry the brief for the senior Minister in his Department. During his contribution it struck me that I was listening to hand-wringing which was followed by hand-washing and it appeared that the Government was not taking this major problem seriously. I commend Senator Hayden, in particular, on her fine speech which was gripping, compelling, knowledgeable and informed, as her contributions are always. If there was a free vote, Senator Hayden would back this motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_331"> Notwithstanding the hand-wringing, followed by apparent hand-washing, it turned out that the Government was just being mean-spirited. The Minister of State's response carried the tone and reflected the Government's amendment that it was not taking these concerns seriously at all. In fact, what he tried to do is hide in plain sight that he recognises there is validity to what is in the motion. The Minister of State has given a commitment that the Minister will undertake an analysis of the issue to look at the conduct of receivers. He also acknowledged the problem that receivers appointed need not be members of regulated professions. Those are the two issues at the core of the motion. He would garner a lot better PR for himself if he congratulated us on being right on the issue and saying the Government does mean to act on this. If he had done so, he would have been congratulated, and deservedly so. Instead, we experienced a schoolboy debating tactic, and I refer not to the Minister of State's speech but to the Government amendment. The pathetic claim was made, rightly contradicted by Senator Hayden, that there is no compelling evidence that this sector requires the introduction of regulations to govern conduct. If there is no such compelling evidence, why is the Minister committing to looking into it? Do Ministers talk to each other at all?</p>

          <p eId="para_333">Some excellent points were made on related issues. In particular, Senators Craughwell and Wilson spoke about the problem of sweetheart deals and the behaviour of banks. I know of one builder in Galway, when a receiver was being appointed to properties with a view to banks selling these properties, who said he was not going to give them to the receiver. He wanted to do up the houses and have them ready for sale because the receiver would sell them at a low price thus leaving him with a higher remaining debt. That is the disgraceful treatment meted out to people who are trying to do honest business but got in trouble partly because of the bad behaviour of banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_334"> There is no validity to the Minister of State's response where he said that the rules of the superior courts may not be adjusted by the Minister. There is nothing that the Government cannot make possible through legislation, subject to the requirements of the Constitution. It would be within the ability and remit of the Minister to ask that rules be made. The Minister is already required to concur in rules being made by the courts. The power exists in the 2009 legislation to make regulations about receivership. Why not have powers to govern the conduct of receivers?</p>
          <p eId="para_335">Why not be more prescriptive in legislation, as that legislation would allow for the making of regulations? That is the reason I refer to the responses given here as being more at the level of schoolboy debating tactics, which try to nit pick in order to knock down a point. It is clear that if the will existed, the legislation could be brought forward by the Government. God knows, in recent times it has already brought forward some quite crazy legislation that goes against the public interest and has done so just because it can. I believe that where there is a serious problem disclosed by the behaviour of receivers, the Government could introduce the necessary legislation and regulations, whether under the 2009 legislation or in some other miscellaneous provisions legislation. Please do not insult the intelligence of Members of the House by saying the Minister cannot make rules, when legislation is all that is required to give the Minister the necessary powers to insist regulations be made.</p>
          <p eId="para_336"> I thank the Minister of State for the grudging acknowledgement that action is needed in this area and I look forward to the promised review into the conduct of receivers and to their coming before the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality in due course.</p>

          <p eId="para_376">I welcome the opportunity to discuss the spring economic statement which was agreed by the Government and unveiled last week by the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform. The spring economic statement sets out the progress made on economic and budgetary matters since the Government took office just over four years ago. I believe and think the people believe these achievements have been significant. Let us reflect for a few moments on the achievements made in the past few years. </p>
          <p eId="para_377"> Economic growth is now stellar. The economy grew by 4.8% last year, the fastest rate of growth in Europe. The current forecast is for a growth rate of 4% this year, which is likely to be near the top of the European growth league table again. Importantly, the recovery has been jobs rich. An additional 95,000 people are in work in Ireland since the low point in mid-2012. We can often get lost behind figures and data. However, that means that 95,000 people are now bringing home a pay cheque to the family who were not in a position to do so in mid-2012.</p>
          <p eId="para_378"> Unemployment has fallen by over five percentage points since its peak and is likely to dip below 10% in the coming months. The jobs lost during the crisis are being recovered in a very real way. By the end of 2018 the Department of Finance is expecting that all of the jobs lost during the economic crisis will have been replaced. The economic downturn meant that some of Ireland's best and brightest had to leave the country in order to find work. The recovery is set to reverse this trend, with a return to inward migration from 2017 onwards. We can now begin in earnest to ask our young people and the not so young who felt they needed to leave these shores to come home again.</p>
          <p eId="para_379"> The public finances have been put on a sustainable footing, with the deficit set to be well below the 3% target for this year. Debt levels, while still too high, are on a firm downward trajectory and set to move towards the European average in the next few years.</p>
          <p eId="para_380"> As a result of the huge sacrifices made by the people since the crisis, the Government is now in a position to implement another mildly expansionary budget this year and every year to 2020, if deemed appropriate. The spring economic statement sets out a strategy designed to put an end to the failed boom and bust model of the past. Instead, a continuation of sensible medium-term focused economic and budgetary policies will secure sustained and balanced growth in the remainder of this decade. The statement is just one part of a much broader reform of the budgetary framework. The next phase in the framework is the national economic dialogue when the Government and relevant stakeholders will discuss the most effective and equitable way to achieve our objectives. Discussions will be based on the imperative of fiscal responsibility and what is in the long-term best interests of the people. No longer can the economy be run in election cycles. The new structures will ensure policy-making will be consistent with broader societal and economic objectives.</p>
          <p eId="para_381"> Turning to the economic situation, I am greatly encouraged by the latest data which show that the recovery is gaining momentum, with the economy growing at the fastest rate in Europe. It grew by 4.8% in 2014 and is forecast to grow by 4% this year. As a result, real GDP is set to exceed its pre-crisis peak by end of the year. In the remainder of the decade our forecasts indicate the economy has the capacity to grow by around 3% to 3.75% per annum, with positive contributions from both exports and domestic demand. The economic recovery is perhaps most clearly evident in the labour market where we have now had nine successive quarters of employment growth, representing an increase of 95,000 jobs since the low-point of the crisis. Encouragingly, the latest data show that employment gains have been driven by increases in the numbers of full-time positions and that the recovery is broad based, with 11 of the 14 sectors of the economy seeing employment gains. As a result, the Government's highly ambitious employment target of 100,000 additional jobs in 2016 will be met one year early. These figures are testament to the continued success of the Government's Action Plan for Jobs which will help to ensure there will be more people working in Ireland by 2020 than ever before in the history of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_382"> The spring economic statement highlights the Government's continuing focus on job creation. It highlights sector-specific interventions, for example, in hospitality, tourism and construction. Sector-specific strategies also play a vital role in ensuring Ireland's continued competitiveness and attractiveness as a location for inward investment. For example, in my own area of sectoral responsibility last month the Government launched its new strategy for international financial services. The IFS 2020 strategy sets out an ambitious target to increase the number of people employed in Ireland's IFS sector by 30% in the coming five years, representing a net increase of 10,000 jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">This is just one example of how Ireland's economic development will be driven in the future by sustainable growth in high value-added sectors of the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_384"> Historically, there were fewer than 60 people employed in international financial services, IFS, companies in Ireland during the late 1980s. Today, there are more than 35,000 people directly employed in IFS companies, with thousands of more jobs indirectly supported. IFS is now a truly national sector of the economy, with significant numbers employed outside the IFSC, across Dublin city and county, and in numerous regional locations such as Cork, Galway, Limerick, Kerry, Waterford, Kilkenny, Louth and Donegal.</p>
          <p eId="para_385"> Growing the numbers employed in IFS by 30% over five years is a highly ambitious but achievable target and one that the Government aims to achieve by implementing our new strategy in full. This strategy sets out a long-term vision for Ireland. To help realise the vision we have set five strategic priorities and 30 concrete actions and we are already getting on with the body of work of implementing these. I outline this to the House because IFS2020 is an example of how Government is focused on driving growth across all sectors of the economy. This strategy is matched by a number of other strategies in important areas of our economy, where we plan to continue to grow jobs and real economic growth in the coming years. </p>
          <p eId="para_386"> Putting the public finances on a sound and sustainable footing has been the main priority of this Government since taking office. Prudent management of the public finances is essential to support economic growth and ensure that there will be no return to the boom and bust model of the past. The people have suffered too much from that and have had enough. To that end, the Government set out a series of fiscal targets to bring down the deficit in a credible and controlled manner and, I am pleased to say, the Government has overachieved each and every year on this target. The deficit in this country fell from €15 billion in 2011 to €4.5 billion this year. The Department of Finance is now forecasting a deficit of 2.3% of GDP in 2015, with Ireland set to exit the excessive deficit procedure by the end of this year. This could not have been achieved without significant reductions in public expenditure. For instance, last year gross voted expenditure amounted to some €54 billion, a reduction of over €3.4 billion from 2011. During that period, current spending was reduced by over 4% and capital spending fell by 23%. These reductions had to be made at a time of increased demands on public services, particularly in the areas of social protection, health and education. </p>
          <p eId="para_387"> To ensure that expenditure was better managed and that these demands were met, the Government implemented a series of reforms. Reforms include the introduction of multi-annual expenditure ceilings, regular comprehensive reviews of public expenditure to make sure we are getting value for taxpayers' money, the publication of the updated public spending code, the implementation of performance budgeting initiatives, and the establishment of the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service.</p>
          <p eId="para_388"> The European Union fiscal rules will serve as a tool to help us responsibly manage our recovery. The key lesson that we have learnt is that increases in spending must be commensurate with increases in growth. We cannot be spending more than we are bringing in in growth. Public expenditure must be sustainable. We must use evidence-based decision making to ensure that our investment maximises value for money and growth in the longer term, while also, crucially, ensuring that we protect the vulnerable in society.</p>
          <p eId="para_389"> A new set of rules will apply from 2016 onwards, which will require us to make progress towards a balanced budget in structural terms. These rules are designed to ensure that fiscal policy enhances economic growth and macro-economic stability. As the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan explained last week, the Government has secured agreement from the European Commission to a change in the application of the rules. This is a really important development for our country. As a result, fiscal space of the order of €1.2 billion, and up to €1.5 billion, will be available for tax cuts and public expenditure increases in budget 2016. Our partners in government have also agreed that the fiscal space will be split evenly between tax reductions and investments in public services. That is a prudent approach at this time. Our forecasts indicate that a similar amount of space will be available in later years, while still ensuring the achievement of a budget surplus before the end of the decade. In other words, as a country, we can afford to reduce the burden of tax on work by in and around €640 million this coming budget, the budget after that and the budget after that one. This amounts to nearly €2 billion worth of tax cuts on work, while investing, at the same time, in crucial front-line public services. </p>
          <p eId="para_390"> Reducing the debt remains a key objective of this Government. Putting debt on a firm downward trajectory will enhance the resilience of the economy to shocks of any origin and help ensure a sustained recovery in the years ahead. It will also better position Ireland to manage demographic pressures over the coming years. The Government has already made significant advances in reducing the burden of debt through reducing the interest rate on the European loans provided under the programme, securing agreement to extend the maturity of the European loans, replacing the promissory notes with very long-dated Government bonds and replacing just over €18 billion of IMF loans with cheaper market-based funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_391"> When we came to government, we were told by our predecessors that we could not change one full stop in the IMF-EU bailout programme. This is proof that we did it and continue to do it and, as a result, the cost of servicing that debt has continued to fall with interest rates on ten year Irish Government bonds now at effectively historic lows. The debt-to-GDP ratio will continue to decline as the recovery continues and is expected to fall to 100% of GDP by the end of 2016, converging towards the EU average in the years ahead. Of course, our net debt position, which takes account of the cash the NTMA is holding and other assets, is much lower. We have improved the cashflow for this country over the next decade by about €40 billion as a result of the successful negotiations that this Government has undertaken with its international partners. </p>
          <p eId="para_392"> As my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, set out last week, our improved fiscal position means that we will look to increase gross voted current expenditure by an additional €600 million to €750 million for 2016. This will allow us to manage demographic pressures and to make crucial investments in key public services. This is something I am sure Senators on all sides of this House will welcome. </p>
          <p eId="para_393"> Ireland's general population has increased by nearly half a million in the past decade. We have the highest percentage of people aged under 15 in the European Union. Life expectancy has also risen and now almost 13% of our population are over 65 years of age. By 2021, this will have increased by close to 40% from a decade earlier. While positive, these changes present challenges for our public services in terms of looking after our young people and giving our older people dignity in their older years.</p>
          <p eId="para_394"> In the health area, demographic changes will cost an estimated €200 million per year over the coming years. The cost of paying for the two main State pension schemes alone is projected to increase by €200 million per year out to 2026. This Government is committed to maintaining the State pension. In education, the number of school children is set to increase every year over the next six years. By 2021, we will need an extra 3,500 teachers at primary and secondary level to provide education to an additional 50,000 pupils. These are quite astonishing numbers. The number of third level students is also projected to increase by 20,000 in the same period. As a country and as a Government, we need to plan to ensure our public finances can meet these demographic challenges.</p>
          <p eId="para_395"> Thanks to the hard won economic recovery, we are now in a position to increase investment in our infrastructure. We will do this in a strategic way by ensuring maximum value for money and focusing on future needs. The new capital plan, which will be published by Government in June, will identify priority areas for investment in key areas that will increase our capacity for growth and our ability to respond to social needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_396"> We believe that that the quality of our education system is a key determinant of future living standards. In the lifetime of this Government, over 150 new schools will have been built. We are providing higher education programmes and services for almost 164,000 full-time students at third level and 270,000 places on further education and training programmes. We will continue to ensure the continual development of our workforce to allow our citizens to be at the forefront of new technology and the creation of high value jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_397"> I think everyone would acknowledge, and rightly so, that we now have a considerably more efficient and productive public service. I pay tribute to all of our public servants and civil servants. These are our teachers, nurses, gardaí, people working at the front line day in, day out, who have had to continue to reform and, in many cases, to do more with less. They have done so with great dignity and great dedication. Public service reform has allowed us to provide additional resources to front-line services, including nurses, gardaí and teachers. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, described this as the reform dividend.</p>
          <p eId="para_398"> Last week Deputy Howlin announced his intention to commence discussions with the trade unions on the issue of public service pay. All public servants have had their pay reduced significantly. These reductions were made on the basis of financial emergency legislation. As the economy recovers, we need to ensure that remuneration and the cost of the public service more generally are managed to ensure that they remain sustainable. We need to acknowledge that by working together with our public service unions we managed to negotiate public sector pay agreements in very difficult times. Now, as a country, when we are in a better time, we need to continue that process of constructive engagement and dialogue in order to plan for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_399"> The hard-won gains of the last four years must not be put at risk by the tax and spend policies of the Opposition. As the Minister, Deputy Noonan, explained last week, lower taxes on income will support more jobs. That is what this Government began to do in the last budget, it is what we will do in the next Government and it is what the Opposition voted against. Higher taxes will cost thousands upon thousands of jobs. The Government will continue to support job creation through a reduction in income tax and USC in the next budget and in future budgets if re-elected. It is vital that the prudent and sustainable pro-growth budgetary policies of this Government are continued to secure a lasting improvement in living standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_400"> We cannot repeat the mistakes of previous governments. Renewed prosperity must be on the basis of responsible government and strategic investment in the productive capacity of our people. The Irish people deserve no less. We must learn the lessons of the past decade and not repeat the mistakes that brought us to ruin. The spring economic statement outlines a roadmap for us to follow. We owe this to the Irish people. I look forward to the debate.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianODomhnaill" eId="spk_124">
          <from>Senator Brian Ó Domhnaill<recordedTime time="2015-05-06T19:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_401">I welcome the Minister of State to the House. This debate gives us an opportunity to reflect on the Government's recent announcement, the spring statement, which focused on expenditure and income from a public finance point of view. I apologise at the outset for being a little late. I was at another meeting. Earlier, we had a discussion in the House and I spoke to the Leader on the need for a vision for the country and how we spend our money going forward, whether on the revenue or capital side. We need to set a plan for the country, and to involve the people, in terms of reducing the deficit or spending any additional revenues that may become available as a result of increased tax revenues as a result of people returning to work with a consequent reduction in the strain on social welfare. Every citizen should be involved in that.</p>
          <p eId="para_402"> The spring statement was a good document, but there was nothing new announced in it. In reality, it is probably a springboard to accelerate the Government into an election cycle. Having said that and having read the statement, the Government will depend on citizens if it is to include everyone in the recovery and to reap the fruits. I was taken aback that entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship was not mentioned at all in the document. Self-employment was only cited once. I have a copy of the document here. I do not understand that as we should be trying to promote an indigenous entrepreneurial spirit within the country. As such, I was taken aback that the self-employed were not mentioned. Part-time workers who are in a crucial category in terms of upskilling and setting up their own businesses were only mentioned twice in the document. Again, we are depending on people to lift the country forward, yet these two cohorts of workers and entrepreneurs were only mentioned in passing.</p>
          <p eId="para_403"> The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, referred to the need to be prudent and to the outlook for various expansionary budgets, as he termed them, between now and 2020, depending, of course, on revenues being made available. The Minister spoke of an increased availability of resources of between €1.2 billion and €1.5 billion for the 2016 budget. He spoke about a 50:50 split in terms of that money coming from tax revenue and savings. It does not make a lot of sense and I would like an explanation. If one looks at where we have been heretofore, the projection does not stack up. It has not been 50:50 to date. In fact, the deficit reduction was brought about in the 2014-15 fiscal cycle by a 50% increase in taxation, 4% GDP growth, a 9% reduction in Government expenditure and 27% from other factors.</p>
          <p eId="para_404"> Job creation and wealth creation are key to the future economic prosperity of the country. I fully agree with the Minister of State that we need to create a culture of allowing people to work. We need to cut the burden on those who are self-employed to give them a cushion for taking risk. We must cut tax burdens across the board to try to get the entrepreneurial spirit motivated. In doing that, we must ensure that the benefits of prosperity are shared by all irrespective of where a person lives or to what social class he or she belongs.</p>
          <p eId="para_405"> Unfortunately, that is where the Government is getting it drastically wrong. There has been a non-existent focus in Government spending on the regions. Any economist will tell one that for every €1 spent by the public sector, the private sector will spend at least €1.30 on top of that. If the focus of Government expenditure is the capital and other cities and not the regions, we will not have economic development in the regions or balanced regional job creation. We saw in the recent NERI report that 94,000 jobs were created over a 12 month period, of which 95% were created in Dublin or the commuter belt.</p>

          <from>Senator John Gilroy<recordedTime time="2015-05-06T19:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_406">That is not true.</p>

          <p eId="para_407">That is a fact and it was set out in a report written by Dr. Michael Collins of NERI. This well-researched document, which I have read, was dismissed last week in the House by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton. I went back and researched the document again. It is a factual report based on actual facts from the Central Statistics Office. I do not know why Deputy Bruton questioned the figures given that they come from the CSO and are Government figures. They are not my figures or NERI figures; they are from the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_408"> In the north west region, zero jobs were created by the agencies while a number were created in the south east. My point is that the focus of economic growth is Dublin and its commuter belt. That is wrong. We need a balanced regional development strategy for the country which includes the north west, the south east and south west. If that does not happen, the emigration cycle that has hollowed out rural Ireland will continue. People will continue to leave not only to go abroad but to go to Dublin. That is not necessarily a bad thing, as we need a strong Dublin. Members spend half the week in Dublin and it needs to be strong. We all support having a good, strong capital city, but we must ensure that the forecast by Teagasc and the CSO that 60% of the population will live within 25 miles of the east coast by 2025 does not come to pass. That cycle must be broken. The only agency that can do it is the Government through its various bodies. The Government must decide to ensure that the west, south west and south east are important. If we continue with the cycle as it is going, the vast majority of the population will live within 25 miles of the east coast.</p>
          <p eId="para_409"> There are many areas on which we could touch, but there is an equality issue at the core of recovery. We could go into the definition of "equality" in terms of deprivation indexes, Government figures by agency, etc., but we do not have time today. However, I will touch on one issue. While the Government has made some progress on it, the issue is a much bigger one than it realises. Political will is required to take it on. I refer to the whole issue of personal debt. There is an issue of government debt, which is being dealt with as it is being reduced on foot of an existing fiscal strategy. The private debt issue in the country, however, is spiralling out of control. The banks are being clogged. In my own county, 250 cases relating to family home repossessions are waiting to go before the Circuit Court in July. That is only one county.</p>
          <p eId="para_410"> Protection for the citizen against the banks must be put in place. Senators Mullen and Craughwell proposed a Private Members' motion. The banks seem to have all of the financial wherewithal and expertise and to be bullying home owners, mortgage holders and people who find themselves in other personal debt difficulties. The State must intervene and protect the citizen. The banks cannot be left all of the expertise and protections. An intervention must happen if we are to have a recovery for everyone. The IMF has written a report claiming that the Irish banks are performing well and are back in profit, but they are back in profit because they are riding roughshod over the people who owe them money and were given loans even though the banks should have known beforehand that they were already going down the swanny. The Government needs to protect citizens. Some 300,000 people are in negative equity and 110,000 people are in mortgage arrears. Those families are up against the wall.</p>
          <p eId="para_411"> It is not an easy issue to address and it would be easy for politicians on our side to blame the Government. The Government is not necessarily to blame, but it will be if it stands by and does nothing about this.</p>

          <p eId="para_413">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and congratulate him on how clearly he set out the aims and ideals of the plan as embodied in the spring economic statement. They are ambitious but obtainable. It is a good programme as he has outlined it to us.</p>
          <p eId="para_414"> Apart from being a European requirement, this is a useful exercise in the management of our economy as well as in charting our recovery from the brink of the collapse that the Government inherited. Rescuing the economy and saving the country were of paramount importance. We did not want to default, nor did we want to leave the eurozone. As such, a clear plan to secure the stabilisation of the economy and keep the country pointing in the right direction was essential. There is no doubt that our people have shown great patience and resilience during the crisis. We are indebted to them for all of their hard work and sacrifices. We are glad that the troika is gone from our shores and that the bailout is over, but we must not forget that the recovery still requires nurturing. It is heartening to know that we are the fastest growing economy in the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_415"> Repairing the public finances is a work in progress, but Government borrowing has radically reduced and interest rates are thankfully at an all-time low. Too many people are out of work, but it is good to know that unemployment levels have fallen to 10% from a high of more than 15%, with employment levels at their highest since 2009.</p>
          <p eId="para_416"> The spring economic statement sets out the Government's five-year plan to 2020 for securing and strengthening the recovery. At the heart of this plan is a commitment to protecting our national competitiveness and stability in the public finances. This will ensure an improved climate for job creation, which remains a top priority. More jobs will mean more resources to fund services and reduce taxes on those already at work. The Government's commitment of 100,000 jobs is about to be achieved one year ahead of target. This will lead to more Irish people returning to the country to take up employment than are leaving. By 2018, every job lost by the previous Government will have been replaced, with more sustainable jobs in the pipeline. By 2019, there will be more people working than ever before.</p>
          <p eId="para_417"> The Government's targets are ambitious and will only be achieved if we continue making the right choices. We are committed to the path that continues reducing the burden of taxation on enterprise and employment, improves our attractiveness for investment and expansion and ignores calls from whatever quarter for a return to the reckless tax and spending policies that destroyed the public finances. The planned targets require a steady growth of between 3% and 3.5% per year, not boom and bust. Steady growth of this nature will eliminate the remaining deficit and bring government debt below average European levels without new taxes or charges. We have moved away from the "when we have it, we spend it" approach to budget management espoused by previous Governments.</p>

          <p eId="para_419">Our small business sector needs more support. This, please God, is in the pipeline. Many people have not yet witnessed the benefits of our recovering economy and some families are still struggling to make ends meet. However, if we hold our heads, the situation will continue to improve. The Minister for Finance will have more scope to assist matters further in the upcoming budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_420"> The addition of an annual spring statement sets out the broad directions needed for growing the economy and repairing the public finances, ensuring a fair sharing out of the benefits of the recovery among those already at work. Private sector employers are once again agreeing sustainable pay increases with their staff and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, has announced the Government's decision to commence discussions with trade unions on the issue of public service pay. All public servants have had their pay cut significantly. Most are also working longer hours. The size of the public service has been reduced by 10% at a time of growing demand for its services. However, all of this was necessary to help us secure stability in the public finances and our national economic recovery. With further improvement occurring, the right time is approaching to open up the prospect of a gradual, sustainable pay recovery for public servants from 2016 onwards linked to continuing reforms in terms of efficiency and effectiveness.</p>
          <p eId="para_421"> The plan's aim is to offer fair rewards for hard work, not quick profits for speculation. The USC introduced by the previous Government was an emergency penal tax on low and middle-income families. This Government intends to accelerate its phased abolition. Some 330,000 low-income families have been removed from the USC. In the last budget, an additional 80,000 low-income families were removed, the two lower rates were cut and those on the minimum wage were removed from the higher USC rate. It is intended that the upcoming budget will bring to 500,000 the total number of low-income workers who have been removed from the USC net. It is also intended to cut the 7% rate of USC on all those earning up to €70,000 per year. It is also intended to end the unfair tax treatment of the self-employed and small business people.</p>
          <p eId="para_422"> Strong growth in jobs is funding tax cuts for workers. Less tax on work means more jobs. The plan will reinforce a virtuous circle of increasing living standards, lower taxes, job creation and improving public finances. Our plan will ensure that work pays more than welfare and reduce the number of workers and their families experiencing poverty. Once the low pay commission makes its recommendation in July, the Government intends to respond with a package of measures in the October budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_423"> There is a renewed optimism in the country. The Government will continue working night and day to secure the recovery. At the next election, the people will have a clear choice between a stable and coherent Government that will secure and strengthen the recovery or instability. Populist promises to reverse every tough decision are nothing but empty rhetoric, irresponsible leadership and bad politics. They are not the solution to our problems. I have every confidence that when the time comes, the people will make the right choice.</p>

        <speech by="#SeanDBarrett" eId="spk_131">
          <from>Senator Sean D. Barrett<recordedTime time="2015-05-06T19:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_424">As always, I welcome the Minister of State to the House. Dr. Stephen Kinsella of the University of Limerick wrote about the spring exercise: "This balancing act deserves applause". What the Ministers, Deputies Noonan and Howlin, are trying to do is commendable, namely, that we not revert to a boom-and-bust cycle. Where I have just come from, the banking inquiry, will have a role to play in that. A new regulation of banks will be required to ensure that credit does not explode as it did to create the property bubble.</p>
          <p eId="para_425"> I will turn to the exercise that the Minister of State has attempted to set out before us.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">How many additional resources are coming on stream and how will the balance be achieved between reduced taxation and increased services? This is up for debate under the semester process and I look forward to seeing how public opinion develops in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_427"> The Minister of State outlined extensively the progress that we have made. An interesting analysis by Cormac Lucey indicates that the 2014 deficit was 0.9% of GDP ahead of target. The IMF observed that 0.3% of GDP growth came from EU accounting changes which incorporate the proceeds of crime and international output, 0.6% came from higher than expected tax revenues and 0.4% came from lower than expected interest charges. Any of these could turn against us, which is why the spring economic statement builds in sensitivity tests for current expenditure, while capital proposals will be evaluated later this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_428"> We tend to lose control over grandiose capital projects. The cost-benefit analysis guidelines which are expected in July will be important in this regard. I proposed amendments to the Roads Bill 2014 to make cost-benefit analyses obligatory. In regard to the track costs of roads, UK studies allocate maintenance costs at approximately 15% of capital costs, based on the number of axles on and torque power of various vehicles. The research suggests that we can get better value from money out of roads. The capacity of a motorway is 55,000 vehicles per day. There is no point in building them on routes with lower traffic volumes. In this new parsimonious era, I am sure that will be kept in mind.</p>
          <p eId="para_429"> Current expenditure between 2014 and 2020 is projected to remain virtually unchanged. The figures are €49.75 billion in 2014 and €48.375 in 2020. Approximately €1 billion of the adjustment will be made on the expenditure side. On the tax side, the projection increases from €41.2 billion in 2014 to €52.9 billion in 2020. That is where the major adjustment will take place. Perhaps that balance needs further investigation because people are wondering when GDP growth will mean something to them as taxpayers. Of course, they are also annoyed at being forced to bail out the banks. The spring economic statement projections are heavily dependent on increased tax revenue from growth. The projections for growth can be inaccurate. Few people besides Morgan Kelly noticed what was going wrong after 2005. Sometimes it is a good idea to slow down the forecasters and wait until we actually see growth before dividing up the benefits. Projections based on dividing growth between taxes and expenditure can become unstuck if the growth is not as expected.</p>
          <p eId="para_430"> We are currently educating more people than most other European countries, with about two thirds of school leavers going on to some form of further education. This is a major reason why firms come here. Between the €3,000 paid by students and the €8,000 provided by the Government, Irish third level institutions are achieving world rankings for €11,000 per student. It would cost four to five times that figure in the United States, from where we are attracting enterprises. People are sometimes pessimistic because of what is going wrong but this is one area that is doing well. The quality of our graduates is good and they are not as expensive as in other parts of the world. I am sure that is one of the reasons why the United States is a leading source of foreign direct investment to Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_431"> I will not bore Members with my opinions on tourism. However, continued growth in the tourism sector requires us not to sell Aer Lingus. It has developed nine routes into this country and it carries 4.8 million passengers across the north Atlantic. British Airways has not developed any routes from Scotland, Manchester, with a catchment population of 15 million, or Birmingham, with a catchment of 11 million. Let us allow our iconic brand to generate the returns this country needs in tourism.</p>
          <p eId="para_432"> I do not know the purpose of post codes given that 98% of post is already delivered by the next day. It appears to be a technological project which will cost us money but I do not know what it is supposed to achieve. It certainly is not doing anything for the postal system. I question the level of return on energy savings when energy prices are falling but I am sure the budget will be adjusted accordingly.</p>
          <p eId="para_433"> International comparisons are important, particularly given that house prices were far out of line with anywhere else. I recall the regular column in <i>The Irish Times</i> which showed what €100,000 would buy in Dublin compared with everywhere else. One might purchase a castle in Germany or France for the same price as a semi-detached house in Dublin. That has to be our reference point. There is no sense in eroding economic competitiveness by using our hard-won gains to pay higher asset prices. I fear there are signs in the greater Dublin area that these problems may be reappearing. It is no secret that we will need stricter regulation of the financial sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_434"> Perhaps some of the social programmes deserve better scrutiny. I do not think it is socially progressive to extend medical services to those aged under six years or over 70 years regardless of income if at the same time we neglect those aged between seven years and 69 years who are short on income. Until we resolve these problems, income redistribution should be focused on the needy rather than being universal.</p>
          <p eId="para_435"> We should also reflect on the mistakes made in the establishment of Irish Water to ensure that we never repeat them. It was supposed to be a conservation exercise but even though we discovered that the public sector was actually the major waster of water we hired all of those engineers into the new company. As Professor John FitzGerald, formerly from the ESRI, has noted, Irish Water has low productivity. We spent €500 million from the pension fund on meters before we decided on an altogether different system of pricing. Senators tabled interesting amendments. It is a pity that the Government did not accept some of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_436"> The Seanad could also play a role in assisting the Government in preparing development plans. The spring economic statement contains a number of good ideas and this House will assist the Government in its further endeavours in that regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_437">Senator Ó Domhnaill erroneously suggested that 95% of all jobs created were in the Dublin region. The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation put the true figure on the record when he addressed the House last week. He also reminded us that if one takes a narrow snapshot of statistics, one can find any result one wishes. However, the standardised techniques through which the CSO and other agencies collate their figures show that 95% of jobs were not created in the Dublin region in the last 12 months.</p>
          <p eId="para_438"> The Opposition made some half-hearted criticisms of the spring economic statement last week. There was no substance to most of the Opposition contributions, however. The statement is required under our fiscal rules and it is commonplace in other European states to issue similar statements. We are, therefore, standardising our procedures with best practice across Europe. I do not think anyone could be opposed to fiscal responsibility, although I wonder about the previous governments. We have managed to break the alignment of the electoral cycle with the economic cycle.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">We can see how the previous Government had become masters at aligning both in the past. We can point to the infamous free money known as SSIAs, which were designed to mature in the year before the election and bring with them the undoubted electoral advantage of giving people money for nothing, a consequence of which was the fuelling of an already overheated economy. </p>

          <p eId="para_451">It was the former leader of the Senator's party who coined the phrase and called it "boomier". The boom was going to get boomier.</p>
          <p eId="para_452"> Having spoken for a moment on our previous Government's role in fiscal irresponsibility, we should now talk about fiscal responsibility, which is what the economic statement is about. Jobs are the only show in town if we are to allow people feel the real benefits of the recovery. It is important that real people feel real benefits and that the recovery is not just seen at a macro level. We can point to the macro figures, which are all very good, but we do need to see ordinary, hard working people enjoying the benefits of it. </p>
          <p eId="para_453"> As a measure of what we have been doing, in 2012 unemployment in this country was at 14.8%. The figure is now down to 10% and it is anticipated that it will decrease to 9% by the end of the year. We will be heading back towards figures of 4% or 5% unemployment, which is considered to be full employment, before 2020. Those figures are real and realistic. It was said several times during the course of this Government by the Opposition that things could not be done. The Minister of State referred to when the Opposition said that not one ounce of change could be negotiated in the troika bailout. We have proven significantly good at that and the Minister of State's figure of €40 billion in future cash flow improvements is evidence of it. That is real money which would have to be found elsewhere otherwise. Not only would we have to find it but the opportunity cost of the loss of that money would be equally damaging to our society. </p>
          <p eId="para_454"> Just this month we have spoken about 45,000 fewer claimants of social welfare between this year and last year. That is a good figure, although it still is not good enough. When we came into Government, the live register figures were heading well above 450,000. I remember discussions at the time about it heading for 500,000. That would have been an absolute disaster and we probably would not have had the ability to recover from such a vicious cycle. The figure at the end of last month was 349,551. This represents a success, but not a success for our Government but a success for everyone who has got a job and for everyone who has come off social welfare payments. This is where the real success lies. </p>
          <p eId="para_455"> The fiscal responsibility measures about which we are talking include planning. Senator Ó Domhnaill will agree that planning for the future is almost a new concept as far as his party is concerned. An increasing population requires us to do that in a sustainable way. The spring economic statement puts in place the broad parameters of what that plan might look like. The Senator said that there was no meat or substance in it. Of course, the meat and substance will be added in the budget later on in the year. At the moment, we are starting the process by which people and politicians can engage and outline their own plans and visions for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_456"> On the issue of irresponsibility again, Sinn Féin had its recent 212 word policy document on the abolition of Irish Water. There was no reference to the fact that if Sinn Féin abolished Irish Water, €900 million would have to be found for investment on an annual basis in Irish water. That would seriously curtail any Government's ability to reform the taxation superstructure in the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_457"> We are talking about reducing the universal social charge. The Government has already taken more than 400,000 people from the USC net. A person can earn €32,000 a year and then rapidly move into paying 51% of his or her entire income back to the State after that point. The entry level to the highest rate of tax is way too low and needs to be examined in light of the extra resources the Government has. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, referred to these extra resources as an economic dividend to the people of Ireland for the undoubted sacrifice they have made. Reducing a deficit from €15 billion a year to €4.8 billion this year and smaller again next year is a remarkable feat. Again, this is not a pat on the back for the Government but a recognition of the sacrifice of the Irish people. The deficit was reduced by way of a combination of revenue raising measures and decreasing expenditure.</p>
          <p eId="para_458"> Undoubtedly, during that time, people have suffered and struggled. We have seen it. We are not immune to looking at the difficulty people have found themselves in. That is why this year, at last, after eight austerity budgets, we might be able to put a few pound back in people's pockets. At the end of the day, that is really what the entire measure of an economy and a successful society should be. The way to do that is to plan. The spring economic statement outlines the broad parameters of that plan. We look forward to engaging in robust debate with politicians, from all parties and none, and to seeing the budget and how the Government will put flesh on the bones of this plan.</p>

          <p eId="para_464"> As highlighted by my colleagues in the other House, the economic statement is being used to ask people to forgive and forget. It is asking people to forget about the cuts they have faced in child benefit, carer's allowance and lone parent payments. There have been reductions in the salaries of young teachers, nurses and gardaí. There have been cuts to rural services. They are being asked to forget the imposition of the austerity measures over the past number of years. It is asking the people to forgive the Government for cutting young people's welfare payments and to forget that this in itself partly contributed to a surge in emigration among young people.</p>
          <p eId="para_465"> It is asking people to forget that more than 20% of jobs are now low paid and that many workers are poorer now than they were before. It is asking us to forget that 450,000 people are on waiting lists as a result of the accident and emergency crisis and to forgive the failing to make any real inroads into reducing waiting lists and waiting times. Despite promises to end the scandal of patients on trolleys, there is no sign of this problem being resolved. We are asked to forget that too. We are being asked to forget that we nationalised our banks and to forgive these banks, which we saved, when they do not pass on lower interest rates to mortgage holders.</p>
          <p eId="para_466"> The Government has failed to meet some of the claims it made for itself on coming into office. In the stability programme update issued in April 2011, it said that the economy would grow by 8.7% from 2012 to 2014.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">It was, however, little more than half of that figure, at 4.7%, because some policies had had the effect of slowing the economy. That is the truth behind the talk of recovery. The recovery, in large part, has come from the overseas sector, exports and net financial flows from overseas. It is widely accepted that some of this involves an element of financial chicanery and accounting practices that might be designed to avail of low taxation rates here, but little of it has to do with the real economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_468"> Last week the Minister for Finance made the bold claim in his contribution in the Dáil on the spring economic statement that our young emigrants would come back. However, the facts tell a different story. The number of new graduates emigrating is actually higher than at any time in the previous six years. Only several weeks ago over 7,000 young Irish citizens aged between 18 and 35 years snapped up Canadian work visas in only a couple of minutes. It is also worth noting that in recent studies emigrants identified four key barriers to their return. They are poor infrastructure, precarious working conditions and low pay - it is not just the availability of jobs but the types of job available - a lack of career opportunities and progression and the lack of affordable housing. There was nothing in the spring economic statement that addressed these barriers in a meaningful way to allow these emigrants to come back to live, raise families and pursue careers here.</p>
          <p eId="para_469"> There are 61,000 fewer people aged between 20 and 34 years in employment since 2011. The number in employment fell by 14,000 in 2014 alone. The level of employment in the west fell by 4,800 in the year to December 2014 and by 5,000 in the south west. This is a similar story in the Border region where the number in employment has fallen by 1,300. The reality is that there is a two-tier recovery. While we can talk about positive economic figures, the recovery is not giving an advantage to all people. Many are being left behind, which is manifesting itself in discontent and people's reactions and protests to, say, water charges. We cannot have a two-tier recovery because it will only be broken and not for everyone.</p>

        <speech by="#ColmBurke" eId="spk_150">
          <from>Senator Colm Burke<recordedTime time="2015-05-06T20:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_470">I welcome the Minister of State who has made a comprehensive statement on this matter. I remind Senator Kathryn Reilly that 20,000 jobs will be lost in Northern Ireland, the equivalent to 60,000 jobs being lost in the Twenty-six Counties, and that it has had poor economic growth rates for several years. This is an issue that should not be ignored.</p>
          <p eId="para_471"> In 2014 we had a 4.8% economic growth rate. In 2015 it is predicted that the rate will be 4% which will continue into the immediate future. We have 95,000 jobs that were not available in 2012. The level of unemployment has come down from 15% to 10%, with a prediction that it will be down to 9.2% in the not too distant future. Long-term projections indicate that between 2015 and 2020 an extra 200,000 jobs will be created. It is important that we work towards achieving this target. We all have a part to play in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_472"> The Minister of State referred to the changing demographic profile of the country. There are 585,000 people aged over 65 years. Within the next 16 years this figure will rise to 990,000. To support the current level of pension provision, we need 3.5 people working for every person in receipt of a pension. By 2030, if the same ratio were to apply, we would need 2.7 million people working to maintain that level of pension provision, health care and nursing home provision. It is important that we set targets and do everything possible to achieve them in a careful and proper manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_473"> The number unemployed has been reduced and now stands at 343,561. It is still a high figure and we have much work to do. In the past 12 months the number dropped by over 45,000, but it is not an easy issue to tackle. It is about upskilling people who were employed in jobs that are no longer available. It is important that we play our part in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_474"> I am not at all convinced that we are giving enough support to the self-employed and those small and medium-sized enterprises providing two to 20 jobs. There are many obstacles in their way. At a meeting earlier today an issue highlighted to me concerned the self-employed who did not have a company. Take for example a person in such circumstances who earns €60,000 a year. If he or she buys equipment to make sure he or she can keep up to date with the services he or she provides at a cost of €30,000, he or she can write off this amount in tax over seven years. However, he or she is still taxed as if he or she earns €60,000. That is an unfair system. The nature of some businesses does not allow people to form companies, meaning they have to operate as self-employed persons. We need to take this into account. They have the incentive to invest, as well as the incentive to provide a service. Accordingly, we need to encourage them to provide that service.</p>
          <p eId="para_475"> I am concerned about the issue of housing, an issue on which the Minister of State will agree. The building of housing is crucial to get more people back into work. The Government has provided much funding for local authorities to provide social housing in the next three years. It is important that clear targets are set as to what has to be done in that three year period. It should not be a case of building 100 houses by the end of the three years. There must be targets to be met in six months, 12 months, 18 months and two years. For example, I have an issue in Cork, the Cork city north-west regeneration project. Last year the Government allocated €10 million for this programme, but it is my understanding only €4 million was spent. In the past three years only 23 houses have been built under this regeneration programme which was first talked about when I was a member of Cork City Council in 2007. Very little progress has been made since. Clear targets must be set in the spending of such moneys by local authorities. If they do not deliver, we will have to take alternative action to ensure the targets are met. It is grand to allocate moneys for such projects, but in the past we have allowed them to go beyond the set time. Now, more than ever, we need targets in order that we can get more people back to work at a faster pace.</p>
          <p eId="para_476"> An issue that needs to be examined is the number of people who have moved abroad and what we can do to bring them back. For someone who has come back and is trying to get into the social welfare system while they are trying to find employment, the system can be far too bureaucratic. It can take up to 15 weeks during which time they become discouraged and leave again. I have seen this happen and the issue needs to be examined urgently.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">We need people with skills, particularly in the building trade, to come back to this country and we need to ensure there are proper support mechanisms for them, their families and their children.</p>
          <p eId="para_478"> I thank the Minister for his contribution and I thank him and his colleagues for the work that has been done to set the targets to be reached over the next few years.</p>

          <from>Senator Mark Daly<recordedTime time="2015-05-06T20:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_479">I welcome the Minister and I hope he does not have to run for President because I am sure he will be Taoiseach. Maybe he will run for President after he has been Taoiseach.</p>
          <p eId="para_480"> Last week a survey of 27 countries ranked people's trust in Government, business, NGOs and the media. Ireland ranked the worst, with only one in five having trust in those former pillars of society. We all know the various reasons for that, the crisis in charities in the case of NGOs and the banking sector in the case of business. In Ireland, people's level of trust in the elites was the lowest of all the 27 countries surveyed. Those countries included China, which says a lot about Irish people's confidence in politics. </p>
          <p eId="para_481"> The reason for this is the lack of equity in our system. I do not know if the Minister read it but there was an interesting piece in the <i>Irish Independent</i> at the weekend which stated that some 260 people controlled €76 billion in assets and that the bottom half of the population have €56 billion among them all. That is a level of inequity that is staggering and it is not going to get any better as the wealthy have got wealthier in this crisis. I recall the infamous words of former US President George W. Bush when, addressing a crowd at a fundraising event, he welcomed the haves and the have-mores. Some of these people caused the crisis and now people view them as having profited from it.</p>
          <p eId="para_482"> Some of the issues brought up by my colleagues opposite show why there is a lack of confidence in the political system, such as the charge against this and previous governments that they are borrowing money to buy votes. When we cannot balance the books, the idea of giving ourselves a pay increase as politicians is hardly likely to improve our poll ratings. The confidence of the Irish people and people in the 27 countries that were polled will not be restored when they understand that the proposal for public sector pay increases involves politicians also getting a pay increase, and borrowing money to do so. That is, unfortunately, one of the proposals.</p>

          <p eId="para_488">I agree with the idea mentioned by Senator Burke of the self-employed having some social protection.

          <p eId="para_490">Thank you. Unfortunately, the Department and the Minister for Social Protection stated that the advisory group was not convinced that there was a need for an extension of social insurance for the self-employed to provide cover for jobseekers. The Senator might take that up with his Minister and, if we were to put down a motion, I hope he would support it.</p>
          <p eId="para_491"> There should be equity for all. There should be a living wage but how we get to the concept of a living wage is a difficult matter because a minimum wage is not the same as a living wage. When one is better off on social welfare than working there is a problem. When families are better off not accepting jobs and remaining on social welfare the system is not working. Equity is what we are looking for. A levy on banks was suggested because they would not bring down their variable rates and we could do that. We could also bring in legislation. There are a number of other things the Government could do but it must do something because the banks are causing another crisis in our housing sector by putting people under so much pressure. They are vetoing the mortgage resolutions and forcing the taxpayer to pick up the bill because when people lose the roof over their heads they require housing at the expense of the taxpayer.</p>
          <p eId="para_492"> The spring economic statement is part of the new requirements under the fiscal treaty but another new Commission proposal is of great concern and would affect us all. It is one of those creeping, incremental proposals that they keep talking about in Europe until people get so used to hearing it being mentioned that they think it will never happen. Then, one bright breezy day, it does happen. There are ongoing manoeuvres to ensure corporation tax is paid in the countries in which earnings are generated. This is the Commission's agenda and its aim is to achieve that agenda. As the Minister will be aware, Ireland lost a vote on this being an issue of subsidiarity, having argued that it was for Ireland alone to make the decision. Ireland alone sets its corporation tax rate but the issue is of concern for us because big countries such as France, Germany and Italy would like corporation tax paid where a product is purchased. This might be very hard to prove in the case of Google, which makes many sales through its search engine in Ireland but to Italian customers, as a result of which Italy is demanding its share and Ireland is losing the battle. Our corporation tax rate of 12.5% counts for nothing - what matters is the fact that these companies pay their tax here based on the fact that we are in the European Union. If the proposal for corporation tax to be paid in the country where revenue is generated is successful and Ireland loses the case there will be no money to pay for the things we were talking about. I ask the Minister to continue the fight to prevent companies which are based here because of our corporation tax rate from moving as a result of the big boys in Europe getting their way once again.</p>

          <p eId="para_494">Go raibh maith agat a Leas-Chathaoirligh agus cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit go dtí an Seanad. The Government's spring economic statement shows a real vision to spread the recovery to all corners of this country. There is no doubt that the economic recovery is gaining momentum and this Government has a plan to spread its benefits to everyone throughout the land. After years of hardship caused by the economic crisis and the disastrous policies of the last Government, it is time for better living standards and improved public services for all the people of the land. It is time to give our young emigrants the opportunity to come home. The Government has a plan to achieve this vision and the spring economic statement shows that the plan is already working.</p>
          <p eId="para_495"> I will give the Minister an example of my own in the form of a meeting I had with two young professional people.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">I have to say that one of them is from my own parish. I did not know her and never saw her in my life before, but I met her in New York City. Her husband is from Galway. Both of them are living and working in the tax exile of Bermuda. Both are highly qualified professional people working for one of the biggest companies in the world. Having gained great experience, they are coming home to this country to rear a family. They realise the opportunities that are in this country now. They are not coming home to apply for social welfare. This is a true statement and I am sure there are other people doing the same.</p>
          <p eId="para_497"> The national deficit has been significantly reduced from €15 billion to €4.5 billion. These are true facts and figures that cannot be denied. Our national debt is now moving closer to the European average. We are being commended on our efforts not only in Europe but also in the United States. I have heard and witnessed such commendations myself. I did not read them, I heard them. </p>
          <p eId="para_498"> This was achieved, thankfully, albeit with major sacrifices by people from all walks of life. It was also achieved with fewer tax increases and more expenditure cuts than anyone thought possible. We ensured that core social welfare rates were maintained to protect the most vulnerable. While getting the economy back on track, we built more schools in the midst of the economic recovery than were built in the previous Government's term during what were called the boom years. These facts and figures speak for themselves. </p>
          <p eId="para_499"> In what is the first step towards universal free GP care, 300,000 children and senior citizens who must currently pay to see their GP, will no longer have to do so from this summer. We do not often advertise or claim these achievements but we must recognise them. We will achieve the promised 100,000 jobs this year, which is a year earlier than planned. By 2018, the jobs lost during the crash will have been recovered. </p>
          <p eId="para_500"> Ireland has established its reputation as the Internet capital of Europe and continues as such, but do we realise that? This week, our reputation was enhanced with the decision of the online fashion company Zalando to open a research and development centre in the Dublin docklands. This German company will create 200 jobs over the next couple of years, although it faced opposition from its own country.</p>
          <p eId="para_501"> Ireland continues to attract global companies to its shores and the Government will continue its work in this regard for many years to come. We are now focused on improving the lot of the so-called squeezed middle - the people who feel they have been paying for everything since the economic crash. Many of these people now find themselves struggling with mortgage arrears, but the Government will make an announcement on this in the coming weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_502"> The Minister for Finance plans to meet with the six main lenders in Irish banking this month to discuss their plans for reducing interest rates. The main priority of this Government's plan is to grow the economy and improve living standards. It is putting more money back into people's pockets through further reductions in income tax and the universal service charge. This is being done in a sensible, responsible way and will not jeopardise our recovery. </p>
          <p eId="para_503"> In his spring economic statement to the Lower House, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, said we would not return to the "If I have it, I'll spend it" ways of the previous Government. That approach, which was aimed at buying elections, would represent the single biggest threat to our economic growth.</p>

          <p eId="para_504">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit. When I was elected, I said I would give credit where it was due and would not oppose for the sake of opposition. Some 95,000 jobs is quite an achievement, as is economic growth at 4% plus and declining unemployment. I do not want to rain on the Minister of State's parade but, as Senator Barrett said some time ago, let us have cash in the till before we start spending it.</p>
          <p eId="para_505"> As regards predictions of future growth, I remember a time when they were predicting a soft landing, but the crash that occurred was crazy. I do not care which side of the House the prediction came from, it was clearly generated by the same people who are generating predictions today. We can only go on what we are being told, but let us be careful about how we move forward. </p>
          <p eId="para_506"> Senator Brennan referred to the preservation of social welfare payments, but many people on social welfare may not necessarily agree with his analysis. We really did make the poor poorer as we worked towards recovery. However, it is a great credit to this Government that we have attracted some of the largest global names for jobs into this country. Our IT sector is powering ahead, but if the Minister of State wants that to continue he had better stop squeezing the third-level sector. He had better start providing lecturers, reducing class sizes and funding further education properly.</p>
          <p eId="para_507"> Earlier today, I attended the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection which was attended by representatives of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation and the national schools. In the 21st century, we are talking about computers being moved on trolleys between classrooms, which does not bode well for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_508"> We must start considering where we will spend our money. Senator Daly spoke about public service pay and was afraid that we in the Oireachtas might get a few bob. I am afraid that anybody might get a few bob before we start fixing the services.</p>

          <p eId="para_512">Let us start putting the money into services and restore them to a 21st century level. When the Minister of State comes to deal with employment issues, he has to do away with zero-hour contracts at the lower end of the employment scale. He must see to it that employers will engage in collective bargaining. We cannot continue to have situations like what is going on between Mandate and Dunnes Stores.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">A significant number of our population live in income poverty, which is the worst type of poverty in that one works for one's salary but one does not have enough to live on.</p>
          <p eId="para_514"> I want to see the restoration of public service pay. I hear people talking about productivity and I engaged in negotiating the Haddington Road agreement for two years when I was president of the Teachers Union of Ireland, and we did deals that were to die in 2016 and they will have to happen in 2016 unless the Government wants to start a war with the public service. There will be no further productivity at this point in time. We are looking for the restoration of what was taken from public servants. Before I came into this House I suffered the pain of the cuts that were imposed on the education sector. I have suffered worse pains since I was elected to the House, but that is another day's work.</p>

          <p eId="para_517">I am concerned about us embarking on what will be the next bubble that will bring Ireland to its knees. I am delighted that milk quotas have been abolished. I am a city boy and, for me, milk comes in a bottle or a carton. I know very little about the production process. However, I know that when an industry starts to expand as a result of the lifting of regulations, such expansion needs to be carefully managed. If it not, we will finish up with massive herds of up to 1,000 cows and someone somewhere in the world will sneeze and decide that this was caused by increased milk production and suddenly we will see the milk bubble that we are creating collapse. I am deeply concerned about that.</p>
          <p eId="para_518"> I agree with Senator Barrett on the sale of Aer Lingus. Its sale has been an issue in this House for several months now. Aer Lingus simply cannot be sold. It is a part of everything that is Irish.</p>
          <p eId="para_519"> I also agree with Senator Barrett with regard to Irish Water, and what a mess we made of that. It is still a mess and that mess will roll on for God knows how long more. The Government is now going to take the cost of the water charges out of our pay packets. I wish it well with that because the moment one utility can take money out my or anyone else's pocket, the ESB, Eircom and the other utilities will say that if the Government can do that for Irish Water, it can do it for them. I will fight tooth and nail to stop the Government doing that if it tries to move in that direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_520"> It is crazy that we are offering free medical cards to the under sixes. As I move rapidly into my mid-60s, I have found that my health has not been the best for the past ten or 15 years. I hope the stent I have in does not cave in and I need another one because I do not have a medical card and health insurance is becoming too expensive.</p>

          <p eId="para_523">As Senator Barrett said, as we move forward in medicine we need to concern ourselves with giving medical cards to the needy, not the greedy. There are people who can well afford to send their children who are under six to the doctor. Let us not proceed with this measure. There are other people who simply cannot afford it.</p>
          <p eId="para_524"> On the issue of upskilling, I have already adverted to the overcrowding that is taking place in our third level and further education sector and in our second level schools as a result of changes to the pupil-teacher ratio. There is also a problem with respect to upskilling in that those with a level 6 or level 7 qualification under the national framework of qualifications who want to move in a new direction have to start at level 5, and there is an impediment in that context.</p>
          <p eId="para_525"> As for the banks and the bankers, what can I say? The bankers are sitting on their big fat bonuses, big jobs and high salaries while the people who bailed them out are struggling to survive. We had a debate on receiverships earlier and once again I was astounded by what I saw in the House. All those on the opposite side of the House to me spoke in favour of taking steps to regulate receivers and then they voted against the motion. Politics is a crazy game.</p>
          <p eId="para_526"> Repossessions, receiverships, the bonus culture and all that must be taken care of. I would love to go through with the Minister of State my five-point plan to assist those in mortgage arrears, which he has received and I know he has read it, because he is one of the good ones. Senator Coghlan is right in saying there is a trajectory for him and it is upward only. I hope the Minister of State takes on board those five points. They are simple but they would ease the pain of many of our citizens. I thank him for coming into the House this evening and giving of his time. The Acting Chairman has been most understanding.</p>

          <p eId="para_535">Three minutes have elapsed now.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CaitKeane" eId="spk_182">
          <from>Senator Cáit Keane<recordedTime time="2015-05-06T20:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_536">I do not care how many minutes have elapsed. The chamber of commerce is important and I am not sorry for mentioning it three times. Its members are the people who make the jobs; we make the regulations. Sometime we have put a fix in the gap, but thankfully the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and the Minister of State, Deputy Harris, have set out 80 to 90 specific details for small businesses, for which those businesses are thankful. I was downstairs listening to those in small businesses thanking the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_537"> The purpose of the spring statement was to get away from what was always criticised, namely, short-term planning, buying votes and all the old ways of doing things. It set out the current economic fiscal situation and we are in a much better position now than we thought we would be in four years ago. Who would have thought that we would have €1.5 billion extra in funds and that we would look to give something back to small businesses? We will look to give something back to the people who saved this country, who worked with us to ensure we got out of the very difficult circumstances we found ourselves in. They helped us and many reforms were introduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_538"> A positive development is this new departure to provide a level of forecasting in advance. There was great criticism of the process in the past when everyone in Brussels knew what the forecast was going to be before the Deputies in Dáil Éireann and the Senators in this House knew what it would be. Now we can have collaborative, participative democracy budgeting. That is what this is about. It is a good development. We know how much we have but we must be prudent and act wisely and responsibly to ensure the country stays the way it is and on the right trajectory. If the economic crash has taught us anything, it is that we must be responsible.</p>
          <p eId="para_539"> I was in the Dáil for the announcement of spring economic statement and the Minister, Deputy Howlin, said that no one owes us anything, no one owes us a living. We have to make sure we do things right ourselves as well. We have to ensure others such as the banks do things right as well. Previous speakers have spoken about that.</p>
          <p eId="para_540"> We received emergency funding at the time when the markets stopped lending to us but we owe it to ourselves to ensure we do not allow a return to that. That is why we have sought to broaden the tax base to prevent over-dependency on property and transaction taxes which contributed to the crisis. We have an extra €1.2 billion to €1.5 billion in funds and both Ministers have spoken in the House previously about the 50:50 split between tax cuts and spending increases, which will be announced later. Some people have criticised the statement and said that the Ministers did not tell us anything new. The statement was not the budget, rather it was a trajectory on forecasts and on fiscal prudent management. France, the United Kingdom and many other countries in Europe have this system. We have not done it to date. This year was the first time for us to do it and it is a new departure.</p>
          <p eId="para_541"> The measures in respect of the 50:50 split between tax cuts and spending increases will be announced in the budget but they must be affordable. That is why the EU as a whole has adopted rules to support stability. That was adopted by the Irish people to ensure we do not lose the run of ourselves. Stability matters as the people voted for it. The Government outlined in the spring statement that it will see increases of €600 million to €700 million which will allow investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_542"> I want to concentrate on one issue whereas previous speakers have mentioned other issues. I would concentrate on the mortgage issue if time permitted as it is very important. Child care provision is an issue that cuts across every Department and every Minister. Each of them must give a bit to ensure that the Department of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy James Reilly, is the one that is really looked after in the next budget because it affects every job, person, parent and child. It affects not only the child where the parents go out work but the child who is cared for at home.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">Child care involves more than just caring for children; it involves education. The pedagogy of education is so important to children between zero and three years of age. Families, particularly those in deprived areas, need child care and health education. This is the business of every person in society. This is a society as well as an economy and we must ensure we get it right. We must ensure society is functioning and fair. The people, including children, depend on us. The children of today will be the fathers and mothers of tomorrow. For every euro spent on child care, €10 is actually returned to the Government in savings in respect of juvenile justice and prisons. That is not my statistic but that of Professor Weikart<b>
						</b>from the United States in a study carried out 20 years ago. We are behind the curve in research in Ireland, but it is now occurring.</p>
          <p eId="para_544"> Tackling homelessness is a very high priority. I compliment the Government on the priority action it took and its announcement yesterday on social housing. We added over 1,000 nurses in 2014. Good news makes news for a day, but bad news is bad news forever. Three hundred new gardaí were recruited last year and there are to be 250 more this year. Recruitment was stalled, but it has started again. There are to be 920 additional teachers, 400 resource teachers and 365 special needs teachers.</p>
          <p eId="para_545"> Some pensioners had their pensions nearly halved and some lost on investments. The pensioners who made the State are suffering. In addition to considering children, one must consider older people. They made the country that we have. As we piggybacked on them for so long, we must ensure they are protected. The number of people over the age of 65 is projected to increase from 11% of the total population in 2010 to 15% in 2020 and 24% in 2060. That is a huge demographic change and we have to provide for it. It will cost €200 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_546"> Social care, including child care, care of the elderly and all of the bits in the middle, must be considered.</p>

          <p eId="para_555">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Simon Harris, and very much welcome the opportunity to discuss the spring statement. As Senator Sean D. Barrett said, there has been a very positive reaction to it from very eminent commentators. I regard the document as a revised and updated roadmap to guide the country safely along the bumpy road to economic recovery in a way that will enhance the lives of all citizens. We all know where we came from and how we got to our current stage of progress. In 2011 the Government was given a mandate by the people to repair the economy and the public finances, to create jobs and give some hope and confidence to the people. The country was in freefall; our sovereignty was compromised and our international reputation was in tatters. Difficult and painful decisions were taken and huge sacrifices made by the people to get the public finances under control. The Government worked hard to repair our reputation abroad and gradually confidence grew in our ability to manage our own affairs. This led many significant international companies to decide to invest here, resulting in the creation of many badly needed jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_556"> Government policies in the past four years have worked well and the economic recovery is taking a firm hold. Some 95,000 jobs have been created since 2012 and there has been a reduction in the number unemployed for nine successive quarters since 2012. The economy is growing at the fastest rate in Europe, with a growth rate of 4% projected in 2015, having reached 4.8% in 2014. All jobs lost during the recession will be replaced by 2018. By 2020, 200,000 jobs will have been added to the 2015 figure. Fewer people are emigrating and some people are beginning to return as circumstances improve. We need them back. We are beginning to develop skills shortages, particularly in the trades. I hope there will be a significant increase in the construction sector. We will need some tradespersons to return to the country and we are beginning to see this happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_557"> The public finances are under control, with the deficit falling below 3% this year. Our debt levels will reflect European levels in the next few years, as the Minister of State said. We must ensure the mistakes of the past will never be repeated. It is the responsibility of the Government to build on the recovery in a prudent, focused manner. Economic recovery provides the platform on which increased job creation, increased economic growth, better services and living conditions can be delivered. Additional resources that become available must be targeted at those who suffered most during the downturn.</p>
          <p eId="para_558"> It is welcome that the projected €1.5 billion in leverage that the Minister for Finance will have in the next budget will be split 50:50. Some 50% will be used to deliver tax and universal social charge, USC, reductions for low and middle income earners, while the remainder will be targeted at the reversal of cuts to public services. Some 330,000 people have been taken out of the USC category by the Government since it took office. It is envisaged that 90,000 more will be taken out of this category in the next budget. The USC rate will be cut to 7% for those earning less than €70,000. This will be the next step towards the eventual dismantlement of the hated charge which was an emergency measure introduced by the previous Government. It was critical at the time, but we all aspire to having it dismantled in as short a time as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_559"> It is critical that we ensure it pays to work. Employment is the surest way of lifting families and individuals out of poverty. Not alone does it take individuals and families out of poverty; it also improves their self-esteem and physical and mental health.</p>
          <p eId="para_560"> When the Government is reversing cuts to public services, I want to see children and adults with disabilities at the top of the priority list. It is shameful that the most vulnerable must fight for recognition and resources. Although there are many good causes, the disabled, including children, must be targeted for special consideration as resources become available. Special attention must also be paid to respite care services.</p>
          <p eId="para_561"> The Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan; the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, and the other members of the Government have done an amazing job in stabilising the public finances and getting the ship of State back on an even keel. However, there is still much to be done. Job creation is to remain at top of the agenda. The recovery is slowly moving to the regions. I certainly hope the regional strategy being developed by IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland will have a huge impact. However, small businesses are struggling and we need to support them as resources become available. The provision of high speed broadband in rural areas is a key concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_562"> Rates which have been referred to by previous speakers must be addressed, with business costs, bank charges and the availability of finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">These are issues that impact on every small business. I note the issue of the self-employed. We saw many of these people who took a risk during the boom time, including small developers, builders and subcontractors. Later, when they found themselves out of work, their employees could receive benefits from the State but those who had provided the jobs could not. The issue of PRSI for the self-employed must be addressed as a matter of urgency and the self-employed brought onto a par with employees. Previous speakers have spoken of the need for further investment in education to reflect increasing numbers, but an effort must also be made to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio in some of our schools. Health needs further investment. No doubt, that will happen as resources become available.</p>
          <p eId="para_564"> I hope the spring statement is updated and refined regularly. We need more openness and debate on budgetary matters. The people are entitled to know regularly how the Government is progressing and its plans and priorities. As public representatives, Deputies and Senators must have an opportunity to influence how the people's money is spent. That is critical. Our future will be secured by prudent management, greater efficiency in our public services and shrewd capital infrastructural investment. To date, the Government has made much progress. Within a year, the people will have an opportunity to adjudicate on how well it has done. I have little doubt that the result will be positive and the Government will be given a further opportunity to build on the progress that has been made and to ensure we have full employment by 2018.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Deputy Simon Harris)<recordedTime time="2015-05-06T20:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_565">I thank Senators on all sides for an interesting debate. If I have picked up one thing from it, it is that no one on any side of the Houses and no citizen is suggesting that the job of work is done. In fact, there is a great deal more to do. I often describe my four years to date in the Oireachtas by saying that in my first three and a half years, the pause button was pressed on so many of the important issues which Senators have raised as we fought to restore and win back our economic sovereignty. Now that we have won back the sovereignty, we can begin to have the exciting and important conversation all our citizens want us to have on how best to cut taxes and increase public expenditure and on what areas to focus expenditure. From the contributions of all Senators, it is clear that there is much to discuss and much to do and that a great debate needs to happen. I am sure it will happen in this Chamber and, as such, I look forward to feeding into it in terms of where those priority areas should be.</p>
          <p eId="para_566"> If there is one specific benefit of the spring economic statement, it is that we can now have an honest debate. Last time I checked, almost all parties in both Houses had signed up to the European spending rules. They have signed up to the fact that we must live within our means and within certain economic parameters. If that is still the position of all parties and groupings, including Independents in this House, the fiscal space is in and around €1.2 billion to €1.5 billion for the next budget. Roughly speaking, it is likely to be the same later although I accept what was said about forecasts. Therefore, we can now discuss how best to spend that. That will lead to much better and more informed debates for us all and I look forward to that.</p>
          <p eId="para_567"> I will run quickly through some of the issues that were raised during the debate. Senator Ó Domhnaill raised the issue of the self-employed and I agree that it is an issue that must be addressed. I am pleased the Taoiseach took the opportunity of the spring economic statement to say the issue of the self-employed and how they are treated by the tax system will begin to be rectified in the next budget. I agree absolutely that entrepreneurial spirit needs to be encouraged. That is why we have established the local enterprise offices and the Action Plan for Jobs and are putting in place measures. There is always more to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_568"> In respect of part-time workers, I note that there will always be people in the economy who need to work part-time for family reasons and who want to work part-time in other cases. We will continue to support them. Thankfully, however, we are seeing ever more people who were in part-time work moving to full-time work as the availability of working hours increases in the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_569"> On the issue of regional economic growth, which a number of Senators raised, we are putting in place regional strategies and plans. A €250 million fund is being put towards that to ensure real economic growth is felt in every part of the country. We will stop the cycle of emigration Senator Ó Domhnaill and many others spoke about. The spring economic statement shows that from 2017 onwards, our emigrants are going to begin to come home. It is time to invite our young and not so young Irish people to come back home.</p>
          <p eId="para_570"> Senator Paul Coghlan made the point about the universal social charge and the ability to accelerate changes. I was pleased he mentioned that by the time of the next budget, 500,000 citizens who were paying the charge when we came to office no longer pay it. In particular, the Government wants to see a focus on those who are paying the 7% rate, which is penal. It is too high and being paid at too early a point. If we are serious about the squeezed middle, that is where we need to focus in relation to tax reductions. Tax reductions, as the spring economic statement shows, can lead to job creation. They are not irresponsible if they are done in the correct manner and targeted at the right people. As stated in the spring economic statement, the ESRI report outlines that if we follow a path of tax reductions on work, we can create 20,000 more jobs over the lifetime of the plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_571"> Senator Barrett raised the issue of the capital plan. I note that capital infrastructure is something in respect of which the Senator has an expertise. We will have the Government's capital plan in June. I take the Senator's point about the need to ensure we learn the lessons of the past. In my time on the Committee of Public Accounts, we dealt with many scary projects that happened in the past. We need cost-benefit analyses and to ensure our projects finish on time. While I am not saying everything is perfect, I am pleased we now have an Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service. It is a very important job. It is the job of the service to check that we are getting value for money. It does not just look at the surface level, but evaluates further the benefit of a particular spend. In my own area, we have the Office of Government Procurement which centralises procurement and puts better standards in place. We also have the multi-annual expenditure ceilings so that one does not have Departments rushing to the end of the year with the feeling that they must spend money. The budget can be applied to the next two years, which is important. I agree on the reduction of the tax burden and was pleased to hear Senator Barrett refer to it. I understand why we put an emphasis on the low-paid and the vulnerable in all our political discourse, and rightly so, but there are many people out there who are just struggling. Many people are working really hard who do not get the attention they deserve. That is why I would like to see cuts to the USC and a focus on reducing the burden of tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_572"> Senator Gilroy outlined very eloquently the importance of the spring economic statement and I would like to reiterate that. The statement does four things. It updates our domestic forecasts, which is really important, sets out policy intent well in advance of the budget, ensures people in Brussels or the Bundestag do not hear information before it is debated in our own Oireachtas, and reforms the budget process. As Senator Gilroy says, the recovery cannot just be felt at a macro level. While we do not agree on many things, I am sure Senator Kathryn Reilly would be pleased to hear me say that if she were here. I thank her for her comments on my own youth. In our own ways, we do our bit to represent young people in these Houses of the Oireachtas. She deprived me of the title of youngest Member of the Oireachtas, which is a title she wears well in doing a good job speaking up for younger people according to her own political ideology. Senator Reilly spoke about the low-paid, as did Senator Craughwell. It is an important issue. It is really important that when we see the results of the Low Pay Commission, action is taken to implement its recommendations. While the Government has restored the minimum wage, the best way to help any struggling worker is through tax reductions. There are possibilities to build on that. Senator Reilly also spoke about housing. The Government has launched the largest local authority building programme in the history of the State. I agree that the availability of housing and ensuring public and private supply is a real challenge. It is something on which my colleagues in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Ministers, Deputies Alan Kelly and Paudie Coffey, are working.</p>
          <p eId="para_573"> Senator Colm Burke referred to demographic challenges and highlighted exactly why we need to plan. Challenges never go away in politics, they just change. We have a number of challenges coming down the tracks in relation to demographics. They relate to younger people and child care but also to pensions, health services and our education system. The spring economic statement enables us to plan for that. Senator Burke is quite correct that the self-employed need more support. There are anomalies and an unfairness in the income tax system for the self-employed, which is something the Taoiseach has personally committed to working with our colleagues in the Labour Party to address in the October budget. I was very pleased to hear Senator Burke say about housing supply that when we give money to local authorities, we must see that targets are met. We must keep a close eye on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">We have all seen instances of this. When money leaves the Oireachtas, there must be delivery on the ground. I am sure that we will work on this.</p>
          <p eId="para_575"> There are many other issues that I would like to touch on, but we have had an interesting debate. I thank Senator Craughwell for his balanced contribution as a constructive Independent. The one comment I would make about forecasting is that there have been changes. The forecasts in this document are endorsed by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, which is an important development, but the Senator is right in that we must constantly keep matters under review. I hope and expect that the spring economic statement will be an annual event. I look forward to debating the issues further. I am sorry that we could not get through them all. I thank the House for its time.</p>
