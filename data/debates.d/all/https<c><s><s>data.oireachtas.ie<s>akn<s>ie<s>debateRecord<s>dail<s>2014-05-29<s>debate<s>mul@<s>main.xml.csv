#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	1	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together. The purpose of Circular 0030/2014 is not to reduce the number of SNA posts in schools but to clarify the role and purpose of SNA support and ensure it is targeted at those pupils who need it. My officials consulted school management bodies prior to issuing the circular and are setting up further meetings with management bodies and parent representative groups to allay fears. Last December the Government approved an extra 390 SNA posts for the period to the end of December 2014, which means that there are now almost 11,000 SNAs available to work with children who have an assessed care need in primary, post-primary and special schools. There are some 10,965 posts available for allocation, of which 10,656 SNA posts have been allocated, more than at any time previously. This means that rather than a reduction in the number of SNA posts, there is provision for a further 309 posts to be allocated to schools to the end of December. These extra posts will ensure the Government's policy of ensuring every child assessed as needing SNA support will receive access to support. Implementation of the circular should ensure children's care needs are better understood in order that SNAs can work more effectively to assist children.
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	2	I thank the Minister of State for his reply, but parents and teachers across the country have noted a squeezing of the SNA support available to students and are rightly concerned about the tone of the aforementioned circular from the Department. A number of specific points made in the circular are giving rise to concern among parents and teachers. It states that in order to receive SNA support, the care needs outlined must be of such significance that they are beyond what would normally be expected to be provided by way of support for a child by the class teacher or other school teachers or beyond the level of assistance which would be offered by other students or the student's fellow pupils. The idea that a departmental circular would put the responsibility on fellow pupils to cater for needs that up to now would have been catered for by SNAs is of great concern to many. At post-primary level, the circular states only students with chronic and serious care needs should need SNA support and that continued and ongoing access to SNA support is generally not desirable for post-primary students. The tone of this statement is deeply unsympathetic. I ask the Minister of State, in the context of the aforementioned points made in the circular which are causing real concern in terms of their implications for students who need support, to provide reassurance that this does not indicate a further squeeze on SNA hours.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	3	The Deputy referred to the squeezing of SNA posts, but that is certainly not what is occurring. As I mentioned, we have the highest number of SNA posts allocated in the history of the State and there are 309 posts yet to be allocated between now and the end of the December. I will outline why the circular was issued. In June 2011 the Department initiated a value for money review of the SNA scheme. In May 2013 the National Council for Special Education published its policy advice on supporting children with special educational needs in schools. Both reports concluded that the SNA scheme had been very successful in supporting the care needs of children with special needs in schools and assisting in their integration and inclusion. Ultimately, that is the function and role of the SNA - to assist in meeting the care needs of the young person who may initially find it challenging to operate in a school environment, particularly at primary level. However, I argue that it is the ambition of every parent and teacher of every child with special needs that ultimately the child achieve full independence and succeed to the best of his or her capacity while moving through the education system. That is ultimately what we are trying to achieve; we are not trying to frighten people. The criteria for the allocation of SNAs have not changed. When a young person needs SNA support, it will be available up until the point where he or she can operate independently. Ultimately, that is the ambition of parents and teachers in general when it comes to caring for children with special needs.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	4	The reality for many parents is that this circular is very frightening because it has moved the goal posts. The Minister of State may not care to admit it, but it is going to make it more difficult for students who need SNA support to receive it. That is a fact. We have already seen cases in our constituency offices of children who previously had SNA support and who are now in the process of losing it because the goal posts have moved significantly. The new circular states a child must have a "profound" disability in order to qualify for SNA support. Much of the change comes on the back of the review about which the Minister of State spoke. One of the findings of the review was that many schools did not know what was the role or remit of SNAs. There is a lot of work to be done with schools in that regard. Schools must be educated on the role and remit of SNAs and how best to use them. However, that does not take away from the fact that many parents are extremely worried that children who currently receive SNA support are going to lose it because of the annual review.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	5	I agree with the Deputy when he makes reference to the importance of clarifying the role of special needs assistants, SNAs, in schools. As I stated in my earlier reply, the Department's officials are at present engaging with school management bodies and parent representative groups to outline exactly this to them, as well as to allay any concerns or fears they might have that the recent circular will lead to a reduction in SNA numbers or allocations, because that is not the intention and certainly is not what will happen. It always has been standard practice that SNA allocations are reviewed annually. The circular acknowledges that pupils will have care needs that will remain constant and there are some disabilities which remain with the young person throughout his or her life. In the case of such young people, their care needs rarely evolve or improve. However, for very large numbers of other children, the exact opposite happens and with the support of an SNA and the classroom teacher, those care needs diminish over time, which is something that should be welcomed. The fact that SNA allocations are reviewed annually does not mean this will lead to a reduction in SNA support for individual pupils or for schools that have pupils who have continuing needs. I stress that what is being done here is simply clarifying the role of the SNA and ensuring that where an SNA support is needed and where those resources need to be channelled to those who need it most, this will be done and is exactly what will happen. While I do not make this charge against the two Deputies opposite, I caution people against spreading fear among parents that this circular somehow will diminish the allocation of SNAs. That is not the intention and as I stated previously, the Government is increasing the number of posts by 309 before the end of this year. At the end of 2014, the number of SNAs allocated in the education system will be the highest since the SNA support system began.
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	6	In his earlier response, the Minister of State outlined that it is the ambition of every parent that his or her child will get to a position where he or she does not need any SNA support. Indeed, it is the hope of every parent at the outset that his or her child would not need such support in the first place. However, in cases where a child needs such support, it is the ambition of a parent to be able to have the reassurance that the child actually will receive it when it is needed. The important point here is that reassurance should be given that this service will be provided. However, in recent years, the experience on the ground has been quite different. In common with the other Members present, I am sure the Minister of State will have spoken to teachers and parents. When one visits a school, one of the biggest difficulties teachers will raise is the pressure on them in respect of SNA resources. While the number of SNAs has increased slightly, the Minister of State indicated there would be a further 300 this year, the actual demand last September alone, for example, increased by 10%. The number of SNA supports did not match that increase. In addition, there has been a similar increase in demand for resource teacher posts and as a result, the Government decided to try to reduce the resource teaching hours being allocated per student but subsequently made a U-turn in that regard. Similarly, the Government did not increase the number of SNAs. A difficulty also arises with regard to the increasing practice of special educational needs organisers, SENOs, giving shared access to an SNA at school level, after which the responsibility is left with the teachers and the school to try to manage that. This is exceptionally difficult and nearly impossible in many situations.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	7	Thank you.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	9	We are over time, thank you.
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	10	There must be reassurance given that additional supports are provided in order that the pressure currently evident in schools can be relieved.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	11	To pick up on the last point, the best people to ascertain whether a pupil needs an SNA are those who carry out the assessment. In carrying out that assessment, they indicate what resources and help a student may need. At present, SNAs are being allocated to schools and unfortunately, the number of SNAs that some schools have does not match the needs of their students and thereafter, a great onus is being left on school management to try to distribute those SNAs as best as possible. Does the Minister of State agree that if a SENO's assessment states that a child is in need of a particular resource such as, for example, an SNA or so many hours per week, this student should get that support and this should not be constrained by budgetary measures?
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	12	To clarify once again, the purpose of this circular was not to provide for or allow for a reduction in the number of SNAs allocated nationwide. That there will be almost 11,000 SNAs in place by the end of the year is testament to this fact. The purpose of the circular simply was to clarify the role of the SNA in the school setting. That role is to provide for the care needs of a young person who needs such support to be able to operate successfully in a school environment. In the past, perhaps, the role of the SNA somehow had expanded beyond that role and it was important to be able to clarify for parents, teachers and school communities as a whole what exactly that role required. It is not and never has been the intention to use this circular somehow to reduce the supports available to young children who are in need of those supports to be able to function successfully in a school environment. Ultimately, the professional decision that is taken on the allocation of SNAs rests with their SENOs, who work as agents of the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, at a local level. The SENOs engage with parents and teachers and conduct a professional assessment of whether a child requires that SNA support. They also carry out an ongoing review of each child's individual care needs as the child progresses through the school system. Consequently, if that SENO makes that recommendation, then yes, the child obviously will need, require and secure those kinds of supports. However, as a child goes through the system, his or her care needs over time evolve and hopefully will lessen. It is important to reflect this in the allocation of SNAs in order that those who are entering the school system, perhaps at junior infants for the first time, can have resources directed towards them in times when the resources available are very scarce.
#JohnHalligan	unknown-#JohnHalligan-party	unknown-#JohnHalligan-dob	unknown-#JohnHalligan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	13	Since the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Quinn, came to office, I have raised repeatedly with them the case of Gaelscoil Philib Barún, Tramore. At 29 years, this Gaelscoil has waited longer than any other school in the country for a permanent building. The past 11 years have been spent in a site owned by the Department of Education and Skills in ageing prefabs, some owned by and others rented by the Department. To date, almost €2 million has been spent on temporary accommodation. Does the Minister of State agree this is an excessive waste of public funds and is money that could have been spent constructing a new school?
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	14	I wish to advise the Deputy that the Department's priority is to ensure that every child will have access to a physical school place. This can necessitate the use of temporary accommodation, as in the case of the school in question, until the Department is in a position to provide a permanent building. The delivery of major school projects required to meet demographic demand will be the main focus for capital investment in the coming years. The five-year plan announced by the Minister, Deputy Quinn, early in the lifetime of the Government prioritises new school building projects, as well as major extensions in areas where a demographic need has been established. Tramore, where the school is located, has not been identified by the Department as an area of significant demographic growth. A project for the school was not, therefore, included in that five-year plan. The school's building project is at an advanced stage of architectural planning, that is, stage 2b. This stage 2b report is currently being reviewed by the Department. Following this review, the Department will contact the school authority regarding the potential, at that time, for further progression of the project in the context of available funding.
#JohnHalligan	unknown-#JohnHalligan-party	unknown-#JohnHalligan-dob	unknown-#JohnHalligan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	15	That was an extraordinary answer. The Department of Education and Skills has told the school's board of management that it is prioritising areas of demographic growth for new schools. The population of Tramore increased by 7% between 2006 and 2011, with 30% of the population classified as being of preschool and school-going age. Over the past decade, enrolments in Tramore increased by more than 500 pupils and if this does not constitute demographic growth, I do not know what does. Incidentally, last August this project was authorised to proceed to stage 2b, meaning all planning and statutory approval had been completed. In a letter to me last September, the Minister commented that he made contact with the school about the potential for further progression of the project. Incidentally, we still are waiting for a reply. In the course of the Minister's visit to the school, he suggested that despite having a site ready with full planning permission in place, the school could be accommodated in a place called the Stella Maris building, which has been rejected by the school and parents. In October 2011, the Minister wrote to me to confirm that the project was on the original construction list but this never happened. I ask the Minister of State to tell the parents, children and teachers of the school why this is the case, based on what the Minister wrote to me and based on the information he gave to the school, the teachers and the families.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	16	First, I should identify how the Department identifies areas that are undergoing significant demographic challenge.It uses a combination of CSO data - the most recent census data - and data from the Department of Social Protection - children's allowance data - to generate a very accurate picture of what the demographic demand is now and what it will be in the next five to six years. Using that data, it has been concluded that Tramore, where the school is located, is not currently an area of significant demographic growth. That is hard verifiable data from the CSO and the Department of Social Protection, from which one is able to document every child living within a certain radius of that school. The Department has a major challenge to face in terms of delivering school buildings over the next number of years and I am sure the Deputy is more than aware that enrolment in post-primary and primary schools is expected to grow by almost 70,000 by 2018 - more than 45,000 at primary level and 25,000 at post-primary level. That is a major challenge we face in terms of providing classroom space for those young people. The Minister has always expressed a fear that at some point we would arrive at a situation where children of school-going age would simply turn up at a school with no classroom space available for them.  Prefabricated classrooms are not the ideal environment for any school and we all wish we had the resources not to have to use prefabricated accommodation. However, for the moment, those young people in Tramore have a school and classrooms. They have quite a modern school environment, based on the fact that most of the investment was made over the past three or four years. As we say, when resources become available to us, we will be able to progress that project to a new school building at some point in the future.
#JohnHalligan	unknown-#JohnHalligan-party	unknown-#JohnHalligan-dob	unknown-#JohnHalligan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	17	It just goes to show how out of touch the Minister of State is that he does not know that part of the school building collapsed on children in February. Some 30 children had to be evacuated, many of whom were asthmatic. Was the Minister of State not aware that one of the prefabs had collapsed? In 2012, the Department promised to reinstate the school building project to a building list. Why has that not been done? I am not too sure if the Minister of State is aware of what is happening in his Department. He is not aware as to whether the school has been reinstated to the building list. Is he not aware that one of the prefabs collapsed and children had to be evacuated? That was on the national news. The Minister of State needs to clarify his position on Gaelscoil Philib Barún. The Minister promised the school building project would be reinstated to the building list but the Minister of State said the opposite. I have shown the Minister of State where the demographics come into play with the number of children on the school list and the population growth in Tramore. Surely that warrants people not having to be educated in prefabricated buildings in a state of collapse.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	18	To clarify, the Deputy made reference to the fact the school has somehow been removed from the school building list and needs to be reinstated. It is currently on a school building list. There are many other such projects in the same situation. There is, and there always has been, two separate building lists in operation. There is the five year capital programme announced by the Minister early in the lifetime of the Government to address that very significant demographic challenge in areas of increasing population and to cater for those 70,000 children coming into our system but alongside that, there is another list on which this school is included and where we are moving schools to a point where they are ready to move to construction. The Deputy is aware that the stage 2b report is currently being reviewed by my Department. Following that review, the Department will contact the school authority. There will be ongoing engagement with the school authority and it is not true to say it has somehow dropped off the radar or a list of priorities for the Department.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	19	My colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills and the Minister for Justice and Equality have established a task force to urgently examine the issues raised by the closure of a number of private colleges. The task force is chaired by the two Departments and includes representatives from QQI, Enterprise Ireland and City of Dublin Education and Training Board as well as representatives of the private high-quality higher education and English language sectors and the Irish Council for International Students. This group is charged with assessing the scale of the issue and, in particular, the number of genuine students who have not yet been accommodated. It will also determine what capacity is available in the sector to make accommodation for students and will oversee a system that seeks to make such accommodation.  The co-chairs of the task force have been asked to make an interim report by this Friday. For the sake of the students involved, it is important to be clear that their immigration permissions have been extended by the Department of Justice and Equality to allow them to continue to work to support themselves and to allow them space to make alternative arrangements. The Government is also introducing a robust quality framework to ensure that only the highest quality providers can attract students from outside the EEA to Ireland. At the heart of this will be the international education mark, provided for in the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Act 2012 and which will be awarded by Quality and Qualifications Ireland. This mark will be introduced from the end of this year.
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	20	As the Minister of State knows, five private language schools have closed in the past month. Anyone who has met or listened to interviews with the students affected by the closure of those language schools will be in no doubt as to the distress faced by many very genuine language students. There were abuses in a number of cases but the reality is that many students who came to this country, specifically to be educated and to learn English, find themselves stranded as a result of these five colleges closing. There are serious questions in regard to how that can happen. I have no doubt the Minister of State is aware of the impact that could have on our international reputation and of the importance of getting to grips with this quickly and ensuring it cannot happen again. Many of the students who have been left stranded are in financial difficulty because they paid money for those courses. What can be done to recompense those students so that they can continue a course? The Irish Council for International Students suggested the establishment of a pop-up English language school to try to ensure those students can continue to learn English and pursue their education.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	21	I have great sympathy for those young people. For the majority of them, it is an alien environment. They have been left high and dry without any support or hope that they may be able to pursue the education they wish to pursue in this country. This task force has all the participants one would require on such a task force to be able to address this issue and it was established with lightning speed by the Minister. It will issue an interim report this Friday but, in the meantime, it is working hard to ensure the students have their visas extended so they are not forced to leave the country and retain the right to work to support themselves while they await an outcome. We have been trying to accommodate those students in other English language schools which operate to far higher standards. It is important to point out that the colleges which closed were private businesses and they were not backed by the State financially or in terms of other learner protection. The Deputy is quite right that we need to be very concerned about how this impacts on Ireland's image abroad as a destination for international education. Ireland earns just under €1 billion per annum from international education and it is one of our most significant exports.  We have been working very closely with the education in Ireland unit in Enterprise Ireland, the QQI and my officials to provide for this quality mark, which is provided for in the legislation underpinning QQI. With the establishment of the quality mark it will not be possible for any institution to market itself abroad under the education in Ireland brand without having that quality mark assigned to it. It will be a mark parents, students, academics and teachers internationally can trust. If an institution operates under that mark, it will be operating to an exceptionally high standard where one can trust the content and quality of the education being delivered. 
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	22	What sort of timeframe is the Minister of State putting on the introduction of that quality mark? We cannot have a situation where there is a question mark over existing colleges. Does the Minister of State believe there is a threat to any other colleges or a danger of other colleges closing down? What steps is the Minister taking to stand over the services currently being provided for students coming to this country? The most urgent aspect relates to those students currently in distress and stranded. It is more than five weeks since some of those colleges closed down. I know the task force is in place but many students have been left in a very difficult situation. Urgent action is critical. The least we can do is to provide for their needs.The Minister of State might also give his view on how this came to pass that we can have allowed this situation arise and so many students end up in big trouble as a result.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	23	It is not alone an issue for Ireland. It is an issue across the world where private institutions, primarily English language schools, set up purporting to offer a high standard of education when, in fact, upon scrutiny they offer a poor standard and few supports for students who find themselves in that difficult situation. The quality mark will be put in place by the end of this year. Education in Ireland has been working exceptionally hard over the past three years, and travelling abroad. Indeed, I have travelled abroad with them on a number of occasions with the third level institutions, colleges, universities and institutes of technology. Every time we travel abroad, we stress repeatedly the exceptionally high quality of the education being provided by the vast majority of institutions in this country. At the end of this year, we will have a quality mark that we can stand over and under which an institution will have that credibility and build for itself a strong reputation for the provision of exceptionally high quality education. We will work to ensure that any young person who is contemplating coming to study in this country must protect himself or herself by ensuring he or she does not subscribe to or attend an institution or college that does not have that quality mark. I am confident we will be able to build that brand internationally so every educational support and opportunity that is offered to young people entering this country will be of that exceptionally high standard and that over time those who cannot operate to those high standards will simply be pushed out of business.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	24	I am confident that the recently launched five-year further education and training, FET, strategy, Ireland's first ever further education and training strategy, will provide the right balance between provision that has a primary focus on developing skills for the economy and courses that support core skills and personal development and are aimed at increasing equity, social inclusion and educational progression. There is a need to strike that balance. Of course, these latter programmes also assist learners on their journey to employment, and we should never try somehow to separate those two objectives. Of the programmes with an economic focus, investment priorities will be determined by good quality labour market intelligence that identifies sectors with skills requirements over time. The strategy contains strategic goals, both on providing skills for the economy and on such active inclusion. All programmes, regardless of their focus, will be reviewed over the lifetime of the strategy. However, the strategy recommends, subject to overall budgetary constraints, sustaining the levels of funding relating to literacy and numeracy and adult education in the immediate term. That is the most immediate challenge that we face. Therefore, I am not concerned that the FET strategy will neglect non-tech or non-business related further education in the future.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	25	I welcome the Minister of State's comments because it is important that the strategy does not neglect non-tech and non-business related further education and training. Having read the report, that balance seems to be more weighted towards those who are probably at an advanced personal development level and who are ready to upskill and get into high-tech jobs. I note that the strategy contains a number of initiatives for those who are not yet at that stage and whose further education and training is about enhancing their personal development. The local training initiatives, the specialist training providers and the community training centres all will play a key role in enhancing a person's personal development. In the strategy, there are a number of elements. One of them is that the relationship with the business community is paramount to the success of the strategy. I wonder how that will work out on the ground. Will there be forums established to allow members of the FET to relate to the business sector? Is it individual providers and employer representative groups who will sit on those forums? If possible, I want to tease that out.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	26	The strategy has identified five high-level goals. Goal number two is to support the active inclusion of those of all abilities in society with special reference to literacy and numeracy. I suppose the best analogy I can draw in terms of what the strategy is setting to achieve is that on the national framework for qualifications, NFQ, there are ten levels or, if one likes, ten different floors, and the lift needs to go to every floor. Every person who is on whatever level, from level one to level six, seven or eight, needs to be able to press the button and be assured that the lift arrives at his or her floor and allows him or her to access that NFQ at whatever point is appropriate for him or her. I was fortunate to be able to engage with a significant number of learners in the run-up to the development of SOLAS and the strategy, and one of the overriding concerns of learners was that they needed to be able to access high quality educational opportunities in their community, home town or village. That is still very much at the heart of the strategy. That first engagement, that first support which people can find so difficult, will be supported and nurtured by SOLAS and the ETBs in future. In terms of engagement with employers, it is exceptionally important that such engagement occurs so we can ensure the learning and training opportunities we are providing for people are up to date and respond directly to the needs of the employment market, right at this point in time and as it evolves over time as it is doing on a rapid basis. As Deputy O'Brien will be aware, there are industry representatives on the board of SOLAS, but also there is provision in the legislation for similar representatives on the boards of the ETBs. Each education and training board, ETB, is currently determining how exactly it can provide for that engagement, but Deputy O'Brien's suggestion of a forum is worthwhile. In meeting some significant employers, I have already spoken to some CEOs who are going down that route. For example, in Galway city there are 8,000 employed in medical devices manufacturing who hold a significant key to the future success of that city and region and it would be reasonable to expect that they would have a role to play in determining the kinds of learning and training opportunities provided in that region. It will be done on a regional basis reflecting the needs of each individual region for which the ETB has responsibility.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	27	I have two brief questions. In relation to the ETBs, because they are such a new entity, some ETBs may be more successful at creating those forums. I wonder what facility is there in place for the individual CEOs to take best practice from each ETB area and how that will be managed. As to my other question, one of the points in the report, on page 19, on how we measure the success of the strategy, is:Everybody who engages with FET, whether employed or unemployed or wishing to engage with FET for the purpose of learning, can access a high quality career guidance, counselling and labour marketing information service.Will the Minister of State give us some more information on how that will be achieved in practice rather than in theory?
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	28	One of the benefits of the rationalisation, from 33 VECs to 16 ETBs, will be the opportunity for CEOs to share knowledge, experience and best practice. That sharing of best practice will be facilitated by SOLAS at national level. If we see examples of best practice occurring in any part of the country - I expect we will see it occurring in all parts of the country in terms of different kinds of provision and different kinds of training opportunities - it is the ambition of SOLAS to allow for that information and best practice to be shared across the system of 16 ETBs. In terms of the engagement at local level, the primary engagement for the unemployed will be through their Intreo office. On approaching their Intreo office, they will be able to access two unique and distinct different kinds of advice: first, the advice from the Department of Social Protection as to what kind of social welfare supports are available for them while they find themselves in that difficult place of being unemployed; and second, expert guidance from staff from within the ETB as to what exactly are the job opportunities because there will be a forensic and ongoing analysis of job opportunities in each ETB region, and then guidance and advice as to how a person can access those opportunities. Those opportunities will be there. The provision of education and training in each region will reflect the skills demands in each region and will be up to date and responsive to the demands of the labour market at the time. There will be those opportunities and there will be guidance given as to how one can access those opportunities.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	29	On Question No. 6, the Deputy is not present. Therefore, we will move on to Question No. 7 in the name of Deputy McConalogue.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	30	I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 21 and 28 together. The surveys cited by Deputy McConalogue focused on guidance counsellors and, in particular, on the time they spend in a one-to-one setting giving career guidance and student counselling. Guidance and counselling are a whole-school responsibility, with guidance counsellors playing their part within an overall team approach. The representative organisations for school principals and school management have developed a framework that assists schools on how best to manage the provision of guidance from within their staffing allocation. Wherever possible, group work and class-based activity should be used to maximise the amount of time available for those pupils who are most in need of one-to-one support. In February the Department of Education and Skills published a guide to developing student support teams in post-primary schools. This is an important resource for schools in promoting and protecting students' well-being and an aid to establishing a team or reviewing an existing team.

#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	32	I asked the Minister of State specifically for his views on the fact that the survey found a decrease of 59% in one-to-one counselling time as a result of the cuts introduced by his Government. His response has been similar to previous replies from the Minister for Education and Skills, namely, that guidance counselling and guidance are a whole-school activity. I draw the Minister of State's attention to a letter which issued to every principal in Ireland in second level schools and colleges of further education on behalf of the teacher education section of his Department. The letter requested principals to facilitate their guidance counsellors' attendance at professional counselling supervision on five occasions for two hours each time during the next academic year. This service, which is funded and overseen by the Department, was put in place by a previous Minister for Education and Skills to ensure that all the one-to-one counselling taking place in schools meets the highest ethical standards and that guidance practitioners receive constant professional supervision to ensure these standards are maintained. Given the often difficult personal issues that students raise in their interactions with guidance counsellors, I am sure the Minister of State will agree that the maintenance of such high professional standards is essential. Is he now stating that while those who are professionally trained and subject to ongoing supervision of their work as guidance counsellors have lost 59% of the time available to them to undertake this activity, the implications are limited because guidance should be a whole-school activity? That is not a situation anyone can stand over. I ask him to specifically address that point.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	33	In my earlier reply I outlined to the Deputy how the vast majority of guidance support will operate within the school community in future. The representative organisations for school principals and my Department have worked to develop a framework to allow schools to best manage the provision of guidance from within their staffing allocations. That puts a greater emphasis on group work and class-based activity and, for the significant majority of the role fulfilled by guidance counsellors, I argue that it is more than sufficient. Where the need arises for one-to-one support for young people, particularly where they experience mental health issues or other challenges, it is important that guidance and support are allocated to them as needed. Well developed and managed student support teams are central to the successful implementation of guidance, and two previous documents which have outlined how that might happen are the guidelines Well-Being in Post-Primary School, which were published in 2013, and A Continuum of Support for Post-Primary Schools, which was published in 2010. These documents provide a framework for schools to support students with social, emotional or academic needs, and their implementation will make a significant contribution to the general well-being of young people and provide a stable and supportive learning environment for all students. Guidance counsellors have two distinct functions. The first is general career guidance and guidance on the educational opportunities a child or young person might pursue, while the second involves support for students' well-being. If a school manages its resources well in terms of guidance, I do not think either of those provisions will suffer at any point in the future.
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	34	The evidence shows there has been a reduction of 59% in one-to-one guidance counselling time since the Government introduced the cuts. The Minister of State referred to a framework his Department is trying to develop with principals to govern how guidance counsellors should operate. I remind him once again of the framework that was put in place a number of years ago to ensure that guidance counsellors are professionally supervised and trained in counselling, particularly in one-to-one counselling. It is a service that requires training and people who know what they are doing. In essence, the Minister of State is saying that subject teachers who do not have professional counselling skills will be expected to consider this work as part of whole-school guidance and an activity in which they can comfortably engage. Is the Minister of State comfortable with allowing teachers who have no qualifications in counselling to counsel vulnerable children, while at the same time insisting on the highest standards of counselling from those who are qualified to do so? This is an exceptionally important service. Students are encountering more difficulties with mental health now than they have in the past. The incidence of self-harm is increasing. The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, recently spoke in a radio interview about her plans to deploy nurses with relevant qualifications to accident and emergency departments to deal with people presenting with mental health problems. When people present to accident and emergency departments they have already been failed by the supports that should be on offer in the community and schools. The Minister of State is trying to deflect from this issue by minimising the impact of the 59% reduction in one-to-one counselling time. This is not something the Government should stand over because it is not safe or fair to children who need support from our school system and the State. The matter needs to be reconsidered with a view to reinstating supports for guidance counselling in schools.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	35	The 59% reduction in one-to-one counselling time to which the Deputy referred includes both the guidance that a child or young person might need to deal with issues arising in school, such as bullying or mental health problems, and career guidance support for young people. With a better allocation of resources and a reallocation of guidance counsellors' time, the supports that a child or young person might need for his or her mental well-being and in dealing with challenges are capable of being catered for within the new guidance counselling structure. The principal and leadership of a school have the best knowledge and experience to determine how exactly guidance resources and teaching resources should be allocated. Even as our budgetary situation recovers, hopefully, over the coming years, I do not believe we should reinstate that one dedicated guidance post. I do not think it is necessary because, with some innovation and imagination, we can end up with a more holistic guidance and counselling support service across all of the teaching community in a school. I do not subscribe to the assertion that teachers, as highly trained individuals and responsible adults operating in a school environment, do not have the professional capacity or knowledge to deal with a significant number of the issues that arise in their classrooms on a daily basis.

While it is recognised that reform is necessary and that there is concern among teachers' unions, I am trying to ascertain the extent to which we can address the need for reform while recognising the need to include all stakeholders.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	37	I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 17 and 62 together. The Minister for Education and Skills and his officials are very open to discussing issues of disagreement relating to the junior cycle student award with the teacher unions, and have been all along. The Minister has asked his officials to continue to have discussions with the partners through the national working group on junior cycle. He has received detailed suggestions, particularly from the management and patron bodies, which will inform the discussions, but he continues to await similar written submissions from the teacher unions.The Minister's door has always been, and will remain, open to anyone in the teaching profession and their representative bodies who want to engage as to how best to deliver this very significant reform of our education system at junior cycle.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	38	As the Deputy who tabled Question No. 17 is not present, Deputy Durkan has six minutes for this question.

We must ask to what extent it will be possible to reconcile the need for reform with the question whether the review of students by their teachers is the appropriate way to do it and the willingness on the part of teachers and their unions to cross that Rubicon in the interests of education and the children.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	40	A national working group has been established to see how best we can achieve this welcome reform of our junior cycle system. The group includes representatives from the Teachers Union of Ireland, TUI, the Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland, ASTI, all the school management bodies, the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, NAPD, Educate Together, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, and the State Examination Commission. It has established three subgroups to examine closely the challenges that some have suggested might emanate from this reform. The subgroups are on quality assurance and support for teacher assessment, continuing professional development required to support teachers and school leaders to implement the junior cycle, and workload and implementation issues for schools and teachers. The subgroup on quality assurance and support is considering ways the assessment and moderation of the new junior cycle will be addressed. The management bodies, Educate Together and parents have provided written submissions containing their views and they are being considered by the Department. However, without a written submission from teachers it is impossible to have the balanced debate the Deputy rightly suggests we have. The teachers must make that submission to represent their views alongside all the other education partners. Without it we are operating in a vacuum. I call upon the teachers' unions across the country to make submissions, engage with the process and, hopefully, arrive at a point where we can collectively move forward together to implement the reform.

#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	42	While I hope the review will be completed by the end of the year, it is being stalled - I do not suggest deliberately - by the non-engagement of the unions in terms of a written submission. The sooner we receive such a submission the quicker we can move towards a conclusion.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	43	Given that the new junior cycle is due to commence in September, I hope the review concludes before the end of the year. The Minister of State is being disingenuous when he says he does not know the teachers' unions' concerns because they have not provided a written submission. The Minister of State and Department are very well aware of their concerns. It is unfair to say he cannot progress unless they engage. They have been engaging with the groups the Department established. To say he does not know their concerns because they have not put them on paper is unfair.
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	44	A recent survey of parents' opinions by a professional polling company is that 60% want to retain independent assessment of the new junior certificate. That is where there is disagreement and the Minister of State refuses to take on board what teachers and parents want. I urge the Minister of State to re-examine this with the Minister, who has been obstinate, stubborn and blind to the views of others in his approach to a very important reform of our education system.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	45	When one is attempting to work with parents, the teaching profession and school communities to implement a very significant reform, it is exceptionally important to engage with all partners. When those partners raise valid concerns about the implementation of the reformed junior cycle, it is important to engage with them. That engagement has been ongoing and the national working group has been established. However, it is exceptionally difficult to operate in an environment where a significant number of the representative groups involved in the process have not made written submissions. We need those ideas as to how we can make this work to the best possible extent. Teachers are professionals and I have every confidence in their professionalism and integrity. Until they put their heads together and use their professional experience to suggest how exactly we can implement the reform, it is very difficult to move forward.

Some parents are wondering whether the NCE and Department will sign this lease. The school wants only a letter of comfort from the Department stating it will continue to receive funding for the next five years.

This project proceeded to tender in April and it is envisaged that, subject to no issues arising, the project will proceed to construction shortly. Following consultations with representatives of Gaelscoil Mhic Amhlaigh and Department officials, it was agreed to relocate the Gaelscoil to a new greenfield site. A suitable site has been identified and the acquisition process is ongoing. Department officials will meet the school's representatives shortly to review the plans for the new school building.

#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	56	I thank the Ceann Comhairle. Section 7 of Circular 0030/2014 states that access to SNA support for pupils with behavioural care needs will only be sanctioned under certain conditions. It seems to indicate that the Department believes a child with behavioural care needs should first be disciplined and punished by a school before SNA support is provided. Will the Minister explain the rationale behind the policy?
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	57	I do not think Deputy Wallace will be playing midfield with Wexford Youths any time in the future. Section 7 of the circular states that in the case of new applications for SNA support, for children with behavioural care needs - that is, where a professional report has identified the care needs as being related to behaviour - in general, it will not be possible to consider access to SNA support until there has been a clear assessment of the child's needs in the classroom setting. The term "in general" allows flexibility for the NCSE to make an SNA allocation immediately where there is a clear and obvious need. However, for most pupils, the circular sets out that it is important to assess how pupils respond to behaviour management strategies in class before allocating SNA support, as SNA support is not designed to be that first response to behavioural difficulties. This section of the circular will not prevent those pupils who need support from receiving that support.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	58	Some parents are very worried. A parent I know in Wexford, Jane Johnstone, has pointed out to me that the section of the circular is a serious concern for many parents. She stated:Most of our kids wouldn't have the understanding of rules, and when kids present with challenging behaviours it's largely due to one of two reasons - either they can't communicate their needs, or are over-stimulated and unable to cope with their environment due to a sensory processing disability. To implement disciplinary action on a child who has a disability or autism is therefore effectively punishing them for having a disability, and for breaking rules that they cannot understand. In addition, there is a fear that these kids will be suspended or expelled, and will fall out of the education system completely, in the absence of needs-based support.Is it not true that more difficult arrangements are being put in place to save money?
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	59	No, it is not true. They are being put in place to clarify the role of the SNA and to ensure that this nation's scarce resources are directed towards those who need them most. The Government approved an extra 390 SNA posts last December up to the end of this year, which means that almost 11,000 SNAs are now available to work. That is the largest number of SNAs we have had since the foundation of the SNA support system. It is not about saving money; it is about ensuring that those children who need SNA support can have access to it. It is important to point out also that professionals - teachers - have significant skills, and they acquire those skills in their training in behaviour management within the classroom setting. Those behaviour management skills apply to all children, and they have the capacity to determine the way and on what basis they are applied.  Despite the tough economic circumstances we faced, we protected - and in some cases regarding SNA provision, increased - the budget devoted to supporting our children. This is not about saving money. It is a reflection of our Government's priorities to protect and cherish our children who have special educational needs. The circular does not seek to remove or reduce SNA support to those children who are very much in need of it.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	60	I understand the Government has retained the numbers-----
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	61	It has increased the numbers.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	62	The big problem is that the demand has grown greatly, which is unfortunate. The number of children needing help has increased a great deal and we have not kept pace in dealing with them. We know that resources are stretched, but children are falling behind now because they do not have as much support. The Minister of State said that teachers are qualified to look after many of these children, but the teachers already have their hands full dealing with the other children. The Minister cannot deny that children with difficulties will fall further behind, and it is unfair to allow so much of an impact on their potential to improve, which is what the parents are telling me is happening.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	63	I was fortunate to work for seven years for a charity that cares for children with special needs. It is not fair to characterise - I am not making this accusation about Deputy Wallace - all children with special needs as having behavioural difficulties; a significant number of them do not. The professional assessment and conclusion drawn by the SENO should be the main factor in determining whether young people need SNA support. It is not and has never been the intention of this Government to reduce the support available to special needs children within our school system. This circular is, first, clarifying the role of the SNAs in terms of their function within the classroom setting and, second, ensuring that those children who need SNA support from the first day they enter the school environment have that support available to them. As their needs evolve and change and, hopefully, diminish, that SNA support can be reduced - there is nothing wrong with that - and those supports can be allocated to other children coming into the system who might be more deserving of them at that time.

I am aware of and have noted the findings of the Irish Independent-Millward Brown opinion poll which was published last week. Last year, officials from the Department went to 12 locations around the country and met parents to explain the implications of the implementation of the framework for the junior cycle. Parents had concerns - I am a parent and I speak to other parents - but when the new approaches were explained they understood the need for these new approaches and the vast majority of parents welcomed them. In the past few weeks my officials met representatives of both the national parents' councils – primary and post-primary - to discuss the needs of parents. It has been agreed that both national parent councils for primary and post-primary will, in partnership with the NCCA, organise a series of meetings around the country between now and the school summer holidays to explain the new approach to learning and assessment. The arrangements for these are detailed in the accompanying table. There is a significant information already available for parents on the NCCA website at www.juniorcycle.ie.DateCountyVenueMonday 27th May 2013Dublin NorthDublin Skylon Hotel, Upper Drumcondra Rd., Drumcondra, Dublin 9Monday 27th May 2013Dublin WestCrown Plaza, BlanchardstownWednesday 29th May 2013Dublin SouthDublin West Ed CentreThursday 30th May 2013MonaghanGlencarn Hotel, CastleblaneyTuesday 4th June 2013WexfordWhites of WexfordTuesday 4th June 2013DonegalMount Errigal HotelWednesday 5th June 2013TraleeTralee Education CentreThursday 6th June 2013Cork CityRochestown ParkThursday 6th June 2013LimerickSouth Court Hotel, RaheenMonday 10th June 2013MayoMayo Education Centre, Castlebar Tuesday 11th June 2013GalwaySalthill Hotel, Promenade, GalwayThursday 13th June 2013Longford TownLongford Arms Hotel

I attended one of the 12 meetings that took place throughout the country. There were attendances of 50, 60 and 70 people at the 12 meetings. The Minister has before him a survey by a reputable polling company telling him that 60% of parents believe that independent assessment at junior cycle level should continue. The Minister, Deputy Quinn, has not been listening on this issue. He tried to dismiss it as a concern of teachers alone and said that the parents to whom he had spoken did not have a concern. The evidence is available now to indicate that parents believe independent assessment should continue. I asked transition year students for their views and the majority of them believe independent assessment should continue. The way this issue has been handled is unfortunate.It is time the Minister and the Minister of State started to listen to the views of others on this issue. Reform is about more than just the Minister for Education and Skills.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	68	Reform is about more than just the Minister for Education and Skills. However, there are times in the lifetime of any Government when somebody must take the lead and a stand in terms of what needs to be done to reform the education system. Nobody denies that the junior certificate programme, as constituted, is broken. It serves no function or purpose in empowering young people to be exceptionally able in the future. We abolished the primary certificate programme many years ago when it became apparent that it also served no useful function. Everybody agrees that this is the right direction in which to move. There is no question about this; what is at issue is implementation. The Minister and I have engaged with young people on a number of issues in the recent past, including this one. The door is open in terms of how we should implement this badly needed reform of the junior cycle system. The working group has been established and includes representatives of the parents council. As I said, we propose to re-engage with parents and will do our best to make people aware of the opportunities to engage with us at various centres throughout the country. There will be a public relations campaign around these opportunities. Our door is open to parents, student and teacher representatives. Nobody denies this is the direction in which we need to move. I agree that we need to re-engage to determine how we can address the concerns raised by parents and teachers.
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	69	Unfortunately, since the Minister announced his intentions in this regard, his door has not been open. The initial National Council for Curriculum and Assessment working group report on the future of junior certificate reform advocated that the 60% examination part of the new junior cycle student award should be independently marked. The Minister made a unilateral decision not to accept this recommendation. At the teachers' conferences last year he described junior certificate reform as a person political project. The result of his approach to this matter is that teachers are refusing to co-operate and there is talk of further industrial action by them in the autumn. As pointed out by the Minister of State, reform of the second level system is very much needed. However, it is being bogged down and brought into question by the approach being taken by the Minister. One of the key issues is independent assessment. It is time the Minister opened his door and worked with others in coming up with a solution and that he take on board the views of parents, teachers and students on independent assessment and incorporated it into the very much needed reform of the junior cycle system.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	70	We must be careful not to lose faith in the professional capacity of teachers to independently, fairly and transparently verify the progress of their students. I am not suggesting the Deputy is making that charge. As parents, we receive reports on the academic achievements and social success or otherwise in the school setting of our children at the end of first and second year and the first half of third year. We have trusted this system for decades. Why should we not trust it now? That is one of the key questions for me. That said, if parents and the teaching profession, in which I have the utmost faith, are expressing concerns, we need to re-engage. Without that engagement and the support of parents, teacher unions and young people we cannot move forward together. The Minister has stated he is open to significant discussion on the independent assessment and verification of young people's achievements, academically and otherwise. His door and that of the Department of Education and Skills remain open. As I stated, we propose to engage again with parents in the next number of weeks. This engagement will continue until we arrive at a consensus on how to move forward together.

#FergusODowdFG	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-party	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-dob	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	72	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time." First, this legislation will establish the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF. This is one of the key elements of the programme for Government and the medium-term economic strategy published last December. The ISIF will take over the assets of the National Pensions Reserve Fund, comprising some €6.9 billion in the discretionary portfolio at the end of the first quarter of the year, to be used for commercial investment in the economy to support economic activity and employment and some €13.3 billion representing the directed investments in the pillar banks, together with related cash balances. Second, the legislation will put NewERA, New Economy and Recovery Authority, on a statutory basis. The core role of NewERA is to provide financial and commercial advice on commercial semi-State bodies for shareholding Ministers. NewERA's role also involves, where requested, advising on the disposal or restructuring of State assets. In addition, it works with relevant stakeholders to develop proposals for investment in energy, broadband, water and forestry projects. It has been operating as a business unit within the NTMA and the Bill defines that function in legislation. Third, the legislation will restructure the corporate governance of the NTMA and its associated entities. The Bill will streamline and simplify the governance structure of the agency and its associated entities which are now relatively complex as a result of the assignment to it of additional functions since it was first established in 1991 as a single function agency responsible for funding and debt management. The reconstituted agency will be directly responsible for funding and debt management, the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, NewERA, the functions of the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, and the State Claims Agency. There will be no change in relation to NAMA which will continue with its own board and to which the NTMA will continue to provide business services and staff. Fourth, the legislation will put the legal costs unit within the State Claims Agency on a statutory basis. The NTMA is known as the State Claims Agency when dealing with claims against State agencies. The legal costs unit deals with third party costs such as those arising from the Mahon and Moriarty tribunals of inquiry, with the aim of minimising the financial exposure of the State and achieving significant savings for the Exchequer. The Bill comprises seven Parts and four Schedules. Part 1 deals with the preliminary and general provisions, including the Short Title. Part 2 contains provisions relating to the governance structure of the agency. I trust Deputies will bear with me while I set out as clearly as possible the current governance structures in the NTMA.  The NTMA was established in 1991 under the National Treasury Management Agency Act 1990 to borrow on behalf of the Exchequer and manage the national debt. The agency was established outside normal public sector structures, with operational freedom to negotiate market competitive salaries. Information on these salaries is available in the annual report. This business model was designed to enable the NTMA to compete with the private sector and attract and retain specialists in mid-career who would not normally be attracted to working in a public sector environment.Subsequently, a number of additional functions were assigned to the NTMA. As with debt management, these were also commercial and market-facing functions where the agency's business model gave it the flexibility to attract and retain staff with the necessary expertise and experience.  The agency took over the management of personal injury and property damage claims against the State in 2000, and is known as the State Claims Agency when doing so. The National Pensions Reserve Fund was established in 2001. The agency is the manager of the fund. The National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, was established in 2003. Its role is to provide financial advice to State bodies undertaking major public investment projects and to procure and deliver public-private partnership projects in sectors other than transport and local authorities. It also procures non-PPP schools on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills. It acts through the NTMA. The NTMA, acting through its NewERA unit, provides advice to shareholding Ministers in regard to commercial semi-state bodies. The NTMA also provides staff and business and support services to NAMA. Turning to the governance structures underlying these functions, the NTMA does not have a board, although it does have an advisory committee whose role is to advise on matters referred to it by the agency. The chief executive is directly responsible to the Minister for the performance of the functions of the agency. The chief executive reports directly to the Minister on the NTMA's funding and debt management, State Claims Agency and NewERA functions. To that extent, the agency is more like a Department than a State agency. The NTMA is responsible for claims management and risk management on behalf of State agencies and is known as the State Claims Agency when doing so. A committee advises on policy and procedures in regard to that work. The NPRF, the NDFA and NAMA - all of which were established under their own governing legislation - all have their own boards. The NTMA acts as the executive in respect of the NPRF and the NDFA. It assigns staff to NAMA and also provides it with business and support services and systems. The NTMA chief executive is an ex officio member of the NPRF commission and the board of NAMA and is ex officio chairman of the NDFA. A director of the NTMA acts as CEO of the NDFA. The NTMA has a number of other functions, such as providing a central treasury service to State agencies and managing various funds, but these are not affected by this Bill.  That is the current position. The agency has carried out the functions it has been assigned with skill and dedication. The governance structure under which it operates has become unwieldy and complex, as my speech indicates. As we put NewERA, the ISIF and the legal costs unit on a statutory footing, we are taking the opportunity to simplify and streamline the governance structures of the NTMA to ensure it is governed in a way that reflects best practice and that will assist it in working in an integrated manner towards the achievement of its objectives. The legislation will convert the agency into a body with members, effectively a board. It will have nine members in total, six appointed by the Minister for Finance, serving a five-year term, and, ex-officio, the chief executive officer of the NTMA, the Secretary General of the Department of Finance and the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. The Minister for Finance will nominate one of the appointed members as chairperson. All these people will have to have specialist skills and knowledge in the areas in which they are operating. The reconstituted NTMA will continue to be directly responsible for the borrowing and debt management functions, as well as the State Claims Agency and various other functions such as the central treasury service, just as it is now. In addition, it will now be directly responsible for the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund and NDFA functions, rather than acting on behalf of other statutory bodies, and it will have NewERA. No changes are proposed to the existing arrangements in respect of NAMA. NAMA will continue to have its own separate board and the existing arrangements whereby the NTMA assigns staff to NAMA and provides business and support services, including HR, IT, market risk, finance, compliance and treasury services, will also continue. On foot of the changes outlined, the NTMA advisory committee and the NDFA and its board will be dissolved, as will the State Claims Agency policy committee. The NPRF commission will also be dissolved as soon as practicable. Turning to the detail of the governance changes, section 8 of the Bill amends the NTMA Act 1990 to provide that the National Treasury Management Agency will be a body with a chairperson and other members. The members will in effect form a board that will be responsible for oversight of the agency and will report to the Minister for Finance. As I mentioned earlier, there will be nine members, with six appointed by the Minister, in addition to the chief executive of the agency, the Secretary General of the Department of Finance and the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. The Minister may appoint as members only persons with expertise and experience at a senior level in a number of specified areas, such as investment, treasury management, economics and accounting. The Minister is required to ensure that there is an equitable balance between men and women, as far as practicable. The chair of the agency is appointed by the Minister. Section 8 inserts a new Schedule, Schedule A, into the NTMA Act 1990. This sets out the detail in relation to the members of the agency. Appointments will generally be for five years, but the term of office of the initial members will be staggered so that they do not all end at the same time. This is in the interests of continuity. A member may not serve more than two consecutive terms of office. Terms and conditions of appointment will be set by the Minister for Finance. The Schedule also contains ancillary provisions, covering such areas as disqualification from office and filling of vacancies. Any remuneration of board members will be published in the annual report. There will be total transparency. Section 9 inserts a new section 3B in the NTMA Act 1990 to provide for the procedures of the agency, the detail of which is set out the Schedule. This sets out rules for the quorum for meetings, electronic meetings and the seal of the agency. The agency will be able to hold incorporeal meetings and pass resolutions by majority without a meeting. This sort of flexibility is essential for an agency which has a central role in the financing of the Exchequer in order to allow speedy decision-making. Section 10 inserts new sections 5A and 5B in the NTMA Act 1990 to establish an investment committee, which will be a committee of the agency and, under the authority of the agency, will be responsible for the investment of ISIF, and allow the agency to establish other committees, respectively. The investment committee will have up to seven members, two members of the agency and up to five persons who are not members of the agency but who have substantial relevant expertise and experience and are appointed with the consent of the Minister for Finance. The chair of the investment committee will be a member of the agency and will be appointed by the agency. Section 11 amends section 6 of the NTMA Act 1990. It sets out the role of the chief executive, reflecting the reconstitution of the agency and the change in reporting relationships. The chief executive will be appointed by the agency with the consent of the Minister for Finance. Section 12 inserts new sections 6A and 6B in the NTMA Act 1990. They provide for the chief executive to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts of Dáil Éireann and for the chairperson and chief executive to appear before other Oireachtas committees, respectively. There will be direct accountability to the Oireachtas in that context. Section 13 effectively updates section 10 of the NTMA Act 1990 so that members of local authorities, as with members of the Oireachtas and European Parliament, may not be employed by the agency. If an employee of the agency becomes a member of a local authority, the Oireachtas or the European Parliament, he or she will stand seconded from the agency. Section 14 amends the provisions concerning the accounts of the agency pursuant to section 12 of the NTMA Act 1990 to take account of the new structures. The accounts are to be signed by the chief executive and an appointed member of the agency. The chief executive will be the officer accountable for the agency. Section 15 inserts new sections 13A and 13B. These sections cover the disclosure of interests by members of the agency and committees of the agency and members of staff of the agency, respectively. Section 16 inserts a new section 13C which provides for the indemnification of members of the agency, members of a committee of the agency, members of staff of the agency and members of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission, where the agency is satisfied that duties have been discharged in good faith. Section 17 replaces section 14 of the Act, covering the disclosure of confidential information. It updates the existing provision to take account of the new structures proposed for the NTMA and developments with regard to the disclosure of confidential information since the NTMA was established. The existing provision is very strict: it is an offence for a person to disclose information obtained in the course of carrying out his or her duties on behalf of the agency. The new section is more nuanced. It will continue to be an offence to disclose, without the consent of the agency, information obtained while performing functions on its behalf. This is essential, given that staff of the agency will have access to information which is very sensitive commercially. However, it will not now be an offence to disclose confidential information in certain circumstances, including disclosure to the Minister for Finance or An Garda Síochána where the information may relate to the commission of an offence. These qualifications to the legislation mean that there is a route available for individuals who believe they should raise issues outside the confines of the agency. Given the pivotal role of the agency in financing the State, while sensitive commercial information is protected, it is also essential that individuals should be able to bring justifiable concerns to an outside authority without risking committing an offence. Part 3 deals with the New Economy and Recovery Authority, NewERA, which is already up and running as part of the NTMA, providing financial and commercial advice on certain commercial semi-State bodies for shareholding Ministers. This part of the Bill puts NewERA on a statutory basis. The idea behind NewERA is that it will help to oversee the financial performance, corporate strategy and capital and investment plans of commercial semi-State bodies. It will provide a dedicated source of corporate finance expertise for Ministers taking a commercial approach to the oversight of semi-State companies, with an emphasis on return on capital. It will also work with stakeholders to develop structures and proposals for investment in energy, broadband and water projects to support economic activity and employment. Its role will also involve, where requested, advising on the disposal or restructuring of State assets. The NTMA will be responsible for the performance of the shareholder advisory functions and known as NewERA when performing these functions. Section 18 sets out the designated commercial semi-State bodies on which the agency will provide advice. These are the ESB, Bord Gáis, Bord na Mona, Coillte Teoranta and EirGrid. The Minister for Finance, after consulting the NTMA, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and relevant shareholding Ministers, may add other State bodies to the list by order. This enabling provision will allow other shareholding Ministers to benefit from NewERA's commercial expertise. Section 19 defines what NewERA does. It provides financial and commercial advisory services on request for Ministers in respect of the commercial semi-State bodies within its remit. This covers advice on a wide range of issues: a Minister's statutory role, exercising rights as a shareholder, the governance of a semi-State body, expected rates of return, dividend policy, corporate and investment strategy, acquisitions and disposals, as well as appointments and the remuneration of directors and the chief executive. NewERA will also be able to provide project management services and for oversight of acquisitions and disposals and restructurings, at the request of the Minister. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will have power to give directions to NewERA on the performance of its functions. He or she must first consult the Minister for Finance and any relevant shareholding Minister. This mirrors the ministerial power of direction over other NTMA functions. Any such direction must be published. An important aspect of the role of NewERA is that it is required, under subsection (4), to have regard to the effective and efficient application of capital by commercial semi-State bodies taken as a whole. The point is that commercial semi-State bodies should not be looked at in isolation, one from another. Rather, a portfolio approach should be considered with a view to optimising the deployment of capital. Section 20 provides that the agency may provide financial and commercial advisory services, as well as project management and advisory services, in regard to other bodies and assets if requested by the Minister with responsibility for the body or asset.  Section 21 requires NewERA to submit a report on the financial performance of each of the commercial semi-State bodies within its remit to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and relevant Ministers each year. Section 22 provides that the agency, in consultation with relevant Ministers, may develop proposals for investment to support economic activity and employment in energy, water, telecommunications and forestry projects. The Minister for Finance, having consulted the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and other relevant Ministers, may specify other sectors by order. A successful example of work in this area was NewERA's work with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources on the recently announced launch of the €70 million national energy efficiency fund backed by London and Regional Properties and Glen Dimplex. Section 23 requires Ministers to provide NewERA with the information it requires to carry out its functions. Ministers must have regard to the advice provided, but this does not constrain them in any way. Section 24 provides that NewERA is to establish procedures for seeking and providing advice, in consultation with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and relevant Ministers. The protocols agreed will streamline interactions between the agency and Departments and ensure NewERA will achieve its full potential. Part 4 gives the agency responsibility for the role currently carried out by the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, in regard to infrastructural projects. The NDFA was established on 1 January 2003 under the National Development Finance Agency Act 2002 to provide financial advice for State authorities on capital projects over a certain size - at present €20 million. It also procures and delivers PPPs other than in the transport and local authority sectors. As I said, it is currently a stand-alone corporate body which discharges its functions through the NTMA. It is proposed that the NDFA and its board be dissolved and its functions be assigned directly to the agency. The two National Development Finance Agency Acts of 2002 and 2007 are repealed by section 6 and this Part, in effect, restates the provisions of these two Acts in so far as they relate to the NDFA's functions, with one exception. The 2002 Act provides that the NDFA can borrow and advance moneys in respect of infrastructural projects, but this power is being removed because the revised rules on Government accounting treatment, as issued by EUROSTAT in February 2004, deemed such transactions to be "on" the State's balance sheet and, consequently, this provision was never used. Section 25 defines terms used in this Part. Section 26 gathers together the functions of the NDFA under the National Development Finance Agency Act 2002, the National Development Finance Agency (Amendment) Act 2007 and the Education and Training Boards Act 2013. These are as follows: providing advice on the optimal financing of public investment projects for State authorities which are defined in Schedule 3 to the Bill and which broadly mean Departments and non-commercial semi-State bodies; providing a specialised procurement delivery function in respect of PPPs, with the exception of road and rail projects, for which the NRA has responsibility; and providing a procurement service in respect of non-PPP schools on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills. Section 27 provides that the agency shall have regard to policy directions and guidance issued by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to State authorities on the financing of public investment projects and PPPs. Section 28 provides that a State authority shall seek the advice of the agency before undertaking a public investment project, subject to guidelines that may be issued by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. Section 29 provides that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform may specify State authorities, in other words, bodies which the NDFA can advise.  Under section 30, the NDFA recoups its costs from the State bodies for which it provides its services.Part 5 establishes a legal costs unit within the State Claims Agency function to look after costs awarded by tribunals of inquiry. Part 5 sets out the detail of how the agency is to operate when managing claims for costs. The Government will delegate to the agency claims in respect of specific tribunals. The National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2000 and subsequent delegation orders delegated to the NTMA a range of functions in respect of the management of personal injuries claims, including bullying and harassment and third-party property damage claims, and their associated risks, against specified State authorities. The agency is known as the State Claims Agency, SCA, when performing these functions.  The SCA has already started to advise on costs awarded by the Mahon tribunal on planning matters and the Moriarty tribunal on payments to politicians. Setting up the legal costs unit within the SCA is being done to minimise the State's exposure and deliver significant savings to the Exchequer as it is recognised that third-party costs represent the major portion of the costs of tribunals. These costs are awarded by the tribunals and their amounts are drawn up in retrospect. The legal costs unit will provide specialist advice in this area and will assess and-or challenge third-party costs claims in order to ensure the costs to the Exchequer are reasonable. Sections 31 and 32 define terms used in this part. Section 33 provides that the agency will manage delegated claims for costs to ensure that costs and expenses are contained at the lowest level achievable. Section 34 empowers the Government to delegate the management of claims for costs to the agency. Section 35 specifies that when managing claims for costs, the agency will do so on behalf of the Attorney General. Section 36 sets out the arrangement which will apply in respect of the payment of legal costs and professional fees. The agency will make such payments out of advances from the Post Office Savings Bank Fund and will subsequently recoup the amounts from the relevant State authority. I will now move on to Part 6. In September 2011, the Government announced its intention to establish the Strategic Investment Fund, which formed part of the programme for Government published in March 2011. The intention is that the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, will channel its resources towards productive investment in the Irish economy and leverage its resources with private sector co-investment and target investment in areas of strategic significance to the future of the Irish economy. Part 6 of this Bill establishes the ISIF. The ISIF will replace the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF, with a mandate to invest on a commercial basis in Ireland so as to support economic activity and employment. The NPRF was established in 2001 as an investment fund to build additional resources to support the Exchequer from 2025 onwards when it was projected that the burden of social welfare and public service pensions would have increased significantly. The NPRF is controlled by the NPRF commission. The NTMA is the manager of the fund and is essentially responsible for investing the NPRF as approved by the commission. In 2009, amending legislation was introduced to allow the Minister for Finance to direct the NPRF commission to recapitalise the banks in order to support the banking system. These are called the directed investments. The value of the NPRF holdings in Irish banks together with related cash balances was €13.3 billion at the end of March. The value of the fund's other investments was €6.9 billion at the end of March. This is what we call the discretionary portfolio which is managed and invested by the NPRF commission. While the State must continue to be aware of the future budgetary implications of social welfare and pension obligations, fostering economic activity and employment in Ireland is a greater priority in the current circumstances and the resources of the NPRF should be redeployed accordingly. As the Minister for Finance has stated, the best way to ensure that the State is in a position to meet its future obligations is to ensure the economy is growing. The ISIF is to be invested on a commercial basis. This will put the fund in a position to leverage its resources by attracting private sector co-investment, recycle its resources in order to make more strategic investments over time and ensure the public assets entrusted to the fund are not frittered away. The primary point of the exercise is to enhance economic activity and increase employment in Ireland which in turn will support the Exchequer. The agency will be responsible for setting the overall investment strategy for the ISIF. When determining and reviewing the strategy, the agency must consult the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, who may consult other Ministers, and must have regard to their views.

#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	77	I am glad to have the opportunity on behalf of Fianna Fáil to speak to Second Stage of this Bill and to state at the outset that we welcome the broad thrust of this Bill and will be supporting its passage on Second Stage and will be considering appropriate amendments on Committee Stage. As the Minister of State knows, on a number of occasions, I have raised the issue of the lengthy delay in getting this legislation brought forward with him and the Minister for Finance. It was back in September 2011 when the Government first announced the establishment of a strategic investment fund so this Bill is very much overdue but I welcome its publication and the fact that we are finally getting to discuss it. The NTMA has undergone a remarkable process of development since its original establishment in 1990 when Albert Reynolds followed through on a budget commitment to establish, under statute, an independent office for the management of the national debt. The impetus for its establishment was the fact that debt management had become an increasingly complex and sophisticated activity, requiring flexible management structures and suitably qualified personnel to exploit fully the potential for savings. Albert Reynolds also pointed out that with the growth of the financial services sector in Dublin, the Department of Finance had been losing staff that were qualified and experienced in the financial area and it had not been possible to recruit suitable staff from elsewhere. The then main Opposition spokesperson on finance, who I believe was a certain Deputy Noonan, said that the action by the Minister in setting up the NTMA was a fire brigade action arising from the fact that he could neither maintain in nor recruit to the Civil Service persons with the desirable level of expertise to manage the national debt. That was 1990 though and since then, the NTMA has developed from a single function agency managing the national debt to a manager of a complex portfolio of public assets and liabilities. This Bill looks to rationalise and simplify the governance structures at the NTMA to enable a more integrated approach to the performance of its functions which have expanded significantly over the past 24 years. The agency will be reconstructed as a body with a chairperson and other members who will have overarching responsibility for the agency's existing debt management and State Claims Agency functions, its function in respect of infrastructure projects currently carried out by the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, and the ISIF and NewERA. There will be no change in the relationship to NAMA. Under this legislation, the NPRF will become the ISIF and in that regard, it will have a statutory mandate to make commercial investments domestically that sustain jobs and growth. We very much welcome this. It also has a role in the NewERA project and will be known as such in this regard and may also bring forward suggestions for investment in particular sectors of the economy. The Bill also establishes a legal costs unit within the State Claims Agency function to deal with third-party costs arising from certain tribunals of inquiry. Three years ago, we suggested leveraging private pensions and the NPRF as a means of supporting infrastructure investment. I know other Opposition groups have made similar proposals. The Government is now belatedly coming round to this idea. However, given its failure to deliver on existing promises, there must be considerable doubt over whether forthcoming announcements will actually produce the tangible benefit they have the potential to deliver. When the Government announced in September 2011 that it would establish a strategic investment fund, we understood that the legislation would be brought forward quickly, which simply has not happened. While the merit of maximising non-Exchequer capital investment is universally recognised, the Government's plans lack ambition and are likely to be of limited impact as currently devised. In our pre-budget submissions in recent years, we have proposed a mandatory total investment of 1% per annum for the next three years from private pension funds and a matching investment by the NPRF from its discretionary portfolio. This gives a potential €4.2 billion for investment on a commercial basis in infrastructure opportunities, would be separate from the public capital programme and could complement the investments that will flow from the ISIF. The size of the fund could be further enhanced by making investment in it available to regular savers in a manner similar to the national solidarity bond as well as additional market funding where available. Earlier this year, following a successful bond sale in which the NTMA raised funds under 3%, we called for consideration to be given for action by the NTMA to significantly reduce the current interest burden of the national debt. Currently, for example, the average interest rate on our national debt is 4%. This is made up of both market and official funding under the EU-IMF programme. We pointed out that there are two options that the NTMA could consider. First, there is the option of an open market buy-back of some of the more expensive debt funded from either the cash reserve we currently hold or by issuing new debt at the current lower rates. Second, while the interest rate on our EFSF-EFSM funding was reduced and the term extended we are continuing to pay 4.1% on our loans from the IMF. Refinancing these loans at even 1% lower than the current rate would save us €225 million on an annual basis. We need to secure the agreement of the European Commission and the ECB for this to happen. Given the European authorities have stated that they wish to enhance the sustainability of the Irish economic recovery, agreeing to allow us pay off our more expensive loans would be a practical demonstration of this commitment and we call on the Government to pursue that option. It is essential that the Minister for Finance works with the NTMA to bring this about. We also believe that savings that are achieved should be deployed to support investment in infrastructure and job creation. The importance of the Government and the NTMA maximising savings is also underlined by comments of former Taoiseach and Minister for Finance, John Bruton, who has spoken of the possibility of another ten years of budget adjustment. He cited the EU fiscal compact treaty, which commits us to reducing the debt-GDP ratio from 120% to 60% and highlighted the fact that the Department of Finance's figures showed that budget surpluses will have to be run to get the debt down. The Minister might indicate his assessment of Mr. Bruton's contribution to this debate. The NTMA in its May investor presentation is forecasting that the budget will be in balance by 2018. That is the year revenue and spending will finally meet, yet, if Mr Bruton is to be believed, there will be another six years of consolidation after that. We need to know the Department's assessment of his contribution. Clearly we have to maximise growth over the next decade and with that in mind, it is vital that in making investments the focus must be on boosting Irish business and jobs rather than just generating profits for asset management companies in the private sector. We heard earlier this year of a fund to make €6.8 billion of commercial investments to boost Irish business and that 13 investments have been made by the entities into which the NPRF has put hundreds of millions of euro as part of its drive to stimulate the economy. The NPRF made cornerstone investments totalling €375 million in three entities with which it has partnered, respectively, and the funds have different objectives, with one focused on healthy businesses seeking to grow, another focused on underperforming businesses and a third on originating and acquiring loans to larger SMEs. The theory is that these funds will benefit the SME sector but sometimes it seems the fund manager will see the real benefit. The State has a proud record of making investments which serve otherwise unmet economic and social need over a prolonged period. Companies such as the ESB, Coillte, Bord na Móna and Aer Lingus were pioneers in their time meeting critical needs in the country and at the same time providing employment and a significant return to the State by way dividends over the years. The aim for the ISIF should be similarly ambitious in terms of the needs of the 21st century. The ICT sector is one that offers particular opportunities for both an investment return and also significant employment benefit. There is a huge need for capital investment in the economy. The investment component of GDP is the one that fell most dramatically by up to 60%. The private sector has not as yet, nor is likely to, be able to restore levels of investment to pre-recession levels. There is, therefore, an obvious need for the State to step in. The much vaunted 1,000 jobs a week growth in employment is beginning to tail off, according to the recent CSO figures; it is now not much more than 1,000 jobs a quarter. Every job that is gained is to be welcomed. The Minister may regret stalling on bringing forward this measure, as it is not likely to result in a practical benefit for more than 12 months, other than the raft of announcements similar to that which we had in the run-up the recent local and European elections. Everyone agrees that the original intent with respect to the NPRF was a good idea - setting aside 1% of GNP annually to provide for public sector pensions from 2025. In the run-up to the last budget, we warned that the Government was ignoring major long-term issues such as future pension provision. While the Bill is welcome as an economic stimulus measure, a comprehensive plan is still needed to ensure the huge and growing future pension liability is met. The performance of the ISIF should be benchmarked against similar investment funds on an annual basis in order that we can make an assessment of how it is progressing. The legislation establishes a legal costs unit within the State Claims Agency to deal with third party costs arising from certain tribunals of inquiry. In its role as the State Claims Agency, the NTMA also manages personal injury, property damage and clinical negligence claims brought against certain State authorities, including Ministers and health enterprises. It also has a risk management role, advising and assisting State authorities in minimising their claim exposures. Total legal costs for the agency increased by €3.6 million between 2012 and 2013. It had legal costs totalling in excess of €39 million in 2012 and almost €43 million in 2013. Those figures are inclusive of €21.9 million in fees to solicitors in 2012 to defend claims managed by the agency, which increased to €24.3 million last year. Public liability cases currently take an average of three years to complete, an increase from 2.4 years since 2011, while employer liability cases take 3.7 years, down from 4.1 years in 2011. Third party property damage cases take 350 days, up from 335 days in 2011, while clinical claims take an average of four years, up from 2.9 years. Clearly, the lengthy time period which it takes to deal with claims is contributing to the high legal costs that are being incurred. While the Bill has no impact on NAMA, it is worth noting its annual report published this week. When we voted to set the agency up five years ago, there was enormous scepticism about its operation, yet it is clear now that it will fulfil its mission, hopefully ahead of target. The agency expressed increasing confidence that it will complete its work earlier than 2020, as originally envisaged. Subject to the outcome of portfolio and asset sales currently under way, it aims to have as much as half of its senior debt repaid by the end of the current year, two years ahead of schedule. As the chairman of the agency pointed out, this is an important achievement for taxpayers. NAMA paid €31.8 billion for the loans it acquired and €30.2 billion of this comprised senior bonds guaranteed by the State, which is a contingent liability on taxpayers. When the agency was set up, many expressed outright disbelief that it would succeed and claimed it could cost the State additional billions of euro but it is likely it will not cost the taxpayer additional money and may well generate a surplus over its lifetime. It must be acknowledged that when the agency purchased the loans from the banks, significant losses crystallised on their balance sheets and this gap was plugged by the vast recapitalisation of the banks by the State at the time. NAMA looks set to at least break even in the context of its own liabilities and that has to be welcomed. When the late Brian Lenihan passed away, the Minister for Finance generously acknowledged that his predecessor had done the heavy lifting on the public finances and the establishment of NAMA and its success to date will be a positive legacy of the former Minister, notwithstanding the issues the agency needs to address in the context of, for example, improving the transparency in the way in which it operates. Along with others, I have raised many issues of concern regarding the agency's operations and will continue to do so but, overall, it is critically important for the State that the agency does well in its financial performance. I refer to the Government's recently announced construction stimulus plan. It seemed to be little more than an election stunt.In any case it contained neither measurable jobs targets nor any real measures to tackle the housing shortage. When one strips back the spin and takes a second look at the 75 actions in this document, it is plain that there are no details on how the shortage of new housing units will be addressed, there is no new investment in social housing and no apprenticeship scheme to help construction workers to qualify for new jobs in the future. Indeed, the document bore an uncanny resemblance to the lofty promises in the NewERA document of some years ago, which pledged to provide 100,000 new jobs. Three years later we are struggling to see any evidence that these jobs have been realised. Just as the job promises in the NewERA document evaporated in a matter of weeks, it is legitimate to fear that the 60,000 jobs promised in this document will suffer the same fate. The plan promises investment of €50 million in social housing nationally, but Dublin City Council has been forced to halve its investment in social housing, reducing it by €40 million this year, due to budget cuts imposed by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan. If the social housing spend is down by €40 million in Dublin city alone, the new investment of €50 million in this document goes nowhere near what local authorities have already been forced to cut from their social housing budgets. We support this Bill. We believe in intervention by the State where there is an investment vacuum. However, we must be both ambitious and careful in how we act. That is a balance which is often difficult to achieve. I reiterate my concerns about pension funding into the future. Allied to this are projections for a massive jump in the number of Irish people over the age of 85 years and all that entails for care budgets. While this Bill is welcome as an economic stimulus measure, we still require a comprehensive plan to ensure that the huge and growing future pension liability is met. My final point relates to the directed portfolio within the NPRF, which includes our shareholdings in Bank of Ireland and AIB. Will the Minister address that point further in his reply to the debate? Is it still the intention of the NPRF to sell those shareholdings to the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, as part of any retroactive recapitalisation deal concerning the Irish banks? It is important that the Government clarify the role it sees itself playing for State companies generally in the future. Currently, it appears to view the commercial semi-state companies as a cash cow to plug the gap in the State's finances, not as a long-term asset to be protected and nurtured.

Ar dtús báire, ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an reachtaíocht seo. Mar atá ráite ag an Teachta McGrath, tá seo fógartha le blianta fada agus níl a fhios agam cé mhéid uair atá sé ardaithe agam leis an Taoiseach, an Tánaiste agus leis an Aire Airgeadais, ná cé mhéid uair a d'fhiafraigh mé cén fáth an raibh moill á chur ar an reachtaíocht seo. Bhí dhá phíosa reachtaíochta faoi leith fógartha ag tús na bliana, ach nuair a fheicim an reachtaíocht seo, tuigim go bhfuiltear curtha le chéile anseo, ach ní fheicim réasún ar bith cén fáth go raibh moill de thrí bliana curtha ar an reachtaíocht seo a thugann deis dúinn infheistíocht chuí a dhéanamh san eacnamaíocht. Seo infheistíocht atá á chuartú ag go leor den phobal agus ag gnólachtaí agus tá daoine ag scairteadh mar gheallair. Ar an drochuair, idir an trí bliana sin tá go leor daoine a d'fhág an tír seo mar nach raibh na deiseanna ann dóibh agus mar nach raibh an infheistíocht déanta agus mar go raibh an eacnamaíocht chomh lag sin nach raibh poist ar fáil. Ar an drochuair, b'fhéidir go bhfuil siad ag éisteacht leis an díospóireacht seo in áiteanna mar Cheanada, na Stáit Aontaithe nó An Astráil. I am glad we are finally discussing this Bill today. It must be the most announced legislation this Government has introduced, but we can finally get down to the detail and cut through the spin now that the legislation has been published. The creation of a strategic investment fund was first announced in September 2011. It was re-announced a number of times, and again in June 2013. Now, in May 2014, more than three years after the Government came to power, it reaches us for the start of the legislative process. On the second announcement I said it was long overdue; now it is just very late. Billions have been squandered from the National Pensions Reserve Fund on zombie banks in the intervening period. This is not just a political point but a real criticism. Three years have passed without any of the type of State investment that is required in the appropriate measure. At a time of emigration and high unemployment the State needed to step in and invest, but the Government sat on its hands and allowed the economy to shrink, our young to leave and our public services to deteriorate. We must compare how swiftly the Government was prepared to legislate to cut civil servants’ pay and remove the protection of the family home with how long this legislation has been in preparation. That is the story of where this Government’s priorities lie. Investment is an afterthought, something to consider three years later. My party has always argued for, and shown how, investment in a stimulus package, coupled with a fairer way of adjusting the budget, could put us on the road to recovery and help us to reduce the deficit as required. I therefore welcome this conversion to the principle at least, although the detail shows how the conservative hand means in practice that this new vehicle will be severely limited in how it can kick-start our economy. Stimulus has always been part of the solution and I am glad the Government is coming around to that Sinn Féin position. It must be a well-directed and effective stimulus, but I fear that is where this Bill is not as good as it should be. We will seek to amend the Bill on Committee Stage to improve it and to make is as useful as it must be if the full benefits of stimulus are to be realised. While this Bill marks a positive step towards sensible economic planning, it still bears the hallmarks of a conservative and austerity-addicted mentality in many ways. It also bears the fingerprints of the troika squeezing out the potential for a positive State-led economic initiative. I doubt it met much resistance from this Government. Sinn Féin has shown how we would leverage the available NPRF to make a real impact in the economy. We would have had it up and running by now, investing on the necessary scale. This Bill is frustrating for those of us who wish to see a real stimulus package put in place. The concept of a strict adherence to the need for a commercial return is one with which we are uncomfortable. It is a measure of how much we remain under the thumb of EU law that the act of investing in our economy has become such a tortuous exercise. In fact, the rules are so fixated on proving a commercial return that the potential for real and immediate impact is blunted. Where is the guarantee of actual benefits to the real economy if each project must be vetted through committees and must find a commercial partner in times of economic hardship? Sinn Féin has put forward proposals that would produce an economic return on investment, but these rules appear to be crippling the possibilities. Simply put, building hospitals, schools and other infrastructure sometimes goes beyond a commercial return. The fund’s limits to economic activity and employment would appear to rule out social or environmental investments which in time would undoubtedly benefit the country. How is this fund going to help ease the crisis in social housing, for example? The Bill lacks a vision. It is not an ideal vehicle for the type of stimulus Sinn Féin has envisaged and championed. The opportunity for a State–led strategic wave of investment is severely limited by the use of committees through which each project must be filtered. The strict requirement for a private partner, possibly up to the point of being a 50:50 partner, will reduce the effectiveness of any investment from the State’s point of view and, as we have seen previously, will benefit the companies rather than the State or society or those in need of work. Last week, the Government announced it was establishing a strategic banking corporation - that is, a company. Those words are carefully chosen. It is a strategic banking corporation, not a bank. In a reply to me last night, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, admitted that the strategic banking corporation would not have a banking licence.A bank without a banking licence is not a bank. As such, when will the programme for Government commitment to establish a strategic investment bank be met? One cannot simply set up a company and include the word "bank" in its name and call it a bank. A bank has a banking licence. That is the rule and as basic as it gets. This vehicle will not have a banking licence. Last week's plan amounted to a German bank paying into a fund from which money will be given to the banks in the hope that they will lend to the real economy. However, there is no safeguard to prevent the banks simply soaking up this money as they have been doing or to prevent it being drawn down. I have noted already the complex and perhaps too rigid tests that must be passed before any investment can be made in the real economy. There is, however, a part of the Bill which allows the Minister for Finance to write a blank cheque. Section 42 permits the Minister to use the National Pensions Reserve Fund to bail out banks once again. If one wants to invest in the real economy, in broadband, housing, water or in the infrastructure our communities are crying out for, one must go through all of the rigorous tests and have a private investor in place. One must pass all the different committees and undergo the various scrutiny processes and there must be a return. However, if the banks come knocking on the Minister's door and, after consulting with the Central Bank, he or she deems the billions that have been raised by the Irish people should be squandered into this bank, he or she can direct the fund manager to do that. Section 42 is an appalling section and requires greater scrutiny and a proper explanation from the Minister as to what the Government is doing here. I note that when one looks at the accountability of the chief executive officer, one sees that he or she is required to come before the Oireachtas committee and answer questions on any issues members raise. However, he or she is not allowed to make any comment on any policy or order from the Government or the Minister. If the Minister had to turn around and say "Listen folks, AIB or Bank of Ireland is in trouble and we need €4 billion of the €6 billion you were planning to invest in the real economy for the bank", the CEO cannot comment but must oblige the Minister's order. Sinn Féin is opposed to putting NewERA on a statutory footing. We are opposed to what NewERA stands for. It is a vehicle for the privatisation of profitable State assets, including Bord Gáis, the ESB and Coillte. Putting NewERA on the footing proposed in the Bill is further proof that the troika mindset is still very much being in place in Government Buildings, Fine Gael and the Labour Party. While we will deal in greater detail with many sections on Committee Stage, I wish to comment on the part of the Bill dealing with the State Claims Agency and the centralisation of claims made against the State. Claims have been made in the past and claims will emerge in future. They may result from institutional abuse, as happened in the case of the Magdalen laundries, or from tribunals of inquiry as we saw with the Moriarty and Mahon tribunals. Some of the costs associated with those tribunals have not yet been dealt with as court challenges continue in relation to the level of costs awarded. It is a matter to which I will return on foot of information I have received recently on the Moriarty tribunal in particular. An early section of the Bill provides that any order under the legislation must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and there are then 21 days in which an order may be quashed by a vote in the House. The section in the Bill dealing with the State Claims Agency allows the Minister for Finance, following consultation with the Taoiseach and Attorney General, to direct - not order - the State Claims Agency to cease paying claims in any directed area. That is a matter of concern given our past. For example, it emerged in October last year that €635,912 had accumulated in third-party costs for the Fine Gael Party in relation to the Moriarty tribunal. In the first quarter of this year, nearly €110,000 was paid for legal costs for the Haughey family. I raise this issue because the Bill provides the Minister of the day with the discretion to direct the State Claims Agency, with which direction it must comply, to cease paying any type of claim. If the agency was to handle a tribunal in future, the Minister could direct it to stop paying any new claim. That is deeply concerning given the involvement of the political parties, particularly Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, in benefitting from these costs in the past. One would not want a situation in which, if Fianna Fáil were, God forbid, in government again, it could say that payments should stop. The matter would not come to the floor of the House. We must examine this. It should be an order at the very least, not a direction, as that would mean it would be voted on in the House. I have outlined the many concerns Sinn Féin has identified with this Bill. We recognise that it has the potential to act as an important element in an economic recovery. While it differs greatly from the stimulus vehicle we would have designed, it must be progressed. Enough time has been wasted by the Government. Let us get on with stimulus. The Bill at least marks a starting point in theory. The danger is that it will not amount to anything more. It may end up being a vehicle through which no lending occurs due to its strict nature. We will deal with this on Committee Stage but I want to see where the Government is looking at this. Will targets be set? We have had targets that were placed on AIB and Bank of Ireland in respect of lending into the real economy but those targets no longer exist. The banks did not meet them. It does not seem that even targets have been envisaged by the Government in terms of the investment of more than €6 billion, which will be at the disposal of the new agency, to help to kick-start the economy.

Mar adúirt an Teachta, táimid go léir ag fanacht lenár gcroí inár mbéil le fada le rud éigin a chloisteáil maidir leis an infheistíocht seo. The impending arrival of the Bill has been announced by Ministers with such regularity over the last three years that we had all been expecting big things on this side of the House. Our disappointment when faced with the legislation before us can, therefore, readily be imagined. The economy is entering the second half of a lost decade. As he tried to explain the crushing defeat of the Labour Party in the local and European elections, Deputy Pat Rabbitte stated two days ago in the Chamber that the State was in the middle of the worst economic crisis since the Famine. One would imagine that the worst economic crisis since the Famine would necessitate the largest and most robust response by the Government to deal with it. We have 400,000 men and women languishing on the live register while 90,000 families are on the housing waiting list. Close to half a million of our people have been forced to emigrate since the start of the crisis. These issues alone should have motivated the Cabinet to respond proportionately.What we are getting is a lukewarm response. Three years of the Government's term have passed and hardly 22 months are left. By acting so late in the economic cycle, the Government has deepened the trough and lengthened the duration of the recession. During the elections we listened to it promise a stimulus and during the fiscal treaty campaign the lampposts were festooned with promises of jobs. Throughout Europe we heard that a new approach would be taken and that we would see a stimulus. Sinn Féin has urged the Government at every point to tailor the response to match the size of the economic problem. We hassled and harried it to act with speed, but it has not happened, which is shocking. We did so for good economic reasons, including because investment in critical infrastructure increases productivity and investment opportunities. Targeted investment would have increased efficiency and created a competitive advantage. It would have made it easier for local businesses to survive the crash and thrive and made the country far more attractive to foreign direct investment. Centrally, it would have reduced significantly the level of unemployment in the State. It would have delivered a social dividend to the hundreds of thousands of families sinking into poverty. That this has not happened, three years into the Government's term, is a damning indictment. That we have had an insipid and inflexible response and investment mechanism is an opportunity lost for the people.  In response to the strategic investment fund Social Justice Ireland has expressed its regret that the Government did not take a broader perspective to assist investment in public services to facilitate socio-economic benefits that would far outweigh their cost over their lifetime. By deciding to limit the purpose of the fund to commercial investment, the Government is, in effect, excluding investment that would be of significant and immediate benefit to the people. We understand the vast majority of the fund’s investments are to be long-term, with the minority to be used to encourage employment creation. From the outset, the Government has hamstrung the ability of this €6.8 billion investment fund to provide the stimulus necessary to cause a significant number of people to go back to work in the short to medium term. The CSO publication, Quarterly National Household Survey, communicated an extremely worrying picture showing that sentiment among businesses was not very strong. Jobs growth is grinding to a halt and we saw a meagre increase in the past quarter - 1,700 jobs in total. This shows that expectation and confidence are flat-lining. That the Government has not understood the reason behind it is shocking. It is seeking to rifle the pockets of families throughout the country through water charges. The retail industry is a good weather vane for expectations in the economy and in the past quarter the industry lost 5,600 jobs. Representative groups of SMEs have made negative comments on the Government's plans, stating they are frustrated with the Government. The Small Firms Association warned that €500 million was a tiny fraction of the current €27 billion business banking market. ISME expressed concern that the bailed out banks would revert to form and divert loans to safer, larger businesses. Chambers Ireland has expressed a worry that the timescale is vague and disappointing. Real and ambitious stimuli are desperately needed and we have the Government tinkering around the edges. It has previous for such tinkering when real change is needed. We now have an ecosystem for funding small businesses that is going nowhere. Micro-finance, loan funds, the credit guarantee scheme and the seed capital scheme are not meeting the objectives set. They are not having the effect that we desire on the real economy. That the Government has used these measures to tinker around the edges rather than going to the centre of the problem - a banking industry unwilling to function in the real economy - is an example of the mistakes it has made, yet this investment fund is a similar measure. While the Government has announced it is intent on setting up a State bank, no one in his or her right mind has confidence that it will deliver it, especially as it has changed into being a lame duck Government in recent days. Even if it gets its act together, the bank will be underfunded and lending will still be in the gift of banks that are desperately trying to deleverage. Currently, Irish businesses are being hammered by a number of cost disadvantages, one of which is the cost of credit. Under the Government's proposals, there appears to be no guarantee that the lower cost of funding or sourcing funds will be passed on to SMEs. As the Minister noted, a fraction of the strategic investment fund is to be directed towards SMEs, with just €375 million to be allocated to three new long-term funds providing equity, credit and restructuring investment for Irish small and medium-sized businesses. Successive budget cuts to capital expenditure have put tens of thousands of people on social welfare payments and have stalled investment, making the capital supply in the country desperately in need of new investment. To date, the Government’s policy has been anti-stimulus. The economist Mr. Paul Krugman recently described fiscal austerity as "a negative stimulus". He correctly observed that if European leaders, including the Government, had been right about the way the world worked, the austerity agenda imposed would not have had such a devastating effect. In my three years as a Deputy I have learned that change is creepingly slow, but it does come. Sinn Féin has pushed the Government in small steps. It is welcome that it no longer sets its face against the concept of a State-supported stimulus. Despite accepting the need for a State-sponsored stimulus, it has turned its attention away from labour intensive and regionally spread projects and those that would increase Ireland’s competitiveness in the longer term. We need an ambitious social housing programme. Increasing the social housing stock in Dublin is important to cool down the market, improve competitiveness and reduce rents. We need to increase the level of employment and increase tax revenue. If the grand plan had come to fruition, cuts to Government expenditure and the refusal to invest in a stimulus package would have been offset by rising private spending, but the opposite has happened. Austerity has delivered stagnant employment figures, in real terms, and a fall in investment by the private sector. The banks are still in difficulty, a fact borne out by the provision in the legislation to allow the fund to invest in banks should they need to be propped up again. Not only has the Government failed to secure a deal in Europe on Ireland’s legacy banking debt, it is also preparing to pump public moneys into bad banks. Ireland is a small open economy and it appears the Government is looking to emulate the United States. While the US Administration embarked on a state-sponsored stimulus programme, it was not enough. In the short term an ambitious stimulus programme acts as a defibrillator for a stalled economy, while in the medium term it improves competitiveness and creates an environment in which recovery can be maximised. What we have is a half-hearted, half-baked Government stimulus that is limited to a purely commercial programme. It will not create jobs within the necessary timescale and not get the economy out of the doldrums.

The Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality, Mr. Brian Purcell, appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality yesterday. Unfortunately, he would not and did not answer any questions surrounding the events of the departure of the former Garda Commissioner, Mr. Martin Callinan. In effect, both Mr. Purcell and the Taoiseach are now hiding behind the Fennelly commission. This is treating the Oireachtas and the public with disdain. There is no legal obstacle as to why Mr. Purcell could not have come before the committee yesterday and answered questions about Mr. Martin Callinan's departure. Similarly, there is no legal obstacle as to why the Taoiseach could not answer questions here yesterday on his role in that departure. Following the resignation of the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, we heard much about a cultural sea change we would see in the area of justice and about new openness and transparency. It appears that all of that now amounts to little more than a hill of beans. We are not seeing any evidence of that type of change whatsoever. We have a farcical situation where the new Minister for Justice and Equality is not in a position to express confidence in her Secretary General. In what company would it be acceptable for a CEO to say she could not say whether she had confidence in the head of operations? This is not a tenable situation and it must be addressed. We still have no answer to the fundamental question as to why the Taoiseach dispatched Mr. Brian Purcell to the house of Mr. Martin Callinan to do his dirty work for him and, effectively, deliver a P45. Why did that happen? We still have no answer to that question. We read in today's Irish Independent that Sergeant Maurice McCabe has been forced out of work on sick leave and has lodged 13 separate complaints pertaining to bullying and harassment. If that is true, it does not represent much of a seachange or cultural shift. Following everything that has happened, if it is true that this is how he is being treated, is it not a damning indictment of the State at this time? Why is it the Acting Commissioner, Ms Noirín O'Sullivan, said yesterday at the committee that senior managers were in contact on a daily basis with Sergeant Maurice McCabe, but we hear the complete opposite from sources very close to him? We need answers to that question. Does the Tánaiste accept there are no legal obstacles preventing the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality, Mr. Brian Purcell, or the Taoiseach from giving this House or a parliamentary committee a full explanation of the circumstances that led to the forced resignation of the former Garda Commissioner, Mr. Martin Callinan?

I confirm I am not retiring from politics and plan on being around for a while. We all know that the issues in regard to An Garda Síochána have required to be addressed for a long time, long before the current Government came into office. In the course of a relatively short period of time this year, we have put in place a number of decisions which will radically change the way in which An Garda Síochána is managed and how it reports to the public. The critical pillar in this is the establishment of an independent Garda authority. This is something the Labour Party has been seeking for a long time and I am glad the Government has now made the decision to proceed with it. The issue of how to deal with whistleblowing is another issue. We have had significant discussion here and in public on how to deal with whistleblowing and whistleblowers. The Government is introducing legislation that will provide protection for people who draw attention to wrong-doing and this legislation will apply to An Garda Síochána. I believe that any member of the Garda who wants to report wrong-doing should be able to do that without fear of any kind of recrimination.  We have also established a number of means by which issues that remain can be worked through, such as the Fennelly commission which will address the issue of the resignation of the former Garda Commissioner and issues surrounding that. The Deputy's question is essentially a legal one. I am not a lawyer so I cannot give him a legal answer. It is important that all of the issues which are being addressed by the Fennelly commission are fully aired and that everybody who has information to give to that commission should do so. This obviously includes the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	82	The truth is the truth, whether it is told to the Fennelly commission, the Oireachtas committee or the Members of this House and the people. The truth does not change. There is no impediment, legal or otherwise, preventing Mr. Purcell or the Taoiseach from coming before the parliamentary committee or this House and providing answers as to what exactly happened and what led to the forced departure of the former Garda Commissioner, Mr. Martin Callinan. That fact has not changed and we still do not have an answer to that question. That answer must be forthcoming. The Tánaiste outlined the policy response and I agree there has been positive movement in a number of respects. However, a number of disturbing features have emerged in recent days. First is the fact that Sergeant Maurice McCabe clearly feels he is not being properly treated within An Garda Síochána. If media reports are to be believed, he has lodged 13 separate complaints. Why is that happening? Why is it the Acting Commissioner was under the impression that Garda management was in daily contact with Sergeant McCabe when the evidence points in the other direction? The Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, needs to contact the Acting Commissioner to get to the bottom of that matter immediately. Why are Mr. Purcell and the Taoiseach not willing to provide a free and open account of the events that led to the resignation of Mr. Martin Callinan? That is not an issue that can just be buried in the Fennelly commission. It is an issue of fundamental public importance. If we are to restore confidence in the justice system, there is an imperative that these answers are forthcoming now. There is no reason we must wait for the Fennelly commission to conclude its work.

Deputy McGrath's party, Fianna Fáil, was in power at the time and it took it two years to respond to those issues and to establish the Morris tribunal, which met over a long period of time. When that tribunal reported, Fianna Fáil effectively did nothing about the report. Problems in An Garda Síochána did not start when this Government came into office. Problems in the Garda did not start six months ago. The difference now is that the Government has acted in order to address the issues. Within the space of a number of months, we have made changes to the management, the structures around the Garda, to the way in which it reports and to the establishment of means of getting to the bottom of issues that require to be fully investigated. We have done this in a space of time that Fianna Fáil did not do when in government. If we set up a commission and ask it to do a job, it should be allowed to do its work. I do not have any doubt but that the Fennelly commission will do its job and that anybody who has information to give to that commission will give the full information and there will be no question in regard to information or the truth being made fully available. It goes beyond the question of information and what is being told to a commission.It is also about what we do about it. We have had repeated investigations of one kind or another. Tribunals have been set up here and tribunals have been set up there. They go on for years and by the time they are finished nobody can remember why they were set up in the first place.

#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	90	On my behalf and that of my party, we wish the Tánaiste and his family well in the future. Last week, the Government launched a plan whose aim was to end homelessness by 2016. It is a very laudable plan that every Member of this House wants to see succeed. We will work with the Government in trying to achieve that goal. In recent months many councils in the State have faced an increase in the number of people presenting as homeless. Part of the reason for this is down to Government policy on rent supplement. As rents increase, particularly in urban areas, the cap on rent allowance means that many families can no longer afford the home they are renting privately. Therefore, they are being forced out on to the streets and presenting to local authorities as homeless. The capital funding being provided to local authorities over the past three years has decreased under the stewardship of the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan. There was a 23% decrease in 2012, a similar decrease in funding for capital projects in 2013 and a 5% decrease in funding this year. These are all contributing to the problem of many people now facing homelessness. Under this Government, the Minister, Deputy Burton, and the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, the housing crisis has got worse. One of the solutions to that is for the Minister, Deputy Burton, to instruct local community welfare officers that a family at risk of being made homeless should be given permission to breach the rent supplement caps. I ask the Tánaiste, as leader of the Labour Party and as a member of the Government, to ensure that directive is given to local community welfare officers. Where a family in danger of being put on the streets because they can no longer afford their private rented accommodation, welfare officers should be allowed to breach the rent supplement caps.

I agree we have a serious housing problem that has to be addressed. I acknowledge Sinn Féin's support for the strategy that the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, announced to end homelessness by 2016. That is an objective that should be pursued by Government, by agencies working with homeless people and by local authorities. It is clear, particularly following last Friday's elections, that this responsibility is now shared more widely politically, particularly regarding the governance of various local authorities. I hope that over the coming weeks political parties, which have been successful and in many cases have become the largest party in local authorities and will be part of governing arrangements in local authorities, will ensure that the agreements they make with other parties for the running of local authorities for the next five years will commit to ensuring that sites are made available and plans are drawn up for the provision of social housing to ensure that people's housing needs are met.

I can go through the detail of that if the Deputy wishes. The Deputy specifically raised an issue with the rent supplement. As he knows, rents are increasing, partly owing to the supply situation. The answer to that is not simply to raise the rent supplement every time there is an adjustment in rent because doing that leads to a never-ending problem with rents continuing to increase. We know from previous experience that as the rent supplement increases the rents increase to meet it. The Minister for Social Protection has already provided arrangements for flexibility in the application of rent supplement, particularly where people are at risk of losing their home. It is my understanding that arrangements are already being put in place to allow for flexibility to be exercised by community welfare officers in the application of rent supplement.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	94	That arrangement is not trickling down to local community welfare officers, as I am sure any Member of the House can confirm to the Tánaiste. Unfortunately, increasing numbers of people in the depths of despair are presenting to my constituency office because they are being forced out of their private rented accommodation. I agree that raising rent supplement caps does not represent a long-term solution. The long-term solution is for the State to provide local authority housing to those who are unable to purchase their own homes. That cannot be done if the Government continues to cut capital budgets to local authorities. It cannot be done if the Government refuses to give local authorities the necessary funding to refurbish the thousands of homes that lie idle and which should generate income for local authorities.

Raising the rent supplement limits is a temporary solution, but it is crucial for the type of people who present at my constituency office and have a demand from a landlord to vacate a property because he is increasing the rent which he knows he could get from another tenant. The reality is that we have a housing crisis and €100 million or €50 million from the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan will not solve it. It will be solved by proper funding to local authorities to provide the necessary accommodation for people who need it.

We need to address the problem of people at risk of losing their home because of increased rents that the rent supplement will not meet. I know that the Minister for Social Protection is addressing that and I will ask her to ensure that the information trickles down. On the capital provision, the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, has already announced additional money to ensure that approximately 1,700 boarded-up houses that could be renewed are refurbished and put back into use as quickly as possible. Additional money has been provided for the resumption of a social housing construction programme.

Part of its significance was due to the reaction of the ladies from the Magdalen laundries, who were present in the Gallery that day, to the apologies offered by the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and others. During his apology, the Taoiseach stated: "I, as Taoiseach, on behalf of the State, the Government and our citizens, deeply regret and apologise unreservedly to all those women for the hurt that was done to them". He also stated that the women deserved more than a formal apology and that he intended to put in place a process "by which we can determine how best to help and support the women in their remaining years". Those sentiments were echoed by other Members. There was a general feeling on that occasion that a process was going to be put in place and that all of the outstanding issues would be resolved. One would imagine that, one year and three months later, all of this would have been done, particularly for those ladies of very advanced years. It is most unfortunate that the reality is different. I wish to highlight some of that reality and then pose a number of questions. As a result of the fact that inadequate records were kept in some places, an enormous burden of proof has been placed on some of the ladies involved. One would imagine that a much more flexible approach could be adopted at this point and that the ladies to whom I refer could be given the benefit of the doubt. However, the opposite is the case because it has been left to them to prove that they were in the laundries. The effect is that some ladies are being excluded from redress, while others are being offered less than that to which they might be entitled. There are those who feel so defeated by this extra burden they are being obliged to shoulder that it is like being back in the laundries for them. An issue arises in respect of the institution known as An Grianán, which was on the site of a Magdalen laundry at High Park. There is no doubt that the women and girls at An Grianán did the same work as those in the laundry. They were referred to it by the justice system - on remand and on probation - and the health boards for protection. Some of them were as young as 11 years of age. A number of the women to whom I refer are not being compensated. I hate using that word because nobody can compensate them for what they endured.

However, that spent by their counterparts at similar training centres in Summerhill in Wexford and Stanhope Street in Dublin is covered under it. Will the Tánaiste, the new Minister for Justice and Equality and the Government ensure that there will be no additional delays or interruptions in respect of the implementation plan relating to the Magdalen ladies? Will they ensure that payments will be expedited and that the situation in respect of An Grianán will be examined? Will they further ensure that there will be a broader interpretation of Mr. Justice Quirke's recommendation on health care in order that the women, regardless of where they live, will have access to a level of care similar to that available to those with Health Amendment Act, HAA, cards?

If she wishes to provide details of particular cases to me, the Taoiseach or the Minister for Justice and Equality, we would be very happy to follow up on them. One of the issues which arose as a result of this entire episode is the retention of records. The Government agreed that the Minister for Education and Skills would bring forward legislative proposals to allow for the retention of records by the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse and all of the issues relating to the Magdalen laundries, etc. We are concerned about the fact that the destruction of any of those records would represent a significant loss. The Minister for Education and Skills has been working on this matter, which the Cabinet discussed earlier in the week. Legislation is being prepared to ensure that the relevant records will be protected. I completely accept that it would be desirable to ensure that the commitments made in respect of payments and the provision of health care and supports to survivors of Magdalen laundries are followed up on. I acknowledge the Deputy's assertion to the effect that questions have arisen with regard to particular periods and what is and is not contemplated for consideration. We would certainly be happy to investigate any matters in respect of which the Deputy can provide details.

The Irish Human Rights Commission and the UN Committee Against Torture, UNCAT, repeatedly requested a statutory and thorough investigation into what happened in the laundries. Preserving the records will ensure that this can happen at some future date. In recent days UNCAT has indicated that the State should "take additional steps to ensure that victims obtain redress as needed, including in the case of the Magdalene Laundries". I take this opportunity to mention the case of Rita. The latter is not her real name. There is absolutely no doubt about the date on which Rita entered the laundry; neither is there any doubt about the date when she was not there. There is a discrepancy in that there is no official proof of where she was for a very short period but there are people who are prepared to swear affidavits in order to prove that she was exactly where she says she was. Rita approached the Department of Justice and Equality following the Taoiseach's apology in February 2013 and registered with the implementation team at the end of June of that year. This lady is in her 80s and for the past six weeks I have been trying to obtain an answer for her from the Department. I have continually been informed that it is awaiting a directive. This has been going on for far too long. As Rita has informed me, it is not the money but rather the principle of the thing. The Tánaiste is seeking details but the Department of Justice and Equality knows the real identity of the person to whom I refer. I hope her case will be resolved by next week at the very latest.

#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	125	The Betting (Amendment) Bill 2013 passed Second Stage in January but we are still awaiting the commencement of Committee Stage. The Bill is designed to extend betting duty to online transactions, but the delay in enacting it is costing the State millions of euro. When will Committee Stage be taken and when will the Bill be passed? If the Tánaiste does not have an answer in that regard, he can ask the relevant Minister to revert to me on the matter. The Taoiseach indicated that the issue of discretionary medical cards was before the relevant Cabinet sub-committee for consideration and that proposals relating to it would be brought to the full Cabinet. Will the Tánaiste advise when that is expected to happen? Will he also indicate when there is likely to be an indication of any possible change in policy and whether legislation will be required to facilitate such a change?

#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	131	I wish to inquire about two tranches of legislation. The first relates to a Private Members' Bill which is currently on Committee Stage, the Wind Turbine Regulation Bill 2014. On Monday, the report of the independent inspector in respect of the decision by Westmeath County Council to incorporate setback distances for wind turbines into the council draft development plan was launched. Unfortunately, the council supported the contention of the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, that the setback distances were not going to be adhered to. This is of considerable concern to residents throughout the midlands. The Wind Turbine Regulation Bill is currently on Committee Stage. When will it be brought forward by the Minister to be discussed on Committee Stage? What is the position on the Protected Disclosures Bill relating to whistleblowers? Report Stage was due to be taken on 11 June. The list of legislation to be completed by the summer recess was published yesterday by the Whip's office but it is not included on the list. Is it still on course to be completed before the summer recess?

I am struck by the fact that a significant subset of those who are currently homeless in the State are women and children who have fled the family home due to domestic violence. The Government has indicated a commitment to deal with this problem. Given the commitments made in recent times about homelessness, does the Tánaiste envisage that the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government will have to come forward with a Supplementary Estimate some time later this year to address the challenge of homelessness and the associated costs that will, inevitably, be involved? Has the Cabinet considered the Istanbul Convention, an international convention that seeks to combat violence against women? The matter is obviously linked to the homelessness issue in the country. My final question relates to the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. Part 4 contains a provision to disappear 77,000 people off the housing waiting lists. Under the Bill the Government has promised and stated that 77,000 people out of the 90,000 people currently on the waiting list will be considered to have their housing needs met. I am not at all surprised at such a proposal coming from Fine Gael but I am absolutely astonished that it would come from the Labour Party. Can the Tánaiste give us some sort of commitment that there will be a change in that legislation before it emerges on Committee or Report Stage?

Obviously, if Deputy Ó Fearghaíl wishes to propose amendments, that is the place to propose them and they will be addressed at that stage. Deputy Ó Fearghaíl referred to domestic violence. Work is under way to reform and consolidate the Domestic Violence Act 1996. It is planned that the reform of the legislation will include new provisions on emergency barring and safety orders. These reforms are needed to enable Ireland to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence, that is, the Istanbul Convention to which Deputy Ó Fearghaíl referred.

The committee issued a report on the pre-legislative consideration of the Bill on 13 February. The ordering of business for the House is a matter for the Whips. From what I can see, the difficulty of the House in respect of its business has more to do with the failure on the part of Opposition parties and Deputies to use the time available to them to make the arguments and the case in the House and to keep the business going.

#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	149	The Bill gives the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, direct responsibility for what is left of the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF. We expected this to be one of the Government's first actions in getting projects up and running. It is important that what is left of the fund delivers a return, given our pension time bomb. The critical date is 2025, which is one of the reasons the NPRF was set up in the first instance. A substantial amount of the fund, some €20.7 billion, was pumped into the banks. Of that, only €13.3 billion will be retained, signifying a direct loss of approximately €7 billion, poking a sizable hole in the fund. We must keep sight of this fact at all times when considering the fund's function and how to use it properly as an economic stimulus, particularly in terms of job creation. One can have growth, but one can also have job-rich growth. Although I have problems with this legislation, it is important that the money be used wisely. We do not have a good heritage of building institutions. Many of the State's institutions are carry-overs, as it were, from the time before the State's founding. Some of those we have created have not served us well. The greatest example in this regard is the HSE. As such, I have been considering who will control the NTMA. It seems that its CEO will report directly to the Minister. A board of six people, including a chair, will be appointed, but the Minister will make the decisions. It is important that the Oireachtas have meaningful oversight of and input into decisions or, at least, the scrutiny thereof. Another issue relates to the payment of board appointees. It appears to be at the Minister's discretion, but there can be wide variations in the amounts paid to people who sit on boards. For example, board members in the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, are paid twice as much as those who sit on the RTE authority. There must be rationalisation of this situation, as the variations are not explicable. The NPRF was established in 2001 with a view to helping the social and private pension economies from 2025 onwards. Given that it has been decimated, however, it is important that any investment be made in a way that gives a return. The Government has advertised that €6.9 billion is available for investment, but that is not the truth, as €1.2 billion of it has been already committed, including as part of the €250 million that has been "invested" in Irish Water, an amount that has come from many different sources. In reality, there is only an approximate €4.8 billion available, and it would have been more honest to say so. It is positive that this fund can be used to leverage financing from the European Investment Bank, EIB. I have been arguing for a different type of housing programme, one that offers people the opportunity to rent their homes for the duration of their lives instead of relying on a rental sector that is based either on local authorities or private, short-term tenures. A substantial amount of money is available from the EIB, but some of the charities cannot draw it down because they need to provide a certain level of guarantee. Their governance does not allow them to make losses. That said, houses are required and this presents an opportunity to provide a different option, one that is not exclusively for people who are financially dependent. A mixed group would prevent ghettoisation on the basis of poverty. Substantial work could be done in this regard, for example, through co-partner arrangements. A requirement of any potential investment is to attract matching investment from an outside source. Many Deputies have been pointing out that pension funds in Ireland could be more productively used within the State. The Nevin Economic Research Institute, NERI, referred to the "multiplier effect of targeted productive investment" in terms of job creation. An impressive number of people could find work if investment was targeted correctly. This has led to a demand for the fund to be used instead of just being allowed to sit there. In this way, people could be taken off the dole and other social protection payments and start doing something that is of some value to the economy and society. Short, medium and long-term investments are required, including in education and training. One of the so-called bundles involves a partnership with the Department of Education and Skills in the provision of schools. What return would there be from such a public-private partnership, PPP? Some PPPs have been very much to the advantage of those on the private side of the arrangements. We need only consider the shadow tolling of some toll roads. It was almost like a lottery ticket.There was a guaranteed return because the State had to provide sufficient numbers of vehicles, even though that was not a particularly sustainable approach. On the issue of State claims, it is a bit like David and Goliath. I hope there will be a difference in culture because I believe the State takes on issues it should not take on just because it can do so. I recall that under a previous Government, between 2004 and 2007, €20 million - I know that figure is correct because I asked a number of parliamentary questions at the time - was spent fighting parents in the courts who were seeking appropriate education for their children, when that €20 million would have provided a substantial amount of what was required. There should be an examination of the cases the State fights to determine whether they could be done in a different way that would save money, rather than always trooping down to the Four Courts to defend issues when it could make the necessary change. I have mixed feelings about this legislation. We have been waiting a long time for it but I have concerns about the control and targeting of the investment. I have concerns about the private sector doing particularly well out of it at the expense of the State. If that happens, it will be a real problem.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	150	I am glad to speak about this because there is probably no more important a subject we could discuss than strategic investment, which is the key to getting this country out of the economic mess it is in. This Bill is long overdue. The strategic investment bank the Government promised, which I presume is now this strategic investment fund, has taken a long time to come before us for this debate. The lack of a strategic plan for investment lies at the heart of the economic crisis we had, because investment flowed to the wrong places for the wrong reasons, creating a bubble economy and leading to a disastrous crash for which we have paid a terrible price. Getting the question of strategic investment right is critical for the future of our economy, if that future is to be sustainable and if it is to avoid repeats of the sort of disastrous crisis we have just been through. I hope that with all the exciting and interesting issues that often occupy the national media, some of which are important and exciting and others less so, some attention will be paid to this very important discussion, which will set the parameters for the future sustainability of our economy. In establishing a strategic investment fund we are starting with a much-depleted fund because of the decision of the previous Government and this Government to bail out private financial institutions and international gamblers in the financial markets. The obvious point - which has been made many times, but which I do not believe we should be allowed to forget because it will be a feature of what is going on in our economy for years to come - is that this year over €8 billion, which could have been in a strategic investment fund and invested in this country to create jobs, develop infrastructure and ensure a sustainable economic future for this country, is being sucked out of the country. That is a tragedy. The pot we have to engage in strategic investment is massively depleted because we will continue to pump out billions of euro for years to come to pay for the disastrous mistakes that were made in the past. Those mistakes must inform our approach to strategic investment to make sure we do not repeat them. I still believe - although I know I will not get any change from this Government on it - that we should be fighting with Europe to retain some, if not all, of that €9 billion to reinvest in our economy in strategic ways. If this Government or any other Government insists on paying back all that money, which we should not do because I do not believe we are obliged to pay it back, it should demand that it is paid out over a much longer term. It should insist that some of the money we are paying out be retained for strategic investment on the basis that we can show that investment is capable of achieving a return which would allow us pay back the money over a much longer term. I make that general introductory point. I will not dwell on it but I believe it is critical and must not be forgotten. In terms of what this fund can do and where we should be investing strategically to create jobs and develop a sustainable economy, on the face of it, this Bill is saying the right things. We need strategic investment. It is a good approach to streamline the National Treasury Management Agency and move away from investing the national pension fund in international hedge funds that are being invested elsewhere, and to redirect the investment back into our economy, with a particular focus on job creation. All of those measures, on the face of it, are welcome, and some of the sectors of the economy mentioned by the Minister with regard to this fund and that are in the legislation, such as infrastructure, energy, telecommunications, broadband and forestry, are key areas in which we must be thinking about strategic investment, because it can generate employment and real wealth for our economy, which can help us get out of the mess we are in and develop the economy on a sustainable path into the future.  However, what worries me greatly is the repeated emphasis the Minister put in his introduction on co-partnership with private investors, public private partnerships, and allowing for further State investment in private financial institutions - that is, bailing out banks - all of which are worrying. In the case of NewERA, the Minister knows well that we are opposed to the State asset disposal programme because we believe it is the wrong way to go about making the best of our assets and resources that must be retained in public ownership and invested in to develop jobs and economic benefits for the citizens of this country rather than being given away to private interests purely to ensure a profit for those interests and, ultimately, at a loss to our economy and society. Overall, there is a worrying emphasis on what is called commercial return, which, going on past experience, is often about short-term rather than long-term, sustainable investment directed towards the good of our economy and society. It is also important that as well as a commercial return on our investment we get a social return, and that the return is regionally balanced so that the investment is spread throughout the country and among different sectors of the economy rather than concentrated in particular regions such as Dublin. It is important that the focus is on balancing the need for a return with the social need of our citizens and the long-term needs of society as a whole. I am concerned that this is not the direction in which we are going and that the focus is more on short term commercial gain for strategic investment. An issue that has not yet been mentioned but that lies at the heart of the economic crisis we are experiencing and needs to be a priority in terms of strategic investment for all sorts of reasons is that of housing. The manner in which NAMA, which comes under the umbrella of the NTMA, has dealt with and is dealing with this issue indicates that we are moving in the wrong direction. I and others have repeatedly and endlessly pointed out that we are experiencing a disastrous housing crisis, that rents and property prices are going through the roof, that a property bubble is rapidly developing and so on. NAMA, the biggest real estate company in the world, owned by the State and under the umbrella of the NTMA, is unloading vast amounts of property onto the market and into the hands of, to a large extent, private international investors who have no commitment to our society, its needs or our economy. They are investing in Ireland for one reason only, namely, to make money, to profit from a property sector that is beginning to again spiral out of control. A body operating under the aegis of the NTMA is handing this property over lock, stock and barrel to big international investors. The Department of Finance has put in place incentives and tax breaks to encourage these vultures on the international markets to invest in and profit from the housing and property sector while at the same time we are experiencing a massive and spiralling housing crisis, with many of our citizens unable to afford to put a roof over their heads. To me, that does not make sense.  If NAMA's job is to make a short-term gain and put private developers back in business, then that makes some sense. However, if we are thinking strategically about the long-term good of the economy, the maintenance of balance and regulation in the housing sector and, crucially, meeting the social needs of Irish citizens, what is being done makes no sense. It is setting in place the ingredients for the same disastrous mistakes to be made again. What should be done is that this property, in so far as NAMA still has it, should be put back into the hands of local authorities to house people in need and generate a long-term revenue stream for the State. Whether property is taken from NAMA or constructed, the effect would be the same - namely, people would be returned to employment, a revenue stream would be created for the Exchequer and there would be savings to the State in moneys currently paid out in rent allowance, rental accommodation scheme, RAS, arrangements and lease arrangements with the private sector, which, if this is not done, will continue to get this revenue stream at great cost to the State. I do not understand it.  In response to our calls for a housing construction programme or housing purchase acquisition programme for local authorities, the response of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, has been to ask where the money will come from. The money could be taken from the Strategic Investment Fund. I will provide some data showing how this would make sense, not only for the people on the housing list in need of affordable housing but for the economy in terms of the revenue that would be generated. According to the response to a parliamentary question I tabled some months ago, the cost of constructing 10,000 council houses - the cost might be slightly higher now because of the rise in inflation, although it would cost us nothing if property was transferred across from NAMA - is €1 billion. If 10,000 houses were constructed annually, the saving to the Exchequer in rent allowance payments to private landlords would be €66.2 million. Also, additional rental revenue of €50 million would be generated for the State. This means that approximately €100 million per annum would accrue for every 10,000 council houses constructed, purchased or transferred from NAMA. If 50,000 houses were to be constructed, purchased or transferred from NAMA, the saving would be €500 million, or the same amount in additional revenue to the State. In other words, if, via NAMA, construction or acquisition-----

That is what I am basing my calculations on. I would appreciate it if Deputy Lawlor ceased interrupting me. This means that over ten years the scheme would pay for itself. Following that, there would be a revenue stream back to the State - money that would otherwise be going to private investors such as LoanStar and other vulture funds. In the context of the repayment of all debts to private institutions, even they would see that this guaranteed revenue back to the State. Also, the construction of social housing would put many people back to work. That is strategic investment that is sustainable, long-term and beneficial to the economy and society. I do not understand why the Government will not do that and the reason all the emphasis is on partnership with the private sector. We all know what happened to public private partnerships such as the one with Bernard McNamara in O'Devaney Gardens, Dominick Street and so on. They were a disaster. Why would we do that? It is a waste of money. It is money down the drain, it is unreliable, it does not work and it has had disastrous consequences in the past. What I have proposed is the type of scheme in which we need to invest. It would meet real social need, create employment and all that would flow from it and provide guaranteed revenue to the State. Another area that could be examined is that of forestry. Despite the fact that we have the most favourable conditions in Europe for the growth of forests, we have spectacularly failed to meet our afforestation targets. This country was once covered by forests. Forestry is a safe investment. It generates a lot of employment and so on. I do not propose to go through all the data because we have already discussed it during several debates. Forestry provides a guaranteed number of jobs for a set amount of acreage. It is a long-term safe investment. The value of timber globally is increasing. A lot of international funds invest in forestry because it is a safe, good investment. It is also good for the environment.

assets to the private sector rather than on recognising where there could be strategic investment with significant potential to generate revenue and deal precisely with issues such as the pensions reserve fund. We need the reserve fund because it is a safe investment that will actually guarantee the pensions of citizens and deal with the pensions crisis that is looming for the country. What I propose presents a win-win scenario. There would be a benefit in terms of carbon credits and EU money. These are the areas we should be examining. A matter that was recently brought to my attention — I am not an environmental expert by any means — was that of geothermal energy. My point on it may be very obvious to people from rural areas. Everything that grows, including grass and scrub, can be turned into energy. I refer to biomass. While the Government's emphasis has been on building huge industrial wind turbines, attracting all of the associated controversy and major questions, a report issued recently claims that if we were to spend on converting the Moneypoint power plant into a biomass plant one tenth of what the Government is planning to spend on turbines in partnership with big private financial interests, we would meet our targets for carbon dioxide emissions reductions. Should we not be considering this? We could grow the trees and there would be an economic benefit in terms of jobs and the environment. Revenue would be returned to us rather than go to private investors. I do not have time to address all areas of strategic investment. I worry deeply about the emphasis the Government is placing, through this legislation, on the facilitation of profit-making by private investors and interests who will drain away our resources and the revenues that could otherwise be generated to the benefit of citizens and the economy.

Some in the House might presume Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett and I are diametrically opposed politically. I would not dispute that to a certain extent, but I believe his point on the lack of a regional focus in this legislation is correct. There is no such focus. That two people might be diametrically opposed politically does not mean that they cannot both look at legislation and spot a flaw. There is a flaw in this legislation and the Deputy has pointed it out. I will now do so. Usually, when a Government Deputy speaks on legislation, he starts by welcoming it. I cannot welcome this Bill because, in its current form, it has a massive problem. While the logic behind the measure is understandable, the omissions from the legislation are a problem. In other words, it actually has the potential to make matters worse economically in certain parts of the country. This is because the distribution of investment across the country is massively imbalanced and there is nothing in the legislation to counteract that growing imbalance. What is worse for me is that, after months of pointing this out on the floor of the House and at meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts and elsewhere, no one in government seems to give a damn. There are parts of the country that have seen almost no foreign direct investment or substantial State investment in the past ten or 15 years. We now have the legislative framework for a strategic investment fund for what is to all intents and purposes a national stimulus package that might amount to €15 billion, if we are lucky. It is structured without any consideration for the fact that cities such as Waterford and other urban areas, in particular, around the country are on their knees economically. Today there will be an announcement of a further 200 job losses in the city of Waterford, to which I will allude. The problem that obtains is actually a lot worse than one that a government does not have any money and cannot spread it around. In this case, the Government finally has some money, but it is choosing not to invest it where it is needed the most. It is fair to say that while we may be experiencing an economic recovery of sorts, we are not experiencing an evenly spread recovery across the country. Dublin has outpaced everywhere else in increasing economic activity, followed by Cork, Galway and, to a lesser extent, Limerick. Outside these urban areas, ordinary businesspeople and taxpayers generally are of the view that the Government has resigned itself to the fact that this is just the way it is. It is believed that as long as the underlying figures for the country as a whole are decent, it is acceptable. The truth is that parts of the country are still in recession or, at the very best, stagnating economically. All I have to do to confirm this is look at the CSO property figures published yesterday. Prices in Dublin rose by 3.1% in April, while there was a fall of 0.3% in prices outside the capital in the same month. It is the same old story. A few weeks ago Teagasc produced a good report on the economic strength of rural towns, the upshot of which was that rural towns had been focused on much less in national development strategies in the past decade and a half. With regard to development strategies generally, the Government has correctly focused on regaining our international reputation by attracting outside investment. A good job has been done in that regard. The Minister for Finance has been central to this and has done a very good job. However, if we are in recovery mode, our recovery has become imbalanced, perhaps through no one's fault. Any new investment in the country has occurred exactly where it is needed least, namely, Dublin, Cork and Galway — three urban locations where 82% of foreign direct investment ended up in the past 20 years. When I read about the NTMA-controlled National Pensions Reserve Fund, totalling €6.8 billion, being turned into a commercial investment fund to be matched by €6 billion to €7 billion in private investment, the obvious question is whether anybody considered that some of the money should have been earmarked for the areas worst affected by the recession. The answer is a resounding "No" time and again, as the Bill confirms. When I asked the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform about this recently, he confirmed that there was no regional angle or perspective and that, as far as he was aware, no consideration of a regional impact. He then said something very interesting, namely, that when his Department examined Exchequer funding and PPPs, it had regard to spread from the political world in which money was allocated. My take on what he said — we all know it — is that nobody inserted regional considerations into this legislation, but, when it comes down to it, anything is possible if there is the political will. The reality is that money is spent and things happen based on the location of Ministers' constituencies. That phenomenon is alive and well under the Government. It is fair to say money is still being allocated not on the basis of need but on the basis of political influence. The Bill proves this again. As far as I can see, no account is being taken in government collectively — I know this — of where money has or has not gone in the past and where it should or should not go in the future. The Department of Finance should ascertain where the investment in State finances has occurred in the past ten or 15 years and where employment rates are at their lowest. It should consider a policy of domestic investment in the areas that need most assistance. The Government could start again with this Bill. It is effectively a stimulus package, but it is structured in such a way that 90% of the €6.8 billion in State money could end up being invested exclusively in Dublin. That could make things a lot worse for other parts of the country. I raised this matter in the House a few weeks ago as a Topical Issue. What I received in response was patronising palaver. I have looked back at the speech made in response by the Minister of State who was here on the day. The part that was particularly galling — perhaps its authors are in the Chamber today — was the statement that "there will not be any parameters set for regional distribution." The next line was: "It must be said that no region will be excluded." It was the kind of cute, smarmy terminology that I really detested.The Minister of State proceeded to characterise my contribution as a "gross distortion" - he said it twice, but nothing I said was a distortion. There is a massive imbalance when it comes to deciding where investment should be made in the country. The Bill amounts to the first stimulus package the country has seen in six or seven years, yet it ignores completely the obvious imbalance. Frankly, we have moved beyond whether people in the regions think there is an imbalance. They know it. Whether the Government thinks what I have said is a gross distortion is beside the point; in the local elections last Friday the people of my area registered what they thought about what I had been saying and what the Government had been doing about it. Last week there were seven Fine Gael and Labour Party councillors in Waterford city; today there is one. People in Waterford are living with the reality of the imbalance about which I am talking. If the Department is going to respond to what I have said a second time, I suggest it not use the word "gross" or "distortion", or attempt to tell me I do not know what I am talking about. It might consider that IDA Ireland has accepted that regional aid guidelines do not work and have not worked, that there is an acceptance that investment is even around the country and that Departments collectively need to consider ways to deal with this glaring economic fact. The Bill needs to be amended. Money needs to be earmarked or set aside from the figure of €6.8 billion for the areas that need it the most. There are a lot of action plans but very little action. I am off to meet the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, for the second time today, with IDA Ireland. The problem with IDA Ireland is that the concept of "business as usual" is not working. There comes a time when we have to ask the question whether it ever will work with the existing personnel and approaches in the agency. The people of Waterford were not saying last Friday that the Government was not working hard enough or that they had forgotten who had caused the economic mess. All they were saying, in some respects, was: "Hello. We exist in the south east, but you have forgotten about us." They want to know what the Government intends to do next. This is emphasised by what has again happened today, with hundreds of job losses in Waterford city. This legislation, unfortunately, demonstrates they have a point. The Government needs to consider what I am saying and act. A starting point would be to amend the Bill appropriately. Money from the Strategic Investment Fund needs to be diverted to where it is needed most.
#AnthonyLawlor	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-party	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-dob	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	160	While I do not always agree with Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett, on a certain point within this legislation, I have to agree with him. This comes from the mandate for the Strategic Investment Fund which, as the Bill states, will be to invest on a commercial basis to support economic activity and employment in Ireland. One of the key things we are lacking where I come from - we have been talking about it for many years - is housing, in particular social housing. While I disagree with Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett on from where he pulls his figures at times, I know that on the ground the people who come to my office regularly are looking to be housed. When I discussed this issue with NAMA and the local authority a number of years ago, when it was first mooted that NAMA would make properties available to the local authorities, it was found that many of the properties in Kildare that were in NAMA were not suitable to house families, most of them being apartments. If Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett had done similar work for his own local authority area in Dún Laoghaire, he would probably have discovered the same thing, namely, only a small percentage of properties in the NAMA portfolio were suitable for families. That is the problem. What NAMA is now doing is dealing with the issue on a commercial basis, although it has also dealt with local authorities to try to transfer as many houses as possible to house those on housing lists. The Strategic Investment Fund has to look at housing as a means by which it can invest some of the billions available. While Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett referred to one incident in which a public private partnership did not work out, many of them did. In addition, he never mentioned anything about Part V. To my mind, Part V was disgraceful legislation, brought forward by a gombeen politician, Mr. Noel Dempsey. It should never have been brought forward and has turned out to be disastrous legislation. In the past five years under it, virtually nothing has been transferred to the local authorities to house people. As a consequence, the housing lists have increased dramatically. When I consider what has happened with the pensions fund, I have to give credit to former Minister Charlie McCreevy who set it up and had a long-term vision for where it was to be used. Unfortunately, in my naivety, when the crash occurred in 2006-07, I always believed it could be used along the lines of what had happened in the United States under the New Deal, namely, to fund social projects to get people back to work again. Instead, we threw it at the banks. I still believe we will get some money back from them. We have invested in shares in Bank of Ireland which are proving to be beneficial and also in AIB; therefore, it would be best not to sell our stake simply because it is rising but to wait a number of years. None the less, I strongly believe some of the investment fund has to be used in partnership to build houses, including with the local authorities. That is why I advocate the removal of Part V of the housing Act. The money should be transferred in partnership with the local authorities to build the houses required. I have always argued that we do not just build houses, we need to build communities. I would have opted for an alternative to Part V. My view was that developers should hand over land and that councils could then decide whether it should be used for the provision of amenities, schools, recreational facilities or houses. Part V only dealt with the building of houses, whereas I would look at building communities. I have looked at how the fund has been used heretofore and welcomed many of the investments that have taken place and how the fund has been used to leverage additional moneys. From a jobs perspective - I am a member of the relevant committee - some of the measures are innovative. I was always very much in favour of young entrepreneurs and other young people getting access and the fund has been used in that way. My view has always been to look at it in an overall, holistic way. As taxpayers, we actually provided the funding for the National Pensions Reserve Fund and we should benefit from it. There is a certain sector of society who are struggling and my point is that there should be some social inclusion provision within the legislation to cover housing. I am concerned to ensure moneys will come back into the NTMA through the investments we have made in the banks. While people might clamour for a repayment of our debt, we should put some of the money into the Strategic Investment Fund in order that we can use it to improve the economy further. We must look at this issue on a long-term, not a short-term basis. If we only look at it on a short-term basis, we will end up paying down debt. However, over a long period, debt is written down slowly but surely. If we invest in infrastructure with the funds we will get back from the investments we have made in the banks, the long-term returns will benefit the whole community. I strongly advocate that we put forward some amendment to this Bill that would include some kind of social provision so that it does not simply generate income back to the State. The State is made up of citizens who at this moment in time are crying out for housing, so it is important that we invest in that, because without citizens we do not have a State.

I want to go back down to the Committee of Public Accounts so I am in a bit of a rush. I welcome this Bill. The NTMA has proved itself to be a very capable arm of the State and this should be recognised. We should look at those factors that make it so successful in how it conducts its work. They include how people are recruited, compensated and rewarded for performance in the workplace. There is possibly a lesson that can be shared with other Departments and other public bodies. Of course, there are different salary scales in the NTMA for various reasons, but it relates to the way in which it structures the pay scales, incentivises competition in the workplace and rewards achievement. People are held to account and are held responsible for their actions. It is possibly an interesting case study in respect of lessons that might be shared with other aspects of the State and how we do our work. A strategic investment fund for the State is important, but it must be strategic and profitable and operate as the NPRF did before we funnelled it into the banks. Deputy Lawlor made an important point about recognising how important the NPRF was and the foresight involved in building up that fund. Unfortunately, that fund was mostly lost in the economic crisis because of what happened in the banking collapse. In taking the money remaining in the NPRF and creating a new fund with it, we must be strategic with those investments in the hope that we have that investment and funds should they be needed if there is another difficulty in the future, financial or otherwise. Hopefully, they will not be needed. The investments must be made on the basis of a decent financial return for the taxpayer. We are not spending this money; rather, we are investing it. We must not use it to curry favour with a particular demographic, region or interest group or for political reasons, because it would be disgraceful if we did that and a big mistake.  Many speakers have spoken about where the NTMA should invest and different ideas and proposals. Deputy Lawlor spoke about housing, which is important. One thing I wanted to touch upon is how the money is invested. I will be tabling an amendment in respect of that along the lines of the ethical investment Bill I introduced last year and in keeping with other national investment funds, most notably Norway's strategic investment fund. This fund is prohibited from making certain investments. I would like to introduce that into our new fund. There is already an ethical prohibition on the State's investing in companies that produce cluster munitions, and I would like to extend that to companies that produce nuclear weapons or nuclear weapon delivery vehicles. The NPRF has already invested €10 million in such companies, which is a disgrace. As we divest and reinvest that money, we must not reinvest in companies that do such work. This would be in keeping with our long-stated foreign policy objectives since our very first days in the UN. It is incredibly important that we are not hypocritical in how we spend taxpayers' money. If this country believes in the abolition of nuclear weapons, it is completely hypocritical for us to invest in companies that are building them. I hope this amendment will be accepted by the Minister of State when I table it. I intend to pursue it rigorously because it is important to me and to the people of this country. It should be recognised at every point that it is their money.  While we are talking about the NTMA, when we exited the bailout last year, we decided not to take a precautionary line of credit from the troika because the NTMA had built up cash reserves in the region of €20 billion, which was a smart move. It is always important that we have such contingencies in place, particularly given the continuing fragility in the international markets. However, I wonder if there is scope to take a portion of that €20 billion in cash reserves - even as little as 7% - to reinvest in the domestic economy by way of a change in the tax bands. If we were to increase the entry point to the marginal rate of tax by €10,000, it would cost the State €1.3 billion. I am not sure whether we will have that even on the current growth forecasts for this year, in keeping with the cuts that must be made this year to bring the annual deficit down. It would be a one-off payment, but such a one-off payment might prove to be the stimulus that we need, so that going into next year's growth levels it might carry over and become something more permanent. I wonder whether it has been discussed at senior level, but if not, I ask that it be considered, because the arithmetic for the next budget is tight, and from what I have heard in certain quarters, I am concerned that we may not be sticking to the current programme, which has specific parameters set out in Irish and European law. It is incredibly important that we reduce the deficit because we are legally obliged to, and for the continuing economic stability of the State. At the same time, we must find measures that might help stimulate the economy. They might not be directly in front of us in terms of the job creation that is taking place every month, which is welcome. The measure about which I spoke might be worth looking at as a one-off measure to help carry us over into next year and to more permanent changes in the tax arrangements in this country.
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	164	I have not had an opportunity to look into this Bill in great detail. There is no point in trying to present myself as somebody who has looked into it in great detail, because I have not done so, but I will make some general observations regarding what has happened to the NPRF since the 31st Dáil was formed. In a development I viewed with alarm and regret, as I felt it was the wrong thing to do, the NPRF was raided very heftily in July 2011 to recapitalise the banks in an over-hasty and probably ill-judged view of the capitalisation requirements of the banks, the state of their financial assets and the funding of their balance sheets. The amount of money that was invested in the two pillar banks was in the order of €16 billion. It was really the capitalisation of the banks plus the contribution to the troika funding needed to start the memorandum of understanding arrangements to manage the deficit. Hitting the NPRF at such a high level was reckless because there could have been at that point creditor capitalisation. The euro system strong-armed the Minister for Finance, the Governor of the Central Bank and the Department of Finance into essentially insisting that the socialisation of Irish-owned banks' losses could justifiably go ahead. That was wrong. Having accommodated that strategy, we have been left in the very defensive and weak position of being unable to insist on or make any progress with regard to creditor participation in the recapitalisation due to the losses.  The loss keeps being referred to as a €64 billion or €65 billion loss and capitalisation, but that amount only represents those losses that have been acknowledged in that way.There are further losses embedded in the banks that have not been recognised and that are causing the paralysis in the two main banks and preventing them from releasing their customers, households and businesses to a normalised level of liabilities funding. Even the front page of today's edition of The Irish Times reports on how the banks are being unreasonable in regard to restructuring to repayable amounts the legacy debts on the balance sheets of households and businesses on the basis of the incomes. The Bill is a behemoth. I glanced through it and it attempts to section off parts of the labyrinth of arrangements and operational management of agencies that are part of the State, including the National Pensions Reserve Fund, which is heavily depleted, with approximately €6.5 billion being put into the new division with new instructions and new boards. That is fine but it presents an opportunity again to make the case supported by the evidence. There are 385,000 people still on the live register; 250,000 people have emigrated; 170,000 households are in deep mortgage distress; SME liabilities amount to €50 billion, of which €25 billion is distressed and probably incapable of being repaid; 90,000 families are on housing waiting lists; and 5,000 people are without homes. That amounts to approximately 1.5 million people and our so-called partners in Europe have not snapped out of their dream to understand it is a nightmare for these people and relief in the order of €50 billion is long overdue to this country. The promissory bonds that represent the losses of Anglo Irish Bank should be extinguished, torn up and mutualised throughout the eurozone. That can be done. It is a matter of will, insistence and fighting for our people. Another €20 billion or €25 billion at a minimum is needed for the two main banks to snap out of their paralysis and deal with their loan books in order that the loans of families and businesses representing at least 750,000 people can be worked out properly and with dignity. It will not be a free and easy ride for those families but it would put them in a position where they can just about honour their debts for the rest of their working or business lives. This needs to be done and the Government parties have an opportunity to flex their muscles and fight for our people. Deputy Eoghan Murphy conceded that he was grateful that I allowed him to make his contribution because he was in a rush to another meeting and I understand that but there was a rush, for instance, on 9 February 2013 to liquidate IBRC without due consideration and deliberation as to what that moment could have provided in terms of another opportunity to eliminate the promissory notes and consequent promissory bonds. The Labour Party advertisements during the recent election campaign referring to €30 billion less bank debt were misleading. It is not the case. Even €20 billion less is not the case. A sum of €20 billion, which would have been the cashflow obligation over the next eight or nine years, has become a €40 billion cash flow obligation extended over 40 years. It has no business being on the backs of the citizens of Ireland. The balance sheets of all the licensed deposit taking businesses, including banks and building societies, show without the need for a banking inquiry that at six monthly intervals between 2001 and 2008, liquidity and solvency ratios, loans to customer deposit ratios and the funding of senior secured and subordinated bonds, together with the aggregate of the credit loans advanced by the banks in Ireland, including foreign-owned banks, were six times our GDP by 2008 instead of the loan assets being three times our GDP. What were the directors of each of those institutions doing during those seven years? What were the banks' auditors doing? The financial engineering of the balance sheets went way out of control. The banks manufactured a credit bubble, which is the prerequisite for an asset price bubble. That is a pyramid or Ponzi scheme, which is bound to collapse mathematically. When it collapses, the residual is the loans to households and businesses. The personalities on the boards of banks and running the banks have changed since 2001 and even since 2008 but we need accountability. Let us gather them together in a place that would accommodate such a revelation, for example, the basketball centre in Dublin, line them up in sections alphabetically, starting with AIB, Anglo Irish Bank and on to Bank of Ireland, Danske Bank and Ulster Bank and so on, and have the people who were in charge of directing the banks explain their balance sheets for each year. They were out of control and when the music stopped in 2008, Bank of Ireland had €61 billion in loans on its balance sheet. That funding in the form of senior secured bonds was short dated compared with some of the loans which had been extended interest-only on a roll-over basis. It was crazy stuff. Dynamite, matches and petrol come to mind. It is not even the fault of a previous Government. The boards of directors created the credit bubble. There cannot be an asset price boom and bust without credit creation. All the customer deposits were lent but that was not good enough for the directors. They wanted more funds to make more loans and, therefore, they issued bonds. Bank of Ireland had €61 billion in loans on its balance sheet in 2008 and AIB had €42 billion in addition to all the customer loans and the interbank money it had borrowed on a three, six and 12 month roll-over basis. It was mad and it gives us the evidence for a banking inquiry. Let us have the directors of these institutions in those years before us to examine their accounts and to have them explain them. This led to 1.5 million people being affected, including 385,000 on the live register, 170,000 in deep mortgage distress, which equates to 500,000 because there are 2.7 people in each household, 90,000 on the housing waiting lists, who were squeezed out of the madness of the asset price boom and bust, and the 5,000 who have no homes to go to at all and are sleeping on the streets. They deserve to see the curtains rolled back in the basketball centre and to be given explanations. There should not be firing squads at dawn, decapitations, heads on battlements and so on but let us hear what they have to say. Not one person on those boards has been asked to explain the balance sheets, which are the evidence of the creation of the credit bubble. Is that not crazy?Is it not crazy that the Government wants a committee of inquiry that will be politically balanced so there is Government control of it? People might feel completely at sea at present as to where to begin, until they start boning up, but I have just said where to begin. That would be the best lesson on how to avoid anything in the future. Without the credit bubble everything else could not have happened. When one creates credit like that, and only the banks did it, one creates the conditions and climate for greed. When I read the newspapers, I read about greedy builders and developers. They could not have been greedy if the greed ingredient, which is credit, had not been created by the banks. Am I right, Deputy Ross?

Perhaps the Minister would ask his colleagues on the Government benches to examine this and to start the banking inquiry along the lines I have just mentioned, because it could save a great deal of money. Let us save some money for the taxpayer and let us share with the taxpayer the truthful, fair and even-handed opening scene. Let us pull back the curtains and start from there. The guarantee only occurred when the bubble burst. We all know what happened after that and that the lawyers had us shivering and afraid to do what was right. Instead of that they became neurotic about the law and said that historical law provides that everybody should be protected equally, including the guys who had bought in the secondary market. The bonds were originally offered in the primary market and the investors had the good sense to get out and sell the bonds to the secondary market. That is when the bonds go up and down in price. This morning, representatives of NAMA appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts to explain how they hope to reduce the exposure of the Exchequer, which is us the citizens, by accelerating the disposal of the loan portfolios they hold. They are probably right to do that at present because there is a huge amount of overloaded liquidity in the hands of hedge funds and other investment funds seeking to buy assets at lower yields than they otherwise might. They are there because the cost of holding the bonds that NAMA issued to the banks in return for the rotten loans it acquired is currently low. However, if NAMA holds onto the funding of the bonds and holds onto the assets because somebody thinks they might make a little more, given that it is a floating variable rate, the price of those bonds might rise and that could result in losses. As the yields rise on those bonds, supported by the underlying property assets, the value falls and the underlying assets fall. Perhaps NAMA is right, and I believe it is, to see if it can dispose of larger lumps of those portfolios, simply to reduce the exposure of the State and the people. I wish the Minister well. He should simplify things wherever he can. He should not add more law. People's heads get wrecked and melt when trying to understand what is happening, so the Minister should simplify. He should recruit people who are competent, experienced and as apolitical as possible to work these things. He should not be afraid of any bad news that might be coming down the track. Instead he should face it, measure it and then deal with. He must keep things open and transparent. I urge the Minister not to allow any of his colleagues to do what has been done on a few occasions previously. When the NAMA legislation was brought forward in October and November in 2009, it was not on the Minister's watch, but the IBRC liquidation and the promissory note issue were presented misleadingly and dishonestly, in my view. There was a golden opportunity to achieve the cancellation of what are now the promissory bonds, formerly the promissory notes. That could have been done. I am deeply disappointed on behalf of the people who elected me and all the other Members of the House at what happened and that illusory and misleading language presented something other than what it was at the time. That is not right. Honesty is the best policy.

That is the reason I have chosen to speak on this Bill today. There are many aspects to the Bill but I will focus on section 22, in particular, which provides that the agency, in consultation with relevant Ministers, can develop proposals for investment to support economic activity and employment in energy, water, telecommunications, forestry and any other sector specified by the order. I fully support the principle of State investment in infrastructure and to create jobs. It is ironic that this runs counter to the neo-liberal philosophy that has been the mania of this Government, the previous Government and the European Union establishment over the last number of years, when the creed was privatisation and looking to the private sector to resolve all problems. The failure of that is seen in the 25 million who are unemployed throughout Europe. The Government is moving very late to invest strategically. This is a tardy and insufficient measure in the face of the mass unemployment and mass emigration from this country in the last number of years. The Socialist Party is grateful to the officials in the Department of Finance for the briefing on the Bill which was given to my colleague, Deputy Joe Higgins. The core of the Bill is that €6.9 billion in assets from the National Pensions Reserve Fund will be given to a new body under the auspices of the National Treasury Management Agency, to be called the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund. A total of €2.4 billion is already committed elsewhere, leaving €4.5 billion to be invested. That sum of €4.5 billion is insufficient in the context of the thousands who have emigrated from this country and the thousands who are unemployed. Let us put it in perspective. This year and every year €8 billion will be paid by the State in interest on our national debt, much of which is due to the bank bailout which was dearly paid for by the Irish people. Five years ago, the National Pensions Reserve Fund had €20.7 billion in assets. This was put into the banks and in 2013 it was worth €13.3 billion. Over €7.5 billion was lost by the Irish people due to the chaos of the finance system of capitalism. That puts the amount of money dealt with by this Bill in context. I wish to draw attention to a glaring omission. There is no specific reference in the Bill to housing, which is the most important strategic and social need in this country at present. It is conservatively estimated that 8,000 to 10,000 houses can be built for €1 billion, so 40,000 houses could potentially be built if the money referred to in this Bill was used for housing.That may sound fanciful but it is not. In 1975, more than 8,000 local authority houses were built in a single year, to say nothing of what was built by the private sector. During the Celtic tiger boom, up to 80,000 houses a year were being built. The idea that the housing crisis cannot be resolved quickly and within a period of perhaps three years is not fanciful at all and only requires the political will to be there. I challenge the Minister. Is this going to happen? Is any of the fund going to be used for housing? Does he accept that could happen with the Bill? I await a reply, as do the thousands who are stuck on housing waiting lists and suffering from the neglect of successive Governments. It is not something that has happened under the current regime alone, but under the previous regime also. A mother with an autistic son contacted our office yesterday to say that she is now homeless. Through the kindness of charity, she is being put up for a night in a hotel. These kinds of case are the order of the day. A man contacted us who is sleeping in the van he used to use for work. That is what people have been reduced to by the lack of housing, rack-renting and Government inaction over successive years. All public social housing was devolved to the private sector. Housing can be facilitated in the Bill. Does the Minister agree that it is a glaring omission, given the countless stories that have come up in the last few weeks alone? If it is not an omission that is to be corrected, will the Minister agree that this is another example of the Government's absolute removal from reality? It is a removal from reality that saw the Government punished severely in the elections over the weekend. Deputy Joe Higgins and I have been approached by countless people in Dublin 15 - in Dublin West - who are suffering because of the housing crisis. They are now going to take action. I caution the Government that there will be social unrest and activity over housing if action is not taken by the regime. Many people have established housing action groups, which are seen as increasingly necessary by those on the housing waiting lists. I await eagerly the Minister's reply to the effect that housing will be included in the Bill.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	172	Ar an gcéad dul síos, ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an bhfoireann ón Roinn Airgeadais maidir leis an eolas breise a fuaireamar uathu inné ar an mBille seo agus an méid a bhaineann leis.  Tá an-chuid gnéithe difriúla insan mBille seo, ach nílim chun dul isteach iontu ar fad inniu. Ceann de na gnéithe is tábhachtaí atá ann ná cad atá le déanamh leis an gCúlchiste Náisiúnta Pinsean maidir leis an airgead atá ann a aistriú go ciste infheistíochta. Ar ndóigh, tá sin thar a bheith riachtanach. Ceann de na cúiseanna ba mhó leis an ngéarchéim dífhostaíochta agus leis na céadta mílte duine óg agus níos sine a bheith ar imirce i láthair na huaire ná an titim tubaisteach a tharla in infheistíocht phríobháideach insan tír seo agus, ag an am céanna, na ciorruithe in infheistíocht phoiblí. Chun na fadhbanna seo a réiteach, tá infheistíocht ag teastáil, go mórmhór in infreastruchtúr poiblí.  Dá bhrí sin, fáiltím i bprionsabal leis an méid go bhfuil airgead Stáit, airgead na ndaoine agus cáiníocóirí, le cur isteach in infheistíocht chun infreastruchtúr a thabhairt chun cinn agus poist a chruthú. Mar a dúirt mo chomhghleacaí, is scanallach an rud é go bhfuil €7.4 billiún d'airgead de chuid lucht íoctha cánach sa tír seo caillte sna bainc. Cuireadh isteach figiúr millteanach mór, €20.7 billiún, cúig bliana ó shin, ach anois níl fágtha ach €13.3 billiún.  Feicim i gCuid 6, alt 42, den Bhille seo go bhfuil sé mar pháirt den Bhille gur féidir tuilleadh airgid a chur isteach sna bainc. Faraor, níl leagan Gaeilge den Bhille againn, ach séard atá á rá ann ná gur féidir infheistíocht a dhéanamh chun teacht ó ghéarchéim doimhin in eacnamaíocht an Stáit nó chun cosc a chur le damáiste a d'fhéadfaí a dhéanamh don chóras airgeadais ionas nach dtarlódh a leithéid. Is iad siúd na critéir céanna a bhí ar bun nuair a cuireadh €60 billiún d'airgead cáiníocóirí isteach sna bainc le sé bliana anuas. Níl faic sa Bhille seo a deireann conas gur féidir aon airgead nua a chuirfear isteach a shábháil ó dul an tslí céanna agus a chuaigh an €20 billiún a cuireadh isteach cheana. Arís, d'fhéadfaí an t-airgead sin a chailliúnt. Maidir le cúrsaí infreastruchtúir agus a leithéid, níl aon tagairt faoi leith sa Bhille don riachtanas is mó sa tír i láthair na huaire - an géarchéim agus an fulaingt uafásach atá i measc na mílte maidir le ganntanas tithíochta agus easpa fothana do dhaoine sa tír seo. I ndáiríre, ba cheart go mbeadh náire ar an Rialtas seo nár thóg na húdaráis áitiúla ach 300 nó 400 teach an bhliain seo caite ag am go bhfuil 90,000 clann ar na liostaí feithimh le haghaidh tithe poiblí. Nuair a fhéachann muid go speisialta ar an méid tithe a tógadh sna seachtóidí, nuair a bhí an tír seo níos boichte ná mar atá i láthair na huaire - an géarchéim seo san áireamh - feiceann muid sa bhliain 1972 gur thóg na húdaráis áitiúla 5,900 teach, tógadh 6,000 teach i 1973, tógadh 6,746 i 1974, agus tógadh 8,794 i 1975. An bhliain seo caite, níor tógadh ach 300 nó 400.  Nach bhfuil sé soiléir cad atá le déanamh anois maidir leis an ngéarchéim seo? Is cóir go ndéanfar togra práinneach le tabhairt faoin ngéarchéim tithíochta sa tír seo. Maidir leis an 1,700 de thithe atá in úinéireacht na n-údarás áitiúla agus atá folamh i láthair na huaire, fáiltím roimh an deis atá á thabhairt do dhaoine glacadh leis na tithe sin, ach níl ansan ach sop i mbéal na gaoithe.Dá bhrí sin, ba cheart go ndéanfadh an Rialtas, mar thogra práinneach, an t-airgead seo a chur isteach in infheistíocht leis an ngéarchéim tithíochta a réiteach agus deireadh a chur leis an bhfulaingt uafásach atá ar siúl mórthimpeall na tíre - le clanna i mullach a chéile, i dtithe lena dtuismitheoirí agus lena sean-tuismitheoirí, rud scanallach i ndáiríre. Freisin, tá lánúin phósta scartha óna chéile agus teaghlaigh ag dul ó óstán go h-óstán. Tá seo náireach. Ansin, nuair a thagann deireadh seachtaine mór ar a dtagann ceoltóir mór nó a leithéid go Páirc an Chrócaigh, cuirtear amach as na h-óstáin iad go dtí áit éigin eile mar go bhfuil úinéirí na n-óstán ag iarraidh níos mó airgid a dhéanamh. Rud náireach é seo. Iarraim ar an Aire Stáit, nuair a bheidh sé ag tabhairt freagra dúinn -----

Chuir mé ceist ar seo ar an bhfoireann ón Roinn inné agus an cheist atá agam anois ná an bhfuil an Rialtas chun a chur roimhe go speisialta cuid mhór den airgead seo a chur isteach chun an géarchéim seo a réiteach? An bhfuil sé chun iarracht a dhéanamh dul ar ais go dtí an leibhéal a bhí ann sna seachtóidí ar a laghad, agus an líon tithe a tógadh ansan a thógail anois? Dá mba rud é go dtógfaí fiú 10,000 tithe in aghaidh na bliana, d'fhéadfadh sin laghdú lomdíreach a dhéanamh ar an mbrú uafásach atá ar an gcóras tithíochta sa tír seo. Laghdódh sé an brú atá ar chánacha agus a leithéid chomh maith. Tá daoine amuigh ansin atá ag fulaingt agus ag fanacht le freagra ón Rialtas.

#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	175	I congratulate Deputy Ruth Coppinger on her maiden speech and I wish her many long years in this House. I regret the fact that she is supplanting her constituency colleague, but maybe we will find another constituency for him. In light of what he said in his elegant speech in Irish, it would be a great pity if we were to lose him to a colleague for political and constituency reasons. I listened to what Deputy Joe Higgins had to say and it consistently alarms me that I find myself, once again, more in agreement with him than with those who promote this Bill. That is not because I agree with the specifics that all the money should go into housing, which is a very direct message and somewhat restrictive, but because I am deeply suspicious of the motivation behind the Bill and I am extremely reluctant to believe the money is going to be as productive or as impartially and independently distributed as the Government parties lead us to believe. Once upon a time, over ten years ago, Charlie McCreevy had a bright idea. The nation was booming and, partly to be prudent for the future into 2025, his idea was to set aside money for a national pension fund. It amounted to 1% of GDP. It was prudent because it was going to dampen a boom that was getting artificially large. Charlie McCreevy had many faults and flaws but he knew that, if he set the money aside in large sums, politicians - himself and his party included - would see the fund growing, set their eagle eyes on it and try to get their paws on it for political advantage. Instead of just setting up a fund, as most politicians would do, he set it in legislation that the fund could not be pillaged for political reasons and could not be used for politicians' constituencies or pet projects. He seemed to have set up, not for eternity but for over 20 years, a fund to look after the needs of pensioners from 2025. That was a sound idea with which few people disagreed at the time. He did not take in the capacity of his successors, when faced with the first possible emergency, huge political embarrassment and a national crisis, to destroy the idea. As Deputy Peter Mathews spelled out so clearly, when the bank crisis arrived the fund was completely and utterly destroyed. Legislation was passed in the Oireachtas to allow the Government to use the fund to prop up the banks. The fund is down €7 billion or €8 billion, a figure that fluctuates a bit, varying with the price of Bank of Ireland shares, which are volatile at the moment. The fund is all but gone, with only €6.9 billion remaining. Today, we are debating what happens to the entrails of the fund. The legislation does exactly the opposite of what Mr. McCreevy did. It enables the Government to do exactly what it likes with what is left, masked with a few pretty cosmetic restrictions. I do not like the legislation, although it has been well spun and well sold and is coated in the language of apple pie and ice cream. The fund will be used, ultimately or pretty shortly, for political purposes and nothing in the legislation stops it from being used for that purpose. My first problem is the question of why the NTMA. The NTMA is the universally acceptable face of Irish State capitalism. It has supposedly done a fantastic job and has managed to capture most Ministers for Finance, almost all of whom sing its praises. I am not sure the myth stands up to scrutiny. Most of it comes from the NTMA and its extraordinarily well-paid spinners, some of whom are sitting for hours before the Committee of Public Accounts, from where I have come, spinning some smooth and unconvincing stories about NAMA. They have done a very good job for the NTMA and have done such a good job that the NTMA empire has expanded over the years from being a debt management agency into taking control of the State Claims Agency, the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NewERA, the NDFA, NAMA and various other bodies, according to a briefing I received from the Department of Finance.I wonder why the NTMA has been given this all-powerful, monopolistic role in the Irish economy and why Ministers are so consistently happy to pay tribute to its success. It has had successes; there is no doubt about that. The fact that it has been able to sell Irish bonds is a success by its standards, whether by luck or not. It had success there and was good at marketing those bonds. However, anybody who believes the NTMA has been some sort of stellar performer in managing funds ought to look at some of the critical pieces written by Professor Stewart of TCD and others, who conclude that the fund management performance of the NTMA is at best middling in terms of its competitors overseas. In its early days, the NTMA very cleverly chose a benchmark which is always exceeded. Every year, on 31 January, it comes out to an audience which is quite uncritical and not very knowledgeable, including successive Ministers for Finance. Each year, the Minister is present and nodding wisely while the NTMA says it has beaten the benchmark again, a benchmark it set itself. Therefore, let us not get too starry-eyed about what the NTMA does or let us not be too happy about the strategic investment fund going to the NTMA. Let us look at this more critically and let us not blindly say it will be okay because it is going there. The NTMA's performance is not particularly great. It is not top quartile, and this we should bear in mind. What is going to happen to this money, this €6.9 billion? We do not know. However, we are being reassured that there are certain restrictions on its use. First, it will go to Ireland, and second, it will go into commercial projects. I do not believe these two restrictions are necessarily compatible. It will not necessarily go to the most commercial projects available if it is restricted to the home patch. This excludes so many options that it is not guaranteed to be commercial. Restricting it to Ireland may have merits; obviously the Irish economy needs that money, but that restriction certainly does not mean it will go into the optimal commercial investment. The second restriction, which is blandly bandied around by those who support this Bill, is that the money must go into commercial projects. How in the name of God do they know the projects are commercial before they have started? What they mean is that the money will go into projects they judge to be commercial, a purely subjective judgment. When we leave decisions like this to subjectivity, we leave them open to the possibility of political interference. With the best will in the world, politicians could maintain that the projects involved are commercial, but the danger is that there could be another agenda involved. I suggest the Government, with only 18 to 24 months to go, will succumb to that danger for political purposes. The proof of this is that the Minister has refused to allow this fund out of his political grasp or the political stranglehold in which it is held. As I see it, the general government policy on where investments go is set by the NTMA, and the most specific direction of these investments is set by the new companies investment committee. The NTMA is dominated by Government nominees. It currently has an advisory committee which is nominated by the Government, and it will now have a nine-member board which will be nominated by the Government. However, with the Government's record, there is little doubt that it will put in place people who are, at the least, safe choices, people who when the chips are down will do what they are told. I have just come from a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts which had NAMA before it. I am not going to be unpleasant or personal about anything, but NAMA, which is part of the NTMA family, has just got a new director. This has happened under the radar and there do not seem to have been any announcements about it. This new director appointed to an important State agency happens to have a Fine Gael pedigree second to none. That new director is also on the board of Bord Gáis. This indicates to me that the Government will not be in any way shy when it comes to making appointments to the new board of the NTMA, particularly to the investment committee, and that it will appoint its cronies and people who will send the money in the direction the Government approves. In fairness, the investment is not directly decided by the Government, but the Minister has a veto. Therefore, it comes to the same thing, although couched in language which offers a certain protection. What I see happening here is something that always happens where politicians, elections and large amounts of money come together. What I see happening is that money will be directed in a way that will be politically advantageous. I do not see any problem with giving the money to housing projects, nor do I see the Government having any problem with that. The problem I see is that the Government will probably give it to housing if it can, but only in specific places where it is politically advantageous to do so. That is the kind of cynical operation I see at hand here. If it were not the Government's intention to direct this money to its political advantage, why did it not detach it from the NTMA and from itself and give it to a truly independent body with a real commercial mandate and direction and which is free of political interference? It could not do that because at the back of its mind it wants this cash and wants to be able to put it in a place that is important to it. The history of Irish politics demonstrates that this is what always happens. Otherwise, there would be far stricter limits and far more restricted investments. I am not happy about this so-called commercial mandate, or the suggestion that the money must go to commercial interests.There are many quangos that are patronised and ripped off in order to pay directors' fees to Government friends and they are called commercial semi-state bodies. Some of them are not commercial at all. CIE is known as a commercial semi-state body. It is not commercial in the sense that it makes a profit; it never makes a profit. It is subsidised to the amount of about €280 million a year. Will we be able to take some of this money and shove it into a body that is not making money because it needs it and say it is meant to be a commercial body or could be in the future? If it goes to prop up a failing State body, that should be addressed in a completely different way. "Commercial" is an abused and contaminated word. There are real dangers. I have serious doubts about setting up another jobs agency, if that is what it is meant to be, because such agencies tend to be subject to political interference and control and are not subject to commercial criteria. While I do not want to say anything irresponsible, this bond is in serious danger of becoming a political slush fund. The proof of the pudding will be in the eating, but the wording of the Bill suggests I am right. It will have a political board controlled by the Minister for Finance and in approaching a general election it will be used in a way that is not responsible and frittered away. There is a shameful history to the origins of this money and it is shameful that so little is left. Owing to the record of the Government and its predecessor with such moneys, I would be inclined to oppose the Bill.

I welcome the Bill, as the purpose for which it is introduced is important. Members on both sides of the House have made reference to its purpose. It goes without saying that in the past the NTMA showed that it could perform miracles with the responsibility thrust upon it, even though at times very difficult tasks were given to it. We should mention the origins of the agency. The NTMA was originally invented to pay for the 1977 Fianna Fáil general election manifesto, which after two and a half years thrust the country into a very serious financial position. The NTMA was subsequently set up to cater for and manage that debt - to rearrange investment in such a way as to be of benefit to the economy. It did so admirably and is to be lauded for what it has done. A number of issues now present themselves to the Government. Without doubt, at this time there is a dearth of available resources to invest in anything. I will not go back and rehearse what we have discussed before and suggest it was the fault of somebody else. I do not mind whose fault it was, nor does it matter at this stage. The Government must run the country, meet its requirements and commitments in a way that was never asked of any previous Government without money. On top of this, when the Government took office, it had an annual revenue deficit the likes of which had never been known since the foundation of the State. It is a miracle that the country did not collapse and implode entirely, with everything going down the tubes, because that is what seemed likely just two and a half years ago. A lot of work had to be done, as a result of which we arrived at the situation in which we now find ourselves. The housing issue that has been referred to is of critical importance. It is not something that has just loomed on the horizon in the past year, two years or five years. It has been on the horizon for several years and every local authority knew there was no investment in replacement housing, as a result of which eventually the entire rental market fell into the hands of the private sector. There is nothing wrong with this, except that there is no control over the cost to the tenant or the leaseholder in any part of the country and markets determine the burden on the householder. Reference has been made to the approximately 100,000 families on the various local authority housing lists. They are all dependent on renting houses in the private sector supported by the Department of Social Protection to the extent of €450 million per annum. That is a recurring event each year and has continued for at least ten to 15 years. Unfortunately, nobody is willing to stand up and accept responsibility for what happened over that period. What happened was that the temporary solution to the country's housing problem became the permanent solution. In other words, temporary leasing and rent support became the replacement for what used to be the building of a reasonable number of local authority houses. I remember when most local authorities, certainly those in the greater Dublin area, built approximately 400 to 500 houses per annum and also offered local authority loans to another 400 to 500 people. That amounts to 1,000 families each year catered for by the local authority system. It was deemed to be much more effective and efficient to have the housing issue catered for by the voluntary sector, with which I have no problem. The only problem is that nothing was done in that sector either. Ironically, the voluntary sector had some considerable advantages over the local authorities. I do not know if it was through negligence, but the local authorities allowed matters to slip from their grasp. It is for them to answer, but the net result is that the people have nowhere to go. It is the most appalling problem I have ever experienced. It is not just me; I know every Member of the House is aware of this. People have not referred to the fact that approximately 30,000 other families are also renting private property. These are families who do not qualify for local authority housing in the ordinary way because their incomes are too high. However, lo and behold, what has happened? Rents have increased - in some cases by 50% or 60% in the past 12 months. As the Acting Chairman knows, this applies throughout the greater Dublin area and into adjoining counties. In many cases, it is worse in the adjoining counties than in Dublin city. Approximately 150,000 families are now dependent entirely on the whims of the market on the extent to which their investment in housing will depend. That is wrong and very unsatisfactory.In many instances, banks are exerting huge pressure on landlords to either increase rents or evict the tenants and replace them with people who can afford to pay. For a number of years we have been encouraged to believe we should be leasing or renting residential properties as opposed to purchasing them. The move in this direction is a colossal and fundamental mistake. Traditionally, Irish people have always wanted to own their properties. They see them as an investment in their futures or those of their families. The land war was fought over people's right to own their own place. Why was that? It was because they had for too long been moved around from pillar to post at the whim of investors, landlords or whomever else. There are many dutiful landlords throughout the country who look after their tenants very well. They are happy to have good tenants who will look after their properties and pay reasonable rents for them. Unfortunately, not all landlords fall into this category. There have been many instances in the past year in which tenants have been asked to vacate properties with 24 hours notice, which is illegal. As a result, a huge number of people have been placed in jeopardy and a great deal of hardship has been suffered by many. All of this was unnecessary. There is a need for strategic investment which must be targeted at the areas with the greatest housing need. This investment must be made in a way which would ensure there would be no recurrence of what happened during the most recent housing bubble when the collateral for properties was used as a bargaining chip between banks and between investors and the banks. As a result, there was massive inflation across the entire housing market. Residential property in this country is much more expensive than in most other European countries, which is not good. In the past the criterion which applied for those seeking mortgages was that two and a half times the income of the main earner and the entire income of the secondary earner would be taken into consideration by the banks. That criterion fell by the wayside and the banks and local authorities brought forward a new formula. I have still not discovered the nature of that formula, but suffice it to say it represented an intricate solution to a problem which there was never any intention of solving in the first instance. As a result, many borrowed huge sums and the repayments were far in excess of their ability to meet them. In that context, they committed themselves to making repayments over a period of 40 or 50 years. Some parents have since sought to rescue their children or grandchildren from their debts and consequently doubled or redoubled their debts. Let us consider what is required for someone to repay a mortgage of €400,000. Nobody should pretend that, even now, people are not paying such amounts for properties, although I accept that there is a difference between prices in Dublin and those which obtain elsewhere. A person who borrows in the region of €350,000 to €400,000 would need an income of approximately €120,000 in order to meet his or her repayments under the old criterion to which I referred. This level of income would certainly be required by single income households. Those who are renting also require very large incomes. It is obvious, therefore, that a greater proportion of the disposable incomes of people who are buying or renting is being spent on servicing their housing requirements. Normally, the maximum repayment should be one third of the net income of the household. In some instances the amount is almost two thirds. Owing to a lack of housing, the level repayments is likely to rise further. I cannot understand why people continually refer to slight overheating - 1% over six months - in the market. The same comments were made when the previous property bubble was about to burst. On the news each morning it used to be stated house prices had stabilised. What was not said was they had stabilised following annual increases of up to 30% or 40%. House prices were removed from the consumer price index in 1977, which is interesting. The reason they were removed was they were affecting the rate of inflation. They contributed to inflation because, as was the case in the most recent property bubble, they rose dramatically. A means must be found whereby the cost of residential property to the consumer must be reflected in some register in order that the Government of the day might be alerted to the prevailing trend. Deputy Shane Ross seems to believe the Government should have no input in this matter. That is ironic, particularly as the Government is always blamed for deficiencies. It is extraordinary that certain individuals are suggesting the Opposition should reap the benefit of the good vibes from issues being resolved and that the Government should accept responsibility for all that is negative. That is a new one on me. The Government should have control in this matter. The fact that previous Administrations did not exercise such control is a sad reflection on what they did when they were in power. As stated, strategic investment in housing is critically important. For several years I have been stating such investment should be made. If it is not forthcoming, much more serious issues are going to arise in six or 12 months time. This problem is not going to go away. It is not true to say we can solve it. We cannot do so. In the 1950s the population of this jurisdiction stood at approximately 2.6 million. It has, as one would expect, increased considerably in the intervening period. If the economy is going to grow and we expect - as we do - to have full employment in the future, housing that is affordable must be provided. We should encourage those who are in a position to exert control over this matter - for example, the Government - to ensure an adequate supply of affordable housing is available on the market at all times. This would benefit two groups, namely, people who would ordinarily register their names on local authority housing lists and first-time buyers. Those in the latter category would include young gardaí and nurses. The people to whom I refer must be in a position to access good quality, affordable housing as opposed to what I, for want of a better word, would describe as the high rise "compartments" that they have been obliged to purchase in recent years. This morning the chairperson of An Bord Pleanála stated that in the future housing would be provided in high density developments of sufficient size to accommodate families. If that proves to be the case, the outcome will be interesting. We have certainly failed in this regard up to now. Some of the houses provided in the past fell far short of meeting both people's basic requirements and the relevant accommodation standards. We are all aware of countless cases in our constituencies in which what can only be described as cramped accommodation was provided for those on local authority housing lists and those on a slightly higher income level who would normally have been expected to be able to afford to purchase homes in the ordinary way. I believe this Bill is of considerable importance. I hope it addresses the situation and I know it is intended to address the situation. Many of us in the House have made numerous requests for something like this to be done as matter of urgency. There are various ways and means of achieving the same objective. I hope this works, but if it does not work and if we cannot achieve within a short space of time the ability to house the people in the two groups to which I have referred, then we will have a disastrous situation on our hands. It does not matter two pins who is responsible for it, because these unfortunate people will be on the roadside, for want of a better description. Many of them are on the roadside at the moment. I mean no disrespect to the Opposition, but I have listened to Members of the Opposition making points to the Ministers sitting on this side of the House as if they were directly responsible. These things must be planned five or six years in advance. Otherwise, we have to introduce emergency measures to deal with them. We do not resolve these issues overnight. We must plan in advance, secure planning permission and go through the process. Otherwise, we can use the infrastructural deficit legislation to speed things up. One way or the other, the greatest single issue facing the country at the moment, apart from our indebtedness, is the housing crisis. I believe we have the ability to resolve it and address it in the context of this legislation and I hope we do so.

Bhí sé an-mhaith Gaeilge bhinn bhlasta Chiarraí a chloisteáil ón Teachta Ó hUigínn. Ba mhaith liom freisin comhghairdeas a dhéanamh leis an Teacht Ruth Coppinger as bheith tofa don Dáil agus as an chéad óráid a thug sí anseo. Is bunphrionsabal é do a lán daoine go rachadh an t-airgead seo isteach i gcruthú post. Sin an bunchloch le cur isteach chun cúrsaí eacnamaíóchta na tíre seo a fheabhsú. Níl aon dul as againn ach é seo a dhéanamh agus airgead a chur isteach aon áit in ar féidir poist a chruthú. An bunphrionsabal atá againn ná go mbeidh poist ar fáil ar fud na tíre. Níl aon treorú sa Bhille gan airgead a chur go haon áit sa tír. Mar sin, má tá tuairim ag duine ar bith in áit ar bith sa tír chun post a chruthú, níl aon chosc ar airgead a chur isteach sa togra sin. Rud tábhachtach é seo. Ní ceart d'aon duine a rá nach rachfaidh an t-airgead isteach go dúiche i gContae Phort Láirge, Contae Chiarraí nó aon chontae eile. Níl aon chosc ar airgead a chur isteach in aon chuid den tír má tá plean cruthaithe ann gur féidir a chinntiú gur commercial operation atá ann.  Labhair an Teachta Ó hUigínn as Gaeilge ar fad, ach tabharfaidh mé freagra as Béarla dó freisin. Admhaím go ndearna sé iarracht an Ghaeilge a chur ar siúl anseo. Maidir le tithíocht, níl aon dabht ach go bhfuil sé an-tábhachtach go mbeidh tithe ar fáil do mhuintir na hÉireann. Níl aon difear eadrainn maidir leis an ghá atá ann leis an fhadhb seo a réiteach agus tithe a chur ar fáil, ach caithfidh airgead a bheith ann leis na tithe sin a thógáil. An bunphrionsabal a bhaineann leis an gciste seo ná go gcaithfidh an togra a bheith ina commercial operation agus go gcaithfidh maoiniú a bheith ar fáil ón private sector chomh maith le maoiniú ón Stát. Má tá sin ann, is féidir linn le chéile dhá oiread an airgid a chur isteach. In other words, we can double the money by getting private investment. With our State fund and matching funding, we could double the amount of money available. That is what is rather attractive about getting private investment into everything we do. At the least, it would double the fund. Furthermore, any money that private enterprise matches to State funding is a big boon to the economy, and that is what this fund is for.

I listened with respect and interest to everything, particularly the points Deputy Boyd Barrett has made. They were cogent and practical and I hope to reply to them constructively. It is important that this is a constructive debate. People on all sides of the House have welcomed the principle of the Bill, including Deputy Boyd Barrett, Deputy Higgins, Deputy Coppinger, the Sinn Féin party and Fianna Fáil. All have welcomed the principle. This is a new step that we all agree on. We all agree that this fund is important for the future of the economy. Notwithstanding the criticisms expressed - there have been many from various political points of view - the fact is that this is a major step. It is a stimulus package that we are bringing into our economy. Basically, we are bringing the money home and making it work for us and for jobs. This is about investment strategies and creating jobs. It is not a political slush fund or a fund that excludes investment from anywhere in the country. I emphasise that point strongly: this is for everyone and every business, whether small, medium or large. If a person has a good idea, he should ring up the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund. It is already in business and has already committed significant amounts of money to employment. My speech was too long at the beginning and I wish to make some points that I did not make at the time but that were in my script. In consultation with the relevant Departments and agencies, the National Treasury Management Agency has developed an economic impact framework, and this is a key element of the investment strategy. This framework seeks to identify targeted areas for investment which have higher potential economic and employment impacts and will also facilitate the identification of categories of investment that would be expected to assist and accelerate normalisation of capital markets in Ireland following the financial crisis. The NTMA expects to be able to publish a preliminary assessment of the economic impact of the investments made to date in Ireland by the National Pensions Reserve Fund during the second quarter of this year. To achieve this, the agency has been developing capabilities for collating and analysing data to measure and report on the economic impact of its investments. It is clear and certain that this is the way the funding will be monitored and examined. Of course, the investment strategy will have to be approved by the board of the NTMA when the legislation is commenced and the new arrangements are in place. It is expected that the investment strategy will facilitate the ISIF in continuing to invest in the public private partnerships included in the Government's stimulus programme agreed in July 2012 on an ongoing basis. Such investments will not crowd out private investment and may include social and environmental projects, subject to the commercial mandate. That is a key point from today's debate. It is the kernel of the points made by several Members of the Opposition. There was consensus on the issue of projects which are socially just, which make a good deal of sense and which are urgently needed. The Government agrees and acknowledges that in respect of these issues there must be a commercial mandate. How do we do that? We do it by going to the marketplace, coming up with proposals and matching funds. I will comment on social housing because several significant points were made in this regard. Recently, we published a construction strategy, the core of which is that every citizen should have access to suitable housing. That is a key policy goal of the Government. We will continue to prioritise the delivery of good-quality social housing. This will include: the return to mainstream local authority housing construction this year, a point well made by the Opposition; enhancing the role of the not-for-profit sector in the provision of social homes, an issue we all agree on; and continuing to work with NAMA, local authorities and approved housing bodies to maximise the delivery of units owned by NAMA or its debtors for social housing. We will identify the best ways to deliver social housing in the years ahead as part of the development of a comprehensive strategy for social housing. The estimate is that in the region of 5,000 new social housing units will be provided in 2014 through leasing and existing capital programmes. This includes the completion of mortgage-to-rent arrangements, the continued transfer of units owned by NAMA or its debtors, the completion of existing building and acquisition programmes and transfers under the rental accommodation scheme.Budget 2014 contained innovative housing measures and announced an additional €30 million of investment in local authority housing. This is expected to provide a substantial number of new and refurbished homes for people on housing waiting lists. Approximately half of this investment will enable the construction of developments in areas with the highest demand for social housing. In March, my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and planning, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, launched a two-year, €68 million local authority home building initiative, which will build 449 new social homes for families in need of housing. This investment represents the first return to new, mainstream local authority house building since the beginning of the financial crisis. The details of the €15 million fund to bring vacant local authority houses back into use were announced in April. This will bring 952 vacant local authority units back into beneficial use, providing both high-quality homes for people in need of housing and employment through labour-intensive activities. This year will also see the completion of a three-year, €100 million investment programme that will provide 800 units for older people, people with disabilities and the homeless. We are in the process of rolling out a new housing assistance payment, which will help to remove barriers to employment for recipients and will contribute to the creation of a higher-quality private rental sector through improved standards. The contribution of the not-for-profit sector to the provision of social housing will be facilitated by legislation regulating the sector. The construction strategy stated that later this year we would publish a social housing strategy setting out the vision for the sector. We will introduce legislation to regulate the approved housing body, AHB, sector. The Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, may have a role to play as long as the commercial investment is structured in a way that supports economic growth and employment. The investment must be structured in a way that does not result in its being classified as expenditure on the Government's balance sheet under Government accounting rules. Otherwise, there would be a need for compensatory expenditure cuts to be made elsewhere. The key element is to get matching funds. With those, houses can be built off the Government's balance sheet and the money goes where we want it to, namely, more and improved social housing. The Government is focused on addressing social housing needs and I am informed that the ISIF is investigating how a suitable commercial investment in the sector could be structured. I hope this will go some way towards acknowledging the points made on all sides of the House. I assure Deputies that this element will form a key part of the debate on Committee and subsequent Stages. I will refer to some of the comments made during this debate, albeit not necessarily in the order in which they were made. Deputy Michael McGrath, who welcomed the legislation, raised the issue of the salary structure in the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA. Information on the NTMA's salary bands are publicly available and are published in the agency's annual report. There are significant advantages in the flexibility given to the NTMA. For example, it allowed the NTMA to recruit specialised staff to resource the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, quickly. This was essential in order to get NAMA up and running with the necessary speed. The key point is that information on the full range of salaries and staff numbers is available and published annually. Transparency is not an issue. The Deputy also asked about directed investments - public policy investments - in AIB and Bank of Ireland. Directed investments will remain under the direction of the Minister for Finance. When the time is right to sell them, the Minister can direct that the money be paid to the Exchequer or remain within the ISIF. The Deputy referred to how the legislation had been announced in March 2011. In anticipation of the Bill and as had been mentioned, the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF, has committed 20% of the value of the fund, amounting to €1.2 billion, to investments in small to medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, public private partnerships, PPPs, and Irish Water. We have not been standing still. NewERA has also been set up within the NTMA on a non-statutory basis and has been providing advice to the relevant Ministers. It is important that the Bill go through the proper due diligence and legal review process. However, that process has not impeded the NPRF in making investment commitments in Ireland. NewERA has made a valuable contribution since its establishment on a non-statutory basis. Some of the €500 million invested in the metering programme has created more than 1,000 jobs. The vast majority of the people in question were previously unemployed, are new entrants into the job market or are apprentices. Initially, 15% of those working in the programme were to come from these categories, but the actual figure is in excess of 80%. It is an advantage to people who do not otherwise have employment opportunities. Deputy Pearse Doherty stated that Sinn Féin would already have had the ISIF up and running. My points respond to that claim. In anticipation of the establishment of the ISIF, the NPRF has committed to a number of investments in Ireland, including infrastructure, water, long-term financing for SMEs - both credit and equity - and venture capital. The NPRF has already committed €1.2 billion. Included in these investments are €375 million to three new long-term funds, which will provide equity, credit and restructuring or recovery investment for Irish SMEs; a collaboration with Silicon Valley Bank that will lead to $100 million in new lending commitments to fast-growing Irish technology, life science, cleantech, private equity and venture capital businesses over five years; a fund of more than $100 million established with the China Investment Corporation, CIC, which will make minority equity investments in fast-growing technology companies in Ireland that have a substantial presence or strategic interest in China; a financing facility of €250 million to Irish Water; standby credit facilities for the delivery of two PPP projects, the N11 and schools bundle 3, with a combined project size of €286 million; a commitment of €250 million to the Irish Infrastructure Fund, a three-way partnership between the NPRF, AMP Capital and Irish Life; a commitment of €125 million to Innovation Fund Ireland, a Government initiative led by Enterprise Ireland and the NPRF to attract leading international venture capital fund managers to Ireland and increase the availability of capital to Irish early-stage and high-growth companies; and a commitment of €81 million to local venture capital funds. In addition, the NPRF has been working closely with NewERA in respect of investment opportunities in the areas of water, energy and broadband. I can place further details on the record in this regard. I acknowledge the serious developments raised by Deputy Deasy with regard to the high rate of unemployment in Waterford. Like others, I am deeply concerned, and it is not true to assert that the Government is not concerned about Waterford. I have knowledge of two specific matters in this regard. First, a national water service investment programme worth €1.77 billion was recently announced by the Minister, Deputy Hogan. Nineteen full A4 pages of projects, large and small, are being addressed. It is expected that between €25 million and €30 million will be spent on improving wastewater treatment facilities at a number of locations throughout County Waterford. This is more than the €20 million to be spent in my county. As such, it is not a political issue and, importantly, is being addressed across the country. Second, and as Deputy Naughten is aware, the significant issues of boil water notices and the capital programme for water service improvement in County Roscommon have been raised repeatedly in the House. They are being addressed by the Government in areas where previous Governments did nothing for the past ten years.I reject the point that we are not significantly investing in rural and other areas. Regarding broadband investment, the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, recently announced a broadband package for the entire country but particularly for the areas that would not otherwise get broadband provision from the private sector. Investment of €0.5 billion is going into the areas that do not have fibre broadband supplied to them. Those areas have been identified. I note in particular County Waterford. I will not read names of the areas into the record, but they have been published. It is untrue to say, therefore, that the Government does not have significant investment proposals for infrastructure in Waterford for both broadband and water. However, I acknowledge the issue regarding unemployment and the jobs that are under threat this very day. It is important to get our facts right in regard to this Government. One of the key questions asked was the reason this investment had to be commercial. Deputy Tóibín expressed disappointment that the ISIF has a commercial investment mandate. The key principle is that it will leverage its resources by acting as a cornerstone investor and attract third-party co-investment. The €6.9 billion will be matched with other investment, resulting in more economic activity and employment in Ireland that could not be achieved if the ISIF was the only investor at the table. A good example would be to consider the Irish investments the NPRF has already made; I spoke about the €1.2 billion earlier. That €1.2 billion becomes €2.4 billion because of the private funding obtained. The ISIF needs to earn a commercial return to be able to recycle its investments. As the investments mature, the money comes back in and we invest again. We are recycling. The ISIF is being established for the longer term with a view to investing in priority areas and attracting other third-party investors to those areas. While those areas will change over time, the ISIF will no longer be required in the old priority area if there is sufficient private sector capital at work, and that will make a difference. Everybody on all sides of the House acknowledges that this fund will make a difference. It was a question of the degree and the location, and the action that would be taken. We all acknowledge that things are changing. This money is now being invested in Ireland and it will have a significant influence on future job creation both nationally and regionally. I repeat that if there is a proposal to significantly invest in employment in a jointly funded operation, please God that will happen. Deputy Murphy raised the matter of providing for future pension costs. While the need for the State to provide for social welfare and public service pensions has not abated, fostering economic activity and employment is currently our greatest priority. The ISIF is expected to have a significant impact on economic growth. By helping the economy to grow we will be in a much better position to meet pension obligations in the long term. Deputy Murphy also spoke about the PPP arrangements that were in place for school bundling. In terms of the way the arrangement works, the Department of Education and Skills makes an annual payment, known as a unity payment, in return for the bundle of schools. The bundle of schools is built by a sponsor which, in turn, will require financing to fund the build cost. Private sector funders such as the EIB, domestic banks, international banks, the ISIF and the institutional investors provide that finance on commercial terms. In order to preserve the off-balance-sheet nature of PPPs, the ISIF can only provide a maximum of 50% of the finance. That means that the ISIF provides additionality to Government expenditure; therefore, compensating expenditure costs elsewhere to meet the EU fiscal rules do not arise. Deputy Deasy said he could not welcome the Bill because it did not ensure balanced regional distribution. I said it was a national fund with a national focus. It does not have a legislative regional focus. The fund's mandate is to make commercial investments, but there is an investment plan. The Minister has the opportunity to examine that plan, and if regional imbalances and other issues arise, I am sure they can be addressed. That question is better addressed not by having a provision in legislation but by being very much aware of the accountability of the fund, through this Oireachtas, with regard to all these issues. This fund will only succeed if everybody can benefit from it. If anybody has any proposals, we want to hear them regardless of where they live or the areas they represent. Examples of regional investment are schools, roads and water, which I mentioned earlier. Deputy Ross raised concerns about ISIF investment decisions and the commercial nature of the fund. It is a commercial fund. This fund will not invest in political pet projects, and the public assets entrusted to the fund will not be frittered away. The Secretaries General of the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform and the chief executive of the National Asset Management Agency are ex officio members of this board. That increases transparency, because they would not - nor would board members - be involved in political pet projects. This is very serious business. It has never been more serious for this country in terms of helping the economy recover. I have every confidence that the combined knowledge of the members of the board, the transparency and accountability regarding all these funds, and the reporting processes and procedures will ensure that the views of the cynics in this House will not prevail and that the credibility and integrity of the board, the appointments made and the officials involved will shine through. I have no doubt it will be successful. Another point that must be made is that no commercial body, bank or group of people would be investing in this country if it were not a commercial operation. All of those operations and business plans must be transparent and costed and must meet all the commercial criteria that apply. There is nothing but total clarity regarding the integrity of the process, and no bank, business or fund will risk an investment on a project that potentially is not commercial or is a fix, which is what seems to be implied. That will not happen. No Member on any side of this House would stand for that. I regret that people have that view, because the transparency, accountability and integrity of this process will shine as our projects succeed. The board of the agency will be appointed by the Minister but, as noted by Deputy Ross, the investment committee members - the people who will be discussing the investment processes - are not appointed by the Minister. Two of them must be members of the board, but the remainder are appointed by the board of the NTMA with the consent of the Minister for Finance. That makes it secure from any potential direct political appointment. I have every confidence that the commercial mandate of the ISIF will be measured by its ability to attract private sector co-investors. I should mention that the general scheme of this Bill was not presented to a departmental select committee for consideration and report thereon as required by Standing Order 123, which was adopted on 17 October 2013. This was in part because the Bill had been sent for drafting well before the Standing Order was introduced and because establishing NewERA on a statutory basis and reorienting the resources of the NPRF into the ISIF are key Government priorities. The Minister was also conscious that there have been some changes in approach following engagement with stakeholders and the Office of the Attorney General during the drafting process, and would wish to avoid suggestions of bad faith if the published Bill differed from the general scheme referred to the select committee beforehand.On foot of these considerations and, balancing the need to expedite passage of the Bill in view of its manifest importance to the Government's efforts to reinvigorate the economy against the demands of a very enlightened modernisation of the process for the development of legislation, the Minister reluctantly came to the view that it was more appropriate to proceed with this legislation without pre-legislative scrutiny. We have had a full Second Stage debate here and, as far as I am aware, there will be no restrictions on the Committee Stage debate.

#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	183	I will take up where I left off last night. For me, the three critical issues in this legislation are the capacity of general practitioners to take on the additional work, whether what is proposed will be at the expense of sick children and other people losing their medical cards, and whether additional infrastructure will be put in place. For example, in some locations public health nurses are not able to carry out routine developmental checks and other vital health checks which detect problems at an early stage because of the reduction in their number and the pressures on the service. Two years ago, €20 million was made available in the budget for the recruitment of additional speech and language therapists in locations that had been identified as being most under-represented. Not all of those positions have been filled. My constituency happened to be one of the worst areas in that a quarter of all vacant positions were in that area. That should not come as a surprise, given the demographics of Tallaght, west Wicklow and Kildare. It is critically important these posts are filled if we are to be able to provide services for people who have been identified as having needs, particularly children. While a child's need for speech and language therapy may be detected at an early stage, because they often have to wait up to two years for services, they start school without their needs having been met, at great cost in later life to the child. The Minister of State needs to explain who will bear the cost of this. The Daily Mail recently published a five- or six-page article on a family who are constituents of mine and whose situation I have been raising for the past six or eight months. I also assisted them last year in putting together an appeal. If the Minister of State has not read it, I can forward a copy of it to him. This family, after succeeding in getting a medical card that was valid for three years, was told nine months later that it was up for review. The family, in which there are four children, is under incredible pressure. The youngest child will qualify for a medical card but the person in the household who needs it most, who is six years old and has cerebral palsy, will not. It is not only GP visits that are at issue in this situation; it is access to occupational and speech therapy, repairs to the child's wheelchair and so on. The child is also PEG-fed. That is just one example.  In some cases, the withdrawal of medical cards does not even make economic sense. I know of a man in his mid-thirties who is working and has two children and a mortgage. He needs a medical card because he has kidney failure. He told me that if he had to choose between paying for his medication to keep himself well or paying his mortgage he would choose to pay his mortgage. If this man does not get his medication he will end up on dialysis and will perhaps lose his job. While this will result in great cost, financially, to the State, the cost for that man will be greater. In another case, a mother had to give up her job in order to care for her baby who had to be fed through a tube. If the provision of this service is at the expense of such people, I would find it hard to support it. I want an assurance that this is not being provided at their expense. General practitioners are of the view that patients who are well should not be used as ammunition to generate unnecessary health care activity when patients with higher needs are being routinely deprived of medical care. I believe it would be unethical of general practitioners to enable current Government policy, which is clearly aimed at political rather than health service gains. Although I understand that GPs are an interested group, it is important to listen to what they have to say. Some of what they are saying is very valid. I would not like to see a situation in which people have to make appointments and not see a GP for five or six days, thus putting pressure on acute hospital services. What would we be gaining? I have serious concerns about this legislation and look forward to hearing the Minister of State's response.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	184	I will take up where Deputy Murphy left off. I am in favour of universal access to health care. The repeated emphasis in the Minister of State's introductory speech and the Government's setting out of its vision to develop the health service is on the need for universality in access to health care. The removal of user fees from any group is to be welcomed. I believe that user fees for health services are unacceptable, obnoxious and wasteful. There are a myriad of reasons why we need to remove them but, as has been said by Deputy Murphy and generally over the past while, the perfectly understandable perception is that we are giving free GP care to the under-sixes at the expense of other groups of chronically ill, disabled or elderly people with serious medical needs. The perception is that this is the quid pro quo. That is unacceptable. The Minister of State will say that this is not the case and that additional money is being provided.We heard on Sean O'Rourke's show again this morning about the appalling and most impossible circumstances of families with severely disabled children who were being denied medical cards. It might have been related to the family to which Deputy Catherine Murphy referred. This week an elderly lady came to my clinic who could barely breathe. I could hear that she had an inability to breathe. She had a severe, chronic, permanent pulmonary condition and was wheezing constantly during our conversation. She informed me that her medical card had been withdrawn and that she had to reduce by half the medication she took, although she might literally collapse and die, of which she was fearful. She feared going up the stairs or going out for a walk. She could barely breathe, yet her medical card had been removed following a review. This is absolutely unacceptable. Understandably, people ask how the Government could possibly endanger the lives, health and welfare of severely sick, disabled and elderly people, while at the same time giving free access to health care to children whose families may well have sufficient resources to pay for it. As a supporter of universal access to health care, I do not accept the setting off of one against the other and do not want to go down that road. It is absolutely understandable people are asking what the hell the Government is doing when they see medical cards being taken from chronically sick and disabled people. It is difficult not to conclude it is a political stunt. I want to see universal access. We are not going to oppose this measure, but we are against the slashing of health budgets and what was referred to in euphemistic jargon, to cover over budgetary cuts, as "medical card probity". I love such phrases. In this case, probity means savage cuts affecting the disabled, the sick and the vulnerable. That is what probity turned out to be, as predicted by us when the measure was included in the budget. That is the current position. The Government must do something to ensure the two sides are not set against each other. Young children should have access to whatever health care they need. I applaud and concur completely with the idea that we need to move towards preventive health care and what is proposed is a step in that direction. If we ensure children are healthy from a young age and give them the access to the health care they need, it will pay off and pay dividends further down the line, but this cannot be achieved where the policy is set against the literal endangerment of the lives of some of the most vulnerable, the ill, the elderly and disabled people. That is appalling and unacceptable. Deputy Catherine Murphy's point is well worth underlining in the light of the example I gave of the lady who came to my clinic this week. Ultimately, there may be no savings, as the Deputy said. The lady who came to my clinic literally looked like she could collapse at any time. If she collapses, she will end up in an accident and emergency unit. This will cost more than it would if we were to give her the medication she needs by returning her medical card. What is occurring does not make sense and I seriously hope the Government will address that appalling set of circumstances. Everybody deserves health care when he or she needs it. We need to allow for universal access that is free at the point of need. Nothing is free in this world; it is always paid for, but it is a question of whether we pay in a fair way through central taxation. This is linked with ability to pay and is thus fair and progressive. It is critical that people receive the health care they need when they need it. Let me outline where I am critical of the particular model of universality in question. I have made the point on a number of occasions, including to the Minister, Deputy James Reilly, that linking universality with a plan to involve private health insurance companies is inappropriate. Putting the money into the pockets of private health insurance companies is sucking out resources that should be going into front-line services and contributing to the required staffing levels, health care, the recruitment of doctors and nurses, etc. I do not see why we need these companies or what value they add to the process. I have not heard any justification for their involvement in it. The examples of Holland and the United States were raised by us on a number of occasions. I refer to the so-called Dutch model and the US model. As I pointed out on a number of occasions, the United States spends more, proportionately, on health than any other country, but 40% of that expenditure is on administration linked with private health insurance companies. It is utter waste. The money is spent on advertising, billing and all that unnecessary crap, including paying the massive and inflated salaries of the top executives in the health insurance companies. Why do we need them? We do not. Why are they involved? They should not be. They are profiting from health care and the health needs of ordinary people. It is all the same, whether the money spent in this way is sucked out of the pockets of citizens through inflated health insurance costs or the public purse. They are equally bad. It is money down the drain and a complete waste. What we need is a national health service and free access to health care at all levels, from the cradle to the grave, provided by a public health service funded through central taxation. This would remove all the waste and the middleman who is sucking out the money. The Government needs to address the concerns of general practitioners. I am glad that there has been some agreement, but the case general practitioners made to us at the meeting in the Burlington was pretty scary. They were saying they were leaving; some had actually bought their tickets to go on the grounds that they were in an unsustainable position. Unless we get them on board, this will not work.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	185	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation and agree with its principle. The Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, probably has the most important job in the State at present in trying to develop the primary care sector. If he can achieve this, he will have done a service, probably for two generations to come, but it is a daunting task. The Bill is one small step in that direction. Like previous speakers, I must ask who is paying for this. It is sad that every second person coming through my door or contacting my constituency office is doing so about a medical card. This morning at 8.15 a.m. a general practitioner in my constituency rang me to apologise for the number of patients he had been referring to my office about medical cards.He explained to me the level of desperation he has in trying to deal with the volume of people coming in to him in situations where their medical card has been withdrawn and where he is trying to put the paperwork in place to justify the reinstatement of that medical card for people who are critically ill or have chronic diseases, and do not have the means to pay for their medication. The whole idea behind discretionary medical cards is that they are there to address undue hardship. As the Acting Chairman will know, down through the years we have done that, particularly in the area covered by the Western Health Board, which was one of the most of the difficult health boards to get a medical card from. However, if one actually presented a clear case to the appeals officer at that time, a discretionary medical card was issued. That no longer applies. The hardship is now being caused when applying for or trying to renew a medical card, or trying to appeal a decision which was wrong in the first place. What I have found in recent months since the whole issue of probity came to the fore is that we are now denying medical cards to people who are legitimately entitled to them, black and white, and not just with the discretionary medical cards. I had a belief this practice was happening in the PCRS but it was only when I came across a recent case that I could actually prove it. I have e-mailed the details to Mr. Paddy Burke and I am still awaiting a response from him. In this case, a 79 year old woman was informed at the end of April, on the renewal of her medical card by the PCRS, that she had lost her card because she was over the income threshold. Luckily, a relative who lives close by picked up the telephone and got through to the medical card section in Finglas. In fairness, the young woman at the other end of the telephone very politely went through the figures with her and it was realised that the Finglas section had made a mistake. The PCRS had calculated the woman's HSE widow's pension, which comes on a fortnightly basis as it does for every single HSE pensioner in the country, on a weekly basis. The PCRS staff member was very apologetic and said the PCRS had made a mistake and that the woman should not have had her medical card withdrawn. However, she then asked if the woman could submit an appeal and get her payslip from the Department of Social Protection along with the payslip from the HSE, and the PCRS would then rectify the matter. Of course, it takes three weeks for the data to go up on the computer systems in Finglas and it takes 15 working days to process the application that goes to Finglas. When nothing came back, I contacted Mr. Burke's office and pointed out that this woman would probably have to wait six weeks to get back a medical card to which she was entitled, in a situation where his staff made a mistake in regard to the calculation of her entitlement. Her relative contacted me yesterday, irate, to tell me she had received another letter from Finglas informing her that the payslip did not state that the pension was paid fortnightly by the HSE, and that the PCRS wanted a letter from the HSE stating this. When that went in, the PCRS would reinstate her medical card. Therefore, she will have to wait another three weeks before the case is looked at again. It is just not good enough that a 79 year old woman who is legitimately entitled to a medical card has to go through these loops to get a card. If there was such concern that she had all of this money under the mattress, could someone in the PCRS not pick up the telephone and call the paymasters in the HSE to ask whether its pensions are paid weekly, fortnightly or monthly, and issue the card to the poor woman? This is a renewal card. My understanding was that when it was a renewal, until a final decision was made on it, the person held onto that card. Of course, the decision to refuse was made on flawed mathematics and this woman has been denied her entitlement in the interim. In another case I am currently dealing with, a man who is undergoing cancer treatment returned his renewal application and the PCRS wrote back to him looking for additional documentation. He sent back that documentation but when he went to his GP earlier this week, the GP said, "Tom, I am afraid your medical card is no longer valid". Again, it was my understanding that, pending any decision on the cards, people would retain their entitlement until a decision was made. In another case I am dealing with, a young man with epilepsy has appealed a decision to the Ballyshannon office. Again, we are told that once an appeal is submitted, the medical card is reinstated temporarily until a decision is made. He had to go to one of the Dublin hospitals last week, and he was told he did not have a medical card and that he had no cover. He has to go back next week and he telephoned me yesterday in fear of what they are going to say to him when he goes back. In another case, a young man who is just over 16 years of age has been informed that if he does not respond within 21 days of the date of the letter regarding his application, the case will be closed. The real sting in the tail is that the letter to him states that a new medical card-GP visit card application form will have to be submitted with up-to-date documentation. If anything puts the fear of God in people, particularly sick people, it is having to fill out the form, gather up all the documentation and get it resubmitted to Finglas again, when it should be there on file in the first place. The reason this young man cannot send back the documentation is that he needs to have his parents' medical card reference number in order to have the application processed. The difficulty is that the PCRS has his parents' medical card suspended and they must wait for another six weeks before they will get a decision on that before he can respond. In the meantime, he will be told that, because it is outside the 21 days, he will have to go through the whole rigmarole again. We deal with the Department of Social Protection on a regular basis, and the target is that documentation has to be sent back within 21 days. It could be 22, 25, or 30 days, depending on the time it takes to get the documentation from the different agencies involved. However, I have yet to have a case where the Department of Social Protection came back to me to say it was rejecting an application because it was outside the 21 days, although if it an application is six or 12 months late it might legitimately dismiss it. The idea with the medical cards is to break people down and to create as much hardship as possible so they will abandon their application. The policy is to try to force people to throw in the towel, to surrender, to put up the white flag. That is what probity is about within the PCRS at the moment. I have another example in regard to documentation that was sent by e-mail from my office on 8 April last. On 14 May, the PCRS wrote back to the family looking for the same information. The family came to me wondering had I sent on the information, and I had the record that I had sent it. Nonetheless, I sent it on again to the PCRS, enclosing the original documentation, and still no decision has yet been made. We are told with great fanfare that the troika has left the country and we are back to our own devices. Yet, we find that the processing of these applications has been sent to Germany. Naturally, someone in another jurisdiction will look at the black and white situation regarding the rules of the medical cards, and say that a person is not entitled to a medical card based on the rules.Of course, as the Minister of State knows, based on the rules, nobody is entitled to a medical card in this country. The income limit for a single person is €184, and the social welfare rate is higher than that, so nobody is entitled to a medical card, if one looks at the rules that are set down there in black and white, because the rules have not been updated. The Minister of State should not look confused about that, because it would really scare me if he did not know the income limit for a medical card. I spoke to a postman at the weekend who told me that he dreads going out with the medical card review letters. The fact that older people are living in fear of getting that letter from Finglas telling them that their medical card is under review, even if they have only had it for a couple of months, is one of the reasons the Government got such a bashing during the recent elections. It is the threat of the withdrawal of that card that causes the fear. People who have lost their medical cards and cannot afford their medication are visiting GPs such as the one with whom I spoke this morning to ask them what tablets they really need to take and what medication they can put on the long finger, because they cannot afford to buy all of it. Another issue with which the Minister of State can deal very quickly is the lack of understanding of what is and is not covered by the medical card. People are coming to me who are afraid of having to pay for an outpatient appointment - which, of course, does not have to be paid for regardless of whether the person has a medical card. These are people who, based on the comments of Ministers, are legitimately and legally entitled to a medical card but who are denied that at the moment. Each of those cases involves a person who is entitled to a medical card pending a final decision or who is entitled to a medical card based on the figures he or she has submitted but who has not got it. I am not talking about discretionary medical cards. These are people who are entitled to medical cards, but they are being denied them. The other issue on which I wish to focus is that of children over the age of six who have a profound disability or illness. As the Minister of State knows, we have spoken about children with life-limiting conditions. I put a proposal to him that we create a national fund of about €8 million that could support home care for those children. These are children in palliative care situations who will never have the opportunity to vote for the Minister of State or for me because they will never see their 18th birthday. Some of those children are stuck in very expensive paediatric beds in hospitals in this city, costing approximately €150,000 per year. We cannot find the €24,000 or €25,000 that the Jack and Jill Foundation needs to keep them in their own homes or that the LauraLynn children's hospice needs to care for them in the hospice service, yet we have a fund of about €8 million that is spread across the country in respect of the various primary care units. If we could pool that nationally, it would be an effective budget. We are not talking about new or additional money to provide very valuable care for these children. We are talking about using the existing money more efficiently to deliver a service for some of the most vulnerable children in this country. I hope that in his response, the Minister of State can update me on the progress he has made on this issue, which has been on his desk for more than 12 months.  My next point relates to the Our Children's Health campaign. I met the people involved in that campaign earlier this week. The Minister of State knows their objective is to try to ensure there is an automatic entitlement to a medical card for children diagnosed with a serious illness or a congenital condition. We are giving automatic entitlement to every child under the age of six, yet we are told that we cannot legally grant automatic entitlement to people with particular conditions, which is, of course, wrong. This tripe is being given out to these parents who have seen what has gone on. There is a lack of understanding of the hurt caused to a parent when they get a letter asking them to prove that someone with a genetic disability such as Down's syndrome still has the condition. It is really hurtful to get a letter like that and it really drags any family down.  If we are talking about giving every fit and able child and every child with a disability under the age of six a medical card, we should review matters regarding sick children over the age of six. There is nothing worse than having a child with a long-term illness that requires parents to go in and out of hospital. They have enough on their plate in trying to meet hospital appointments without having to go through the rigmarole about which I spoke earlier. It hurts me when these parents come to me and I have to help them jump through the hoops to try to prove their entitlement to a medical card. Two of those parents met me this morning to speak about genetic illnesses. It is just not right that they have to go through the yard manure about which I spoke earlier. We wrote into law through the Health (Amendment) Act 1996 a provision giving women who had contracted hepatitis C from contaminated blood, due to a monumental mistake by agents of the State, a legal entitlement to a medical card based on a medical condition and regardless of means, so it is possible to do it. We are talking about a small handful of children and I will tell the Minister of State why it is just a small handful. There are about 56,000 discretionary medical cards in this country, and we are talking about the withdrawal of roughly 2,000 of those per year due to probity measures. The sort of money we are talking about is around €2 million, based on the average cost of a medical card. Of those who have discretionary medical cards, perhaps about 50% - probably fewer - are in respect of children, so we are talking about a very small cohort of children who would not automatically be entitled to a medical card or who would be entitled to a discretionary medical card once they have gone through all the hoops. Enshrining this entitlement in law would mean they would not have go through these hoops any more and would get a medical card by right. The Minister of State can set down in a statutory instrument exactly what those conditions are. He knows the implications of it, including financial implications. If we are considering introducing an entitlement for under-sixes, surely we should be looking at this for what is a saving to the Exchequer of about €2 million per annum. That is the sort of money we are talking about. It makes such a difference to those families. I will press this on Committee and Report Stages and I hope the Minister of State will examine it. I know he is one of the exceptions in the Government. When I met the families this week, I told them he is a Minister who thinks and listens to what goes on in this House. I know he will take this away and consider it. I hope that by the time this legislation is passed, he will still be dealing with it - or, possibly, he will be in a more senior position to deal with it.

I will be tabling an amendment. The provision is there and the precedent has been set. There is conditionality in respect of the hepatitis C issue, and in this case the condition could be that the person is under the age of 18. Parents should not have to go through the yard manure about which I have just spoken. I urge the Minister of State to deal with this mess.People who are legitimately entitled to medical cards are not getting them because the PCRS believes the only way it can make savings is to deny people who are legally entitled to medical cards.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	188	I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the debate. The Bill is relevant in the current climate, particularly in the context of the issue of discretionary medical cards and the horrific problems faced by sick and disabled children who are being hounded about their medical cards. Medical need must be the top priority, on which there can be no fudge. I call on the Government, in particular the Ministers for Health and Children and Youth Affairs, to act on this matter. It is a question of priorities and values. A society or state that does not look after the sick, the elderly or the disabled is going nowhere, but, above all, it is one without a heart. Let us deal, first, with the issue of sick children; second, look after the disabled; and, third, look after senior citizens. When we have dealt with these priorities, the Government can move on with its broader vision and reform plans and address the professionalism required in the health service. Anybody who says the opposite in this debate is not serious about providing a top class, quality health service, which is the objective of most Members. I agree with much of Deputy Denis Naughten's contribution. A consensus is emerging that we must provide a quality health service with universal access, which is professional, caring, humane and built on compassion. However, there is also the reality that it must be paid for. The legislation provides for free GP care for children aged under six years who are ordinarily resident in the State. The HSE will provide a choice of GPs for this purpose in so far as it is practicable to do so. Nobody disagrees with that principle; therefore, I welcome the legislation. A total of 240,000 new children will have access to this service. Before that happens, the Minister must consider the position of the minority of children who are very ill. They must be prioritised. The Government also has to put into practice all the talk uttered by its members about the rights of children, the children's rights referendum and putting children first. We must ask ourselves whether we are doing this. We are not putting sick children first and enough is not being done for children with an intellectual or a physical disability or children who grow up in families in crisis or who come from disadvantaged backgrounds. These issues need to be addressed in this legislation which deals with the health and future of children. I am annoyed when I consider the priorities that are sometimes accepted by the House. A classic example was yesterday's meeting of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, of which I am a member. We wanted a few clear answers on the issue of Garda whistleblowers and the Guerin report, but we could not get them. A number of inquiries are due to be held, some of which will cost approximately €2 million. This morning I was contacted by a group of parents from Darndale in my constituency who use an excellent preschool service that looks after 260 children and employs 100 staff. It is a beautiful example of a playschool that adopts best practice in dealing with vulnerable children and it works. I have been on site and met the children, parents and staff. However, they face a budgetary shortfall of €200,000. I raised the issue with the former Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and the newly appointed Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan. There seems to be money available for many other projects, but sometimes when it comes to children's issues, they are parked and we have to kick and scream and jump up and down about them. Again, it is a question of priorities and values. We need to support children with disabilities. Six months ago the Committee of Public Accounts investigated the disability sector in the context of the high wages being paid and the squandering of money. While that debate was ongoing, disability service providers were coming under pressure because of cutbacks of between 3% and 5%, but this was ignored. We need to face up to this issue. In budget 2014, €37 million was allocated to cover the cost of accessing free GP care under this legislation, which equates to €154 per each child who gains eligibility. The legislation also amends the existing legislation on appeals concerning eligibility for GP services. The programme for Government, in the extract dealing with primary care, states:Universal primary care will remove fees for GP care and will be introduced within this Government's term of office.The legislative basis for Universal Primary Care will be established under a Universal Primary Care Act.Universal Primary Care will be introduced in phases so additional doctors, nurses and other primary care professionals can be recruited.It is essential when introducing such changes that this be done in phases. The programme for Government also states:Access to primary care without fees will be extended in the first year to claimants of free drugs under the Long-Term Illness Scheme at a cost of €17 million...Access to care without fees will be extended to all in the final phase.Many of us support this philosophy in providing a quality health service. I stress, at the same time, that we must pay for it, which will mean additional costs and, therefore, increases in taxation. However, most realistic, sensible people say privately that if they were guaranteed a good quality health service, they would not mind paying an extra few bob for it. Fine Gael has looked to Holland and elsewhere for examples of best practice. However, the Government should examine universal health care systems that work in other countries such as Cuba. I have visited that country and its health service is amazing. The GP service is excellent when one considers Cuba is a poorer country than Ireland and being hammered by the United States through a trade embargo and sanctions. It is disgraceful that a small country such as Cuba is being hammered by the United States. They are located within kilometres of each other and people should sit down and resolve the issues involved, particularly when Cubans have a good quality primary health care system which we all could emulate. We have to be open and creative. Every society has its faults and extreme right-wing people will give out about Cuba, but that is their problem. The country has a quality health service that works and we should not be afraid to look at it. The Government states it wants to plan a quality health service with universal access based on equality and medical need. Those of us who support that principle want to see this happen. However, on occasion the Government parties are not prepared to stand up for it. The cuts to child benefit were an attack on children. Meanwhile prescription charges for medical card holders increased to €2.50 per item, while the rate of stamp duty on pension schemes for senior citizens increased to 0.75%.In addition, 35,000 medical cards were taken out of the system. Another disaster was the cut of the bereavement grant of €800. Maternity benefit was cut to €230 per week, which will cost mothers €832 this year. We must examine these issues as well if we are considering an overall health strategy and plan. It is important that we deal with these issues in the legislation. We talk about costs and GPs' private fees. The data on GP private fees are not routinely collected, but sources say that an informal check found that the fees in urban areas were approximately €50 to €55 and that they were slightly lower in rural areas. In 2009 an Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, research paper by Samantha Smith stated that private charges for GP visits ranged from €40 to €60 and that the charges varied according to GP and could be hard to predict in advance. The Competition Authority has highlighted the rising cost of doctor visits and its impact, stating that the cost of visiting a GP had risen rapidly in recent years, significantly outpacing the general rate of inflation in the economy. It said there were indications that a substantial number of private patients were delaying GP visits due to cost factors and shopping around for cheaper consultation fees. That is something we must examine. We met such people on the doorsteps during the local election campaign, people who said they were afraid to pay the extra few bob to go to the GP. They were outside the threshold. Health must be a priority. I missed the earlier part of the debate but I understand the issue with the GPs has been resolved. Is that correct?

#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	190	I welcome that. I had intended to raise their case because we have talked to the GPs and understand their situation. It is very difficult. We do not wish to lose high-quality people so we must ensure they are supported. We understand the costs they have in terms of administration and so forth. When I visit my GP, his clinic sometimes resembles the very busy clinic of a backbench Deputy. With so many people there is stress, and the staff are under pressure too. Under this scheme, approximately 240,000 children - that is, 57% of children under six - will gain entitlement to free GP care that they did not have previously. A total of 420,000 children aged five years and younger will be eligible under this scheme. Within that number, 181,000 - 43% - will retain the eligibility they currently have for GP care under a medical card or GP card. These figures reflect the number of children aged under six in the last census in 2011, which is 420,745. However, we will have to be prepared, because the Central Statistics Office, CSO, has projected that by 2014 the population of this age group will have increased to between 441,907 and 443,133, which suggests there will be a little over 20,000 more children aged under six years in the State than the figures quoted. We must be constantly vigilant about the numbers because we have a rapidly growing population. This is also having an impact in our primary schools, particularly on the junior infant classes. I mentioned the high cost of GP visits. Currently, GPs earn income by way of fees from their private patients, which are approximately 60% of the population, and providing services to public patients under the GMS scheme, which covers medical cards, GP visit cards and other free-at-the-point-of-use services such as immunisation and screening. The IMO has argued that the GMS scheme is designed to protect the poorest and most vulnerable in society and that it believes the integrity of the scheme is lost in this proposal. This was said in a debate that was held earlier. The Society of St. Vincent de Paul was also worried and said we must target people on low incomes and people with particular needs. That fits into the points I made earlier. We must ensure that the poorer and weaker sections of society are not forgotten in this broader debate. Another issue arose recently. I do not know if the Minister saw "The Saturday Night Show" with Brendan O'Connor which featured Declan Coyle and his family. His son Alex, whose medical card has been axed by the HSE, was brought into the studio. He requires a cocktail of syringes, feeding pumps, nappies and medication. All of his issues were related to us. We cannot allow situations such as these to arise. It should be about medical need, the rights of the children, protecting their health and supporting their families. Overall, I welcome the legislation. I will always support reforms that are sensible and I will always support a health service that is based on equality and respect for the citizens of this State. If we are serious about building a new republic, and there is cross-party consensus on this, people must accept that changes must be made. We cannot return to the ways of the past. We can use this opportunity of reorganising the country and the public finances to start afresh. Many other countries have done that in the past. There is no reason we cannot start to build from the mess of the banking crisis of the last number of years, the evolution of the international financial crisis and the rampant greed that was in our society for many years. We can all learn and make a start. We can start through small measures such as this legislative measure. That is one part of it, but we must also be very realistic and sensible. If every person in this State pays their few bob and their tax for the health service, they are entitled to a health service. Equally, there is the issue of those who work in the public service and the health service. The vast majority are doing a fantastic job, sometimes against the odds. However, we must ensure that standards and professionalism are always maintained, and there have been many cases in which families have been let down. All of us must constantly up our game. That is what public service is about. It is amazing that we are losing many good nurses and medical personnel. They train and go to college here - we spend millions on them every year - but then leave within two or three years. We must stop that brain drain, particularly in the medical services. Those young people are the future of the health service. Legislation such as this can assist young children, but it can also kick-start the fulfilment of a broader vision of a health service that looks after its patients and makes top-quality health care the priority.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	191	I thank the Deputies for their contributions on this Second Stage debate. The contributions were extremely thoughtful, not just on what is provided for in the Bill but also on the broader issue of medical cards, the awarding of medical cards and the allocation of resources generally. It has been a very good debate. The Government is committed to introducing, on a phased basis, a universal GP service without fees for the entire population within its term of office, as set out in the programme for Government and in the Future Health strategy framework. It has been decided to commence the roll-out of a universal GP service by providing all children under the age of six years with access to a GP service without fees. I emphasise, as Deputy McGrath and others fairly acknowledged, that this is just the first phase of a comprehensive project. Additional earmarked funding of €37 million was provided in budget 2014 to fund this first phase.It has been made very clear that this measure is not being funded on foot of savings implemented elsewhere in the health system. There are good reasons to provide universal access to GP care in view of the health needs of this particular age cohort. The early identification of health issues at a young age can mitigate or reduce the impact of ill health later in life. I am aware that Deputies have raised concerns regarding medical cards awarded on foot of the exercise of its discretion by the HSE. I will return to that issue before I conclude. The legislation's key features are the entitlement for all children aged five years and younger to a GP service without fees, the removal of the need for children aged five and under to have a medical card or GP visit card under the GMS scheme to qualify for the GP service, and a provision whereby the HSE may enter a contract with GPs for the provision of the GP service to children. The Bill further provides that the Minister may set the rate of fees payable to GPs for the service. As I stated on Second Stage yesterday, I was pleased to announce the conclusion of a framework agreement with the Irish Medical Organisation. The framework agreement sets out a process for engagement on the whole GMS GP contract and other publicly funded contracts involving GPs. The agreement has been reached following a series of discussions with the IMO by the HSE and the Department, led by myself. The framework agreement sets out an agreed process for engagement on all aspects of the GMS contract with GPs with due regard to the IMO's role as a representative body for medical practitioners and within the context of the provisions of the primary legislation to underpin the introduction of GP care free at the point of access. I look forward to a meaningful engagement with the IMO on the GP contract. I welcome the support expressed by Deputies in the House for the further strengthening of primary care services generally in Ireland. I acknowledge that endorsement has also been given by most if not all speakers to the introduction of universal access to the health system in place of the existing two-tier health system as soon as possible. Contrary to the concerns raised, for example, by Deputy Billy Kelleher, it is not expected that the Bill will have a dramatic impact on the capacity of the GP service in Ireland. We have done some modelling work on the impact which shows there will be some. It is an issue I look forward to discussing with the representatives of GPs in the course of our engagement on the new contract we now need. There has been a suggestion that the approach of discretion worked well in the past. While I acknowledge this, it is a fact that significant regional variations in the issuing of discretionary cards arose. For example, 24 cards per 1,000 persons were issued in Cork while four cards per 1,000 persons were issued in Meath. In the view of the ombudsman, the different treatment of persons depending on geographical location is improperly discriminatory, an undesirable administrative practice and contrary to fair or sound administration. I reject the suggestion that the number of discretionary medical cards was increased by 800 cards in April for what a Deputy described as "election purposes". The HSE has never ceased awarding medical cards through the exercise of discretion in accordance with the framework set out in the health legislation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Government is very aware of public concern about medical cards. The Cabinet sub-committee on health met this morning and decided to develop the policy framework governing eligibility in a manner which also takes account of medical conditions. The HSE will establish an expert panel to examine the range of conditions that should be brought into consideration. The process will include the development of a new legislative framework as necessary. In light of the decision, the HSE's director general will now suspend reviews of medical cards where discretion has been exercised to take account of medical circumstances. The Department of Health has also been mandated to develop a policy paper on the further roll-out of GP care free at the point of access in the context of the move to universal health insurance. The Minister for Health will present a memorandum for Government setting out the next steps in this regard. To return to the Bill, as all children aged five years and under will be covered by the new GP service under the Bill, children who have not yet attained the age of six will be removed from the existing GP service under the medical card scheme. It is important to be crystal clear that children aged under six who are currently entitled to a medical card will continue to qualify for a medical card and their entitlement to other health services, including prescription drugs, will not be affected. The Bill provides a framework whereby the HSE will be entitled to enter into a contract with any suitably qualified and vocationally trained GP for the provision of general practitioner services to all children aged five years and younger. The Minister for Health may, by regulation, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, fix the rate of fees and allowances to be paid to GPs for services provided under these contracts. The relevant section requires that the Minister in making a regulation for this purpose must engage in consultations and it prescribes the role of the Minister and HSE, the nature and manner of the consultations and the considerations to which the Minster must have regard in making regulations. The new framework agreement we have reached with the IMO will govern the basis of our engagement, consultation and negotiations with the representatives of GPs so that they are integrally involved in the planning, roll-out and necessary contractual arrangements needed to underpin this new service. I look forward to that real and meaningful engagement, as sought by the IMO, on all aspects of the contract. I thank Deputies for their contributions on the proposed legislation and commend the Bill to the House.

#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	194	I am grateful to the Office of the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter. I am also glad that the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Alex White, is here to take the debate. There are two lovely hotels in east Cork, which the Minister and Leas-Cheann Comhairle may visit at some stage. One is Garryvoe Hotel, which has invested €325,000 in energy savings. The hotel has told me it has data showing savings running to €130,000 per annum since it made the change. Rochestown Park Hotel did something similar. It looked at energy and has seen that it has also made huge savings of approximately €115,000 per annum following an investment of €240,000. In two years, they will have made the money back. I was approached a number of years ago by a contractor who was very concerned about what he saw as an opportunity being wasted to save energy in our hospitals. I put down a series of parliamentary questions and received a great deal of information back. The information demonstrates that if combined heat and power - or CHP - was used in our hospitals, massive savings would be possible. I have some figures that we have worked out. The 2012 energy bill at Cork University Hospital was €3.258 million. By making a number of changes, including moving to CHP or from oil to gas, and taking into account other efficiencies, some contractors say annual savings at that hospital could be of the order of €1.7 million. We have done the analysis for a lot of hospitals, including Merlin Park, Portiuncula, Mayo and Roscommon hospitals, and the savings come to approximately €5.5 million per annum. That is excluding the large hospitals in Dublin. That is a minimum saving. A great deal more is possible. Why is this not happening? I have been asking the question for quite a while. I have been told that all kinds of expensive consultants must be brought in and all kinds of reports produced. Yet, two hotels in Cork have been able to do it very easily. They brought in Bord Gáis and said "Tell us what we can do". I am told that there is a plant in Cork University Hospital which is not being used and needs to be upgraded. Why is that not happening? It is simply a matter of plugging one out and the other one in. We have just had a debate on expensive medical cards.This is money that could be saved very easily by switching over to gas. Many contracting firms have told me they are willing to do this for free and to share the savings over a number of years so there would be no capital outlay upfront. I cannot understand why a much greater effort is not being made to try to save this amount of money. Perhaps it is a relatively small amount but €10 million would go a long way to help the budgets of these hospitals. If the Minister of State had €1.7 million extra per annum for Cork University Hospital it would go a long way to provide services for patients. Will the Minister of State have this matter investigated and come back to me and the House soon to tell us whether I am right or wrong with these figures? Can this be achieved and if it can be achieved why is it not happening? Why are we not making it happen? We have many consultants and experts in every area but this could be done immediately. I am sure there are many more areas like this throughout the public sector where it could be achieved. I await the response of the Minister of State with interest.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	195	I thank Deputy Stanton for raising this important and interesting issue. The national energy efficiency action plan sets a public sector energy efficient target of a 33% reduction of energy usage to be achieved by 2020. The HSE is working to comply with the Government's green procurement guidelines, which require public bodies to ensure that a minimum building energy rating of B3 is achieved in all newly built and leased buildings from January 2012 and a minimum rating of A3 from January 2015. A national programme for installing a combined heat and power, CHP, plant was initiated in the mid-1990s. Given the advances in technology a number of these older plants have been removed. However, a number of CHP evaluation processes are under way. These include University Hospital Galway, St. Luke's General Hospital in Kilkenny and Cork University Hospital. The HSE policy on energy saving is guided by a number of programmes. In conjunction with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, the HSE runs the energy management action plan and has rolled it out on its larger campuses. It is also working with some of the major acute voluntary hospitals. The first stage of this programme is now completed. In conjunction with the OPW, the HSE is also implementing a monitoring and reporting programme. Three large administration campuses have been identified as pilot sites. The installation of monitoring equipment on these three campuses is now completed and the energy awareness programme is scheduled to commence in mid-June 2014. Discussions are also under way with a large acute hospital. These pilot programmes will identify energy saving projects which may include combined heat and power installations. The HSE is also participating in the national energy services framework which was published in December 2013 by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. It provides for public sector and commercial organisations, a standard and structured approach to support the efficient procurement and delivery of energy efficiency projects on the ground. In June 2013, the Minister with responsibility for energy announced the first tranche of exemplar energy efficiency projects to be supported by the SEAI under the Action Plan for Jobs. The HSE is committed to increasing its energy savings and is planning to deliver savings in future years and I have set out the broad context in which the HSE is approaching this important area. I note the specific issues raised by Deputy Stanton in respect of converting to combined heat and power plants. I bow to his superior knowledge which he clearly elaborated for the House this afternoon. Any innovative ideas a Deputy brings to the House deserve to be considered and examined. If there is further detail the Deputy wishes me or the Minister to look at in respect of this we will certainly do so.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	196	I thank the Minister of State for his response and ask him to look at some of the replies to parliamentary questions I have received over the past six months on this issue and the figures therein which are quite instructive. Perhaps the Minister of State could call the two hotels I mentioned and speak to the management there. I spoke to them today and they are delighted with it. With all due respect, the response I have received is exactly the same as the response I received last December, almost word for word. That was six months ago. If this had been acted on then the Minister of State would have €5 million more to spend. I have very little faith in this. I have come to the House as a last resort because I have been pushing this at various levels with the HSE and hospital management and getting no response whatsoever. I challenge the Minister of State to personally telephone the hospitals, find out what is going on, visit them and make it happen because we are wasting public money which could be saved and the Minister of State is responsible for this to the House. The speech the Minister of State read out was all very fine but it is fancy verbiage and does not mean much because nothing is happening. I have been raising this issue for quite a while at various levels and I am frustrated. The amount I mentioned as a potential saving is a minimum and a lot more could be achieved by making simple changes and bringing in serious contractors. Forget the fancy consultants; bring in serious contractors who are practical people and they will identify and make the changes in approximately one month. They have done it already in the private sector hotels I mentioned. I cannot see why it cannot be done in hospitals. There would also be huge savings in carbon emissions. The Rochestown Park Hotel has had a reduction of 33% in emissions which has resulted in a decrease of 77 tonnes of carbon and 278 fewer tonnes of carbon dioxide being emitted to the atmosphere, which is equivalent to removing 150 cars from the nation's roads each year. There are other benefits and it is not just about financial savings. I challenge the Minister of State, the Department and the HSE to get working on this. I want to see serious results soon.

If he has received the same response today as he did in December it is unfortunate. Let us see if there is any more detail we can get. I never have any difficulty in either telephoning or calling to hotels in any part of the country, particularly in east Cork, but I am not sure if it is necessarily the way we need to proceed although I would not exclude it. I will certainly speak to the director general of the HSE to see where we are on this issue.

I was prompted to do so after being contacted by staff and families of patients in the unit. That week the local press in Galway described the unit as being like a war zone. Last week a person in the Health and Safety Authority provided me with a copy of a letter sent to it on behalf of the staff in the unit. It makes for alarming reading and states the ongoing dangerously low staffing levels at the unit continue on a daily basis and on more than one occasion there has been no clinical nurse managers to manage the ward. One clinical nurse manager was recently assigned elsewhere in the community. Last week, there was a tragic situation when the absence of any security meant a patient was able to abscond from the ward and commit suicide. There was also a very near miss last week when a highly suicidal patient absconded from the ward and was found in the community inflicting self harm. The activities area in the unit was closed last week and remains so. This denies patients access to an area which is part of their holistic recovery plan. Risk assessments submitted to management appear to be ignored. Disclaimers submitted by staff outlining unacceptably short staffing levels also appear to be ignored.There appears to be no agreement on minimum staffing levels. Morale among the staff appears to be at an all-time low and there is an exceptionally high level of sick leave owing to stress in that location. The staff to whom I have spoken believe the above factors have been identified since the closure of St. Brigid's Hospital in Ballinasloe. They have been warning about this arrangement and pointed out that this has been an accident waiting to happen. I compliment the staff who have spoken out. Like the Garda whistleblowers, in the face of incredible pressure from senior management and the HSE, they have done a wonderful job in highlighting the consequences of the reconfiguration of the service.  This has happened as a direct result of the closure of the St. Brigid's psychiatric unit and the failure to fill key front-line posts in the region. Since last year some 40% of the posts provided for under A Vision for Change have not been filled under the HSE service plan. Without adequate mental health staff levels in University Hospital Galway and across the community, the unit is simply not fit for purpose. However, in this House earlier this year the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health services made a robust defence of the provision of that service. Is the Minister of State aware of the consequences of these cuts to mental health services in Galway? Is he aware that the House has been warned about them? We were unequivocally advised, however, that this would not happen. Is the Minister of State aware that there is a €3.2 million brand new, ligature-free facility lying idle in Ballinasloe? Despite this, service users in the psychiatric unit have no access to a recreational area, which inhibits them from securing better outcomes in their own recovery. I appeal to the Minister of State to urgently reconsider reinstating temporarily services at St. Brigid's Hospital in Ballinasloe which would allow us to deal with the overflow. Before I came to the House, staff informed me that they were gravely concerned about the prospect of an intake over the course of a bank holiday weekend in the light of the chronic staffing levels. I appeal to the Minister of State to consider positively the temporary opening of the brand new facility that lies idle in St. Brigid's Hospital in Ballinasloe to deal with the overflow of patients at University Hospital Galway.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	202	I am taking this important matter on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch. I thank the Deputy for raising it. The HSE is proceeding to modernise and reform mental health services across HSE West, including the Galway and Roscommon areas. A key factor in this reform was the recognition that the previous overall stock of 79 psychiatric beds across Galway and Roscommon was too high, based on the recommendations in A Vision for Change, allied with a corresponding underdevelopment of community-based mental health services. In this context, an implementation plan to reconfigure mental health services across the Galway and Roscommon administrative area was put in place, culminating in the closure of the psychiatric ward in St. Brigid's Hospital, Ballinasloe, and the transfer of beds from Ballinasloe on a phased basis to the existing acute psychiatric unit in University Hospital Galway. Since February, a bed capacity level of 45 psychiatric beds has been operational in University Hospital Galway. I have been informed by the HSE that at no time since February has this bed occupancy level been exceeded. The latest information from it is that there were ten vacant beds in the unit this morning. Therefore, there is no pressure on physical bed occupancy in University Hospital Galway. With the increase in bed capacity, the local HSE has also improved clinical governance, putting in place two assistant directors of nursing and two additional senior nurse managers. This is in addition to a range of new staff and services, including the redeployment of nurses from Ballinasloe. The HSE points out that the clinical director, together with the nurse managers, conduct daily assessments of staffing requirements to ensure a safe service at all times. Representatives of the Mental Health Commission also regularly visit the service. Staff in the acute unit at University Hospital Galway are confident that they can meet the needs of current inpatients and the needs of those referred for assessments. The HSE acknowledges the tragic death of a service user recently. This has been reported to the Mental Health Commission and internally in line with HSE protocols. An internal review is under way. My Department and the HSE are committed to quality in mental health services and patient safety and will continue to strive to ensure patients receive the best care possible when they need to access health and social care services. Improving the safety and quality of that care, be it mental health, acute care, services for older people and other areas, should be and will be our highest priority.
#ColmKeaveney	unknown-#ColmKeaveney-party	unknown-#ColmKeaveney-dob	unknown-#ColmKeaveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	203	This issue is not about bed capacity, despite the fact that 30% of the beds in the administrative area of Galway and Roscommon have been removed. The infrastructure has not been put in place for community-led multidisciplinary teams. Some 40% of posts in the community are unfilled. It is not, therefore, an issue of bed capacity but of not having the staff to deal with whatever capacity is available in the system today. It is an unsafe unit. A brand new €3.2 million facility in Ballinasloe has never even been opened and the appeal was to consider opening it temporarily. I do not know why the HSE is advising the Minister of State that there is no issue with bed capacity. We have previously received these guarantees from the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health services and they are not being honoured. In Galway in the past 12 days there have been 11 deaths by suicide. I do not know what the unit's discharge policy is, but the staffing levels are inconsistent with the HSE's advice. The Minister of State is not listening to those on the front line who are clearly stating there is an ongoing dangerously low staffing level in the unit. I have advised the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health services that she fails to listen to front-line staff. I am, therefore, asking the Minister of State to listen to front-line staff, not to some corporate individual in a pinstripe suit based in the HSE in Merlin Park who is talking to the Department about bed capacity. This is not an issue about bed capacity but about outcomes for patient-centred delivery of an acceptable mental health service.  This location is inappropriate and absolutely unacceptable. I ask the Minister of State to consider opening temporarily a modern public service, not some 1960s or 1970s decrepit unit. The HSE cannot even open up an amenities area that is central to the recovery of vulnerable patients. Staff have clearly stated the patients detained in the unit are not being detained by legal means because the detention does not meet the requirements of the Mental Treatment Act. The HSE has closed a holistic environment where there is supposed to be socialisation and engagement with other service users. The unit is inappropriate and I am asking the Minister of State to open temporarily the facility in Ballinasloe that lies idle.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	204	I do not propose to add very much to what I said in my initial response. From what I have been told, I understand there was a visit last Thursday by the Health and Safety Authority of relevance to this issue. A meeting between the HSA and senior management took place on Friday and some immediate issues were addressed, including updating certain policies. It was agreed that the HSE would submit a full action plan to address outstanding issues and that there would be intensive consultation between staff and management. There has been and will continue to be intensive consultation between staff and management, which has been ongoing since last week, to complete the action plan. It was anticipated that the completed action plan would issue to the HSA today. I understand it includes the recruitment of additional nursing staff to eliminate the requirement for agency staff. I will certainly communicate the issues the Deputy has raised to the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who is aware of the issues he has raised and has dealt with them in the House previously.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	205	I appreciate that this issue does not relate to the Department of the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, but I decided it was important to highlight it, even without a Minister from the Department of Education and Skills being present because of the urgency attached to it. As people know, the wind-down of All Hallows College started last week and the 30 day consultation period has commenced. There was a meeting of the students in the college last night. As of now, there are no answers forthcoming and they have been informed that they will not be getting any from the board of trustees until Friday at the earliest, which is a major cause for concern. All Hallows is a unique educational facility. Many of my former colleagues at the airport who worked for SR Technics pursued courses there when that company closed and European funding was made available. The college is a centre of excellence for mature students and its ethos is one of liberation through education. All Hallows looks at things differently and develops different types of programmes. Its closure would represent a tragic loss to the education system. There are two problems which arise. At present, there are approximately 460 students studying at All Hallows and some 150 of them are pursuing the adult learning BA, ALBA, for personal and professional development. A number are due to graduate imminently and are, as a result, fairly much in the clear. The college will not be enrolling any further students but it estimates that it would take three to four years for existing students to complete their studies. Given that it is a private college, All Hallows does not fall under the terms of the relevant legislation but the authorities there have stated that they will assist students in completing their studies. As yet, there has been no indication of how this might be achieved. All Hallows is connected to DCU, St. Patrick's College of Education and the Mater Dei Institute under a linkage agreement, a copy of which I would like, if possible, to see. There are students at the college who want to continue their studies and who, in many instances, have paid thousands of euro towards their education. A large number of them are mature students. Their tutors and mentors at the college want to continue to facilitate the provision of adult education. What they need is another institutional setting in which to do so and for the Department of Education and Skills to do what it can to assist the process in this regard. Many of the college's degree and other programmes are facilitated by DCU, St. Patrick's College of Education and the Mater Dei Institute. We must be creative in terms of how we deal with that fact. The ALBA programme is extremely important for mature students. I know someone who is studying at All Hallows and who had wanted to apply to pursue a masters degree in community development and voluntary work. The college offers some excellent programmes in that regard. Aontas has recommended that the ALBA programme, which is only available at All Hallows, should be rolled out across all third level institutions nationally. Prior learning is recognised under ALBA and the strands relating to it include adult education, human development and arts and ideas. It also includes a professional focus strand which emphasises areas such as community development, etc. If the Department does not intervene to save the programme, it will be lost forever. Students were informed last night that they cannot transfer anywhere else as a result of the uniqueness of the ALBA programme. The Department of Education and Skills must address this matter. Has it given any consideration to what it might do to help students who are currently studying at All Hallows? Has it considered how it might protect the type of educational programmes to which I refer and which have a great deal to offer both our economy and society?
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	206	I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, and I thank Deputy Clare Daly for raising it. The Department of Education and Skills was informed by All Hallows College of its intention to wind down its operations. The President of the college indicated to the Department that its closure will be handled in an orderly manner. As the Deputy will be aware, All Hallows is a private college that specialises, inter alia, in the teaching of theology, philosophy, psychology and English literature. A linkage agreement has, as the Deputy noted, been in place between DCU and All Hallows since 2008. As a result of this agreement, All Hallows College became a college of DCU and all degrees are validated and accredited by the latter. The college is not an approved institution under the Higher Education Authority and it does not receive core funding from the Department. However, three full-time undergraduate courses in the college are approved under the Department's free fees initiative. Under the latter, the Exchequer meets the cost of tuition fees in respect of eligible students on approved full-time courses. In the case of All Hallows, the Department refunds the cost of tuition fees up to a limit of 130 students on the three approved courses. The college was paid some €440,000 for the 2013-14 academic year in respect of 119 eligible students who attended the courses to which I refer for the full year. A wide-ranging reform programme of the higher education system is being implemented. This arises on foot of the modernisation framework contained in the national strategy for higher education to the year 2030. The latter recommends that continuing funding support for institutions such as All Hallows, which receive limited public funding for specific programmes, should be a matter for the Higher Education Authority and subject to ongoing review in the context of quality outcomes, overall demand and available provision within relevant regional clusters. In May 2013 the Minister set out his response to the Higher Education Authority's advice on future system configuration and confirmed the approach recommended. In its consideration of the limited free fees funding allocated to All Hallows, the Higher Education Authority concluded that existing provision should be continued.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	207	A couple of issues arise. The college has developed and moved on from the theological base on which it was founded. Its current ethos is very much based on social justice and community. As already stated, it has a particular focus on mature students who want a second chance at education. On foot of its ethos, it has certainly inspired people to undertake voluntary and community work. It is quite important, therefore, that it should be saved. As the Minister of State indicated, the problem which arises in this regard relates to money. All Hallows is a private college but, as he also indicated, the State pays it some money on the basis of the number of students pursuing particular courses. However, this money is capped. If the cap were lifted, that might assist in alleviating the situation. One of the solutions being discussed relates to the fact that DCU has decided to accept a different combination of subjects in respect of the relevant courses and this would help in attracting more students. I do not wish to be disrespectful but dropping many of the theology combinations and focusing more on the other programmes might be the way forward. DCU has agreed that this would, in fact, attract more students. The difficulty is that the Department must lift the cap to which I refer. It must be accepted that All Hallows is a fine educational facility on the northside of Dublin. The premises in which it is located is extremely impressive and it would be tragic if it was lost to the education sector. The college has relied on philanthropy to survive and is existing on the basis of endowment funds, which are being depleted, and some fees. It sold some land a number of years ago in order to fund its operations. Could the State not intervene and negotiate with the authorities at the college in order to try to preserve it as an educational facility? We know, on the basis of population projections, that we are going to require more such facilities in the future. I accept that this matter is not relevant to the Minister of State's Department but I request that he impress on the Minister for Education and Skills the need for an intervention in respect of it. A further meeting of the ALBA students is due to take place tonight. Most of the latter are mature students and they are extremely concerned. The Government could, without breaking the bank, secure what is a fine educational establishment. If it lifted the cap in respect of the courses to which I referred earlier, the number of students would increase and this would be enough to keep All Hallows going. The college estimates that it would require €2 million in order to get through the next academic year. That is not a huge amount and most of the students who attend the college pay fees. As stated earlier, many of them are former colleagues of mine at Dublin airport. All Hallows provides a fine service. I appeal to the Minister for Education and Skills to link up with the authorities there in order to discover what might be done in the context of securing its future for both current and prospective students.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	208	As the Deputy acknowledged, All Hallows is a private college. It is a fine institution and the Deputy did a great job describing it. I know All Hallows and its history very well because I grew up just a stone's throw from it. Everything the Deputy said about it, its history and its contribution to education is absolutely correct. As I noted earlier, the Department provides the college with specific funding under the free fees initiative in respect of a small cohort of the student population. I am not sure whether I fully grasp the point the Deputy made in the context of the relationship with DCU and the cap in respect of All Hallows. I understand the point about the cap but I must point out that it was not reached in any of the past three years.The cap on numbers in respect of which the free fees would be reimbursed was 130 in 2013-14 and 119 students availed of it. The cap has been 130 for the past three years and the numbers who availed of the scheme were 119 in 2013-14, 121 in 2012-13 and 103 in 2011-12 while the number was 112 in 2010-11 when the cap was 136. The Deputy may have been making a point in respect of a possible connection with DCU.

#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-05-29 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	210	I understand that point now, I did not grasp it earlier. Certainly, I will communicate that to the Minister for Education and Skills. The Deputy raises what is absolutely a fair point in that respect. I have no wish to speak directly on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills but the Minister must operate in respect of the future planning and configuration of higher education on the basis of a rational plan from the Higher Education Authority that covers the configuration of need and course mix throughout the third level sector. He received this advice last year and he is proceeding on that basis. It is difficult for any individual college or an individual request to depart from the overall global plan the Minister must observe. I will certainly communicate what the Deputy has said to the Minister, Deputy Quinn. It is clearly a difficult time for the staff and students involved in the college. In the first instance everyone's thoughts are with them. It is a very human situation. These people are facing the closure of an institution. The same would apply to any third level institution. I hope and expect that the interests of students are kept to the fore of the arrangements being undertaken by the college. The Department has welcomed the fact that the college intends to wind down on a phased basis to facilitate, as far as possible, the completion of students' studies. Meanwhile, I undertake to communicate to the Minister the issues the Deputy has raised in this context.
