I thank the ushers and cleaning and catering staff for their extraordinary work in these extraordinary times. I also thank the Clerk, Mr. Martin Groves, and Ms Bridget Doody, who do extraordinary work behind the scenes in the Seanad office, getting all amendments, legislation and other business ready each morning. I know the process now as I see it from my new position and it goes late into the night. Senator Paddy Burke knows this from his time in the Chair. I also thank the Ceann Comhairle for the use of this historic Chamber. It is a mark of how extraordinary are these times when the Seanad is sitting in the Dáil Chamber. I hope that over the next few weeks Members will get a break from work and have some time to spend with family and friends. I look forward to seeing everybody again in September.

With late sittings and the new positions in which we find ourselves, they have done a tremendous job. I wish everyone well for the recess and I hope everyone gets a nice break here in Ireland. Perhaps they might come to Galway West and Connemara if they so wish, or to all of Galway, including Ballinasloe.

I hope we will not be still here at 2.40 a.m. tomorrow. I thank all the staff for facilitating us and the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to use the Chamber. It has been a particular honour and I have now sat in this Chamber as a Senator for more days than I did as a Deputy. This is the final day before the summer recess and although the Houses will not sit, there are cheap headlines coming from certain journalists that seem to suggest Members of the Oireachtas are going on six weeks of holidays. It is incumbent on the Houses of the Oireachtas press office to address this. Members will take a break.I hope everyone enjoys it and spends time in Ireland. I will be taking a few days in Galway. I hope the Deputy Leader will come to Wexford. The idea that Members do not work when the Houses are not sitting is misinformed and nonsense. People here will be working on policy, meeting with different groups and dealing with individual representations. I ask that the Houses of the Oireachtas look at addressing some of those misleading headlines. We will not be sitting in August but it was in August 1970 that the Social Democratic and Labour Party was formed. The men and women involved in those early days consistently advocated policies that, through peaceful means, supported engagement, conciliation, social justice, the unity of this island and Ireland playing a constructive role within the European Union. Leaders such as Gerry Fitt, Seamus Mallon, Austin Currie and Bríd Rodgers charted a difficult course but it was the position advocated by the SDLP that ultimately underpinned the peace process. The SDLP was, of course, led by John Hume for a long time. I consider him the greatest living Irish person. His actions more than anyone else's led to the peace process that shapes Ireland's future. In that regard, I am sure the Deputy Leader and other Members of the House will join with me in wishing the current leader of the SDLP, Colm Eastwood, and its members a very happy 50th birthday and in thanking that party for the enormous contribution it has made in shaping the future of this island.

Today we deal with very important legislation, the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Bill 2020. Let us hope we do not have a reoccurrence of what happened in the Lower House yesterday. I appeal to all democrats to support open, healthy discussion. As a revising chamber, it is our job to revise legislation and to look at all amendments and to give them serious consideration. It should be remembered that it was not too long ago that half of the Government were on the opposite benches in the Dáil, hurling all sorts of political accusations at the other party for its failures in the areas of housing, healthcare and disabilities. I could go on listing a raft of things. They should not forget where they came from. They are in government for the moment but who is to say that they will not be back on the hustings in six months' time arguing a different story? It is important to respect both sides. I respect the Government as it has a democratic mandate but those of us on this side of the House also have a mandate and we should be facilitated in scrutinising legislation. The last Taoiseach, now Tánaiste, came to this House and stressed the importance of this Chamber, the Seanad, as the revising chamber of these Houses. That is important. As we wind down for the summer recess, it is important to look at a few things. We have had a hectic time as politicians but also as people and citizens of this country. We have had a general election and a Seanad election. We had a major crisis in healthcare, which has not gone away. We have a crisis in housing and our economy is flat on the ground and needs help. Brexit lies ahead of us. There has been Covid-19 and the associated forced closure of essential services. We should think of the disabled people, those who were locked in their homes and those who could not say goodbye to their husbands, partners and loved ones because of Covid. None of us caused this but these are tough, harsh times. I have no doubt they will get harder in the future. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to Deputy Varadkar, who led the outgoing Government, for his steady, sure hand with regard to Covid. That has to be acknowledged. He was professional and steady, as were all involved. I also acknowledge the work of Fianna Fáil with regard to the confidence and supply agreement which allowed all that to happen. We saw good co-operation. Co-operation is key. Above all else, I thank the community call, the people in every one of the 31 local authorities who enlisted volunteers. That was important. Finally, I thank the Oireachtas team, particularly Martin Groves, Bridget Doody and their team. I also thank the ushers, the caterers, the attendants and all of the people who make these Houses, the family of the Oireachtas, work as well as it does. I thank them because it is important to do so. As I leave for the summer recess, I plead for Members to respect and support one another in this Parliament. I ask that we give legitimacy to criticism and scrutiny of legislation. I ask Members over the summer to think about pledging not to facilitate or acquiesce to the guillotining of legislation or the ramming through of every stage of a Bill in one day. That is not good for democracy. For the sake of the people of this country, we should not do it. Let us think about that before going away and let us come back with vigour and a commitment not to acquiesce to that type of abuse of the democratic process.

I understand the court has found that the national climate change mitigation plan falls well short of the level of specificity required to comply with the law. This is a very serious finding and we need a debate on the matter urgently after the recess. I also wish to raise the very serious matter of the proposed closure of a nursing home, St. Mary's Centre, Telford, on Merrion Road in Dublin 4. I have spoken with some of those involved in the campaign to save this home. They are very concerned about the impact the proposed closure will have on the residents. This is a healthcare facility which provides care to women with visual impairments and other care needs. Many of the residents have lived in the centre for many decades. To move them at this point would be extremely traumatic. The centre is run under the auspices of the Sisters of Charity. It comprises a registered nursing home and a registered disability centre. The staff and residents were informed of the proposed closure in a relatively perfunctory way in June and July. There have been some newspaper reports about it and the matter is now due before the courts in August.  The directors say it is sought to liquidate the company which operates the centre. Liquidators were appointed by the High Court on 24 July. There are real concerns about the impact this proposed closure will have on the residents and staff. This nursing home has remained free of the virus throughout the Covid-19 pandemic. There is no immediate concern about it. It has very positive reports from HIQA. I ask that the Minister for Health be brought to the House. I have already written to him to ask him to come to the House, to meet with residents and staff to hear their concerns, and to bring the home under public management to ensure it remains open for those who desperately need its services. I was wary of wading into the debate on the removal of the statues outside the Shelbourne Hotel given how much somewhat unwarranted outrage has been expressed. Some useful commentary has been offered in a thoughtful way. It suggests that, when we look at works of art, we have to remember the context and how they may be interpreted. Statues of this sort fit in with the tradition of portraying women, and particularly African women, in a way we would now find rather problematic. We should recall that one woman's ankle bracelet may well be another woman's manacle. It is in that context I believe the Shelbourne Hotel may have acted to remove the statues. I express my thanks and that of the Labour group to the staff of the Cathaoirleach, his office and the Leader's office for all of the work they have done in running the House during this difficult time. I wish everyone well in the break ahead.

I hope all of us will join together in recognising the value of the people who enable us to work in the way we do and in thanking them and in wishing them well in the weeks ahead. I raise the issue of Debenhams. This is day 111 of the strike by members of staff of Debenhams who are members of Mandate and SIPTU. They have spent 16 weeks on the picket line. It is a 24-hour-a-day picket line. It has to be because two days ago, at 3 a.m., the liquidators entered the Limerick store. They are trying to access the stock, which is worth millions. This money must form part of a settlement for the workers.I want to send a message to KPMG that it would be entirely unacceptable for it to try to interfere in any way with that stock until such time as a settlement has been made. Government officials have met the workers from Mandate. That is important because the Government has a role to play. Four years ago, after the debacle at Clerys, the Duffy-Cahill report was published. That report outlined a set of measures which must be taken to protect workers and prevent tactical insolvencies. The reality is that Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have sat back and let that report gather dust for the past four years. We have spent the past couple of weeks passing emergency legislation, much of which is necessary, but why is it that we never pass emergency legislation relating to working class people and workers' rights? Why has that report been left to gather dust for the past four years? I want to send the clear message that this dispute must be resolved before we come back in September. It would be unthinkable that those workers would have to spend another six weeks manning a picket line 24 hours a day because of the negligence of previous Governments. There is a role for the Government to play and I call on it to play that role and ensure a just settlement for those workers. I will briefly mention the situation at Shannon Group and key sites in Limerick, such as King John's Castle and Bunratty Castle, because those sites may have been closed by the time the Seanad resumes. It is fair to say that everyone in this Chamber knows that is unacceptable and that there must be an intervention by the Government. If that intervention has not been made by the time we come back in September, the clamour for action will be loud and clear, day in and day out. We must do better by the workers at those key sites and the people of Limerick and Clare.

As a legislator, I am aware of the serious concerns relating to Galway 2020, the company that was established to deliver the programme of events. It was revealed at a Galway City Council meeting last week that in excess of €18 million has been spent despite no major events having taken place. That money was provided by the Government and the EU. In spite of the fact that no events took place, €18 million of a possible €19 million has been spent. I share the concerns of my colleagues on Galway City Council at the level of spending in light of the cancellation of all events. The Government is due to provide an additional €5 million in funding in the coming weeks for a revised programme of events. Questions must be asked because this is taxpayers' money. There is a duty on all public representatives, including everybody in this House and in Dáil Éireann, to ensure that public money is spent appropriately and in accordance with the regulated guidelines. I am asking the Deputy Leader to contact the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to ensure that the appropriate measures relating to funding are outlined. If an audit is required and I believe it is at this stage - it should be pursued via the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.

They have done a tremendous job over the years, particularly in the past number of months which have been very difficult for everybody. This Chamber has been our fourth home in the past 12 months. We have been in the temporary Seanad Chamber, the restored Seanad Chamber, the Convention Centre Dublin and now we are here in the Dáil Chamber. The staff are due great credit for having everything running smoothly even though we have been all over the place for the past 12 months. I would like to suggest an issue into which the Cathaoirleach might look. We spent a considerable amount of money, through the Office of Public Works, OPW, to bring the temporary Seanad Chamber, owned by the National Museum of Ireland, up to a high standard for sittings of the House for two and a half years. That Chamber should be used again by the Oireachtas for committee meetings. There will be a lot of pressure in the context of meeting rooms when we return in September because joint committees will be up and running and we will need that space. I remember at that time the former head of the National Museum of Ireland, Dr. Pat Wallace, said that the staff of the museum cried when that space was given to the Seanad. We spent a considerable amount of money on it and I would hope that we would be able to use it in the future. There will be a need for it, and I ask the Cathaoirleach to investigate the possibility of using that room for committee meetings or sittings of the Seanad in the future.

I have had a bumpier ride since I came in here a few weeks ago. The cervical cancer crisis overseen by the previous Government continues. It has been compounded by the recent tragic death of Ruth Morrissey. Cervical checks are due to restart soon but breast and bowel cancer screening will not resume until September. The people of Ireland did not stop getting sick during the slowdown in the provision of general healthcare. In that context, I am calling on the Government to do better. A recent HIQA report shows that almost 60% of nursing homes inspected after Covid-19 may have had more severe outbreaks because of weak governance and management. What action has the Government taken to improve the governance and management? I am calling on the Government to do better. It is sad to see that it took action from our Senators yesterday to deliver an answer for those living in direct provision in the Skellig Star Hotel. I am calling on the Government to do better for those in direct provision. The Government is miles away from where it ought to be on other issues. The fiasco surrounding data protection for citizens of our State is nothing short of criminal. If it is not alleged Garda leaks to media sources or gangland criminals, it is data collected when people leave the State. The Government must do better. Towns and villages have been touched by the closure of businesses and loss of jobs as a result of Covid-19. Cities and towns continue to suffer because of flooding and I think particularly about Kenmare in that regard. I am asking the Government to do better. It is all very well coming into this House day after day but, ultimately, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party hold the power to effect change. I am trusting that there is more than enough talent and capability among those parties to take on these challenges and I am holding them accountable. The Oireachtas is heading into summer recess and I can only hope that the rest will replenish the spirits of the members of the Government so that it can return with a different attitude. The people of Ireland demand and deserve more. We are watching the Government and I ask it to do better. I also thank the staff who have shown amazing kindness to me since I came into this House in April. I appreciate that and thank them for making me feel welcome.

That request has been made by a number of other Senators in order to discuss social and affordable housing and the homeless crisis. The issue I wish to raise comprises two interconnected aspects.One of these relates to the county development plan process, which every county council is undergoing, and the impact the national planning framework and the regional plans are having on our councillors. I raised the very unfair distribution of population figures several times at committee hearings. We are now asking councillors to make very tough decisions. The role of Irish Water is connected to that. It is a chicken-and-egg situation. We cannot have sustainable development without infrastructure. I raised this issue at committee level. Irish Water is not answerable to this House at all, which is a complete and utter failure. That needs to be addressed. The State writes Irish Water a check for €750 million per year. There is no accountability in that regard. We have talked about regional development and sustainable development. Irish Water has no interest in the development of small towns and villages because there is no profit in it. My proposal at the time was to ring-fence a percentage of that €750 million for the development of small towns and rural villages. A 10% share would give us €75 million a year to invest in small towns and rural villages to allow them to sustain themselves in future. It is even more important now with the advent of Covid-19. We can develop spaces that will allow people to work in their towns rather than coming up to Dublin. While Senator Byrne has probably sat in the Dáil Chamber as a Senator for longer than I did as a Deputy, I did not think I would be sitting here again so soon. It is disappointing that I have not yet had the opportunity to sit in the Seanad Chamber. I thank all the staff for making everything possible today and I hope they enjoy their summer recess.

I am very new, so this is a wonderful experience. It is wonderful to be in the Dáil Chamber and to see the sunshine coming in from outside. We do not see it on television, but it shines very beautifully on the ceiling. It provides haloes for all the angels here in the Chamber. I would like to discuss the stay-and-spend initiative. We have talked about it so much, but August is about to begin. For people who are thinking of taking a staycation, I wish to highlight again how wonderful it is to travel all around the country. I particularly wish to highlight that Ballinasloe is the newest town in Ireland. We have a new streetscape and all the businesses will be painting their shop-fronts. That is one example of the amazing towns around Ireland that we sometimes miss because we are speeding from A to B on motorways. People should remember that there is a lot to see and experience and a lot of great people to meet on adventures in Ireland. I wish everyone going on holidays in Ireland a wonderful time. I encourage them to holiday safely, which is really important, especially this bank holiday weekend. In regard to the schools we have just mentioned, I note that Scoil an Chroí Naofa in Ballinasloe is fighting very hard to ensure that people with special needs can be safely integrated into the mainstream classes. I wish everyone well for the summer and I look forward to engaging in robust and constructive debate in September.

It runs all the way from the Liffey, at Spencer Dock in my constituency, to Longford, a distance of almost 150 km. During the pandemic it has been an amazing amenity for the people of the north inner city, providing a space for walking, cycling and picnicking. It has taken more than ten years, but today will see the official opening of a section of the Royal Canal running from Sheriff Street to the North Strand. It is a relatively small stretch of the canal. When I brought this up with the city council more than ten years ago, I was told it was not city council land. It was owned by CIÉ and Waterways Ireland. Several State bodies would have to be involved. They all engaged and worked together. It is a great tribute to the public servants, designers, architects, engineers, construction workers and city council officials who have opened up that part of the Royal Canal. It is now a premium cycle route and walkway for everybody to enjoy free of charge. I would like to ask the Leader to talk to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport about the next steps for the Royal Canal premium cycle route, of which this was phase 2. I would like to see phases 3 and 4 accelerated, extending the cycle route to Cross Guns Bridge in Phibsborough and from there all the way to Ashtown. It is a really well-used part of the city. It is a safe off-road cycle route running all the way from the M50 to the Irish Financial Services Centre. It is the type of public space in which we should invest for the enjoyment of everybody, either as an amenity or as a means of transport. I would also like to thank everyone in the House, particularly the staff, who have been incredibly accommodating and supportive since I was appointed. To the Senators of all parties and none, I would like to say that it has taken me more than 16 years to get to this House. I have worked with public representatives of all parties and none. It is not my intention to waste my time or that of other Members. I will work with all Senators. We are coming through a pandemic. In the case taken by Friends of the Irish Environment that was decided today it took the courts to confirm to the world that our State is failing on climate action. We are also in the midst of a housing crisis. I will work with all Senators. However, when a vote is called on cleaning the Chamber I have to doubt their bona fides. Let us put yesterday's incident behind us and move forward. I hope Members enjoy the recess.

They have shown great kindness and have made me feel very welcome, as have many people in this Chamber. I hope everyone working here also gets a wonderful break. The Boyne valley is less than an hour away, so they might zip up there and have a look-see. I would like to take a moment to refer to the controversy that raged this week in respect of a Tampax ad. I will not weigh in on the quality or merits of the ad. All sorts of ads are ill-advised, but we do not take them off the air. As a nation we need to get over the hysteria, a word I use deliberately, that arises whenever we get down to the nitty-gritty of bodies and bodily functions. The unwarranted response did nothing to deal with period poverty in Ireland or globally. In the last session both Houses passed motions around period poverty, which shows that we can have a relatively mature conversation about periods and the needs of people who have them. Yesterday, the House also discussed the work of the Homeless Period Ireland project. It should not have to do that work. Another Senator talked about someone in direct provision who was incontinent and was given a bucket. We need to have a mature conversation about women's bodies and the bodies of people who have periods. I cannot wait for the trolls to attack me for referring to "people who have periods". I will not go into a kumbaya circle about when I had my first period, but it is problematic for the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland to insist that someone needs to be over 18 to see certain kinds of ads, an age at which people have had periods for more than half their lives. I also want to commend the Irish Family Planning Association on its Because She Counts campaign. I know many people in this House supported that. Finally, I note that today is Eid al-Adha. I do not know if Members saw the coverage of events in Croke Park this morning. It was a wonderful example of Ireland's céad míle fáilte, pluralism, religious tolerance and inclusion. I want to take this moment to wish all of my Muslim friends Eid Mubarak.

In 2018 a joint initiative of the Department of Education and Skills and the HSE introduced specialised therapeutic services in schools. Some 19 speech and language therapists and 12 occupational therapists were recruited in a pilot programme, with each therapist supporting a cluster of schools.The pilot was set up to test how early intervention and specialised supports can be integrated into the education system rather than being delivered in an outside forum. This system would allow therapists to support a greater number of pupils in the school environment, where there is often a large concentration of needs. In 2017, there were 741 children waiting more than one year for speech and language therapy. All the research shows that language development is critical to every aspect of children's lives and is one of the best predictions of educational achievement. I ask the Leader to request an update from the Minister for Education and Skills outlining how the scheme will be implemented. The programme for Government, Our Shared Future, commits to a full implementation of the access and inclusion model, which helps children with additional needs to access early intervention education and care, and to expand and enhance the speech and language and occupational therapy pilot scheme in schools, given its success. I fully believe that it is the way forward for children to receive those supports in a familiar environment rather than a clinical setting.

On the last sitting day of the Seanad and Dáil, things can get out of hand. That certainly happened in the Dáil last night. When we talk about how fantastic the staff in Leinster House are, we should remember that some of those staff left their families yesterday afternoon and told them they would be home at 11 p.m. or midnight. My information is that a number of members of staff did not get home until 3.30 a.m. this morning. We talk a lot about workers' rights but what happened to workers in the Houses of the Oireachtas yesterday was absolutely disgraceful. I do not like it and it should not happen. There was clearly going to be prolonged debate in the Dáil because people were making valid arguments about speaking rights, but we cannot treat people like that. We cannot, on the one hand, say they are fantastic but then keep them out half the night, particularly when they would have told their families to expect them home at an earlier time. Perhaps it is time for reflection on that matter. The need for a Ballaghaderreen-Strokestown bypass on the N5 in Roscommon was talked about for years. It is very badly needed and is finally under construction. However, a number of the farmers who lost their land have not been paid and that is outrageous and disgraceful. Their land was taken over and they are left years without their money. Many of them are the owners of small farms and are finding it hard to survive. We must examine whether this issue needs to be addressed in legislation to ensure no other members of the public are treated like this. The farmers in Roscommon are very concerned and upset because they have bills to meet and the loss of their land will have consequences for their farm payments, as the Cathaoirleach would know. The way this type of process is handled needs to change. I am asking the Leader to raise the issue with the Minister with responsibility for transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and with Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII. We need to get it sorted out as quickly as possible.

I spoke on that occasion about the need for a formal inquiry into what has happened. In the United Kingdom, the authorities have started their inquiries into similar problems in that jurisdiction. This week, the Committee of Public Accounts at Westminster published its report, which found shocking failures in decision making. In particular, the committee condemned the decision to release 25,000 hospital patients into care homes, to free up beds, without testing those patients for Covid. This action was described in the report as "reckless" and an "appalling error". We know that more than 500 similar discharges happened in this country early on in the lockdown. That decision needs to be investigated further and the UK inquiry may perhaps give a taste of what might be discovered here. The latest depressing development in regard to the nursing home sector in Ireland is the announcement of the closure of three facilities operated by the Sisters of Charity in Dublin. Senator Bacik adverted to one of them. The closure of the St. Mary's Centre and the Caritas Convalescent Centre, both on the Merrion Road, and St. Monica's nursing home on Belvedere Place leaves a total of 135 elderly residents to be moved elsewhere. All three facilities are facing financial difficulties and may or may not have enough funds to pay statutory redundancy to staff. The Caritas centre is closing as a direct result of the pandemic. The HSE told the centre management it could reopen with a 40% reduction in the number of beds, which made the care home financially unviable. I understood that both the St. Mary's and St. Monica's facilities had been the subject of critical HIQA inspection reports in recent years. The HSE has expressed surprise at the closures, indicating that it thought they were engaged in a process to restructure. However, the Sisters of Charity say they lack the funds needed to bring each premises up to the standards required by HIQA. Is this the state of things to come and will other care homes fall victims to the fallout of the Covid pandemic? It is not a case of blaming those who ran the homes. If they find themselves unable to run them viably, we have to be fair in dealing with that. If the State is going to step up, it has to be done so responsibly. Unfortunately, we have had talk from irresponsible people in the other House who have no problem with seizing private property, particularly if it belongs to certain classes of people and not to others. The State has a responsibility to invest in these facilities to ensure there is a continuity of care. That involves acknowledging the investment of others, as well as the contribution of the State, in the financial running of these homes up to now. There has to be a fair solution but we should be very troubled by the closure of any of these institutions at this time. In particular, we must keep in mind the impact on those who will be most affected by such closures.

For too long we have had a situation where women's health is ignored. Unfortunately, we have recently seen the consequences of that failure, which can be a matter of life and death. A specific issue I would like to see examined is fertility. There are couples throughout the country struggling financially, physically and emotionally with infertility. I can tell colleagues that having to deal with fertility and miscarriage issues was one of the lowest points of my life. There is nowhere to turn to for professional help. Another issue we need to examine is the treatment of women with endometriosis, which is a cruel and debilitating disease. It takes up to nine years to get diagnosed in this country, during which time it is getting worse and one's entire body is crippled underneath the condition. I have endometriosis and today I am pain free. Last week, I stood in here feeling like I had daggers swinging around inside my stomach. I am one of the lucky ones because I was able to go to work and stand here, I am not addicted to painkillers and I do not have suicidal thoughts. The same is not true for many women in this country but they are ignored, pushed aside and told the pain they are experiencing is only a bad period. I am the second speaker to talk about periods today. Endometriosis is not just a bad period. It is a crippling disease and we need to examine how it is treated and ensure we take care of the women in this country who suffer with it.

I wish everyone a very happy break for the few weeks we are in recess. In recent months we have gone through a pandemic and had major issues to deal with. Carers are one of the sectors of society whose members have come to me to say how upset and annoyed they are at how they were dealt with during the pandemic. While other people received the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, of €350 per week, carers were entitled to only €219 and no additional payment. That became a huge issue for people who were working twice as hard as usual because the usual services were not open. They felt they were not being listened to. The situation of carers is an issue I have raised with the Minister with a view to having it addressed. The contribution of carers to our society is absolutely amazing and we have not talked enough about the trauma they have endured over the past four months. It is one of the key things we need to look at now that services are reopening and children and adults with intellectual disabilities are going back to their services. With regard to transport, for example, many service users were transported by taxi in groups of two or three. Now those taxis will be able to carry only one passenger at a time. I have a case in Bandon where a person who would usually pay €8 a day for a taxi has been asked to pay €40, which adds up to €120 for the three days per week this person goes to services. This is an example of the kind of lack of joined-up thinking that is causing major frustration for people in communities throughout the country. Not only do carers feel they were not really looked after during the pandemic but when it comes to enabling children and adults with disabilities to go back to their services, they are not being looked after either.We need to have what I would call a real debate on the issue of carers, the way they are looked after in our society and the amount of work they do. They are true heroes and we have to do more for them. A debate next September on our future strategy in that regard is very important. I ask the Leader to put that on the agenda and that when we return in September it is one of the main priorities of this House.

It is a very important reminder of how seriously we need to act on climate change. It is not simply that we need to be acting on mitigating and adapting to climate change but that we also need to ensure we are not taking actions that take us in the wrong direction. I hope we will now see the same passion that sometimes goes into the defence of property rights applied to the Supreme Court decision that tells us that climate action is a fundamental responsibility and that the State has to do more. I join those who thanked all of the public servants in this House for their work, recognising that we are ourselves public servants, that we have to do our work and that sometimes that will be calling votes. However, it is very important to thank all the public servants here and those across Ireland. I would strongly point out that the remarks made this week in respect of public servants were unacceptable because it was our public services, in the most difficult circumstances in the very darkest times of this crisis, who kept people going across the country. That is very important and it is the reason public services, and investment in public servants' pay and conditions, and new imagined public services such as taking areas into public service as described earlier, be it in residential care and other areas, need to be looked at as part of how we build and go forward. As we end this term I want to raise a note of concern. There are very worrying events happening around the world. We are seeing in Hong Kong a push-back against democratic rights. In terms of rule of law, we are seeing people being picked up in unmarked vehicles in the United States. In Poland, we have seen a decision to pull away from an international convention in terms of domestic violence. We saw that happen in Russia previously, which led to very dangerous laws that affected women's health and rights. It is a reminder of the reason the European Union needs to ratify the Istanbul convention and produce directives that ensure each individual woman and child in Poland has recourse to that law, if not their own country's law. It is notable that President Duda did that in Poland with a 1% majority. It was a winner-takes-all attitude to politics. That is a dangerous attitude to politics. In Ireland, where we have valued the diversity of political opinion, we need to be extremely cautious of anything that moves us even one inch towards the idea of Government without Parliament or the idea of winner-takes-all politics. At different points in our lives all of us here might be in government, although I may never be in government, or in opposition. We have to respect each other going into the Civil War period of commemorations. Diversity of voices is crucial. The decision to roll back to Civil War-era, 1920s politics in terms of who gets to speak in the Dáil Chamber was a regressive step and one we should all be concerned about. It is very important that in this House we endeavour to keep that constructive form of politics moving forward. I urge that on everybody, not as a point of division but as a point of unity so that we can move forward and serve the people of Ireland better.

Senator Gavan mentioned the Debenhams workers. There is a Debenhams in Newbridge, in Kildare South, where I live, and I have been very proud to stand with the workers, and did so over the weekend. There are a lot of negotiations going on behind the scenes. I note that the Taoiseach met Debenhams workers yesterday. He has also been in contact with the liquidator in the United Kingdom as well as the liquidator here, as I have, so hopefully we will be able to find some resolution over the next few months. I agree with Senator Gavan that that is vitally important. The issue I want to raise concerns students at third level. It has been a very difficult year for all students, particularly leaving certificate students who now must wait an extra three weeks to get their results and to know what the future will hold for them. Many of them will go on to third level. Many will not because there are wonderful apprenticeships available. There are opportunities for other employment also. I refer to those who will go to third level and will need to move away from home. Families make huge sacrifices to send their children to third level. What happened in recent months was appalling in terms of accommodation fees that were not returned. Families paid private management companies between €6,000 and €8,000 in advance and many of them did not get back that money. In addition to that, I have a receipt from a family who paid €700 up-front for electricity for the Christmas to Easter semester. That was not returned even though the student had to leave college on 12 March. That is wrong. Families who had to pay deposits in February for the September-October 2020 start have been told now that those colleges might only sit for three weeks of the coming semester. The privately-managed companies will not rotate the accommodation so families are facing hotel and bed and breakfast accommodation costs. That is wrong. The new Department with responsibility for third level, further education and research is welcome but it is very important that the Minister with responsibility for higher education looks at the accommodation crisis and ensures that there is regulation on the private companies.

We have to show leadership in that area so I wish everybody well in that respect. I want to unpatronisingly and genuinely salute the integrity and courage of Senator McGreehan - I hope I am pronouncing her name correctly - for the testimony she gave to the House today. That kind of courage merits a positive response from the Leader. I turn now to a theme I raised previously and which I will turn to as often as I can on every possible occasion during this term. Covid-19 was mentioned earlier but if it has taught us anything it is that for once we should treasure our carers and home care, and provide the opportunity for people to be cared for in their own homes. I ask the Leader to make the statutory home-care package scheme a legislative priority very early in the autumn session to ensure we have the equivalent of the fair deal scheme for people to be cared for in their homes. I ask the Leader to specifically seek to have that legislation brought to the House. Our carers should get very attractive packages. There should be increased moneys for that in the budget. The job should be made attractive and given an enhanced status. If we do that a number of people will opt to care. Unfortunately, the current socioeconomic reality is that a number of people will be dislocated job-wise and caring should be made an attractive option, as well as retirement villages and supporting people to build granny flats etc. The immediate response to Covid-19, however, should be the provision of care in the home.

I never speak about the other House but I was absolutely shocked, as was the nation as a whole, by the shenanigans we witnessed on television last night. There is no gagging of democracy in these Houses and anybody who argues as much is only fooling himself or herself. A system was put in place and it does not suit a minority but as far as I can see those Members still have approximately 65% to 70% of speaking time. As they did not get their way, they chose to behave like a pack of rowdy undergraduates. There was a travesty last night as a person appointed as a teller for a vote refused to sign the result because it did not suit him. Is that democracy? Some of those people on the extreme left are doing this nation a disservice by hyping the talk of gagging democracy. They have tried street politics and we listen to them every week outside practising megaphone diplomacy. They are now trying it in the Lower House. I am thankful nobody has tried it here yet. They have nothing to say about abuses in Trotskyite regimes like Russia, China or North Korea but if anything happens in any of the European democracies, they give out yards. I am having a bit of a rant but I believe I represent common sense in this. I appeal to those undergraduate Deputies to cop on and grow up.

I will not rant so Members should not worry. There is merit in Senator O'Sullivan's suggestion. We are in a parliamentary democracy and we represent the people who put us here, whether they are the electorate for the Lower House or councillors, among others, in the Seanad. The Parliament's groups have voting strengths according to the votes received. I raise the matter of proprietary directors not being included in the new wage subsidy scheme. I raised this issue yesterday in discussing a Bill with the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Fleming, and I will do so again this morning. It is a very important matter that must be addressed by the Government and a solution must be found. I am appealing to the Deputy Leader to intervene with the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. It is a very difficult time for businesses, including self-employed family directors. They are working to create and keep jobs and we must look after them. I ask the Deputy Leader to intervene on that matter. I join everybody in thanking the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas for their tremendous dedication, not just during the pandemic but at all times. They work irregular and unsocial hours but are always courteous, efficient, helpful and friendly. I wish all my colleagues in the House a very happy summer. Like most speakers, I suggest people come to my local area, Cork, which is the best part of the country.

For the benefit of Members who might see people arriving later but speaking earlier than they do, there is a specific rota for speaking slots.

That is democracy and these are the rules. As in all parliamentary chambers, everybody should be afforded the opportunity to speak while abiding by the rules.

One is never too late to wish a person well in a new role. It is probably the last good wish he will get in this respect but I got it in before the House rose for the summer. I remember the Cathaoirleach canvassing at Monaghan County Council when Senator Robbie Gallagher was a councillor. He brought some razzmatazz to the campaign. It was out of Bobby Kennedy's book. He did not have the advantage of being a sitting county councillor but he had political acumen, like Senator Timmy Dooley, who also jumped the county council apprenticeship and went straight to the Upper House. I still have the lovely DVD.

Sport has had a good airing this week and it can be the heartbeat of a community. I know we are doing our best but it is important when sport returns in any shape or form. We should really exhaust all possible channels to ensure we can restart sport while putting health and safety first. My wish this morning, as the House rises for the summer, is discuss the Leinster schools senior cup rugby final for 2020. These children, or young adults, gave six years of their lives to this. We had the spectacle of a first-ever Kildare final between Clongowes Wood and Newbridge College, which only recently celebrated the 50th anniversary since last winning the cup in 1970. These are kids or young adults and I hope they will take places in college but there is a window of opportunity in the next month for this match to happen. I say this as the Leinster provincial team is training, along with its academy and under-20 team. Is there any way at all that the Irish Rugby Football Union, IRFU, could give those youths a well-deserved day in the sun, even if few people are present? It could be an all-Kildare derby that would provide such a spectacle. It would be the highlight of their young sporting lives. I know the IRFU will do its best but is there any feasible or viable way to put on that match? It means so much to the young people, who are now adults. They have worked for six years to get to the promised land and have their moment in the sun. The pandemic has ripped it away from them. It is late but perhaps it is not too late. Could the IRFU look at this again to see if it is possible to put on the match? It would make many families, the teams and supporters so happy if we could defeat the pandemic this way. If there is a way of doing this while adhering to health and safety advice, it would be a spectacular boost to the young adults as they enter the next chapter of their lives. This chapter is just not closed yet and they are hoping against hope that the match can be put on. I will write to the IRFU and do everything I can to see if there is any way the match can be played.

They are equally important. I start with Senator Byrne's comments and I also wish the Social Democratic and Labour Party, SDLP, a happy 50th birthday. I had the pleasure a number of years ago to attend an event in my constituency the time with Mr. John Hume, although it was a time when his unfortunate illness was becoming evident. I join the Senator in wishing the SDLP and its members, including Mr. Colum Eastwood, a happy birthday. Senator Boyhan mentioned healthy discussion and a respectful debate and I concur with his comments. At times there is action at late-night sittings, as we saw last night in the other House, that are definitely regrettable. I agree with his concerns about taking all Stages of Bills in one sitting. We appreciate that this is an unprecedented emergency and the House had not been constituted because there was no Government in place. This should not happen and will not happen again.I hope that in September we can return to taking Second Stage and Committee Stage of legislation on different days and maybe in different weeks. Senators Bacik and Mullen referred to nursing homes and several other speakers, including Senators Lombard and O'Reilly, mentioned carers. The two matters are linked. I agree with all about the need for debates on this area. Nursing homes are important because in many cases there are not alternatives. I was lucky enough, when my late father was diagnosed with a terminal illness, my mother said "Billy, we will keep you at home". We were able to do that because there were seven of us in the family and we were able to do a rota. My sister from London was able to come over and work remotely on her laptop and mobile phone in Moycullen. We were able to look after him and keep him at home but other families do not have that option because they do not have the numbers of siblings that we have. I have always had a romantic view, and one of my favourite television programmes when I was younger was "The Waltons", where there were four generations of the same family living in the same house. I know that is not realistic in many cases but it is an absolutely wonderful setting where younger people are able to look after older people. There is a need to look at the whole area of carers and nursing homes. I will take the matter of Telford at Merrion back to the Minister for Health. Senator Gavan and many others thanked public servants, as I do too. He and Senator O'Loughlin mentioned the Debenhams workers. We all recognise that former Debenhams workers have immediate questions and concerns about their redundancy payments as a result of the liquidation. There are ongoing discussions with the liquidators, the companies and unions. We note that the workers have statutory employment rights, that liquidation is court supervised and remains before the High Court. The legal proceedings have to conclude. I do not want to say anything prejudicial but it is important that they get what is in their rights. However, I disagree with Senator Gavan's view that the Government does not look after ordinary workers. The whole basis of the emergency legislation on the pandemic unemployment payment and the wage subsidy scheme has been to protect workers and, indeed, employers because it is not possible to cannot have one without the other. There is no point in employers thinking that they can run a company without employees or an employee thinking that they can get a day's pay or a week's wage without someone to employ them. Of course, there are also self-employed people who are very important in all this. Senator Crowe mentioned Galway 2020. What has happened there is regrettable. There was a litany of issues previously and the matter has been compounded this year. A wonderful event was planned but the opening-night celebrations were cancelled when a bad storm hit Galway Bay. Covid has impacted on every sector but it has had a real impact on Galway 2020, with many events either cancelled or postponed. On 10 July, the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Catherine Martin, published a reimagined cultural programme for Galway 2020, with scaled-down events, although still featuring 350 artists due to work. Progress on this is being closely monitored by the Department. There has been a significant reduction in staff numbers and there is a Government commitment in the context of ensuring funding and governance. Senator Burke made a very positive suggestion about the room in the National Museum of Ireland. I am not sure if that room is in its ownership. We are tight for space at times and no more so than during the current pandemic. The Cathaoirleach stated that he will look at this matter, which is important. Senator Keogan said that the Government must do better. The Government, regardless of the parties which comprise it, always endeavour to do better and the role of the Opposition is to keep us on our toes in that regard. I would point out that the things that we are doing now and that we are able to do, including borrowing money for initiatives such as the July stimulus, was possible because we were able to balance our books at the start of the year and had good credit-worthiness as a State and because we had full employment at that point. It is important to remember that. Senator Casey asked for a debate with the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, on housing and Irish Water. We will not get into a discussion on the various funding streams relating to Irish Water but I know that it is an important issue in the investment in rural towns and villages. I concur that it is important in relation to spatial programming and population. Senator Dolan spoke about people holidaying at home. We all agree. She also mentioned Scoil Croí Naofa and integrating special needs into mainstream. I am sure we can take that up with the Minister for Education and Skills. Senator Fitzpatrick spoke of the wonderful amenity of the Royal Canal and the need to speak to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport on phases 3 and 4. Several Senators have asked for debates on greenways and blueways. It is important and I agree. Senator Hoey spoke about the Tampax ad and the near hysteria surrounding it, as well as the more important point on period poverty. It is something that does not personally impact on people of my sex but we do appreciate the importance of the issue. In the previous Oireachtas, the Irish Women's Parliamentary Caucus had a special debate in the Houses on period poverty. If all it takes is for 82 people to object to an ad for its removal, God knows what might happen down the line on other ads. I question the decision in this regard. Senator Carrigy raised the important issue of speech and language therapy services. It is hugely important for those who require those basic services. It is mentioned in the programme for Government and it is important that it is not just a mention but that there is full implementation. All of us here, including the Opposition, have a role in ensuring the Government is focused on that. Senator Murphy referred to the N5 bypass around Strokestown to Ballaghaderreen, a €200 million project that is under way. He mentioned concerns that family farmers have not been paid. It is a serious issue. There is a process and compulsory purchase orders have been made. There is a statutory process that the Irish Farmers Association on consent and access worked on. I will take the matter up with Transport Infrastructure Ireland and the Minister. Senator McGreehan, as Senator O'Reilly acknowledged, told a very personal story about fertility, and the women, and indeed couples, who struggle with it. I will not get too personal about that as it would not be right, but I applaud what she has said and it is important that the issues she raised are taken on board. Senator Higgins raised a number of issues including the importance of public servants, residential care and climate change. These are all very important points. She and Senator O'Sullivan mentioned what happened in the Dáil last night. She spoke of a winner-takes-all attitude towards politics and how diversity of voices is important. I agree with that but it is also important that there are more proportionate speaking times for Members, which is the point of what was voted on yesterday. Indeed, there was no reduction in Opposition speaking time, but more proportional times were given to those speaking based on the numbers in the Dáil. Among the matters raised by Senator O'Loughlin was that of accommodation payments at third level. I will ask the Minister with responsibility for further and higher education, Deputy Harris, to take up the matter of those payments. Senator Buttimer referred to parliamentary democracy and to proprietary directors. I raised this with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, yesterday. He stated that he is aware of the issue. It is a standard measure to avoid the abuse of these schemes but he will look into the matter in terms of the scheme's development. Senator Martin spoke of the importance of sport and urged that we exhaust all channels to get sporting events back, specifically the all-Kildare Leinster Senior Cup final. It should happen. Those involved in rugby, especially schools rugby and in Leinster in particular, place huge importance on winning a medal in a final like that. I hope those involved get an opportunity to complete the fixture and that the IRFU takes that on board, taking into account the considerations relating to health.

I accept that the time allowed for debate is necessarily short. The Government is keen to deliver for renters today. The programme for Government recognises the important role that the private rental sector plays in housing many people and we want the sector to continue to play this key role into the future. Through this Bill, the Government seeks to address challenges in the rental sector including standards, security and affordability for renters. I ask Senators to pass the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Bill 2020 to help mitigate the adverse social and economic impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic which, unfortunately, have been felt by many tenants in the residential rental sector.  Some tenants continue to deal with the fallout of Covid-19. The Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 was enacted on 27 March 2020. Part 2 of that Act modifies the operation of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 during the Covid-19 emergency period, initially for 3 months, to better protect tenants by prohibiting rent increases in all cases and tenancy terminations in all but limited and exceptional cases. Section 4(1) provides that upon the request of the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, after consulting with the Minister for Health and with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the Government may make an order to extend the emergency period for such period as it considers appropriate, if it is satisfied that making the order is in the public interest, having regard to the threat to public health presented by Covid-19, the highly contagious nature of the disease and the need to restrict the movement of persons in order to prevent the spread of the disease among the population.On 19 June, the previous Government made an order extending the emergency period until 20 July in accordance with the aforementioned section 4(1). On 20 July, upon the request of the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, a further Government order was made to extend the emergency period until 1 August. This extra time has enabled the development of policy and law by my Department for the consideration of the Seanad today in the form of the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Bill 2020. The recitals at the start of the Bill set out the policy context in which the temporary and limited restrictions on landlords' constitutionally protected property rights are framed, in Part 2 and section 12, for the social common good. Covid-19 has undeniably caused a crisis for the world and Ireland has not escaped, with significant adverse impacts being visited upon those who have contracted the disease and their families and friends. The broad social impacts of Covid-19 are closely interwoven with the adverse economic impacts. There has been a substantial and sudden increase in unemployment. Many in the residential rental sector have faced jobs losses, restricting their ability to pay rent and putting them at risk of losing their homes. There is a significant risk that some renters would have difficulty securing alternative rental accommodation and might end up in overcrowded accommodation at a time when the State is keenly focused on suppressing the spread of Covid-19. We want to minimise the occurrence of any overcrowded accommodation, and in doing so we want to minimise the risk of transmission of Covid-19 in Ireland, which has already cost the country dearly. We want the economic recovery to start now with the help of the July stimulus. Working together and continuing to adhere to the public health advice, we can arrest the fallout for our society and economy by getting people back to work. The Bill recognises that Covid-19 has been hard on many tenants, particularly those working in the worst affected sectors of the economy, such as retail and hospitality. The Bill proposes short-term and long-term solutions. Where tenants make a written declaration that the economic impact of Covid-19 has rendered them unable to pay their rent and at a significant risk of tenancy termination, the Bill provides for increased notice periods for failure to pay rent due, from 28 days to 90 days, for notices of termination served on tenants in the residential rental sector during the emergency period from the passing of this Bill to 10 January 2021. Any notice of termination grounded on rent arrears and served during this new emergency period cannot specify a tenancy termination date earlier than 11 January 2021. The Bill also provides for a prohibition on rent increases on tenancies of dwellings during the new emergency period. In the longer term, permanent amendments to the Residential Tenancies Acts in the Bill provide that before a notice of termination grounded on rent arrears can be served, a tenant will have 28 days to pay outstanding rent. Those 28 days will start from the date of receipt by the tenant or the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, of a written rent arrears notification from the landlord, whichever date occurs later. The Residential Tenancies Act will be amended to include specific requirements relating to the giving of notifications and notices of termination by landlords to tenants and the RTB in respect of arrears of rent. The Bill also provides for the once-off extension from ten years to 12 years of the period under the Valuation Act 2001 within which a valuation list in relation to the rating authority area of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council shall be published, with the return to the usual ten year period in 2023. This temporary provision is required to counter the logistical difficulties caused by the Covid-19 restrictions. We have to continue to address the immediate and drastic economic and social consequences of Covid-19, protecting as many jobs as possible and making sure that families and businesses can survive financially. The economic recession the pandemic has caused is the most rapid and dramatic ever experienced by anyone in the Houses of the Oireachtas. The emergency measures introduced in March, with all-party support, have prevented a much deeper social and economic crisis. On Thursday of last week, the Government approved the proposals of the Minister to progress residential tenancy legislation before the summer recess to better protect tenants who remain vulnerable as society and businesses reopen after the Covid-19 lockdown. In light of the prevailing economic situation caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the proposed Residential Tenancies and Valuation Bill 2020 provides further protection during a new emergency period, until 10 January 2021, for tenants who have been economically impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. There are three parts to the Bill, which comprises 14 sections. Part 1 includes preliminary and general provisions. Sections 1 and 2 contain standard provisions relating to the short title, collective citations and definitions. Part 2, which covers the protection of tenants during the emergency period, provides key and urgent enhancements to protections for tenants during an emergency period where they have been economically impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic and are unable to meet their obligations under the Residential Tenancies Acts to pay the rent due. Section 3 defines the emergency period to mean from the date of the passing of this Act to 10 January 2021. Section 4 provides that Part 2 shall not apply unless the tenant makes a written declaration that he or she is unable to comply with his or her obligations to pay rent due because he or she is or was temporarily out of work due to having contracted Covid-19 without entitlement to be paid by his or her employer; or is in receipt of, or entitled to receive, the temporary wage subsidy or any other payment out of public moneys provided for under statute and paid for the purpose of alleviating financial hardship resulting from the loss of employment occasioned by Covid-19, including rent supplement or a supplementary welfare allowance, and as a consequence is at significant risk that the tenancy will be terminated by the landlord. Such a declaration must be served on the RTB and copied to the landlord. It shall be an offence to make a false or misleading declaration. During the emergency period and where the declaration has been made, section 5 provides that before a notice of termination is served by a landlord on foot of rent arrears, a tenant must have been afforded a minimum of 28 days to pay his or her rent arrears after a written rent arrears notice has been received by both the tenant and the RTB. A 90-day notice of termination period will now apply where rent arrears are the basis of the termination. The corresponding notice period for rent arrears terminations outside of the emergency period is 28 days. A notice of termination served during the emergency period shall not specify a termination date that falls earlier than 11 January 2021. A tenant cannot acquire Part 4 security of tenure rights as a result of this section. Section 6 provides that no rent increase can take effect during the emergency period and no increase in rent will be payable in respect of any time during that period. Section 7 provides that tenants can submit the relevant declaration to the RTB by electronic means to avail of the enhanced protections under Part 2 of the Bill. Part 3 provides for amendments to the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 and the Valuation Act 2001. Section 8 provides that during the period from the date of the passing of this Act to 10 January 2021, tenancy tribunals are not required to be held in public. This is a continuation of the provision first introduced in the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 in the interest of safeguarding public health. Section 9 provides for an amendment to the table in section 34 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 to provide a new separate ground 1A for termination of a tenancy for reasons of non-payment of rent within the minimum 28-day period afforded for payment, following receipt of a written rent arrears notice by both the tenant and the RTB. The 28-day period commences upon receipt of the written rent arrears notice by the tenant or by the RTB, whichever occurs later. Section 10 is a consequential amendment to section 35 of the Residential Tenancies Act arising from the new ground 1A provided for under section 9. Section 11 inserts a new section 39A into the Residential Tenancies Acts. The new section 39A provides that where a landlord serves a notice of termination in relation to the failure to pay an amount of rent set under the tenancy, a copy of that notice must be sent to the RTB at the same time as to the tenant. When the RTB receives a copy of the notice, it will notify the tenant in writing of his or her right to refer a matter in connection with the notice of termination to the board for resolution under section 76. In the resolution of any dispute arising, the RTB adjudicator shall have regard to any advice provided to the tenant by the Money Advice & Budgeting Service, MABS, when making a decision or determination. Where there is an appeal to a tribunal, the tribunal shall also have regard to any advice provided by MABS when making its determination. Section 12 provides for a number of amendments to section 67 of the Residential Tenancies Acts. Paragraphs (a) and (b) provide conditions for the serving of a notice of termination where the tenant has failed to pay an amount of rent due. The conditions are that the tenant and the RTB have been notified in writing that: such amount of rent due, as is specified in the notification has not been paid, and that the rent has not been paid to the landlord within the minimum period of 28 days following receipt of the written rent arrears notification by the tenant, or by the RTB, whichever occurs later. Paragraph (c) provides that where the RTB receives a notification that an amount of rent due has not been paid, it shall provide information in writing to assist the tenant in getting advice from MABS. Provision is also made that any notice of termination for failure by a tenant to pay an amount of rent due shall be deemed to be invalid if the landlord fails to simultaneously serve a copy of that notice on the tenant and the RTB. Section 13 amends section 5 of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 in subsection (6) to redefine the revised termination date so that it cannot expire any earlier than 10 August 2020. This applies to tenancies where a notice of termination had been served but the notice period had not expired before the 2020 Act came into law on 27 March 2020. Section 5(7) of the 2020 Act is also deleted to ensure that Part 2, operation of Residential Tenancies Act 2004, of that Act ceases to operate at the end of the emergency period under section 3(1) of that Act. Section 14 modifies the application of section 25 of the Valuation Act 2001 by extending the period from ten years to 12 years within which a valuation list in relation to the rating authority area of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council shall be published, with a return to the usual ten-year period in 2023. This Bill is being debated in the Houses of the Oireachtas during an economic emergency. The measures that we take now have to target those who most need our help. The tailored approach in this Bill targets a prohibition on rent increases to those who most need it. It protects tenants from imminent tenancy termination caused by rent arrears. The earliest that they will have to leave their home is 11 January 2021. We recognise that some landlords also find themselves on the wrong side of Covid-19, and we also recognise constitutionally protected property rights. That is the reason this Bill balances the need to protect those worst affected by Covid-19 with the need to respect property rights and the legitimate interests of landlords. On the back of our hard-won progress in suppressing the spread of Covid-19, Ireland now has to face the challenge of restoring society and the economy. This Bill will play its part in that regard. Our focus, heading into the autumn term, will be to continue the adjustment of our lives to living with Covid-19. We need a new normal that is safe. We must respect the efforts that all of society has contributed in getting us this far. The residential rental sector has been affected by the economic fallout of Covid-19. Tenants, landlords and professionals engaged in the sector all needed to adapt to the situation presented the pandemic. It has not been easy and uncertainty remains. This legislation seeks to protect both tenants and landlords. Landlords accept that some tenants will face serious financial challenges over the coming weeks and months and I know that they will work to support tenants to the greatest extent possible. Landlords recognise that forbearance is required. The provisions in this Bill will help during and after the economic fallout from Covid-19. It will ultimately help landlords by ensuring early and active engagement by tenants with Government support structures where they find themselves in difficulty in making rent payments. The usual rental protections under the Residential Tenancies Acts will apply as normal from 2 August. It is only where rent arrears is a problem during the new emergency period to 10 January 2021 that the temporary prohibition on rent increases and tenancy terminations will apply. Earlier this month, the RTB, in conjunction with the ESRI, published a paper entitled, Exploring the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Rental Prices in Ireland from January to June 2020: Early Insights from a Monthly Rent Index. The analysis shows that the annual growth rate of rent amounts declined significantly compared to the period prior to the lockdown. While the annual growth rate in March was over 3%, by April this had fallen to 0.4%, and it declined again in May to 0.1%. By June, the annual growth rate had turned negative, with prices falling by 3.3% compared to the same month the previous year. The findings clearly show early downward pressure on rental prices and a reduction in the number of registrations, the latter of which is consistent with the restrictions on economic and social life brought in to stop the spread of Covid-19. Early estimates for April through to June show annualised rental falls in Dublin, with a clear reduction in the year-on-year growth rate in other areas. My Department and the ESRI operate a programme of collaborative research principally focused on housing economics. Under this programme, researchers from the ESRI and my Department prepared a research paper exploring the short-term implications of the Covid-19 pandemic on the private rental market. The research paper is focused on rental payment affordability and the potential incidence of arrears during the first three months of the pandemic among non-supported, private market renting households, that is, among renting households which do not receive a housing subsidy. Changes in consumption patterns arising from public health measures are also considered in the paper. The research findings published on 28 July do not identify a significant rent arrears problem emerging during the first three months of the pandemic. While tenants are legally obliged to continue to pay rent during this emergency, the Government is fully conscious that some tenants have seen a reduction in their working hours, some have lost their job, and others have been forced to self-isolate to protect their communities and in some cases have contracted Covid-19. The Government has made available a range of income and rental supports to anyone in financial difficulty. I encourage tenants who are experiencing difficulties to engage with their landlords and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection at the earliest opportunity to seek whatever income and rental support might apply in their case. Covid-19 has presented this country and the global community with enormous challenges over the past five months. The pandemic continues to present challenges in the medium to long term particularly for those most vulnerable in society, and those working in sectors most heavily impacted by the pandemic. The Programme for Government: Our Shared Future, asserts the Government's ambition to meet the challenges, repair the damage that has been inflicted on people by the pandemic and take the renewed spirit arising from these challenging times and translate it into action. This has been a very stressful and testing time for people. The economic impact of the pandemic will continue to be felt in all parts of the country and in society for a long time to come. We now need to move decisively to recover from its devastating social, economic and cultural impact. The key goal is to get as many people back working in a safe manner as soon as possible. The Government is committed to helping people who need help to meet their housing needs. It believes that everybody should have access to good quality housing to purchase or rent at an affordable price, built to a high standard and located close to essential services offering a high quality of life. We understand that the provision of more affordable housing has a profound benefit socially and economically and we believe that the State has a fundamental role in enabling the delivery of new homes and ensuring that the best use is made of existing stock.As Minister of State in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, I know that people need to get back to work as soon as possible to be able to pay their rent and other bills. This Bill will help tenants when they most need it.

I thank the Minister of State for bringing this legislation to the House. I have not had the opportunity previously to address him and I thank him for coming in. I am speaking as Fianna Fáil spokesperson for housing, local government and heritage. I was first elected to Dublin City Council in 2004 and was in Dublin City Council for more than 16 years when it was essentially established as a housing authority. For more than 16 years I have been dealing with people and trying to help them address their housing needs. I went from a situation when I was first elected to helping people apply to the local authority to navigate the process to secure a home, to helping them avoid becoming homeless. My constituency of Dublin Central is probably the one which has been hit greatest by the housing crisis. When I talk about this Bill I see it for what it is, which is very important legislation that aims to protect renters who cannot pay their rent and helps to protect them from becoming homeless. However, I have to ask the Minister of State to indulge me for a minute or two to talk about the housing crisis. The housing crisis is not just about the acute end of it we see in homelessness that hits the headlines but is affecting people of every age and, quite honestly, every income level.  In this example of one family, and there are hundreds of such cases I have dealt with on a personal basis, both parents are working with four young children, they are on a housing list for more than seven years in rented accommodation and became homeless. They ended up being put in a hotel out in Ballymun and had to take a shuttle to the airport, take a bus into town and then take a bus back out to Cabra to get their children to school. The children’s attendance at school suffered and it had never been a problem or had they been late for school. The parents' ability to get to work suffered and the grandparents and older siblings ended up with an overcrowded situation as well. It affected everybody including their employers because they were then without very valuable workers. As a Government, we have an enormous challenge to address the housing crisis and we need to do that by having a significant change in attitude in how we see housing. It must be seen as a vital social infrastructure and cannot be seen as a financial asset. This Government is committed to taking on the challenge and to ensuring that there will be a significant State-led public house-building programme so that we will recover the lost decade in social house-building that we have experienced in this State. I wish the Minister of State well and he has all of our support in doing that but we have to act with urgency and ambition like this is an emergency, the way we did in the pandemic. We need to take this housing challenge and ensure that by the end of this four years there is a significant change in the delivery of housing in this State with public housing on public land and affordable housing to both purchase and rent. The Minister of State has our commitment to work with him on that. On the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Bill 2020, this is the third extension of the emergency legislation that was introduced in March. It aims to target those renters. I am thinking primarily of those young workers, the young women, the retail workers and those working in hospitality whose incomes have been dramatically cut by the pandemic. This is a targeted approach which will ensure that those renters are protected from eviction or from rent increases. Most critically, it will also ensure that the State will actively support those renters to avoid homelessness, rent increases and evictions. In that respect it is very welcome. From my experience, knowing how many people who have come to me who have been renting for a long time like the family I described earlier and faced with a notice to quit on the basis that the home is going to be sold, it is very important that the Residential Tenancies Board is being resourced to tackle those scenarios. I have seen those scenarios in real life and it is important that the Minister of State’s Department is giving 15 extra staff members to the Residential Tenancy Board to ensure that there are no bogus attempts to evict renters and deprive them of their home.  What is also very important is the other practical response that the Department is taking with the call for housing. I got to the bottom of all of those cases by going to Dublin City Council. When the person came to me, I said to them to ask the landlord if they will sell the property to Dublin City Council. We would then know if the landlord was really selling it and if they were, Dublin City Council would engage with them. Dublin City Council, to its great credit, is the one local authority that has to a significant extent purchased properties and has managed to keep tenants in those properties and avoid homelessness. The Minister of State’s call for housing from the Department is very welcome. What this does is it puts that call out there to all landlords who wish to sell properties. If they want to sell their property, they can sell it back to the State. If their tenants are on the social housing list they will be retained in that tenancy. That is a practical measure and is not one that requires any legislation and what the Minister of State has done is welcome. That is the type of approach we need. We need to stop people being made homeless and to secure what tenancies we have but, most critically, if we are going to address the housing crisis, we have to address supply. We must get on with a significant State-led public house-building programme. We need to have public housing on public land and affordable housing in sustainable communities close to where people want to live, work and enjoy their lives.
#MartinConway	unknown-#MartinConway-party	unknown-#MartinConway-dob	unknown-#MartinConway-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-07-31 00:00:00	Teachtaireachtaí ón Dáil - Messages from Dáil	44	Gabhaim buíochas leis an Leas-Chathaoirleach. I warmly congratulate and tAire Stáit, Teachta Burke, on his appointment which is a well-deserved one and I will welcome him in what I believe is his first visit to the Seanad. He has a big job of work to do but no better man.  This legislation is very welcome. I will pick up on one point that the Minister of State has made which is about striking a balance. This is about being fair and supportive - and rightly so - of tenants who find themselves in difficulty and in desperately challenging situations as a result of this pandemic. It also recognises the constitutional rights of landlords which can sometimes be overlooked. This legislation is trying to achieve what we all want to see which is fairness. Senator Fitzpatrick is very correct on the challenge we face with the housing crisis, particularly in urban areas. Since 2016, between private and public housing, 50,000 houses were built and in the fullness of time former Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, will get credit for at least doing his level best to manage the situation and to get stock built. The one way of dealing with the housing crisis is by building houses. There is a chronic shortage of houses and when one has a situation where supply and demand do not meet and where an equilibrium is not achieved, then, unfortunately, prices go up, and it is expensive for people to try to purchase houses. We have all dealt with people who were not in a position to get a mortgage even though they both had what would be considered well-paid good jobs. The way one deals with properties for rent is by increasing the supply. The more houses that are built the more properties that are available for rent as well. It is certainly the ambition of this Government to deal with the housing stock situation head-on and to engage in a large-scale building programme. This, in itself, will create jobs in the short to medium term, outside of its long-term benefits to society.Building houses in strategic areas to prevent the development of ghettos is extremely important. The planning process must continually be looked at to ensure that it is streamlined for people who wish to build houses. The various aspects of this Bill are, as the has Minister outlined, timely and appropriate. Legislation passed by this House at the beginning of the pandemic was essential and achieved what it set out to achieve. However, it is appropriate now to amend that legislation with this Bill. My colleague, Senator Cummins, is the Fine Gael spokesperson on housing but he was not in a position to be here today. He has spoken at length about the challenges faced by provincial cities such as Limerick and Waterford. The Leas-Chathaoirleach has spoken about the challenges facing Cork. Sometimes the narrative about the housing crisis tends to get focused on Dublin but it also exists in other areas. We have seen the success of the rent pressure zones and I think that constant monitoring of those zones and the introduction of new ones, where appropriate, is a welcome measure. The work that the Minister of State has to do is significant. He and the Minister know the challenge that lies ahead and I wish them all the best in trying to achieve a housing programme through which everyone who needs a home will get one.
#RonanMullen	unknown-#RonanMullen-party	unknown-#RonanMullen-dob	unknown-#RonanMullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-07-31 00:00:00	Teachtaireachtaí ón Dáil - Messages from Dáil	45	Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire Stáit. I congratulate him on his appointment and wish him well in his brief. I welcome this Bill. Tenants in Ireland have historically had far fewer rights than their counterparts on the Continent. This imbalance has been substantially addressed in recent years, and we should have no fear about continuing in that direction. This Bill places restrictions on property rights guaranteed under the Constitution. As such, the Oireachtas has a legal and moral duty to act responsibly but the measures in the Bill seem to be proportionate and in the public interest. I was listening to Roddy Doyle speaking to Oliver Callan on the radio this morning. He was speaking in almost nostalgic terms about the accommodation that used to exist - people sharing bedsits, bathrooms and so on. It sounded to me as if he was being nostalgic about what were, in fact, terrible tips in which to live. We must acknowledge the fact that there is a great frustration for many people who cannot afford to be out of home, in a place of their own and able to enjoy the freedom, independence and human progress that involves. I wonder how far we are from imaginative solutions that look at quality high-rise accommodation in the city with the appropriate space and amenities. I am not a fan of the co-living model, although there may be potential for it. It should be possible to imagine new ways of providing accommodation while always keeping an eye on the importance of family life, the needs of children and so on. As a person from rural Ireland, I would also like to see some kind of imaginative approach to getting people to move, if necessary, from urban areas to live in more rural towns throughout the country in order to try to revive them. I know there are employment and other issues in that regard but I would like to see serious and imaginative planning in that area. It is not only because I take a small proportion of my income from a rental property that I want to mention that I do not like to see a general demonisation of landlords in the discourse that goes on. I followed the debate on this Bill in the Dáil and I was disappointed by the tone of many of the contributions. There are several categories of private landlord that one can think of, from large corporate landlords to buy-to-let investors. There are also others who own just one property which they may have inherited as a family property and rent out to supplement a small income. It is this last category of small landlords that I would like specifically to mention. Some of those landlords are old age pensioners who rely on small rental incomes from very modest properties to supplement their pensions. They are not profiteers or rack-renters. They already face significant pressure as a result of the measures introduced to protect tenants in recent years. Buy-to-let investors have been given some relief by the banks but there is no relief for landlords without mortgages. I spoke to one such person recently who receives the basic old age pension and rents out a second property which they own, which yields an income of €140 a week. That is a modest rental income. The tenant has been laid off due to Covid-19 but the property owner has no desire to evict her and would have no objection to this legislation, although it would obviously expose them to serious financial hardship through loss of rental income. I wonder whether anything could be done, at a policy level, to provide relief to people in that kind of situation. Tenants who have lost their jobs can apply for rent supplement and, later, housing assistance payment if they do not already qualify for it. We should be encouraging as many people as possible to do that. This would allow for rents to be paid, to some extent, assisting both tenants and smaller landlords. Threshold has been advising people accordingly. There are long delays in applications for those supports at present and it is important that the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection tries to process them as efficiently as possible. Could we look at other ways of alleviating pressure on smaller landlords and old age pensioners? Property tax liability continues throughout the emergency period and many property owners pay it on a monthly basis. Could we examine the possibility of a very limited exemption from property tax in cases such as the one I have outlined? Could this be something that would apply to those whose only income, apart from rental income, would be the statutory pension? From representations I have received, it seems that there are enough people in such a situation to justify a scheme like that. The Covid-19 situation should also be used to finally address the issue of short-term holiday lets, the so-called Airbnb effect. Before the pandemic, 5,000 entire homes in Dublin were being used for short-term lets. In 2017, the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government proposed a series of measures to address this, some of which were implemented in July of last year, but that there are concerns that they did not go far enough. Airbnb has its European headquarters in Dublin and has lobbied strongly against changes in this area. Surely the present lull in the tourist sector gives an opportunity to address this issue once and for all. This is a chance to rebalance the market away from short-term holiday lets and towards long-term residential leases. I again welcome the Minister of State and wish him well. I also welcome this Bill because it is important that we protect people at this difficult time in our national life. I also call for imaginative solutions to our ongoing housing challenges. We must remember that there are many different types of stakeholder in our society, including small-time landlords who are dependent on modest rental incomes for a portion of the income that they need to survive. I want to sincerely apologise for not using up my full allocation of time and I promise it will not happen again.

No doubt there are challenges ahead but my party colleagues and I will do everything we can to work constructively to solve the housing crisis and, where appropriate, support the Government. We must keep people in their homes and allow them to have hope for the future of their housing security. The ban on evictions and rent increases introduced by this Government a few months ago helped people. Those measures saw the numbers from the private rental sector entering homelessness drop significantly. The Government decision not to privilege the rights of landlords over those of tenants gave renters hope that they would not have to go back to work before it was safe to do so. Renters were also given hope that the Government would stop treating all tenants like they were only ever trying to game the system and, given the slightest chance, would lie and refuse to pay. It gave them hope that they will be able to remain in their homes. I listened to a number of previous speakers and the one issue that keeps coming up is whether what is proposed is fair, balanced and proportional in terms of the rights of landlords and the rights of tenants. I do not agree. I believe the Bill does not do that. It is neither fair nor proportional, and it does not balance rights. The Bill confirms to renters that the Government cares more about a vocal minority of landlords than it does about keeping people out of homelessness, that it cares more about punishing renters for not being homeowners or small landlords than it does about giving people a home and that it cares more about pushing through a flawed Bill than one that would actually provide effective, long-term and short-term solutions. The Minister of State told Senators that this Bill adequately protects renters affected by Covid-19, that he has extended the eviction ban into the distant future, along with the ban on rent increases, and that those who need it will be protected. It does not, however, do that. It protects those who the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has deemed deserving and he has defined that group of people in an impossibly narrow and restrictive way. This week, the Government has successfully pushed through a Bill that significantly tightens the availability of the pandemic unemployment payments, PUP. This week, it was confirmed that from 17 September the rates for the PUP would change again, putting people under even more financial strain. The Government is loosening protections for renters and cutting income supports before there is any indication that the pandemic is over. We are potentially facing into a second wave. I am surprised the Minister of State stood up in the House today and decided to spin the ESRI report published earlier this week. Contrary to the Minister of State's comments that there has been no short-term economic impact, the ESRI report notes:... it is likely that the scale of the Covid-19 shock is such that, the longer the duration of the downturn, the higher the missed payments, and consequently, arrears rate will climb. This likelihood is magnified if the PUP or TWSS payments are withdrawn or are modified such that the effective rates of payment are considerably reduced.With the exception of the short-term support, the ESRI report also states that some 70,000 people who are currently renting do not have sufficient income remaining after their rent is paid. The Minister of State would do well to read the whole report and not selectively pull out the one or two sentences that support his arguments. The Bill does not provide any effective mechanism, beyond involving MABS, for dealing with inevitably increasing rent arrears. It is not much help to create a payment plan for people when they do not have any money to pay with. The Minister of State has previously noted that many tenants in the private rental sector have not applied for rent supplement despite the temporary loosening of requirements. I have asked some parliamentary questions, which have been artfully dodged, on what communications campaign was conducted by the Department in respect of rent supplement. The Department did not even update its website in the middle of the pandemic. The first time I heard any Minister refer to it was the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government following his appointment. For the duration of the deep lockdown crisis, there was no communication plan relating to rent supplement. The Minister failed to acknowledge this because, clearly, many people still do not know they are entitled to rent supplement, or even that rent supplement exists. Of the 700,000 people who receive the PUP, only some 8,000 rent supplement claims have been made since March. The Minister and the Department must not repeat this back-seat approach to informing people of the assistance available to them from now on. It is hard to believe that the only real mechanism for dealing with rent arrears is something of an afterthought in this Bill, which does not provide any clarity for the tenants it is actually supposed to help. The Residential Tenancies and Valuation Bill 2020 leaves so many exceptions in the fine print in the context of evictions that there is a concrete risk that homelessness will be on the rise in September once more. On this occasion, however, we will be in the middle of the second wave of the pandemic, which will have an even worse impact on the economy. The changes proposed by the Minister only afford protection from eviction until January to those who can prove that they have been impacted upon by an extremely limited set of circumstances. Unfortunately for renters, unless they have been diagnosed with Covid-19 and told to isolate or have been receipt of a financial supplement "paid for the purpose of alleviating financial hardship resulting from the loss of employment" as a result of a pandemic, they will no longer have any protections. Even if a person is a member of this limited group, he or she will still have problems and will still not be protected unless he or she provides a written declaration to the RTB and the landlord which proves not only that he or she is financially affected but also that he or she is in receipt of Government supports and, as a result, there is a significant risk that the tenancy will be terminated. There is no retrospective declaration included in the legislation and the Minister is not accepting an amendment I put forward in that regard. The Bill does not provide any guidance for what might constitute the significant risk to which I refer. The self-declaration process is unnecessarily cumbersome and places the burden on renters to prove they deserve to stay in their homes. If a renter makes a false declaration - and there is no clarification around what constitutes a false declaration - he or she is criminalised. No-fault evictions are back, substantial renovation evictions are back and evictions for the benefit of family members, including nieces and nephews, are back. At the same time, there is no provision to increase the staffing of the RTB for inspections and protection of renters. What is worse, the Bill provides for the introduction of an offence to criminalise tenants. It does not, however, provide the same treatment for those landlords who use other eviction exceptions under section 34 to get rid of tenants after August 1 in bad faith. If the House needed clear evidence of the thinking behind this Bill, it is clear in this provision. It is not fair or balanced, and it is not proportionate. It says a lot about how this new Government sees renters that this legislation has been left to the very last minute to be examined, amended and debated by both Houses. All that renters want is certainty on the status of their home. Consistently leaving measures such as this to the last minute fails to do that. I thank the Leas Cathaoirleach for indulging me with regard to time.

Before the Covid-19 pandemic, the rental sector was already in crisis. We all know that rents were at unsustainably high levels. The daft.ie index for the second quarter of 2020 tells us that new asking rents average €1,400 across the State. In Dublin, the average new rent is more than €2,000. The RTB index shows an average monthly rent of €1,200 nationwide, and €1,700 in Dublin. The programme for Government promised to improve security and affordability for renters. Fianna Fáil's manifesto went even further and promised a new deal for renters. Yet, the first act of this Government is to remove protections for the majority of renters in the State. The bans on evictions, notices to quit and rent increases introduced on 27 March gave renters a much-needed break. Much more than that, the emergency measures proved what lots of us have said all along, namely, that the vacant possession notices to quit were the single biggest cause of families entering into homelessness. As a result of these emergency measures, we now have the lowest number of families living in emergency accommodation in three years. This Bill has just whipped the rug out from underneath renters' feet. From 2 August, rent increases will be back and eviction notices will be back. The Bill does nothing for the renter who may have lost part of his or her income due to the pandemic, and who cut back on everything else to make the rent. The couple struggling to save for a mortgage while simultaneously trying to pay €2,000 in rent once again face rent increases. The Bill does nothing for them. The Government will tell us that it could not extend the emergency measures because their legal basis was a health emergency. Yet the Bill passed through the Dáil on the day we had the biggest spike in Covid-19 case numbers in weeks, with 85 new cases. We are still in the midst of a pandemic.Is the Minister of State seriously saying that the families who are having their protections removed by this Bill will be safer in emergency accommodation if there is an increase in Covid-19 numbers? Not only are the protections so narrow that they exclude most renters, they are also cumbersome and complicated. Even Threshold, the country's front-line housing advice and advocacy service, has had to criticise them. In drafting this Bill, the Minister clearly did not give any thought whatsoever to renters who have literacy problems, mental health issues or for whom English is not their first language. They will have to navigate their way through protections that are as clear as mud and that will be a gift to the small number of rogue landlords who will easily exploit the loopholes. My colleague, Senator Moynihan, mentioned that we only have to look at the poor uptake of the Covid housing assistance payment to know that not all renters are aware of their rights or how to access the supports that are available to them. Perhaps the most telling demonstration of how bad this Bill is was the fact that the Government could not even get the Minister of State at the Department of Rural and Community Development, Deputy Joe O'Brien, to support it. What is very interesting about the manner in which the latter abstained on the Bill last night is that he has worked for years in homeless services. If he could not, in good conscience, support this Bill because he knows it will make matters much worse, I do not know how anybody could support it. The Government criticised the Opposition and said we were being negative but it refused to accept any of our amendments, which are eminently sensible, constructive and try to help. It could have chosen to extend the ban on notices to quit, evictions and rent increases until the end of the year. It could have amended the emergency legislation to address the small number of cases of wilful non-payment of rent, serious anti-social behaviour or where a landlord is at risk of becoming homeless. Instead, it is dead set on ploughing ahead with a bad Bill that will negatively impact on the rental market, hurt renters and take money out of the local economy because with rising rents tenants will have less disposable income. I will table amendments to try to rectify some of the worst aspects of the Bill but I call on the Green Party Senators to do the right thing and follow the example of their colleagues.

One would think that emergency legislation is rushed through Parliament to protect the most vulnerable in our society but that is not the case today. The pandemic exposed the truth that if one rents, one has little or no security. Also, much if not all of one's disposable income goes towards something one might never even own. This Bill does nothing to address rent increases. Senator Boylan has outlined the rental figures. There has been a nationwide annual increase of 5%. There is much talk from the Government parties that the pandemic brought about certain changes and that perhaps we should not go back to the old days. This Bill provides landlords with a direct route back to the old days. I know many good people who were and who remain in the Green Party but I am disappointed that many of its members voted for this Bill and will probably do so again today. It is a shame that the lasting legacy of the solidarity we all felt during the pandemic will be a greatly and much-needed enhanced cycle network but not an end to people having to live in tents next to them. Before the pandemic, rents were out of control. Rents are still out of control. As a young person living in Dublin, I want to set out the reality of what happens if one is lucky enough to have a job. At least half of one's take-home pay goes on rent. That was the reality before the pandemic and it is the reality now. This Bill is bad for renters. It is bad for the stability of the rental market. It will lead to an increased number of notices to quit and the exit of landlords from the market. It is also bad for the local economy because rent increases reduce the amount of disposable income renters have to spend on goods and services at this crucial time. I have spoken to many business owners in the constituency of Dublin South-Central, in places such as Inchicore, including Craig, who opened a coffee shop during the pandemic, and Ken, who owns the butchers and the local shop. How will their future viability be secured? Many of their customers face never-ending increases. I look forward to the day when the Minister will come to this House with legislation that gives fairness in the long term to younger people and to renters.

It is his first visit in his new capacity. We have learned a good deal. Much of what was said for many years became more clear during the Covid-19 crisis. Issues highlighted and points made by parties in opposition were reinforced. Some of those parties that are now in government should be very aware of that because they were present for those debates. I will take three or four of the lessons learned, because this is very important. We need a change in the way we deal with housing. It is not a mystery that needs to be solved. It is not something for which we need a new guru. For years, very clear messages have been coming from local authority councillors, activists, Threshold, housing agencies and the Opposition benches. Airbnb is a problem. We saw that in the sudden increase in new properties available to rent during the pandemic. It told us just how much had been taken out. It also showed us why there was a real problem - resources were not allocated to track down Airbnb where it had been operating. It should not take the fact that the customer disappears for this effectively black market in short-term renting to be flushed out and become evident. It needs to be followed up now in that those who were acting inappropriately outside of proper legal permission before this crisis would be investigated. Co-living is a disastrous idea which gives rise to massive health risks. I say this sadly because I believe there are versions of co-living which could be positive. I lived in shared accommodation in other parts of the world where it was done properly but the idea of co-living in the dormitory-style atmosphere being put forward is a serious issue. We know of cases internationally whereby apartment buildings have become the source for clusters of Covid-19 because people share stairs and elevators. We will see that happen much more when all those people are sharing a kitchen and the basic facilities. We know that green space matters but a false tension is often created to the effect that it is only the green space that we can use for public housing because we could never interfere with commercial housing. We have had big empty commercial office blocks all around the country, many of which were never rented because their main benefit was the tax benefit they provided to those who invested in them. We know work practices will change. They need to change. Green spaces matter for people who live in cities. They are part of making our inner cities livable. We know that when we hollow out city centres as spaces where diverse communities can live it is bad for businesses also. There is a reason some businesses in the suburbs kept going while those in the city centres died. It is because the latter relied only on office workers who came in occasionally. They did not have the organic connection with the fabric of a vibrant, multi-use, multi-function, things happening together community that many communities within Dublin close to the city centre still have. However, those communities are hanging on by the skin of their teeth in that regard. We also know, and these were points made eloquently by Senator Fitzpatrick, that local authorities are very important. There is a problem when we have an over-reliance on private landlords. That has been said maybe 5,000 times. It is a problem and it is also a choice. Our local authorities, as was said, were set up literally as local housing agencies. There is no reason the local authorities should not be providing the land. They should be positive landlords who can understand, adjust rent and balance the needs of communities and where people can plan. How many families that grew up in local authority housing increased their rent as their family circumstances improved and their children could go to the same school for six years? I refer to what that means for that next generation's opportunities. Senator Fitzpatrick mentioned that the Dublin local authority was able to purchase houses. There was an explicit ban on other local authorities doing that. In certain parts of the country, they were banned from buying houses. Effectively, they paid the same amount for a ten-year lease on a house that they could have bought for, say, €5,000 more.Now, when the market picks up, families that may be living in that, where their children may be located locally, may find themselves pushed out. I urge the Minister of State not to make that mistake again. Build or buy but do not lease. Do not store up a new problem for five or 10 years' time.

Within that, this Bill is looking at private rental. I recognise and this is good that there is an extension to some measures and in respect of rent. There are some positive elements in this Bill but they are deeply undermined by a couple of those same negative core assumptions which are there as legacies. I am not going to slam any Government party or person for how they act on this but we need to learn and to challenge the assumptions. We do not accept everything as given because it did not work in the past. Some of the really problematic aspects are sections in this Bill which we will try to amend. Due to the poor timing of this Bill the Minister of State is not able to do them but I ask him to consider not commencing them. There are fundamental problems on the mistreatment of renters where they are required to sign declarations which could make them criminals. At a time of fear in a crisis this creates more fear. We do not do that for most other people. If a landlord, for example, under this Bill gives an inaccurate rental notification there is a presumption of good faith in so many areas but this simply states inaccuracies. These refer to inaccuracies as to what payments they are on. To be honest, it was very unclear to many members of the Government how some of those payments were working. Is the jobseeker's payment an income supplement? If one is on the working family payment, does that count? There are so many questions, ambiguities and a lack of clarity around some of these payments. There are also many very vulnerable people who can still be evicted. We heard about the small owner, the older person who has one property that he or she rents out. There are also older people who have no property and who might be evicted. I am also worried about them and what it might be to be of a cocooning age, walking the streets trying to get a new place to live in Ireland. Those people matter and the Bill does not address them. One further point as I come to the end of my time - we will get to address all of these points in the course of this debate - is on the question of property rights. It is time to start moving on this. We know that there are rights such as common good, family life, and right to privacy, all of which are in the Constitution. The State needs to start testing this. It is acknowledged in the programme for Government in its commitment to the right to housing because people need the right to housing and it is something that the State needs. As a preamble to that referendum, which I hope comes very soon, let us start taking test cases and let the State start making good decisions and good policy that we know is for the common good. If landlords want to challenge this, let them challenge it and let this take us through the courts and see what they have to say. That will be useful information in how we frame that right to housing when we put it into the Constitution, as is long overdue.

I will begin by congratulating the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, in his new job, which of all the Ministers of State is one of great responsibilities. Perhaps he is first among equals where he is in the eye of the storm. Our country, both landlords and tenants, will be looking for leadership from the Minister of State. This is the crux of the matter. The Government is not an advocacy group but must protect the rights of landlords and tenants and act in the common good. It also has a statutory responsibility to support the good work of the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB. I am quite familiar with the work of the RTB, formerly the PRTB. The Green Party-Fianna Fáil Government appointed me to the PRTB and the subsequent Government of Fine Gael-Labour Party reappointed me. There was an examination then for the third appointment, where one was just a number, which I liked most of all as everyone was completely anonymous. I was reappointed then having passed the exam. I have sat for many years and I believe I was the longest-serving barrister on the RTB’s dispute appeals committee listening and adjudicating on appeals. I have many memories from my days there and they are all good.  The administrative staff of the RTB worked heroically and were understaffed at the time. They called us up during weekends and outside of normal working hours, without any extra remuneration. It was most disappointing to hear Deputy MacSharry have a cheap shot at public and civil servants. That is not my experience of the hard-working people in the administration wing of the Residential Tenancies Board who one never hears about.  Then one has the adjudicators, to whom the dispute goes first, followed by the tribunal hearings - in my time it was three but under the new legislation it can at times sit as one person - all of whom were expert in going to Cork and other places, always under the law taking public transport and arriving back in their homes at 10 p.m. or 11 p.m. I know that this is the wrong climate in which to say this to the Minister of State but in better times, which I hope are not too far away, he will consider better terms and conditions for the good, hard-working, expert people who adjudicate and sit on tribunals for the RTB because they need more recognition. At all times, all parties, be they landlords or tenants, were treated with the utmost respect by the RTB.  I will debunk a common myth that the RTB is a pro-tenant decision-making place. It was anything but that. It was fair and equal. On the statistics from the RTB, in my tenure I have probably written more appeal judgments than most, and they are all published on the world wide web at this stage, because its administration is done in public. I appreciate that in this Bill, due to the pandemic, we have to forsake temporarily the administration of justice in public which is unfortunate but I fully understand this. Both sides in the RTB always got a fair hearing but what is not widely known was that many landlords came before us who were in tears because, contrary to public perception, they were not millionaires but were facing homelessness themselves. My heart went out to tenants and one does everything possible within the legal parameters where one is in within a quasi-judicial role, which is very restrictive in its interpretation by the Act. The landlords were facing a situation where they wanted to sell their property or use it for a family member because of tough times. I am aware that there are hedge funds as well but I am talking about a cohort of landlords. I call them the accidental landlords who are leaving the rental sector.  I understand that the Minister of State must strike a balance and there are legal restrictions in how to strike that balance between constitutional property rights as enshrined in our Constitution and as interpreted by jurisprudence, including in the well-known Madigan cases where what I would like to see and what is perhaps legally and constitutionally permissible are two very different things.  I would do everything possible for tenants. I always have. I was a founder of the New Beginning group of lawyers who kept mortgage holders in their homes when there was no legal aid or personal insolvency regime on a statutory basis in this country. That may be yesteryear but I was involved in the RTB up to a couple of years ago, or less. It is so important to strike that balance. This Bill clearly extends notices of termination periods, and prohibits rent increases but in certain circumstances, and this is obviously not enough for this part of the House. I accept that, but to do more, under legal advice which I am sure goes with every proposed Bill that comes before the House, one does not want to see something struck down in its entirety. If we are really serious about this, the place to tackle it is the Constitution. An amendment would give us the power to do the things we would love to do. We should take a cross-party approach. A right to housing is called for in the programme for Government. Enshrining this right would strengthen the hand of tenants, who, through no fault of their own, have come under incredible pressure. It is important to address this in a way which balances both rights or droves of accidental landlords will leave the market. The rental system in Ireland is broken. I accept that. However, it is so disproportionate to think that a blunt instrument contained in one Bill can fix the rental system, which is a part of the overall housing system and affects homelessness. It does not deal with the problem we face. Over-reliance on a silver-bullet solution in the form of this Bill cannot work. We need a much more holistic approach to keeping people safely in their homes. We must take an evidence-based approach and balance the rights of landlords and tenants. I fully agree that this should come before us on a regular basis. Right now, I do not hear a huge clamour to sell properties. If I did I would be very concerned. I will conclude on this note. If a tribunal makes a declaration calling for a property to be vacated, it is usually very generous and gives a long stay of execution. Then a landlord must go to the courts to enforce it. There is time to get this right and keep it under regular and constant review. I will be very open-minded about that.

I have known the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, for a long time. I served with him on Mullingar town council before the great decision to dissolve the town councils was taken. I also served with him on Westmeath County Council. I have no doubt that he will excel in his new position as Minister of State. We are delighted to have two new Ministers of State in Mullingar, Deputies Peter Burke and Troy. It has certainly been a great addition to Westmeath. I would like to build on the points made by Senator Martin. I have listened intently to the arguments made by the Opposition. Some good points have been made. However, there are many which do not stack up. I have an in-depth knowledge of the property market and, in my experience, the Government has devoted a wall of money to this problem. I am sure the Minister of State can provide an exact figure. I do not wish to argue over facts with a particular Senator, but my experience has been that councils are actively looking to purchase houses. A huge amount of money has been spent on this. The Minister of State did not argue this point because he was listening to the various contributors, but I am sure he can give us a figure.

My experience and the experience of the people I talk to throughout the country is that if a case can be made for the purchase of a particular house by a council, the purchase happens. I have seen this personally; I have been involved. I ask the Minister of State to clarify the position. There are a couple of other points. I have listened intently. Based on some of the opinions that have been expressed, Senators must have been reading a different Bill than the one I read.

The legislation seeks to protect both landlords and tenants. I do not own any property and neither does my family, but we must accept that we need landlords in the system. As has already been stated, many people are left houses by parents, uncles or aunts. Such people will say that renting property out is a nightmare, particularly if they cannot sell it on. In the few seconds I have left, I wish to say that homelessness is a blight on our society. Whether one is in a rural meeting in County Roscommon or a meeting in inner city Dublin, one can see that it upsets people. We all have a responsibility to deal with the matter more effectively than we have in the past. That is why I want to acknowledge the contribution of every Member here. Many valid points have been made.  At the moment, we are in a crisis but this is an ongoing situation. I welcome the Minister of State and wish him well. I hope that we will be able to use his Roscommon connections to solve all our housing problems. This is an ongoing situation and it is particularly difficult at present. I acknowledge that we will all have to do better when this crisis hopefully comes to an end. We will all have to do things differently to ensure that tenants are not pushed out onto the roadside or forced to live in a hotel room or, as has been known to happen, in the back of a van. That is upsetting to everyone and it must change. I am sorry my time is so limited. I welcome this Bill. It will give some protection to tenants.
#BarryWard	unknown-#BarryWard-party	unknown-#BarryWard-dob	unknown-#BarryWard-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-07-31 00:00:00	Teachtaireachtaí ón Dáil - Messages from Dáil	62	I intended to specifically address section 14 but, having listened to the debate, there are a couple of other points I wish to discuss. I have been struck by the piety of some contributions, particularly on the part of Sinn Féin Senators, and the contradictions contained therein. As is their wont, and as they did before the election, those in Sinn Féin promise everything but are not in a position to deliver anything. In fact, the vacant promises we have heard from them are more damaging than anything else. We heard from one Senator that this Bill must not be allowed to continue because it will remove caps on rents and enable evictions. A second Sinn Féin Senator stated that the Bill would drive landlords from the market. Nothing is surer to drive landlords from the market than a situation in which they cannot control the rent they are levying and have no way of dealing with tenants who wilfully refuse to pay it. Such tenants do exist. Landlords are expected to just suffer through it. The reality is that all of these provisions are balances of rights, in most cases between a tenant and a landlord. Landlords are not always bad. Many landlords in Ireland are small individuals with one or two properties. Some did not even intend to become landlords. They are all beholden to the banks. Perhaps that is the root of the problem. No quarter is ever given by the banks to people who are having difficulty in paying their mortgages. Many of us have been here before. I have previously stated that the banks will give a borrower an umbrella on a sunny day and ask for it back when it rains. They do not care about people. They do not care about small landlords or the tenants who are beholden to them. They are a major part of the problem. I also want to respond to something Senator Higgins said. I respect her contribution and I agree entirely with what she said about allowing local authorities to do their job and to become the housing agencies they were in the past. The Minister of State and I have had this conversation before.Part of the problem is the right to buy. I have been a strong supporter of that in the past because it is a really important opportunity to allow certain families to move beyond the particular place that they are in, but the other side of that coin is that it significantly reduces the stock that is available to local authorities on an ongoing basis. That should be examined. I implore the Minister of State, in a broader context, to empower local authorities, specifically to empower the members of those local authorities, the councillors, throughout this country who want to do good things for the people they represent, to action the things they need to action to get solutions on the ground in areas that they know better than anyone. The Custom House needs to release power to local authorities to allow them to do a better job on the ground than they are being allowed to do at the moment. That is a really important part as well. I wish to speak about section 14, which is the last section in the Bill. Essentially, it makes amendments to the Valuation Act. This is something I discussed with the then Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, around the beginning of the lockdown due to the Covid situation. It specifically applies to my former local authority, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown. The valuation system in and of itself is an antiquated one. It involves the juxtaposition of the Department of Finance in one regard and the local authority in the other in the creation of commercial rates. A local authority strikes the annual rateable valuation, the multiplier essentially of the valuation applied by the Department of Finance or the Valuation Office, which I think has now moved out of the Department of Finance. The difficulty is that the Act requires a revaluation every five to ten years. The maximum it can be is ten years. What this does, essentially, is it delays the revaluation in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown by up to a further two years. That is really important because we are in such a state of flux at the moment that the inflexibility of the Valuation Act means that the Valuation Office has to proceed with the valuation, notwithstanding the fact that right now it is very difficult to assess the real value of property. Unfortunately, we had this ten years ago in Dún Laoghaire because the revaluation took place for us in 2010 and at that time the marker for the valuation of properties was the 2007 figures, which was pre-bust, which meant that one had a situation whereby properties were revalued at massive rates and almost every retail business in the county saw a significant increase in their rates. Revaluations are always supposed to be revenue-neutral for the council, so it increased the rates for some and decreased the rates for others. What actually happened was the rateable valuation of the retail properties went through the roof and those retailers could not afford the rates increases. They appealed them to the Valuation Office and subsequent to the rate having been set by the council, their rates were reduced, which meant that Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council was left massively out of pocket. I am really pleased this provision is included in the Bill because it will mean that is less likely to happen again, but in the broader context we should be looking at the Valuation Act and whether the rigidity of it is appropriate or if we should be giving more flexibility to local authorities.

He has a very difficult task. I am particularly interested in local government. For the past four years I sat on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government and I would like to sit on it again. There is a lot more work to do. Fine Gael has been in government for nine years and with no disrespect to the Minister of State, I am quite tired of people coming in here talking about a programme for Government. My colleague, friend and Senator on my right speaks about his involvement in the Residential Tenancies Board and makes a very eloquent case to support all of these amendments, if the Minister of State were to take them on board. I took the trouble of checking the membership of the Residential Tenancies Board before I came into the Chamber. This is the Residential Tenancies Board of which one of our colleagues in the House is a member. The board states: "No one can be made to leave their accommodation (other than in limited and exceptional circumstances where a breach of tenant obligations takes place and an RTB Determination Order is sourced through the dispute resolution process)." That is a good start. That is something I think everyone would agree with. I do not see why anyone could vote against the Bill. I am somewhat amazed by the backlash or resistance to these amendments. I thank the Labour Party, Sinn Féin and the Civil Engagement Group for going to the trouble of preparing 40 amendments. From inquiries I made before coming in here, I understand that the Government is not going to accept any of them. Perhaps the Minister of State has not told the House that yet, but that is my understanding. If that is the case, it is an absolute disgrace that people could come into this House and nod their heads as if it were all very enlightened and interesting but the Minister of State has already signed up to reject the amendments. I had not even spoken when I heard that all the amendments would be rejected. What does that say about our Parliament and our democratic process? I hope and appeal to the Greens here today, with their track record on this issue, to at least support some of the amendments, or if they have a real difficulty at least to abstain, because we cannot have them talking out of both sides of their mouth. Let us consider the Rebuilding Ireland document. It was introduced to the House by the then Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney. He said no one would be in a hotel within a few months. I spoke to six people today who are in emergency accommodation in a hotel. Then he asked the committee to give him another few months, and then a few months after that he ran out of the Department and he did not achieve what he set out to achieve. We have not heard too much from him yet about housing. One could ask the reason for the tenancy problem. It is because we have a shortage of good, public housing. Everybody should be allowed rent in good public housing and it should be managed according to the principles of the RTB. I say to the Senators here today that they should push their amendments. Let the Government Members come to vote. A simple majority is all that is required. Half of them have more than likely left the House. If they have gone, perhaps they will turn back from Kerry, Cork and Donegal to vote. How many Senators are tenants and landlords? How many people are up to date in terms of their declarations? I presume they all are. There are no journalists here, but I say to them that they should dig and find out who are the landlords who are Deputies, Senators or Ministers and why is there resistance to bringing in some decent protections for people. I spoke to a man and his partner yesterday who went to view accommodation and the first thing the landlord said is that it is a shared house so cash would be required. The second thing he said was that he did not want them in the house for more than three hours in the middle of the day because they live there too. Is that acceptable? Members can come in here in a few months' time and say that it is all awful. We should remember that Fianna Fáil was sitting on these benches in the Dáil six months ago. Let us remember what it told the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government about how he had failed and was not delivering. Fianna Fáil is in government a few weeks later and it is acquiescing. It is part of this old act. I say shame on those Members. How many of their daughters and sons are in unfit accommodation? How many people are forced to pay under-the-counter top-ups? Lots of people are. Members know it and I know it. I spoke the other day to a woman with three children who told me she was paying €2,500 for a flat in Bray but she had to get the last €500 from her mother because she has to make an under-the-counter payment. Do Members think that is good enough? I do not believe they do, but we now have an opportunity to bring in legislation to do something. I appeal to politicians with any sense of decency about tenants' rights to support some of these amendments.

I support the Bill because of how it is going to further protect tenants. I wish to respond to a couple of the issues that were raised. I strongly agree with my colleague, Senator Ward, when it comes to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government. We do not have a Department of local government in Ireland, we have a Department of centralising government. In the coming years, we must ensure that powers, in particular with regard to housing, are devolved to local authorities so that they are in a position to fulfil that very crucial function. I also agree with what Senator Ward said about a review of the Valuation Act, although I would go a lot further. This is something we need to look at. We need to consider abolishing the commercial rates model as a way of funding local government entirely. It dates back to the era of King George IV. It is a completely anachronistic model for funding local government. I would be even more radical than Senator Ward in terms of what he proposes. Building supply is crucial. I agree with what Senators Fitzpatrick and Higgins said about the importance of getting local authorities back to building local authority homes but I am a little nervous about them buying because what we have often seen is that when local authorities look to buy homes, in some cases it distorts the market and it is often first-time buyers who lose out.I would prefer to see an emphasis on local authorities building. I will address some of the specific concerns about the implementation of this legislation. It should be ensured that there are sufficient staffing levels in the Residential Tenancies Board and the local authorities so that people will be on hand to answer questions about these regulations and to help people go through the process. It is all very well having the necessary protections in place but if we do not have the staff in the RTB or the local authorities, we will have a problem. I would like assurances from the Minister of State in that regard. In response to issues others have raised, there should be an information campaign in simple English and a number of other languages so that the rights and obligations of tenants and landlords under this legislation are clear. The crucial point which a number of speakers, including my colleague, Senator Fitzpatrick, have raised is that the biggest challenge in this area relates to supply. We have to start building again. The lack of supply has driven up rental costs, which has made it more difficult to rent. It has also given rise to the increase in homelessness which is, as Senator Murphy said, a blight on our society.  These high rents have meant that tens of thousands have been excluded from aspiring to own their own home. In my hometown of Gorey, it costs approximately €1,200 a month to rent a three-bedroom house if one can find one. The housing assistance payment, HAP, comes nowhere near meeting that cost. For many individuals and couples, a mortgage would cost a lot less. We must ensure that the rent those individuals and couples have paid is considered when they apply for a mortgage. The appointment of the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, will make a real difference. This comes back to a crucial point. A number of people have criticised Fianna Fáil but this is what differentiates Fianna Fáil from other parties. I disagree with Senator Conway's earlier comments in praise of the approach of the former Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy. The difference between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael is that Fine Gael believes in a market-led approach. We support free enterprise and understand the construction industry and its workers but, where the market fails, the State has to intervene. The State must intervene in order to ensure supply.  We are also different from those in Sinn Féin and on the hard left who do not believe in the right of individuals to aspire to own their own home. We support the idea that individuals or couples should have the right to build or buy their own home. Senator Boyhan might reflect on the market-led approach to issues adopted by his former party, the Progressive Democrats. This approach has failed in the area of housing. I welcome this Bill. It provides sufficient short-term protections but it must be remembered that it is not a silver bullet. The real solution to the housing crisis is to increase supply. The test of the success of the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, over the coming years will be the number of social and, in particular, affordable houses they build. They should get to it.

We worked together in Longford-Westmeath for a number of years and I know that he is an extremely capable public representative. He will do an excellent job in the Department and I wish him well. I will back up what Senator Davitt said. Having been a member of the local authority in Longford for the last ten years, I have seen the support that has been given with regard to purchasing housing within the county. This is real money, unlike the Apple money which Sinn Féin was spending prior to the election. I welcome the Bill. It is necessary to protect tenants who are having difficulty paying rent due to Covid-19 and I will fully support it. I acknowledge the numerous issues that have been mentioned. Homelessness has been mentioned. I praise the work of the Simon Communities in the midlands. It does a tremendous amount of work for people in the midlands who have been made homeless.  One issue that has arisen during the Covid-19 pandemic is that of remote working. I believe we will see the housing market in Dublin freeing up as more people live back down the country and work from home. This will have an effect on the market in Dublin, increasing availability and bringing down prices.  I will pick out a couple of points in the Bill. At one point it refers to the Residential Tenancies Board as an intermediary with regard to disputes. I firmly believe that the powers of the RTB need to be increased. We need to look at stronger legislation, including legislation to protect some landlords. Many of them are accidental landlords. We must also protect residents who live close to tenants who have been involved in anti-social behaviour. I know of numerous cases in which tenants have been found guilty of such behaviour yet landlords and local authorities cannot get orders for them to be removed. Senator Keogan and I spoke yesterday about the help-to-buy scheme. It is not available to anybody who wishes to purchase a second-hand house. It only applies to newly-built houses, of which there are none in many counties. In my own county of Longford, no newly-built houses are available for purchase. We need to develop an affordable housing strategy to create sustainable communities. I ask the Minister of State to make this a priority not just for my own area but for the country as a whole.  When we are developing and planning these communities, we need to consult with the existing residents and families and to listen to their concerns so that we do not impinge on their quality of life. I ask that the Department look at a number of these points. I am confident that the Minister of State will deliver in his Department and I wish him well.

We must talk about how we got to where we are today. The simple fact is that we are in this difficulty because, for the last couple of decades under both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, there was very little or no building of public housing. That is how we got into this mess. Both of the conservative parties decided that the market would do. That is the fact of the matter. That is what happened under Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.

I want to talk about Limerick, where rents have increased to more than €1,200 for a two-bedroom apartment. There has been double-digit growth in rents. Let us be very clear; this Bill will allow rent increases to commence once again. We in Sinn Féin do not believe rents should be increased right now. I actually believe that if a landlord is getting more than €1,200 for a two-bedroom apartment on the Dock Road in Limerick, that is plenty. Surely to God, before we allow rent increases to begin again we should build in further protections for tenants. One thing that always amazes me, perhaps because I spent time abroad, is the stumbling block both conservative parties have about giving tenants real security of tenure. The idea that, if a house is put up for sale, the landlord has the right to remove the tenants is fundamentally wrong. In the rest of Europe, tenants have a right to stay in those buildings. What is wrong with Irish tenants? What is wrong with the conservative mindset of both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael that they will never make that move?  It is interesting that, when it was in opposition, Fianna Fáil backed a motion in the Dáil which would change this provision. That reminds me of a quote from Marx, by which I mean Groucho Marx. He said, "These are my principles, and if you don't like them... well, I have others." That is Fianna Fáil summed up in a nutshell. When it is in opposition, it tries to play the role of a party that is slightly on the left. Now that is in government and nicely ensconced under the wings of Fine Gael, it is a different matter. The people I will meet over the weekend and next week, the terrified tenants, know there is no difference between the parties.  I will provide a concrete example of this. In my village of Castleconnell, there is a rogue landlord who has already told his tenants that, as soon as these restrictions are lifted, he will increase their rents. These are working people who struggle from week to week and from month to month to pay their rents. What the Government is doing today will allow this man to increase these people's rents. They will have no protections. That is the reality. Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil stand for rent increases while Sinn Féin stands for tenants. I am proud of the side I am on.

The previous speaker said that Fianna Fáil did not build local authority houses. I have just checked the data and they show that when my party was last in government, in the period up to 2011, it built an average of 5,000 local authority houses per year. It is important to put that on the record.

They have a huge task ahead of them and the people of Ireland are depending on them to deliver on it. I wish that we did not need the legislation we are discussing today but we do need it because of the very broad impact of the Covid-19 crisis. There has been a huge increase in unemployment and many people in the residential rental sector have faced job losses, restricting their ability to pay rent and putting them at risk of losing their temporary homes. The legislation imposing restrictions on evictions that was introduced in March led to a 56% drop in the number of families presenting as homeless and in need of emergency accommodation. Those legislative provisions clearly have worked and it is important that we continue with them for the time being. The private rental sector was in crisis before Covid because rents were and continue to be at an unsustainably high level. In County Kildare, for instance, the average rent is €1,440 a month, which is an increase of 4.5% on last year. The rental sector is in crisis because we do not have enough affordable housing provision and there is not enough social housing being built by local authorities. That is not the fault of the councils but is the consequence of a legacy of problems with red tape over the past nine years that has hindered their efforts to get the funding to build houses. Since I became a public representative, housing has, year on year, become the biggest issue I deal with. People contact me about it every single day. It is the issue about which I feel the most frustrated and worried that I am letting people down. I cannot do anything to support them in their absolute need for a home in an area in which to put down roots, know where they can send their children to school and be part of a sustainable community. On average, people are waiting ten to 12 years in Kildare for a home. In recent years, I have been particularly sad to find an increase in men and women, particularly single people, in their 60s, 70s and 80s not having a home to call their own. I find that incredibly depressing and a really sad thing to see in the Ireland of today. One of the problems we are seeing is the proliferation of housing agencies. When I asked the director of housing in Kildare County Council about this last year, he told me he was dealing with 57 different housing agencies throughout the county. That is wrong. Local authorities should be getting the finance and support directly to build houses as opposed to having to deal with 57 separate housing agencies. I would make the point that housing co-operatives cannot buy their own houses. The principle of home ownership should apply to them as well. Let me be clear that I am not and never have been a landlord, but I have been a renter. I rented for 16 years, including three years in Dublin when I was in college and 13 years in Newbridge when I moved there to start teaching. I do not see younger family members and friends of mine being in the position that I was, after 13 years of renting, of being able to buy my own house. That is the problem we are facing today. People of all ages and all incomes cannot afford to buy a home because there is not a sufficient plan in place to provide affordable housing. I support the Bill. It is very important that we have it in place for the reasons I have outlined. There is a mentality out there that all landlords are bad. That is completely wrong. I want to stand up for the majority of landlords and tenants who work well together. They want compliance and transparency. Everybody needs to work together to ensure housing is delivered for those who need it, including those who are vulnerable and those who are working hard to get to a position whereby they can have their own homes.
#MarkWall	unknown-#MarkWall-party	unknown-#MarkWall-dob	unknown-#MarkWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-07-31 00:00:00	Teachtaireachtaí ón Dáil - Messages from Dáil	72	I welcome the Minister of State and wish him well in his role. I look forward to working with him. My party's spokesperson on housing, Senator Moynihan, outlined our concerns regarding what is a very flawed Bill. Senator Boyhan noted that there are 40 amendments tabled for debate on Committee Stage. Senator Moynihan and other colleagues will talk us through those amendments in due course, which seek to address the flaws in the Bill. I have several points to make that are relevant to the debate. The first is to address what Senator Davitt said about the wall of money made available to county councils. I can only say that this Wall has not seen the wall of money to which he referred. Both Senators Fitzpatrick and Higgins noted that local authorities have an opportunity to purchase one-off houses. I draw the Minister of State's attention to a case in County Kildare - one of several such cases - where contracts were signed with the homeowner in November last year for the sale of the property to Kildare County Council. That person has now been told that the council, on the instructions of Government, can no longer go through with the purchase. This is directly in opposition to what is happening in Dublin City Council and other local authorities. Clearly, Kildare County Council is not part of this particular purchasing policy. As I said, I am aware of a number of such cases. Senator Fitzpatrick correctly noted that some landlords will sell their houses to maintain a tenant in the property, but Kildare County Council is being told this is not an option. Will the Minister of State confirm whether that is the case? It is what I have been told. I want to place on record my thanks to the public servants who deal on a daily basis with housing queries. I am sure we will all join in thanking them for their work. There has been a lot of talk in the past week about what public servants do or do not do. I totally abhor what has been said in some quarters. Day in and day out, public servants go about their work. In particular, the staff at housing counters throughout the country deal with people who are at the limit of what they can endure. Their quality of life when they come in to engage with our public servants is at an all-time low. It is important that I take this opportunity to record my thanks to those public servants who deal with people who are going through the trauma of not having a home. The HAP scheme was mentioned by a number of speakers. There is a serious problem in County Kildare in regard to what I refer to as inter-county HAP arrangements. To give an example, in my town of Athy, a house recently became available 1 mile from the town boundary but over the county boundary in County Laois. A person who was in a homeless situation was not able to take that property under the HAP scheme, even though it would have resolved her situation. My colleagues in the Dáil have put in a number of parliamentary questions on this issue and the response from the Department is that such decisions are a matter for the local authority. However, Kildare County Council is saying that its direction from the Department is otherwise. Can the Minister of State tell us whether something will be done once and for all about inter-county HAP arrangements? I am sure other Members have encountered the same issue in their areas. It would help to solve the housing crisis if local authorities could override county boundaries and offer HAP properties that are located only 1 mile or 2 miles from a particular town or village. I heard this morning on my local radio station, Kfm, that 167 people were in homeless accommodation in County Kildare in May. When we take into account the corresponding numbers of 124 for County Meath and 27 for County Wicklow - all three counties being part of the mid-east region - it paints a very bleak picture. I received up to ten phone calls relating to housing before I came to the Chamber today. Senator O'Loughlin referred to our reliance on voluntary housing. We have to get away from this. We must get rid of the hubs that have been created. Once and for all, we have to build council houses. They were good enough for generations of people. Let us go back to building council houses. Our reliance on voluntary houses has to stop. Less than two hours ago in a WhatsApp message, a person asked me to "Get me out of here". This legislation will do nothing to help that person.

Many of the Bills that have come before us this week have been completely rushed. I will support several of the amendments that have been tabled. Earlier this week, Senator Fitzpatrick spoke about the number of people who have died in our city of Dublin. People are dying in many cities throughout the country, whether in hostel accommodation or on the streets. This should not happen. It is probably one of the reasons Fine Gael lost the general election. The biggest catastrophe the State has experienced relates to how we look after those who are most vulnerable. When I saw a child eating off a cardboard box on the streets of Dublin, it certainly did not make me proud to be in local government at the time. This week alone, while I may be sitting in this Chamber I am also dealing with people who are being evicted from their houses by mortgage companies and banks. I am dealing with people who are being evicted from their houses because the landlords are selling them. They cannot find anywhere to rent. I do a lot of good things in my life but I just do not have the time to focus on trying to find houses for people to rent. I just do not have that ability. I do not have the time to do it. They are crying out for houses to rent. People cannot get landlords to take housing assistance payments. In parts of County Meath, where I am from, the housing assistance payment does not even meet two thirds of what people are looking for. In Dunboyne, Ratoath and Ashbourne, for example, people looking to rent a two-bedroom property will pay €1,500 to €1,800 for it. The HAP may only provide €900 to €1,000. We will have to look at this or we will end up with more homeless people. One good thing about Covid, and there is only one good thing that I can see, is that it reduced our figures for homelessness, according to Focus Ireland, from 10,000 to 8,000. Whatever we did right during that time, we need to continue to do it for these people. We look at the level of supply and we realise that there is simply not enough. If we look at the local development plans, whether in Kildare or Meath, we are told that fully serviced land has to be dezoned. We are told we can only build 4,000 houses between now and 2024. This will not meet the needs of those who require housing in County Meath. We will have to look at the development plans being done throughout the country and see how we can improve the supply of housing in these areas. With regard to section 4, the written declaration could cause problems for people that I and county councillors deal with on a daily basis. There are 500,000 people in this country who cannot read or write. I do not know how many times I have filled in documents for people who cannot read or write. Many local authority members throughout the country do the same. I do not know what the Minister of State will do about this. The document will mean absolutely nothing to these 500,000 people. I do not know how the Minister of State will communicate to the most vulnerable but he will have to get the message out to them that help will be there for them. I can jump up and down here with my colleagues, I can object to every amendment or I can propose and second every amendment but it will not do anything because it will be defeated. I want the Minister of State to do better for those who are most vulnerable and those who need support, whether it be the tenant or the landlord. I want the Minister of State to be there for both.
#PeterBurke	unknown-#PeterBurke-party	unknown-#PeterBurke-dob	unknown-#PeterBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-07-31 00:00:00	Teachtaireachtaí ón Dáil - Messages from Dáil	74	I thank all of the Senators for their comments. I listened to them all intently and have taken notes on each one. I appreciate the genuine comments because we need to assess all sectors of society we represent and ensure we are as informed as possible as we legislate. Senator Fitzpatrick made the case for getting more houses for local authorities and meeting the targets. Obviously, this is very important. Last year, there were 25,000 and, up to the end of March last, there were 10,000 social housing units through blended measures. It is very important that we continue at pace to serve the needs of those who are most vulnerable. I note the programme for Government places significant urgency on this and renews it, which is very important. With regard to the points Senator Fitzpatrick raised, it is very important to note that the ESRI and Threshold have made a determination. Threshold's most significant concern relates to rent arrears. This is what we are responding to. We are legislating to protect the most vulnerable tenancies in our State to ensure we get through the very narrow gap as the Covid-19 pandemic evolves from a stark position whereby everyone was in lockdown and the movement of people was prohibited except where essential, to now, as we are restarting our economy and moving through each phase. The issues are reverting to rent increases and protecting tenants from this and from eviction. It has to be linked to a sound determination. It is very important that I say this. I appreciate Senator Fitzpatrick's kind comments on our call in respect of housing. This matter is very important. I am working very closely with the Minister on it. I look forward to having a very good relationship with him. It is essential for the programme for Government that we work well together. I am sure we will do our very best to respond to this crisis. Senator Conway spoke about the local authority building programme and building and buying houses. It is very important that we get a blend of measures. Significant urgency is now being placed on our local authorities getting back to building houses. This is very important. It takes time to get this shift but the programme for Government is also very clear on this. Senator Conway mentioned planning for housing and the emphasis on the mistakes that were made in the past. This is why it is very important that we have a national planning framework to deal with planning and ensure that we are building in the correct areas and that our towns and villages do not suffer.That is one of the key elements of our towns first policy. There is a significant amount of positive action in the programme for Government to deal with these pressure points. Senator Mullen also raised matters relating to housing in rural Ireland. Again, I revert to the national planning framework and Housing First. He mentioned the case of some of our smaller landlords, a point that is missed by a significant proportion of people in this debate. I have figures from some research I did this morning. From 2016 to 2019, 6,500 fewer landlords have been operating in the residential market, which is a 5% reduction. When we house people we need a model to ensure there are tenancies but there is a reason landlords are leaving the system. We must ensure any legislation we produce does not have an adverse impact as there must be housing for people. It is also very important to note that 70% of landlords just own one property, with 86% owning one or two properties. It is a significant proportion of landlords and we must be careful not to demonise one sector. Senator Mullen articulated the point very well. Senator Mullen also mentioned the property tax and there is a deferral mechanism contained in the legislation for people who fall into difficult circumstances. That is there for all to see. He commented on Airbnb, which has been contentious, and the Government takes this point seriously. Local authorities have been given funding to increase and review cases where properties are used for Airbnb. There have been 757 properties identified over the past number of weeks as we move to putting more resources into the area and 633 warning letters have been issued. In the Dublin area especially we are really working on this to ensure we can protect tenants and make properties available. Properties used for Airbnb require planning, which is a key point. I thank Senator Moynihan for her comments. I have different views from her perspective on the Bill. She said I was spinning the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, report but that is absolutely not the case. I am working to get legislation through here that would strike a balance. If there is a change and we experience a second wave of the virus, neither I nor the Government would have a problem with responding through primary legislation to meet demand. I am currently legislating for the circumstances in which we find ourselves today and ensuring protections are advanced to tenants, including the most vulnerable tenants, which is a key point. It is all about trying to get a balance between the sections. The Senator commented on the narrow scope of the Bill but there are a significant number of employers using the wage subsidy scheme, with employees effectively underwritten throughout this crisis. Such people have key access and if they feel their income is under pressure or they may fall into rent arrears, a response is provided for in this legislation. Senator Moynihan said there is no retrospective element in the legislation. If she read the legislation, she would see section 5(4) applies and her point was not well made. I have heard the concerns set out by Senators Boylan and Warfield. I am trying my best to advocate this legislation as a measure to protect the most vulnerable, which is the most important action we can take. The Senators' views on how to respond to a very significant crisis are different from that of the Government; that is quite clear and the Senators are fully entitled to articulate those today. Ultimately, we must ensure there are more homes each year for people, and that is what we are doing. It is very easy to identify problems when one would not be accountable for it. We can see in the North of Ireland the changes made were minimal and in this jurisdiction we are going much further. I dealt conclusively with the Airbnb matter raised by Senator Higgins a moment ago. It is not the case that local authorities are banned from buying houses. My local authority in Westmeath is currently buying houses. The Senator may wish to interrupt-----

On Committee Stage Senators may intervene until the cows come home but they are not coming home yet. The Minister of State has possession and Senators are not allowed to intervene and interrupt him.
#PeterBurke	unknown-#PeterBurke-party	unknown-#PeterBurke-dob	unknown-#PeterBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-07-31 00:00:00	Teachtaireachtaí ón Dáil - Messages from Dáil	76	I take the Senator's point on the building of homes. We must have a blend of measures, including getting back to home building in local authorities. It is what we are trying to do and there is a renewed emphasis and strength in that with the programme for Government, which is very important. The Senator also mentioned the right to housing and related significant matters, and we must respond to those. The programme for Government takes a view on them. Action on the ground, such as putting infrastructure and houses in place, will make life better for people than just changing the wording on something but I also note the aims of the programme for Government in this regard. I listened to Senator Martin's contribution and it is great to have somebody who has experience working with the Residential Tenancies Board. It was interesting. He spoke of the common good and we are working to achieve a balance in the common good so we can respond to ensure those in our most vulnerable tenancies in our State can be protected. This Bill achieves that through a narrow scope. It is important to strike the balance mentioned by Senator Martin. I thank Senator Davitt and all Senators for their good wishes, which I genuinely appreciate, as I will need them in this job. It is a very challenging role, as we can see. The Senator mentioned acquisitions and 2,772 houses were acquired in 2019 through the local authority process. Senator Eugene Murphy spoke of the blight of homelessness and I absolutely agree with this. We have all met people in our clinics affected by this and feel for them, and we are all trying to resolve this matter as fast as we can. I thank Senator Ward for his remarks. He spoke about the Valuation Act 2001 as referred to in section 14 of this Bill, articulating the challenges that existed in local authorities before this. He also responded to remarks from other Members in the Houses. I listened to Senator Boyhan's remarks, which were very partisan, if I might say so. He may take the view that he is fed up of some people coming to this House over the past number of years but I have come here to do my best. I am not a landlord but the Senator implied we are in certain categories or boxes. I am a husband, a father and I hold clinics where I meet people from the most vulnerable parts of society. I have not heard any big ticket solutions from the Senator. I am trying my best to put through a piece of legislation that would respect the most vulnerable people in our society. We have done a good job in this regard and the programme for Government does a similarly good job in articulating the actions to be taken. There is an idea that people can throw others into categories, saying X is this and Y is that. The majority, if not all, of people in this House and the Dáil are trying to do their best for others. They have been elected with a mandate. The Senator might speak about amendments not being accepted but we all have a democratic mandate. This House will decide anything I wish or do not wish to press. It is not me but the House that decides such matters, and that is democracy in action. The Senator might argue the points on any other issue but that is what it comes down to. Senator Byrne articulated well how we are trying to change from acquisitions to house building, which is very important. We have a renewed urgency in this regard. There were references to the past and the former Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy. From 2016 to 2019, he met his targets: in 2016 the target was for 4,240 units and over 5,700 were delivered; in 2017 the target was 5,050 units and 7,095 delivered; in 2018 the target was 7,869 units and 8,422 were delivered; and in 2019 the target was 10,000 and more than 10,000 were delivered.This was through a blended approach that involves all the different measures. He did his best. We must work harder to provide solutions for people. It is great to hear problems being identified. I am in the business of providing concrete solutions that will protect the most vulnerable tenants in our State. That is the balance this Bill strikes. I thank Senator Carrigy for his comments and goodwill. It relates to what he said regarding the pressures in our cities. The national planning framework clearly captures how we will be trying to expand in the regions over the coming decades. We must follow that as the guide in terms of how to improve our society and ensure that we build in the most appropriate places because planning will always be intrinsically linked to housing. One cannot have a house without proper planning and the proper processes to govern that. Senator Gavan went through a number of issues relating to his home area. It is very important to note that, as a constituency representative, I am not immune to the most vulnerable, significant cases on the ground, which I meet every week in my clinics. Some are very distressing. We work to try to resolve them. That is what I am here to do. Sometimes it is advanced that certain people have a patent on compassion and understanding and they think everyone else has a different view on life. That is not the case because I know the real issues on the ground. I was a councillor for a number of years before I was elected to the Dáil. I am committed to doing that and to ensuring that most vulnerable are protected and treated with respect and compassion. That is what this Bill aims to do. I appreciate Senator O'Loughlin's comments. She articulated very clearly the way the rent crisis relates to social housing. It is a case of supply and demand. There has been criticism in the past but we have come a long way. We are not too far removed from the era of ghost estates, deficits in our infrastructure and trying to rebalance that to deliver houses in the face of all the challenges brought about by a growing economy. This is a significant issue that must be responded to with a blend of measures. That is what we are trying to do in this programme for Government. I thank Senator Wall for his comments. He is concerned about HAP. It is possible to travel through county boundaries. There is an application process there. Once someone reaches the income thresholds for the relevant county for which he or she is going forward, he or she is able to do that. The Senator also mentioned the number of homeless people, which is a matter of acute concern for us all. There are many services working with the most vulnerable. Along with the Minister, the Government and its partners, I want to do my best to ensure that we can meet that demand and do our best to resolve it. I appreciate the many views that were put forward. We are under pressure to get this Bill through the Houses because there is a time constraint involved. The Bill is needed now. We need to give key protection to tenants - those at the coalface of Covid-19, those who have had their incomes reduced and those on various different payments the State has put in place. We urgently need this response. We cannot delay this legislation. I sat in the Dáil yesterday and went through all the amendments here again this morning. I am confident that this Bill meets the requirement of getting the balance right between the two actors in this process and ensuring that protections are in place for tenants who face the most acute eviction notices. The ESRI, which produced a report, and Threshold are operating at the coalface. I am very happy with the balance struck.

There was an incorrect line reference in amendments Nos. 2 and 11. Much of this was due to the circulation of the Bill late last night. We got it from the Dáil. The Clerk of the Seanad, the Clerk Assistant and the staff were working late last night to ensure that the legislation was ready today. However, because of the number of amendments and the late hour at which we received the legislation, an error occurred. Consequently, a substitute numbered list has been circulated.

I am not going to get excited by it but I would suggest that he did not hear what we were proposing or anything from me. I do not like to get too personal so I will not do so and will talk through the Chair. This is a process. There are five Stages in a Bill. If the Minister of State has plenty of time and wants to hear plenty, I am happy to stand here and talk for a long time. I am standing in solidarity with other Senators and I support what they have done. This is my entitlement and right. For some reason, the Minister of State has difficulty in understanding my proposal. He singled me out by name and said he had a difficulty. He did not hear what I proposed. On this side of the House, we can work together. I am of the view that these amendments are valid and should be put. I put it to the Minister of State, who did not answer me, that he has made a decision that all these 40 amendments will not be supported. That sends out a clear message about the Government to the effect that it is not prepared to give any consideration in terms of seeing anyone else's side. I shared my experience of being a member of the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government for four and a half years and the bellyaching I heard from politicians on many sides about what they were going to do for tenants. Remember that Fine Gael has been in office for nine years. The Minister of State tells me that he does not understand or hear what I am trying to say. I am saying clearly, and the record of the House will show this, that I support the amendments. It might be helpful for us all - I am conscious of time - if the Minister of State indicated that it is his decision not to support them. We can spend all of the time here, someone can then get up and guillotine the thing and the newspapers tomorrow will write about another saga in Parliament regarding how people are being shut up and prevented from engaging in the political process. Is it the case that the Minister of State will not accept this amendment or the other 39? If that is the case, then so be it. I am a realist and will go home but if it is not the case and there is any chance the Minister of State might accept one amendment, I will stay and debate matters.

However, it is disingenuous to suggest that it is simply the decision of this House because the schedule of the Oireachtas is set by the Government and the Government has chosen that the Dáil rose before the Seanad debated this legislation. This is a very important aspect. I urge the Minister of State to feed information back to his fellow Ministers. There are potentially 11 Stages to each item of legislation. There are five Stages in each House and then there is the Stage whereby if changes are made, the relevant Bill goes back to the initiating House. That needs to be planned for in legislation. If we are brought legislation in a situation whereby if we amended it, there is no Dáil to respond to our changes, that is appropriate or proper respect for due process. This issue must be addressed.I know that we are keen to move on to section 4 in which there are fundamental issues we must address but before we do, I will say that there are unforeseen consequences in section 3. We have seen examples of unforeseen consequences when legislation is rushed. That is why it is unfortunate that the Minister of State is not leaving himself the opportunity to respond to an issue if one is identified. I would like the Minister of State to indicate whether there will be new residential tenancies legislation coming through in the autumn. Will there be an opportunity for us to engage on the substantial issues that are being raised here and on which we have been told we cannot engage because this is emergency legislation? When will we have the opportunity for an holistic discussion and real thinking about doing housing in a different way? That is what people on all sides of the House have been calling for.

I have written down the names of everyone who contributed so, if I omitted the Senator, I did so in error. I tried to get back to every single person so I did not pick out everyone individually. I agreed with some Senators and not others. The point I made to Senator Boyhan was that he was trying to categorise me when he asked how politicians are landlords. I responded to the Senator because I will not tolerate that. I am very clear about that. I know my background and where I came from. I work very hard in this job to deliver for the most vulnerable and ensure that we strike a balance here. I want to be clear that I have no issue with discussing all of these amendments and that is what I am here to do. Anyone with proposals that are of merit, as some of these amendments are, will be listened to and those amendments can be explored with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government. We must assess the pathway that the pandemic takes when considering legislation. We may need to come back and do primary legislation if other challenges emerge. We will do that and the Government will not be found wanting in that regard. Let there be no doubt that I am happy to debate these issues and to further engage through the committee. I will bring any concerns that are raised by Senators back to the Minister and the Government.

I would appreciate it if the Minister of State could give me some comfort.

There will be a multimedia campaign embarked upon by the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB. It is obviously in all our interests that tenants can understand the process, particularly the most vulnerable who have challenges with regard to reading and writing and have had difficulty understanding forms in the past. This form will be simple and help will be available. The RTB will also point to information in that regard.

I also look forward to being on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government. I do not know if I will be a member of that committee but I hope to be and will do everything I can to make that happen. I think I have a strong record on housing, planning and local government so I just want to say again what I have said before. It is important that we get this right. The great thing about this House is that it is on the record. I previously posed the question as to why there was such resistance to amendments in both the Dáil and the Seanad. That was the first thing I said. I then asked how many politicians are landlords. That was not to ask the Minister of State if he is a landlord. I know everyone who has land that we want. We have a process whereby politicians make declarations that are published every year in newspapers. Other things are also published but those declarations are on the record of the House and, I presume, are up on our website. There was no intention to suggest that the Minister of State is a landlord. Anyone is entitled to be a landlord.  The Minister of State shared a statistic I did not know, that is, that up to 80% of landlords owned one or two properties. We are talking about many people who bought a little investment that could act as a pension, or whatever. I have always been an advocate of rental accommodation being provided by both the public and private sectors.  I would not like the Minister of State to leave this House thinking that there was any slight or inference on him because that was not my intention. I want to clarify that because I would not want that impression to be given. However, I do ask a question which was also raised in the Dáil. I took the trouble to print off some of the transcripts from last night's Dáil debate. I want to make clear that there was no effort to in any way undermine the Minister of State or make any inferences and I would not like him to think that. Having said that, I think the question I asked is legitimate and I repeat it: how many of our politicians are landlords and why is there resistance to bringing in legislation? As the Minister of State has rightly said, it is a matter for the House. It is a matter for the Government to refuse to support the amendments. I accept that and have been around long enough to know that is the case. It is nonetheless disappointing and does not augur well for us, going forward, if every day we come into both Houses of the Oireachtas and are told we are not going to get support. It was not long ago when people were on different sides of the Houses. Opposition is a frustrating place to be, but we all have a job to do and a mandate. As the Minister of State rightly said, we all know first-hand of people who have difficulties. I wanted to clarify the matters to which I have referred and hope that the Minister of State will accept that clarification.

As I have already mentioned, it should also be provided in a number of other languages, particularly of Polish, Lithuanian and so on, because that would be beneficial. I will make it clear to Senator Boyhan that I am neither landlord nor tenant. I share the Minister of State's concern that a piety emerges when people start to talk in defence of landlords. I was not aware of the statistics that the Minister of State outlined and it is interesting to note that 86% of landlords own only one or two properties and 70% own only one property. As others have said, many landlords are in that position accidentally. This is about the balancing of rights.  I agree with what the Senator said about the declaration of interests on which Members clearly outline if they are a landlord or a tenant. I think most people are good landlords and good tenants. I would sincerely hope that situations in which Deputies refuse to pay their rent and run up a rent bill of €12,000 with a charity, stopping others from being able to rent, would also be publicised. Situations involving bad tenants also need to be addressed. Many of us know that a small minority of tenants in local authority houses do not pay their rent and leave those houses in appalling states. There is also a small minority of tenants in private rented accommodation who often leave the landlord with a very large bill because of the state in which they leave the rental house. There is another side to that. I entirely accept that there are dishonourable landlords who will use any excuse to try and increase the rent and will not provide the necessary services to tenants. Like the Minister of State, I deal with queries from both landlords and tenants about the challenges that they face. The crucial question to ask about this legislation is are we striking the right balance in an emergency situation. That was the basis on which I made my decision about the legislation. I share Senator Higgins's concerns that the Dáil decided to go into recess before the Seanad passed this Bill and that rushing of legislation is a cause for concern.I am happy, however, that the Minister of State has indicated there may be a need in the autumn to introduce primary legislation. I welcome that and if there are concerns this at least will provide safeguards until January. If concerns materialise over the summer, I hope we would have a lot longer to consider those in the autumn.

Nobody wants to have a situation where, as we have, every piece of legislation that has come before the Twenty-sixth Seanad has gone through all Stages in a very short period of time. In every instance there has been a logical and necessary basis for that, but nobody thinks it is desirable. I have discussed this with many of the Ministers who have come before the House and I am pleased to say that many of them have, as the Minister of State, Deputy Burke has today, acknowledged the fact that there is room when we resume in September to take up issues that have arisen in the course of debates here and address them in a more considered and perhaps slower way than we have at the moment. I agree with the Senators' comments that it is undesirable to rush legislation through as we are. I say this while recognising the necessity for some of the provisions here, including the fact that we will not sit again until September and in the context of the current crisis we are going through. I also want to address, much in the way that Senator Byrne did, the comments of Senator Boyhan, a man who was my ward colleague in the local authority of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, a man I know very well and for whom I have great respect. I do have difficulties, however, with the question he asked on Second Stage and which has been addressed by other speakers, on who landlords are. It is a matter of public record.

The specific reason was that Senators Boylan, Ruane, Higgins and I met for an hour before this debate to go through the amendments. For the purposes of time we discussed grouping issues and putting some amendments through a voice vote and others to a division. We did this work to try to lessen the impact on other Members of the House. As I sit here there is a back and forth with Senators getting in and making massive speeches on an amendment I have moved. I ask that Senators please not do that. If Senators are going to do this it will have been a waste of our hour before we came into the Chamber.

As I said earlier, there is no issue around going through the amendments. Looking down the list there are amendments we went through in absolute detail that have huge merit in terms of receivership and indefinite duration that we are absolutely prepared to look at in the autumn. There is no doubt on that, but I ask Senators to bear in mind the urgency attached to this legislation and the 1 August date. We really need to get these protections in quickly.

I have heard "balance" more times today, and it is a good job we are not playing a drinking game when it comes to the word "balance". There is no balance in this section because the Government is asking renters to sign declarations that, if they get wrong, could possibly lead to them being declared criminals, while the same is not being done with regard to landlords. Amendment No. 2 is asking that the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, assess the information it has to hand and to make the decision that the tenant is giving the information in good faith. If we trust the RTB to adjudicate on disputes why are we not allowing it to adjudicate on a person's circumstances? This is the reason there is no balance. Amendment No. 3 is about the word "significant" and there being no legal definition of "significant" risk. How will one assess the people who are eligible under these emergency protections if one does not have a legal definition of significant risk?
#AliceMaryHiggins	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-party	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-dob	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-07-31 00:00:00	Teachtaireachtaí ón Dáil - Messages from Dáil	115	I support the amendment. We may not press all of these amendments to a vote but with the amendments being grouped in section 4 there will be just two opportunities to speak to the amendments in this section. I put it to the Minister of State that there are a lot of problems with section 4. If the Minister of State cannot accept our amendments, and if he recognises the merit in our arguments, I urge him to consider not commencing section 4. I will be very frank. I believe it opens up significant concerns and fears. I spoke on Second Stage about the fear people might have when they have to make a self declaration. I was concerned about whether people who are cocooning or people of different ages are covered. I went again to see who is covered and who is a relevant person. The Government is asking ordinary citizens across Ireland to make this declaration - and I will discuss the matter of an offence in the next section, which is its own problem - but we must consider the literacy issues as highlighted by Senator Keogan, and that more than half the population have digital literacy issues. How will such a person decide if he or she is a relevant person? I apologise to my colleagues and I will not give long speeches on other amendments, but this is important. As a legislator who has been legislating for years and is familiar with reading legislation, I was trying to determine who is a relevant person. The section raises the question of whether a relevant person is on temporary wage subsidy, a supplementary welfare allowance, or any other payment from public moneys for the purposes of alleviating financial hardship. Is this a jobseeker's payment or is it for alleviating financial hardship? Perhaps clarity is needed. Will the new jobseeker's payment, due to come into effect in the next few days, definitely be covered in this section? It is currently not named. Again, a Government amendment to this effect might have been useful if it was intended. Instead it says "any other payment". Is the working family payment covered here? If a person receives the working family payment is he or she a relevant person in this regard? Perhaps a family had been on very low wages but is now reliant on the working family payment. Is this enough to qualify a person as a relevant person for this legislation? Let us consider the other criteria a person might need to be a relevant person. Section 4 says the relevant person will be a person "to whom subsection (7) (inserted by section 5 of the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020) of section 40 of the Act of 2005 applies". Let us check back into definitions and interpretation where many lines in six different Bills are mentioned, and we find that "the Act of 2005" means the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005. We then go to find subsection (7) of that Act. Subsection (7), as inserted by the new legislation relates to those in local authority housing, including Traveller accommodation. Great. Now we know that people who live in local authority housing might not be evicted under this proposed legislation. That was a little bit of work. Let us now look to see about the other category of relevant persons being "belonging to a category prescribed under subsection (8) of the said section 40". Let us roll back to see what section 40 is. That would be section 40 of "the Act of 2005", which is the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005. Now we must look for the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, but it is not updated on the website. I had my assistant go to work on it but we could not find things in the paper. We contacted the Bills Office. We looked in the Irish Statute Book and eventually after 40 minute's work we discovered that the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2010, which is not mentioned anywhere in this legislation, actually had amended that section. We had been told there was no section 8 in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 as published.They inserted a new subsection (8) into section 6 of the 2010 Act and it states: "Without prejudice to subsection (7), the Minister might make regulations ... in relation to persons or classes of persons who may certify that an insured person ... [is] incapable of work." We have done all that work and we have got to a part at the end that tells us there may be some regulations the Minister has made in terms of who is qualified but that is subsection (8) as it was in the 2010 Act. The fact that a new section 7 was inserted in the emergency provisions legislation might mean that what was section 6(8) in the 2010 Act has now become subsection (8). Section 6(7) of the 2010 Act refers to a person who has a document from a registered medical practitioner categorising that he or she is incapable of work and which he or she has provided to an officer of the Minister. Is it what was previously subsection (7) of section 6 of the 2010 Act, which may, since the emergency legislation, have become subsection (8) of section 40 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, which states that the person has to have a certificate from a medical practitioner or is it the new section 8 as inserted in the 2010 Act, which is now a subsection of section 40 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, which states that it is a person who the person has made regulations to say that they are incapable of work? I am a little unclear about that, and I am a legislator who has been working in the area of legislation for years. I do not know if the Minister of State can categorically tell me which of those it is.

Let us be clear. That is what we are asking citizens to figure out and if they do it wrong, they will be afraid - we will come to the question of the sanction - that they will make a wrong declaration. I appreciate that the Minister of State has indicated that plain English will be used and that the RTB will be involved. However, it would have been much more sensible if he accepted the points made and the amendment, which states that we should let the RTB, which is expert in this, categorise it and not put a new scary document in front of people for them to sign that they are not sure of and who are already scared because of Covid-19. This has not been thought through. I urge him, if it is possible to do so, to commence other parts of this Bill and not to push the declaration aspect. I ask him to not commence elements of this section. If that cannot be done, the senior Minister needs to assign staff resources to deal with this, not just have an online campaign. Will extra staff be hired? Will there be staff in county council foyers who people can meet and who will help them complete these forms and declarations, particularly as people will be afraid?
#BarryWard	unknown-#BarryWard-party	unknown-#BarryWard-dob	unknown-#BarryWard-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-07-31 00:00:00	Teachtaireachtaí ón Dáil - Messages from Dáil	119	Senator Higgins raises a legitimate issue that needs to be addressed. However, I propose to speak about it in respect of later amendments. Amendment No. 5 is not grouped with these amendments. The point she raises is legitimate, which is the reason I was very pleased to hear the Minister of State indicate that there would be a public information campaign. I do not know if huge numbers of staff are required but it is important to distinguish between the point Senator Higgins has just made and the fact that we are asking citizens to look at legislation and understand what it means. Unfortunately, that is not the practice and it is an issue I raised in respect of other legislation in this House already. We cannot expect citizens to read this legislation, the regulations that go with it and the legislation that it amends. I am a practising barrister and there are times when I have to go back, as Senator Higgins has just done, through reams of different items of legislation that have been amended. I find that very difficult to do and it is easy to miss something. For that reason, we do not expect citizens to do it. That is why there are officials in Departments and agencies and lawyers and other people whose job it is to do that and to put the matter into plain language. Unfortunately, because of the specificity required for legislation, we cannot write it in the plain language we might like to write it in although that does not mean that there is not room in legislation - in fact in all the Bills we have seen already - to make the language clearer. I believe there is room but I do not believe that the test we apply to whether this legislation works, or is scary for that matter, is whether an ordinary citizen can read it because if that were the test, I do not believe we would ever pass it. Reference has been made rightly to ordinary citizens who might have literacy difficulties, linguistic difficulties if English is not their first language or whatever it might be. There are many reasons they would not be able to interpret this legislation in the way we would like but that cannot be the test. The Senator makes a valid and fair point. It is something we should always have in mind when we are passing legislation. However, just because it is complicated does not mean that it does not achieve what it is meant to achieve or that it is not valid in that regard.

I am new to dealing with legislation. I have been dealing with people all my life. In the constituency in which I live, 77% of the population identify as non-Irish and there is a very high level of disability. Historically, we had very high levels of illiteracy also. The housing crisis is most acute in my constituency and every day I would help people who are struggling either with the threat of homelessness or are in homelessness. When I read this legislation, I identify a relevant person as being anybody whose income has been negatively impacted upon and who is struggling to pay rent. It would be welcome if the Minister of State could confirm that that is what the term "relevant person" means. In terms of the issue of the declaration, my reading of the legislation is that it will be specifically defined by the RTB because it will be charged with the administration of this process but I heard the Minister of State say that the declaration can be a handwritten letter or an email. It is critical, however, that it identifies the person, identifies clearly and honestly their circumstances and then can be used to prevent that person from becoming homeless. It can be used by the State bodies to support that person to avoid a rent increase or eviction. That is my understanding of it. The only people who should be worried about being guilty of an offence are people whose incomes are not negatively impacted or may have increased but who are trying to claim these protections. I refer to people in receipt of public housing like Deputies refusing to pay their rent for four years. I would appreciate it if the Minister of State would clarify those two points, but my understanding is that it will be in plain English and that the citizens information bureaux, the RTB and all of the wonderful local authority councillors who deal with tenants every day will be there to support tenants at risk of becoming homeless or of a rent increase.

That is the key point. As I said, and to be very clear, if someone is in rent arrears, they are suffering because of the Covid-19 pandemic and their income is reduced they can make this case, self-declare and the RTB will adjudicate on it. We will put together a multimedia campaign to ensure that everyone is informed, that the forms will be written in plain English and that it will be very clear to people. We will also issue guidance, when the legislation is passed, in respect of social welfare but we are not putting the onus on individuals. If someone is in rent arrears, he or she has the process to deal with that but in terms of the effect of amendment No. 2, how will the RTB know who is in effect in arrears? There must be a process in place and it must be clear and defined. That is the effect of amendment No. 2. In the context of amendment No. 3, I know that the word "significant" is subjective but it is key in terms of the identification of people and for the process they have to go through. What is significant for one person may not be significant for the next. That is why the RTB has a clear role to examine that impartially and make a determination. On amendment No. 11, section 5(4) makes matters very clear in the context of retrospective treatment.

I wish the process was as Senator Fitzpatrick described it.It would be very reasonable for people to write letters describing their experience. Senator Moynihan's amendment provides that the RTB would be able to tell people if they qualify, but according to the Bill, they must declare that they qualify. That is different. My specific question was on the effect of a relevant person and who was a relevant person.

We should not be including something like this in the Bill as a criminal offence. It is a very cumbersome process. I echo Senator Keogan's point that we have a problem with literacy, particularly among non-Irish nationals, who are more likely to be living in rented accommodation. Including them as a criminal offence is very disproportionate. At the briefing with the Department on Monday, officials said that people can use their judgment about what a false declaration is, but making something a criminal offence is an excessive provision.

The concerns expressed by Senators on Second Stage and in moving this amendment are real concerns with a real basis. The people identified are exactly the people to whom Senator Moynihan referred, those with literacy difficulties for whom English is not their first language, or those with disabilities, including intellectual disabilities and so on. I can understand where this amendment is coming from in terms of the creation of a criminal offence in section 4(2). The concern is that people might make a mistaken false statement or accidentally say something that is not true, correct or fully correct and might subsequently find themselves before the courts answering for that mistake. However, that is not the way that the criminal law works. I spoke earlier in the week of our criminal justice system which is very fair. One of its tenets is that one does not commit criminal offences by mistake, there must be an element of mental intention to commit an offence. The concerns are that people might unwittingly make a mistaken declaration and subsequently find themselves before the court answering, in a criminal context, for having made that mistake are probably unfounded. It is not immediately clear how the matter might proceed in terms of the prosecution of any offence under this but I suggest, and this is an area in which I have worked for a long time, that one could not prosecute people under this subsection unless they had wilfully and intentionally made a misstatement or an untruth on the form. Anything short of that would not pass muster in terms of the protections that exist within criminal law, the requirement for a mental intent, and the requirement for it to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. They exist regardless of level, whether it is the District Court or a jury trial in a more superior court. While I wholly accept the bona fides that underlines the amendment and the concerns that are genuinely held, they are unnecessary as the system exists in such a way, which applied not only in regulatory matters such as this but everything from shoplifting a Mars bar from a shop to public order offences and very serious offences, with the golden thread that goes through to protect individuals who are charged with these offences. The concerns that underpin the amendment are unfounded because the system already takes account of people making mistakes or accidents and they are not liable to the criminal law for them.

I support the amendment for the deletion of the offence. I have put down amendment No. 5 which covers a very similar ground to that in amendment No. 6 tabled by Senator Boylan. These amendments are us, in good faith, as Opposition Senators, putting forward what we believe are useful clarifications that would have made it a lot simpler. Currently the Bill states, "A person who makes a declaration referred to in subsection (1) that is false or misleading in any material respect shall be guilty of an offence." That is frightening language for someone to read. I accept what Senator Ward says about the court taking a nuanced definition of intention and those familiar with navigating the court systems or who have solicitors who advise them on their financial matters and so on, may well be confident in that regard, but most people think "false" means "not true". We discussed how complicated it is. On what Senator Fitzpatrick described, it would be much better if it was an application. Why not put in an application without an offence, where the person may put down the case, they send the application to the RTB and the RTB tells them that they qualify? That would have been a smoother, better process. However, the problem arises from a more fundamental issue, an assumption that I mentioned at the very beginning that we need to dive into, around who one trusts and who one does not trust. Later in the Bill, we will discuss how any notification for rent overdue will be passed on with no scrutiny of whether that is accurate or not. We imagine that if landlords put in the wrong amount, and it turns out that is inaccurate, the RTB might point that out to them - that is what we are asking for - but that will not be an offence. There are all kinds of presumptions at play. It is correct that it is all in the law anyway, so those who are sufficiently advantaged do not need it to be in the law because they already have it. The problem is not how this might play out in the courts but how it plays out in people's kitchens and sitting rooms, when they are on the phone to their mother and they are trying to figure out if they qualify, and if they have a landlord who tells them they are in danger. We know this, and we also know it from employment legislation, that where people are afraid that they might make a mistake, that is an issue in itself. We know it happens where there is a landlord who is notifying people of their evictions and a tenant is believing that they are not entitled to be evicted, and the landlord or some quasi-legal person on their behalf tells them that the tenant better be very careful because of what will happen if they make a mistake in this. We do not know how many people might not seek and claim the chill effect. We already know that in the course of the Covid epidemic, there was under-claiming of rent allowance and HAP. For many who have been on these payments, it is their first time being on a social welfare payment. They do not actually know the system at all, let alone have the confidence to say, "I believe the exact payment that I am on directly exactly qualifies".  I really regret that the Bill is being rushed through. I would like to think that were it not being rushed, the Minister of State would take these amendments on board. Senator Boylan's amendment is possibly more neatly worded than mine and better, where she said that it should not be made "deliberately or intentionally". That may apply in an interpretation before a judge but it would be nice if it was clear. This is not saying that everyone needs to read the primary legislation, that is not the issue. Normally it would not be an issue because we normally look at who must implement or interpret it.However, it is couched in terms of the declarations people must make. If it turned out that a declaration was wrong and if a landlord wanted to go to the RTB to say that the people involved stated that they qualified but they did not, then the declaration could be declared invalid. That would be enough. It can happen but my point is that it would have been sufficient and that there is an excess of requirement here. I can see that the Minister of State is frustrated but he can imagine the frustration the persons who face eviction are going to feel. Let us imagine that and carry it through. He mentioned that there is going to be an awareness campaign. Will he, hopefully now, address the points that Senator Ward made in the context of clarifying how he sees the framing of the offence of what constitutes a false, misleading or inaccurate declaration being interpreted and what is his expectation in that regard? Will reassurances be provided by means of the awareness campaigns we are hearing about to people to the effect that they are not in danger of criminal prosecution if there are inaccuracies in what they include in a declaration?

Senator Ward is right in that if this goes to the courts, it will more than likely be thrown out or it will never make it to the courts in the first instance. He would say that as a middle-class white man. He views the law in a completely different way to someone who is a Traveller, an uneducated individual or, perhaps, a member of the Roma community. It is very different when a landlord says to a person to be very careful about filling in the declaration because that individual could be prosecuted because he or she knows that the law does not treat him or her the same. We are trying to be constructive. I am sorry if the Minister of State is frustrated and that this is the Friday of a bank holiday weekend. He wanted to rush this Bill through, however. We are trying to protect the most vulnerable in society. By not accepting the amendments or taking on board the constructive advice that we are giving, he is putting vulnerable tenants at risk. I know that landlords abuse their position because there is a power imbalance in our society. The provision will be abused.

#BarryWard	unknown-#BarryWard-party	unknown-#BarryWard-dob	unknown-#BarryWard-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-07-31 00:00:00	Teachtaireachtaí ón Dáil - Messages from Dáil	136	There is an important point here. I have spent 14 years of my life representing the very people that Senator Boylan talked about, namely, members of the Traveller and Roma communities and those in the parts of society that are done down by officialdom. I have defended those people and I know very well what life is like for them. There is a suggestion that if we change what is in this Bill, the kind of landlords to whom Senator Higgins mentioned, that is, those who are unscrupulous are not going to say exactly the same thing anyway. There is also a suggestion that if we change the language and put in two words that mean exactly the same thing, that will somehow change the way people approach this matter. There is a further suggestion that the very people who are disadvantaged in society and to whom Senator Boylan refers in the context of her amendment are going to be reading this legislation in the first place. They will not be doing so for exactly the reasons that I mentioned earlier. This amendment creates an apprehension that is ill-founded and unnecessary. The legislation is clear in what it says. The law is clear. It is not just this legislation, the matter is covered by common law, regulation and the application of that law in the courts. People will not be done down by the fact that this uses simple words such as "false" and "misleading" as opposed to the other language that it is being proposed. I understand where the Senators are coming from but they should not throw it back on me and suggest that I somehow do not understand how this system works. I do because, as I already pointed out to Senator Boylan, I have fought for these people for 14 years and I will not be lectured on the subject by her. I know very well how the system works and I also know that the amendments proposed here are unnecessary. They are not going to change the situation one jot. There will still be unscrupulous people who will try to manipulate those who are done down by society. That is still going to happen no matter what amendments are accepted. Rather than throwing stones across the Chamber, we have a Minister of State who has considered these matters, has engaged on them, has taken on board what has been said but who disagrees. That is the difference. It is not frustration, it is disagreement. If, however, one disagrees with Sinn Féin, one is always on the wrong side of the argument. I will not take lectures from the Senator.

My concern relates to the confusion that has been put out there for tenants. These are very vulnerable people who we may be scaring into thinking that they are facing prosecution. Can we not just remember the core point here regarding tenants' rights, the RTB, seeking advice, making a declaration and the information and assistance available. It is up to the RTB to decide if it is going to prosecute someone. There has to be a level of penalty for someone who wilfully misleads. That has to be the case. The RTB is fair. Senator Martin went into detail on how the RTB operates. He spoke on the basis of his experience of sitting on the board and working through the cases. The Senator also outlined how impartial the RTB is. It is not going to prosecute vulnerable tenants for genuine mistakes but will work with them and public information will be provided on this. I have assured people that there will be a significant campaign in providing advice regarding how this simple process will work. We need to be very clear. We do not want to be scaring vulnerable people who will need this support tomorrow or over the next few days and weeks. I want that message to go out loud and clear. I am in no way frustrated but we have to respect the rules of debate. I refer to circumstances where Senator Higgins shouts me down before I can finish my responses to her questions. That was the only point I was making.

I welcome the Bill, but I am extremely disappointed by the watering down of protections for tenants contained in it. It represents an unfortunate weakening of the social solidarity we saw during the Covid-19 lockdown, when we introduced strong emergency measures to support vulnerable people, the unemployed and tenants in the private rental market. It is extremely depressing to see this Government withdrawing these protections at the earliest possible opportunity. The Bill has already prompted a host of Opposition amendments in the Dáil and in this House. It has already cost the Government two votes in the Dáil, including that of a junior Minister. This should be enough to give its supporters cause for concern.  Amendment No. 12 is a straightforward change. It would delete an extremely mean-spirited provision of this Bill. It is identical to a recommendation I proposed during debates on the emergency Covid-19 legislation in the last Seanad in March. As the Minister of State knows, tenants acquire legal rights according to the length of time they remain in the property. In the context of a rental market where protections are extremely weak by international comparisons, tenancy rights under Part 4 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 are extremely important to ensuring stability and security of tenure and protecting vulnerable tenants from homelessness. They become even more important during a pandemic, when a person's accommodation becomes a key part of his or her protection against a virus. Due to the eviction ban instituted in March and the extension of notice to quit periods proposed under this Bill, tenants have remained and will be remaining in their homes for longer due to the increased legal protection from homelessness rightly provided by the Oireachtas. However, this subsection would ensure that the extra time for which a tenant or a family is allowed to stay in a home as a result of these protections is explicitly excluded from any assessment of tenancy rights. This provision was wrong in March and it is wrong now. People have been forced to remain in their homes for months as a result of public health advice issued by the Government. They have been legally prevented from leaving. To expressly prohibit time spent under a legally enforced quarantine from contributing to the tenancy rights of an individual or family and their ability to stay in their own home is not fair. The provision must be removed. I urge the Minister of State to accept this amendment.

The key question at the moment concerns linking Part 5 protections to the emergency and the additional protections that are afforded. We must strike a fine balance to introduce a measure that will be constitutional and will work. The Department has assessed this in detail and it is our considered view that as we move through the stages of reopening the economy, protections must be linked to the paying of rent in the normal manner. If a tenant is under pressure or is unable to pay due to the emergency, this Bill will provide the protocols enabling him or her to seek protection. The Department takes the view that bringing Part 4 protections into this is too big a step and will not stand up.

The issue is that people have been living in their homes and paying rent for a certain period but this time does not count where their legal rights are concerned. This is not a protection concerning tenants' ability to pay. It addresses the fact that the period for which tenants reside in their homes does not entitle them to legal rights. It does not make any sense. I do not understand the relevance of the Minister of State's response to the amendment I have put forward.

I am supporting Senator Ruane's recommendation. Our Part 4 protections are quite weak when compared to protections for tenants internationally.There are multiple ways in which Part 4 has been chipped away at over the years in previous legislation relating to residential tenancies. There have been multiple exemptions and loopholes. There are many ways to get around people having Part 4 tenancies. Incentives have been given to landlords in various Finance Acts to carry out certain kinds of refurbishments. In these incentives, a balance was not struck between the benefits for landlords and preventing the erosion of the rights of Part 4 tenants, even though amendments were tabled which would have had this effect. We need to examine the issue of balance. The fact that the programme for Government mentions a right to housing should indicate a new perspective and a somewhat greater ambition with regard to how the question of balance is interpreted. As I said, we should be open to implementing what we believe to be good policy and then allowing people to challenge it if they wish to. This is important. I also concur that this is not necessarily about persons who are not paying rent but about recognising Part 4.
#BarryWard	unknown-#BarryWard-party	unknown-#BarryWard-dob	unknown-#BarryWard-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-07-31 00:00:00	Teachtaireachtaí ón Dáil - Messages from Dáil	149	I may be mistaken but it is my understanding that Part 4 - and specifically section 67(2)(b) - relates to the obligations of a tenant under an agreement which he or she has made as part of a tenancy. Where such tenants fail to abide by conditions, whether paying rent or another condition, this section puts a limit on the time it takes for a landlord to take action against them. Section 67(2)(b) provides for 28 days. Section 5(5) of the Bill we are discussing does not allow for the period during which, as Senator Ruane said, tenants were under compulsory lockdown due to the Covid crisis to be counted. I am very sympathetic towards the notion that tenants should be allowed to count that time but, as I said earlier, all the provisions of this Bill involve the balancing of rights. When talking about these issues, there is sometimes a danger of thinking only of the nasty landlord and the helpless tenant who may be out of pocket due to a lack of pay and of therefore thinking the benefit should always be given to the tenant. As a general statement, I have sympathy with that but we should consider a situation in which a person was in a tenancy in March and had not paid rent for a month before the commencement of the lockdown. This amendment would allow such persons to continue in their tenancies without paying rent or attempting to do so. I do not think it is common for tenants to wilfully take advantage but it does happen. The danger of this amendment is that it may allow tenants in that position to live rent-free at the expense of the landlord who might have to make significant mortgage repayments to a bank. The person who owns the apartment - and who may own it in title only because the bank actually owns it - may still have significant financial obligations which could easily drag them under. The danger with this amendment is that it does not balance those rights. People who are behaving badly may avail of the law to protect them and to allow them to continue to behave badly. As stated, I have sympathy with the notion that we must protect people who are left at the end of a short rope during a lockdown such as that we experienced in response to Covid. I have sympathy with such a notion but the problem is that we must always have balance in these things. Section 5(5) seeks to create that balance and not to allow people who are already behaving badly to avail of the law to continue to do so. I understand the intent and the import of the amendment but I am concerned that, if it were implemented and section 5(5) removed, it could create unforeseen difficulties for people who have obligations to banks.

This amendment is about protecting people and allowing the months for which they are living in a given accommodation to accrue towards giving them protection rights. It does not, in any way, shape or form, allow such tenants to live rent-free or to break any other contractual obligations. All the amendment does is protect tenants living in houses and allows the months for which they are living there to accrue for the purposes of building up their rights. There seems to be some confusion. If the confusion is on my part, I am willing to listen to an explanation, but I do not believe it is. When we tabled this amendment in March, we did a lot of work. This does not allow people who are not paying rent to stay in accommodation. It has nothing to do with preventing the eviction of tenants who refuse to pay rent. It is about allowing tenants to count the months they lived in a given accommodation during the Covid lockdown in building up their rights to stay. Under the legislation the former Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, brought in last year or the year before, if someone lives in a residence for certain set periods of time - one year, two years, three years and six years - he or she will accrue certain rights. This legislation says that time spent living in a residence during the Covid lockdown no longer counts towards the time one has accumulated living in that residence. This amendment seeks to correct that.

I want to be very clear on that. Those who seek the declaration will be unable to accrue additional rights if they are not meeting their obligations. That is a different section. We have to finely balance rights with regard to those who avail of the declaration. The case of those who do not avail of a declaration is totally different. They will continue to accrue rights under Part 4.

I have heard a lot about tenants in today's debate. There seems to be an argument that we do not understand what it is like to be a tenant. As a tenant for many years, I know what it is like to be asked to leave one's accommodation. I know what it is like to be told that, because of the amount of time one has spent in a place, one has a given number of months to find somewhere else to live. I know what it is like when the bank takes over a property and the landlord is no longer there to allow one to stay in the accommodation. From working in Galway County Council, I have also seen the opportunities for people to try to benefit from the HAP. I welcome the fact that this Bill extends the period during which people cannot be evicted until 10 January 2020 if they make a declaration that they have been affected by Covid. They will not be evicted and will not have to move and their rents cannot be increased. This can only be a good thing right now. This measure is designed to improve the very precarious nature of tenancies across the country. We have all experienced that. I very much welcome it. It is good to hear the clarification that people may still accrue months towards their Part 4 rights if they have not made a declaration with regard to Covid.

I noticed a hopeful comment in one of his earlier contributions when he mentioned receivers and the question of the definition of landlord. If he is not in a position to accept the amendment at this point, I hope he might be able to address the question of expanding the definition of landlord and also deal with receivers. I think he made a positive passing comment about addressing that issue in an earlier exchange so I wish to give him an opportunity to tell us about his intentions in that regard.

In page 8, to delete lines 3 to 5 and substitute the following:
“Amendment of section 106 of the Act of 2004
8. Section 106 of the Act of 2004 is amended by the insertion of the following subsection(4)—“(4)Subsection (1) of this section may be satisfied by the online streaming of proceedings from the date of passing of this Act to 10 January 2021. If the online streaming of proceeding under subsection (4) is not feasible, then minutes of the proceedings should be taken and made publicly available.”.I do not like the phrase "the new normal" because I hope we can do something better and different to what we had as the normal. The Bill in itself is an acknowledgement of the fact that we are looking at a longer period of time to deal with the Covid crisis. Many of the things that we do will have to be done differently, but it is very important that doing things differently is not a cutting of corners on due process. That is true of our discussions in the House and it is also true of the very important discussions that take place in tribunals of the RTB. I am concerned about this, although it might have been a necessary measure, of which we got very little notice in the previous legislation. It was the removal of the effect of section 106 of the 2004 Act requiring a public process in respect of a tenancy tribunal in the case of a dispute. To be frank, I believe it would have been wiser when this was pushed through in March when we were in crisis mode to have introduced a temporary suspension of the effect of that section. There was a case to be made for that but, instead, there has been and should have been time to look at doing things differently. We are going to have tenancy decisions being made and tribunals will be taking place. We have talked about the RTB and its wisdom. We heard one of our colleagues in the Green Party, who spoke eloquently about being part of those tribunals and what happens and the decisions that are made by the RTB. I am reminded of the phrase that for justice to be done it must also be seen to be done, and due process must be seen to be done. That is extremely important. It is also important that individuals who find themselves in a situation, who might not be lawyers that have seen 20 such cases, would be able to see what happened to somebody else like them in a similar situation. For example, if one type of family in a housing estate is affected, that they can see what arguments were made in a similar case and that they would be equipped with the knowledge. My amendment simply suggested that rather than suspending the full public visibility and attendance at tenancy tribunals given that we must be careful due to Covid, we would look to online streaming of those processes or where online streaming was not possible or appropriate that minutes of the proceedings would be taken and made publicly available. The Minister of State might address the issue by regulation or other procedure. That would allow people to at least know what has transpired and how the RTB makes decisions because a tribunal might make a decision that would affect them in the future. It is almost an oversight and this probably got carried over from the previous legislation but I would welcome if the Minister of State could give me some sense of how we can ensure as we go into what might be another six, eight or 12 months of restrictions that we will have due process.

This is a key issue in terms of public health considerations whereby one has to weigh and balance them against the right to have a transparent public process. I fully appreciate that that is a major concern. However, public hearings are not suspended, they are just not mandatory. In terms of public health, the RTB will have to make a determination based on how many tribunals are going on per day or what the social distancing requirements are at any given time. There is no prohibition on tribunals taking place in public in section 7. That is key. The measure is in place until 10 January at which time I hope we can move on. I accept the points Senator Higgins made.

I have also co-sponsored the Labour Party amendments to this section which are tabled in the same spirit. My amendment is tabled on foot of advice from the Simon Communities which contacted all Senators this week to express its concerns about the various inadequacies contained in the Bill.The briefing indicates the Bill does not protect those tenants who could be made homeless because the landlord requires the property for his or her own use or wishes to sell the property. It argues these clauses in the legislation have been a driver of homelessness over the period of the housing and homelessness crisis and the Dublin Simon Community is concerned that the removal of that protection without the development of comprehensive prevention supports would lead to an increase in the number of individuals and families having to present to homeless services. The pandemic is not over, the emergency has not finished and the measures we introduced in the initial stages of the crisis have not outlived their usefulness, and they likely never will. The Minister of State has come before us today with extremely narrow proposals to provide very weak protections for certain tenants being evicted where they are not able to pay rent due to Covid-19. The Government is doing nothing for tenants being evicted under other legal grounds in the residential tenancies legislation and withdrawing all legal protections from them, essentially throwing them back to a chaotic private rental market operating in the midst of a pandemic. This amendment would, at least, provide a measure of respite by banning evictions on the more landlord-friendly grounds until the emergency period has expired. The Government, in its legislation, sees this as ending in January 2021. I urge the Minister to accept the amendment so that we do not see important legal protection for tenants evaporate with the enactment of this Bill next week.

We are trying to get what is achievable and constitutional, which can be very difficult, while trying to protect the most vulnerable. We have no idea for sure for how long Covid-19 will be here and we cannot rely on a blanket ban on evictions being sustainable in the long term. We must be very clear and I quoted figures earlier regarding balancing the rights of tenants and landlords, as 6,500 residential landlords left the market since 2016 and 86% of those landlords have one or two units. It is important that we have small-scale landlords as well as tenants as public housing is not currently able to meet demand. We need to be very careful that the measures we adopt do not have unintended consequences like those I have mentioned. This Bill is about protecting the most vulnerable and ensuring those who are under pressure due to the pandemic can make a declaration and rely on the protections set out within the Bill.

It goes to the absolute core of the issue I mentioned earlier, which is the fact we have a desperate imbalance in the system as is. I will not speak excessively on the two amendments that have been ruled out of order but they relate to the table in section 9. We have been hearing about balance and that when we do something for renters we have to think how it would affect landlords. I reiterate the points we have made. Please look at this in the autumn. When we look at the budget, the finance Bill and all of the other Bills let us make sure there is not undue consequence. This is a vital issue. The amendment I tabled was simply looking at the question that when a place is being refurbished it should not in itself become a loophole to allow people to be evicted. There is already provision whereby somebody who has to move out for a few months while a place is being refurbished can be offered a new tenancy. Anybody in Dublin will tell us, and I am sure it is the same in Galway and Cork, that this is being used as a way of getting around the rental pressure zones because it can be treated as a new tenancy and the landlord can start from scratch in terms of where the rent goes. We looked for this in respect of the refurbishment grants and it will become much more pressing in terms of the urgent need for work on retrofitting. It will be a terrible disaster if a very positive thing, which is the retrofitting of homes, were to become a loophole to allow people to be evicted and, when the place goes up for rent again, not being offered a tenancy at an equivalent rate. What we are suggesting is that where there is a rental pressure zone and the Government has set a threshold of a 4% increase allowed in any year, if a tenant is asked to leave and a place is refurbished or retrofitted, or whatever it might be, and the place goes on the market again that the original tenants would not simply be allowed to reapply for the tenancy but that they would be allowed to reapply for tenancy in a way consistent with the logic of the rental pressure zones. The Minister of State mentioned cross-party work. There is huge wisdom in this House and in the other House, among all of those who worked in local authorities before they came in here, on what is actually happening with regard to the loopholes in rental pressure zones and how the table is misused for this purpose. This is an issue that has been raised by Threshold and others. Perhaps it is an issue we can look at in future.

It has highlighted its concern that the process put in place with regard to the notice of terminations, particularly the new measure whereby a notice of termination may relate to non-payment of rent in a new way, could in itself compromise the actual role of the RTB, which is to be an adjudicator. The RTB will notify the tenants of their rights under section 76, for example, but even the very fact of receiving a formal notification of their rights under section 76 from the RTB could be seen as it giving an imprimatur of legitimacy to a request that had come from the landlord. Amendments Nos. 26 and 27 refer to the idea that when the RTB receives a notification of termination from a landlord, which it has to receive on the same day as the tenant, and it is prima facie completely illegitimate as, for example, it cites grounds that are not legitimate grounds in the table we mentioned or in the legislation or that the claim made is outrageous, rather than simply passing on that the tenant has section 76 rights and referring to them, the RTB would, in fact, be able to take action on the notification it received and make meaningful the very positive step put into the legislation, whereby the RTB is informed of a notification at the same time as the tenant. It would give substance to this. Having received a notification that seems to be prima facie invalid to it, it would be able to address these concerns at the same time as telling the tenant about the process. It would be able to tell the tenant and the landlord that there are questions that might need to be addressed. It would be very useful and practical. From the experience of a tenant, it would mean this is not about an imbalance but about a process that works, and that the tenant is not simply getting a letter from the landlord followed by a letter stating his or her formal rights. Part 3 is not about Covid any more. These are new measures being put into our rental legislation. One of the new measures being expanded and changed is the extent to which non-payment of rent can be used as a basis for termination of accommodation. The rental pressure zones were mentioned. It would be good if the RTB would undergo an actual process to confirm the amount of rent that persons are being asked for is in line with good practice under the rental pressure zones. We know there have been incidents. I know of some cases but Threshold knows of many as it is a first call for renters. The number one issue that Threshold raised is the assumption in the Bill that the claim for rent due from the landlord is effectively assumed to be valid unless challenged by the tenant through a tribunal process. It is the balance between where we place our trust and where we assume good faith. If the RTB had an actual scrutiny role when it gets notifications, there are several ways it could be addressed. I hope the Minister of State will give me a sense of how he would see it working out and how we can avoid unfortunate situations.

The board has to be independent. We are very clear on this. It must be neutral. Therefore, by default, it cannot intervene. A tenant can, under section 76, bring forward a determination to get involved in a resolution process. We are providing that the RTB must write to the tenant to get involved in the process when issues arise. We are very clear on the matter. Under section 76 the pathway is there for tenants to bring forward resolutions that may require determinations. We have to be very careful not to compromise the impartiality of the RTB. I am very keen not to do this.

It is not about being partial to a tenant or liking a tenant. It is about due process. It is about standards in the rental sector and the standards in practice. We know from when we were discussing the legislation and how complex it is that the RTB is sometimes in a better position to know whether something is prima facie invalid or valid. It has the expertise that an individual tenant might not have. I am not suggesting it goes to gun for a particular tenant. I am saying it would raise and flag a concern. There is a concern about the RTB giving its imprimatur. A landlord might say the RTB was also sent this and it did not raise any concerns. I want to know what the mechanism is for the RTB if something comes across its desk that is just straight up wrong.

In every instance where a tenant presented a notice of termination of residency or tenancy, the first advice we always gave was that he or she should contact Threshold. That is what is done in Galway County Council and I assume it is the same in local authorities.

In section 16(a) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, which is being used as the basis for notifications of termination of tenancy arising out of the non-payment of rent, there is an explicit reference that the amount of rent being sought should not be incompatible with other enactments. Will the Minister of State provide clarity in this regard? The amount of rent sought by way of a notice served under the authority of section 16(a) must be compatible with other enactments, which would, I assume, include enactments in respect of rental pressure zones. If the amount sought is incompatible with the rules under the rental pressure zones provisions, does that mean the claim is not eligible? My concern is that once the process is under way and the matter is under consideration by the tribunal, the claim could be seen to be invalid. I want to know what the mechanisms are for dealing with a false claim in that sense. My fundamental concern, which I will address in my amendment No. 29, is that the process being put in place will move too quickly. The Bill introduces new grounds of non-payment of rent but the timeline involved for dealing with such cases is extremely short. People are being given only 28 days' notice to pay back-----

I am confident that the board is able to do its businesses and that we are balancing the rights of tenants and landlords in an impartial manner.

The notice period that is allowed in such cases is too narrow, and this is an example of the right balance not being struck. Regardless of the duration of tenancy, people are being given only 28 days' notice. Again, this is not Covid-specific but something that will apply all the time. In a situation where an amount of rent is due, even if the tenant has been in the property for ten or 20 years and it is the first time the rent has not been paid, for which there may be many reasons, a notification period of 28 days is far too short and is not appropriate. Moreover, there is no consideration given to the amount due. If there is to be a fair balance, we should be looking at how much rent is owed over how long a period of time. We should have the same kinds of complicated grids that we have around Part 4 tenancies and evictions. Where there is a failure by the tenant to pay an amount of rent due, 28 days - or less than a month - is too short a period to allow for the payment to be made. I am proposing in amendment No. 29 that the period be extended to 60 days. This would give people time to get the notification, see how much rent is due and seek confirmation if they do not believe they owe the amount indicated. It gives them time to talk to Threshold, which runs a busy service and cannot always offer 12 hours of help to somebody immediately, and whomever else they need to consult. It allows them time to confirm whether the right amount of rent due is being sought and to challenge it if they do not believe it is correct. Where they are asked to leave the property, it gives them time to try to make other arrangements. A notice period of 28 days is too short and it is not enough time to allow people to pay back any rent owed. It does not even give enough time for them to put their entire next pay cheque into paying off whatever rent might be due. I hate to be dramatic but this calls to mind the classic stories of debtors' prison and the loopholes that arose under that system. At times when money was short, such as just after Christmas, people fall into arrears. I know there are processes in place to deal with that and I recognise that 80% or 90% of landlords will work with their tenants to address those situations. However, I am worried that the space afforded here is too narrow and that it may create a dangerous situation where a landlord who has been waiting a very long time to get somebody out of a building could exploit it. A notice period of 60 days would offer a more reasonable balance and I hope the Minister of State will review it.

Things have improved drastically in terms of the supports that are there to help people who are struggling to pay their rent. We are very much focused in this Bill on the Covid-19 emergency and trying to safeguard people in tenancies who are vulnerable through the effects of the pandemic. The various schemes are in place and the pathway for people in that situation is very clear. As I said, there are supports for tenants who find themselves facing a 28-day notification. One of the big issues we have identified in the Department is the low take-up of the rent supplement scheme. That is something we want to highlight and address further. In the meantime, supports from the State are in place and applications are being turned around quickly.

As the Minister of State mentioned, there are supports that will be available to tenants after that. From now until 10 January next, tenants who can make declarations in the context of the impact of Covid will be protected.

It introduces a change in the law in terms of the notification of termination of a tenancy and it is an important change. It relates to provisions in the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 and broader rental policy.I understand that the Minister of State might not be able to accept the amendment today because the Dáil has risen. Some people can be evicted during this period. Yes, that ban on eviction will stop this regressive measure having a negative effect for a few months. I urge the Minister of State to use those few months to revisit the fact that 28 days is too short and to ensure we have a fit-for-purpose Residential Tenancies Act that addresses the fact that 28 days is too short before evictions start again because this is the policy for the next ten years unless we and the Minister of State change it.

Any low-income worker will already be on a housing list. He or she should already be on a local authority or voluntary housing list. He or she will be in receipt of HAP or rent supplement and if the HAP or rent supplement is insufficient, there is facility to have it increased. I have helped many people do this. They have had to do this because of all of the pressure caused by increasing rents. The reality is that if anybody is under financial pressure, he or she needs to access the supports because we need to make tenancies sustainable and 28 days should not be an issue. However, it is key that there is greater awareness of the emergency rent supplement that is available. Homeless HAP has become the default in Dublin. HAP itself will not secure someone a tenancy. The increased allowances on homeless HAP represent the default and this is still insufficient. It does not take away from the fundamental issue of affordability, which we must address in other ways.

There will be people who will be in distress in terms of discharging their rent. This Bill deals with that with regard to Covid-19. There are State supports for other tenancies and they are being dealt with quickly. There is a three-day turnaround in respect of the community welfare officer, which is very efficient in terms of people undergoing stress. We have all worked with people in our clinics up and down the country who are under stress and we advise them about those supports. They are there and are ready and waiting. We must keep advising people about this because tenants who are under pressure through this period and are unable to discharge their rent need to be aware that the State is ready, willing and available to help through MABS, supports like rent supplement and those other available supports that we will be able to discuss to do our best to keep their in their tenancies because that is the wish of the Government. We want secure quality tenancies and to keep people in them.

The problem is that this 28-day measure is a measure whereby 28 days' notice of eviction will go into the middle of the housing crisis we faced beforehand. Yes, measures are in place but let us contrast things. We heard about the landlords and their mortgages. Compare the measures that are there for persons struggling with their mortgages with the measures that are there for persons struggling with rent such as the period of time, the timelines, the processes and the mechanisms to allow somebody to make arrears. We are giving somebody 28 days straight up to pay up and that is it. There is no long process for people to find a reasonable way to pay the back rent and deal with it. It is 28 days. Again, I am not accusing the Minister of State of this but it seems that this smacks of a measure that probably some landlords would like that is tagged on to a Bill that has mainly a very laudable and positive purpose. It needs to be revisited. I would regard 60 days as the basic minimum. I will press the amendment.

The Minister of State is going to have to keep that provision under review. This legislation is making it easier to evict people on the basis of rent unpaid and that will require much more scrutiny. I do not need to speak further on the issue because the relevant points were made in our previous discussion.
