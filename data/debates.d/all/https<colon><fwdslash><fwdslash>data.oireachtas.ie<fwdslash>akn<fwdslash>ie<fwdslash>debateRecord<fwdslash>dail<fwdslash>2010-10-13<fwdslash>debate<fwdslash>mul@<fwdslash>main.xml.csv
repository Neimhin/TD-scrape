#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	0	The small business sector in Ireland is in crisis.  There are thousands of small, indigenous Irish businesses barely hanging on, with many employing three, five, ten or 15 employees and now really struggling.  The very concept of indigenous Irish business is at risk because of the failed banking strategy of the Government.Last January the Tánaiste committed to the introduction of a loan guarantee scheme.  I understand there is a great deal of messing going on between the Department of Finance and the Department Enterprise, Trade and Innovation about the introduction of the scheme.  As we talk in this House about consensus and a move towards putting forward solutions for what is the greatest economic crisis that the Government has led us into, what has happened to the loan guarantee scheme?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	1	With regard to supports for small business and the work of Enterprise Ireland, the schemes which have been introduced are successful and have been very helpful to more than 1,800 firms in the country.  The question of loan guarantee must be considered very carefully.  We have already been given credit plans from the banks to ensure that on the basis of their successful recapitalisation they will be in a position to extend credit lines to business.  The issue of the State being a further guarantor in respect of loans in business, in addition to what security businesses are already providing, is something that must be carefully considered and is under discussion.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	2	As Deputy Bruton pointed out yesterday, a third of county enterprise boards have no seed capital; they cannot help anybody but can pay their own staff.  The Government had no problem in putting out approximately €40 billion for recapitalisation of the banks or Anglo Irish Bank.  This type of scheme operates in many countries and where they are well designed and constructed, they are commercially driven and self-financing without being a burden on the taxpayer.  Banks have only been accustomed to lending where property and assets were involved and they have never been accustomed to lending to small Irish businesses who want to get into manufacturing, exports, food or tourism.  These are the areas where we know serious job potential exists.  Currently, many businesses which want to use initiative and creativity to get into these areas cannot get the required assistance because the banks' strategies are not as forthcoming as they should be.In January, the Tánaiste and the Government committed to a loan guarantee scheme but it has not seen the light of day.  I recognise that it must be vetted but there is a great degree of messing going on between the Department of Finance and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation.  The scheme has not seen the light of day and thousands of small Irish businesses are hanging on by their fingernails.  There are 80,000 small businesses in the country employing almost 800,000 people.  Not every problem can be solved but this has a solution.  The Government committed to the issue but we cannot believe it any more.  Will the Taoiseach drive the process through so that we can have a loan guarantee scheme that will be of assistance to small Irish businesses?As we are talking about consensus, Fine Gael will next week introduce a motion for a loan guarantee scheme.  I hope on that occasion, when it will be properly assessed and vetted, the Government will see fit to give it consensus and support in the interest of retaining Irish jobs.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	4	Any debate taking place in the House will afford everyone the opportunity to explain their precise position on these issues and the necessary policies to support small businesses.  There are many supports in place from Enterprise Ireland which are assisting small businesses but the working capital needs of small businesses will be best protected and provided for once the full recapitalisation of the banking system is in place.  That is at an advanced stage.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	6	We are coming to the time of year when the weather gets colder and families must spend more money heating their homes.  The price of home heating oil is now 26% higher than it was this time last year.  One of the factors which has contributed to the increase in the price of home heating oil is the carbon levy introduced by the Government in the last budget.  When the Minister for Finance introduced that measure he promised that a vouched fuel allowance scheme would be developed to offset the increases for low-income families dependent on such fuel.  That vouched fuel allowance scheme has not yet been produced.The programme for Government committed to the publication of a fuel poverty strategy by the end of 2009 in keeping with the introduction of the carbon levy.  The problem of fuel poverty is very real and the energy regulator has told us electricity disconnections are now running at a rate of between 2,000 and 2,500 households per month.  Bord Gáis has told us that so far this year, 4,000 homes have been disconnected.The Labour Party has a motion before the House proposed by Deputy McManus last night which addresses the issue and calls on the Government to introduce the vouched fuel allowance scheme promised in the budget to offset the carbon levy measures for low-income families.  It also calls for the publication of the fuel poverty strategy.  We were surprised that the Government amendment made no mention of either measure when it was circulated last night and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, in responding to the Labour Party motion, made no commitment to either of them.  When will the vouched fuel allowance scheme, promised in last year's budget, be introduced?  When will the fuel poverty strategy, promised for the end of 2009, be published?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	7	The vouched fuel allowance scheme related to the carbon levy on solid fuels.  This is subject to a commandment order.  Subsequently, when we came to make the decision, taking into account that aspect of the situation, it was to be made subject to a commencement order.  That did not happen, however.  The vouched scheme will only come into place in the solid fuels area once the commencement order for the applications of a carbon levy to those fuels applies.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	9	Home heating oil prices are still lower than they were during mid-2008 which was the last time there was an increase in the fuel allowance rate.  Home heating oil significantly reduced in price after that last increase in fuel allowance.  The fuel allowance rate was not reduced at that time.  The fuel allowance rate remained static when home heating products reduced in price.  That granted an increase in the rate.  To use lower prices during 2009 as a justification for an increase in fuel allowance at that stage would not be possible.There is also the exceptional needs payment for anyone who may have difficulty in that respect.

It shows no appreciation of the kind of difficulties people have in meeting their home-heating costs.  This idea that the vouched fuel allowance was attached only to the introduction of the carbon levy on solid fuels is a completely new excuse by the Government for not proceeding with its introduction.I will offer the Taoiseach a way that it can be introduced.  The energy providers, the ESB and Bord Gáis, are required to re-brand themselves.

Those moneys would be better spent providing some assistance to those families who cannot meet their fuel bills.  Those families are being switched off by the two suppliers in question which then charge them €200 to switch off and another €200 to be reconnected.There is a solution.  The Government made a promise in last year's budget for a vouched fuel allowance.  It has not yet been introduced.  The Government made a commitment there would also be a fuel poverty strategy to deal with the needs of families on low incomes who cannot afford to heat their homes in winter.  The Taoiseach should introduce these.  Instead of Bord Gáis and the ESB spending €40 million each on putting up new nameplates on their offices, it would be better spent providing for those who are having difficulties meeting their fuel costs.

It will provide a way to deal with the issue more widely and generally.  It will not be like in the past when there were income supports to free fuel schemes.  It will also involve retrofitting households to help people have more energy efficient homes.Significant moneys are going into the retrofit programme with thousands of homes becoming more energy efficient.  This runs counter to having fuel schemes that do not deal with energy inefficiency.  The whole question is the switch to more energy efficient homes, the best way to deal with fuel poverty.  This programme will be accelerated over coming years.

Work is progressing on these matters, to give effect to the commitments in the renewed programme for Government.As regards the Joint Committee on the Constitution, I have put it on the record before that neither I, nor my Department, are solely responsible for the implementation of recommendations in the reports of the joint committee.  It would be a matter for the relevant Ministers to consider any recommendations emanating from these reports and to bring forward proposals to respond to them, as appropriate.  To date, the joint committee has not brought forward any recommendations relevant to my Department.

What is the position of the Attorney General's assessment of the agreed wording put forward in February 2010 by the all-party committee dealing with a referendum on children's rights?  That was a number of months ago.  I know matters need to be analysed and assessed.  Can the Taoiseach give an update on the current position?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	62	We may have a referendum.  It is a matter that is receiving attention and is being dealt with on an inter-departmental basis.  As the Deputy knows, it is subject to Cabinet and committee discussions but there are issues arising in regard to it that are being looked at, such as the possible unforeseen consequences of some of the wording and how that might result in legislative changes or have financial implications.  That all has to be examined so we can come forward with wording that meets the requirements of the situation and can be properly implemented, if agreed to, and subsequently ratified by the people.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	63	Would the Taoiseach hazard a guess as to whether any referendum would be held in the lifetime of his Government?

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	67	The Taoiseach referred to the various matters which are in the programme for Government which would require referendums at some stage.  They include the recommendations on extending the franchise for presidential elections to Irish people living abroad; recommendations for changes to the electoral system; a new electoral system for Seanad Éireann; a new basis for European elections; a recommendation on the possibility of extending the franchise for local elections to those aged 16 and over; and proposals to hold a constitutional referendum to amend Article 41.2 of the Constitution, broadening the reference to the role of women in the home to one which recognises the role of the parent in the home.  Will any of those recommendations see their way into a referendum in the lifetime of this Government?  When will the referendum on the rights and protection of children be held?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	68	I cannot say when the referendum will be held because the Government is still considering the implications of the proposed wording and a lot of work is taking place on an inter-departmental basis, which is continuing.  The Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs would know what is the up-to-date position.On the other issues, I understand they are the subject of consideration for the Electoral Commission.  Those issues will be dealt with in that forum in the first instance.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	69	On those matters, there are no proposals for a referendum.  It is safe to assume that there will not be referendums on any of those issues in the lifetime of the Government.On the referendum on children's rights, the report of the all-party committee was published on 16 February and recommended that there should be a constitutional amendment on the rights of the child.  The expectation was that the referendum would have been held last summer.  The Taoiseach deferred holding the referendum because he did not want to hold the by-elections with it.  The Chief Whip told us when we debated the moving of the writs on the by-elections last week that they would be held towards the end of the first quarter of next year.  Does the Taoiseach expect that the referendum on the rights of children will be held on the same day?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	70	The assertion made by the Deputy is incorrect.  It is not correct to say that one could have expected a referendum last summer.  The proposal was submitted to the Government in March or April and was the result of many years work.  We have to examine the implications of the proposed wording.  Ministers and Departments were asked to consider the report, which dealt with the complex nature of the issues involved, and to examine the implications of the proposed wording for their individual areas of responsibility.  Arising from that examination, a range of unintended policy and resource implications were identified.  Consequently, the Minister for Health and Children was asked to develop further work on the referendum, in co-operation with the Attorney General, and that has to be brought back to Government in due course.The implications of the proposed wording are potentially far-reaching and could give rise to very substantial costs.  The examination of the committee's wording identified a range of unintended policy and resource implications.  These included concerns that the concept of continuity of care might lead to children being left in inappropriate care situations.  There are also concerns about the implications for immigration policy and the manner in which the voice of the child provisions could lead to unwieldy and inappropriate arrangements, for example, if a child is suspended from school it could result in legal representation being required on both sides.A new wording to try to take account of the proposals put forward by the joint committee, with the policy support being provided by the office of the Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs, is currently being considered.  This will try to bring forward a recommendation for Ministers and the Government to see in what way we can deal with this issue without the unintended resource and policy implications.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	71	Two issues arise from that.  I understand the Taoiseach said the Government is now considering a new wording.  Do I understand from that the Government is considering a new draft of the proposal?  Given that the original wording came from an all-party committee, does he intend to share the proposed new wording with the all-party committee?  How does he intend to progress the new wording?  Is it intended that the Government will consider the new wording and come to the House with a Bill for a referendum which contains the new wording or will there be consultation or discussion with the all-party committee on what the new wording contains?I again return to the intention of the Government.  Is it still the Government's intention to hold the referendum in the lifetime of this Government or do I interpret what the Taoiseach has said about the difficulties the Government is considering, in terms of the consequences of the amendment and the provision being put into the Constitution, as meaning that the referendum will not be held at all?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	72	No, obviously the work is continuing and drafting is being considered.  No issue has come to Cabinet for its consideration at this point.  I will give the Deputy an update on the work that has been ongoing.  The commitment to bring forward legislation for a constitutional amendment remains and the Government is determined to fulfil that commitment.  We are all agreed that we want to acknowledge the rights of children in the Constitution.  We have to do it in a careful and considered way.  Substantive work is going on.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	73	I ask the Taoiseach to comment on the wording.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	74	Work is continuing on the wording.  No wording has been brought to Government at this point.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	75	I understood from the Taoiseach's earlier reply that he said the Government was considering new wording.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	76	No, I said it is being drafted by the Office of the Attorney General with the policy support being provided by office of the Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs.  This is a matter that the Minister of State will bring to Government in due course and we can deal with it on that basis.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	77	I appreciate that I am probably testing the patience of the Ceann Comhairle.  Do I take it from that that the Government has decided to reject the wording was presented to it by the all-party committee?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	78	On an examination of the proposed wording, its implications for the areas of  responsibility of the various Ministers and Departments were examined.  An examination will identify the range of unintended policy and resources to date.  Arising from that, work will continue in the Office of the Attorney General to bring forward a writ for consideration by Government on legislation for a constitutional amendment.  That commitment remains.  The drafting and wording continues to be worked on and will have to be brought back to the Government for further discussion and consideration.  It is a work in progress.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	79	Has the wording of the committee now been dropped?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	80	On examination, a range of unintended policy and resource implications were identified.The work that has arisen from that has meant the Minister with policy support is engaged with the Attorney General to see what could be provided that would deal with some of the issues being raised.  When we get back whatever wording arises from that work we can consider it and take it from there.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	83	I have just explained that from the Government's point of view it has identified a range of unintended policy and resource implications, some of which I outlined in my first reply.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	84	Clearly from the Taoiseach's responses this morning, the all-party consensus on the wording of the constitutional amendment to enshrine children's rights in the Constitution has been rejected by the Government.  Over the past while, there has been much talk about achieving all-party consensus.  We had all-party consensus after a protracted period of engagement between all the parties in the committee itself——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	85	A question, Deputy.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	86	——with the finest of legal advice, expert to this area.Now that the Taoiseach has indicated to the House that the Government will proceed to look at an alternative wording, will he advise us whether he has concluded his deliberations with the various Departments vis-à-vis the impact of the change in the Constitution on their respective areas of responsibility; whether the deliberations of the Attorney General have concluded; and whether he expects he will reach a finite position on the now being drafted alternative wording before the end of the year?  If that would be the case — or if it is not the case, whichever — is the Taoiseach in a position at this point in time to indicate the Government’s expected timeframe for the conclusion of this process which at present has a duration of several months?  Will the Taoiseach affirm for the House that the Government will come before the House and advise of its intention to move towards a referendum in 2011?  If new wording is to be agreed at Cabinet will the former committee, no longer in existence, be reconstituted for an evaluation of what the Government will propose?
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	87	Deputy, we are getting into detail that is not appropriate to Question Time for the Taoiseach.

#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	89	It is more appropriate to the line Minister.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	90	Let me assure the Ceann Comhairle that it is absolutely appropriate.  I did not spend two years wasting my time so I want to know exactly what will happen.  Many people from all parties, including Fianna Fáil, put much good work into this and I want to know whether we have been absolutely discarded and set aside or whether there will be any consultation whatsoever with what has been referred to here colloquially as Mary O'Rourke's committee?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	91	I want to put on record again the Government's appreciation of the work done by the joint committee.  The committee assisted greatly in ensuring political consensus on the policy objectives of the referendum.  The Government has a duty to consider the implications of the proposed wording put forward by the committee and to fully understand exactly what is involved.  The Government has to be satisfied that the acknowledgement of children's rights as enunciated in the proposed constitutional amendment meets the policy objectives.  We must also ensure that the constitutional language used provides the necessary clarity.  In particular, the Government must ensure there are no unintended consequences arising from the proposed wording.  The important matter here is that we get this right.  None of us wants to find himself or herself back here in a year's time trying to undo unintended consequences which could arise if the full implications of the proposed wording are not properly teased out in advance of the referendum.Every statement on the proposed wording must be constitutionally right, bearing in mind that it may be subject to judicial interpretation.  I think everyone would accept that.  It does not take in any way from the work that people have done, the policy objectives they set themselves or the proposed wording it put forward for consideration by the Government.  The Government is now discharging its obligations in that respect.  Obviously it would be the intention of the Minister of State with responsibility for children to liaise with those who have been involved in this work thus far when the issue is crystallised, and we can come forward with a discussion at that point.  It is part of the process; the Parliament has done its work in bringing forward its proposals and the Government has to do its work.  It is a substantive and complex area as everyone knows and the intention is to avoid any unintended policy or other consequences; that is the purpose of the work being undertaken at present.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	92	Will the Taoiseach address the matter of the timeframe of the work in hand?  Does he have any idea at this moment in time when the current process of drafting and consultation with the various Departments and the Office of the Attorney General will conclude?  Will there actually be a product and, thereby by extension, a determination as to when a referendum would follow?On an unrelated issue but with regard to previous referenda referred to, the Taoiseach's predecessor indicated a very strong determination to bring about an improved or increased involvement on the part of Irish citizens North of the Border in the electoral process in this State.  He had signalled his hope to bring about a situation where Irish citizens North of the Border would be able to participate in presidential, Dáil or Seanad elections or any combination of all three.  Nothing was done on that.  However, rightly there is continuous reflection on the importance of the Irish diaspora globally and the Taoiseach has invited many successful figures from that diaspora——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	93	It may be necessary to submit a separate parliamentary question on this matter.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	94	No, this is about this question.  It is really tedious not being allowed to conclude simple questions.  I do not expect to be treated any differently from anybody else who has tabled——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	95	I have no difficulty with the simple questions.  When the Deputy starts dispensing advice and information that is where we run into difficulty.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	96	No, we are not running into difficulty here; we are going directly to a specific question.  The point is that the Taoiseach has reflected on the important role and the potential of involving the diaspora more in problems currently besetting us.  Is any consideration being given at this point in time to a constitutional referendum on extending the rights of participation to Irish citizens living overseas — with more and more of them in that situation over the past 12 to 18 months by virtue of forced emigration — so that people would have the opportunity, as is the case in many other states at least for a defined period of time, to participate in the electoral process in their home country?  Is the Government giving any consideration to such a proposal, one that I would very much welcome?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	97	In a specific reply to the question raised by the Deputy, I am not aware of any proposal in gestation at present to provide for such an arrangement for those outside the country who hold citizenship to have votes in general elections or any other elections here. On the issue generally——

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	99	I think——

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	101	I am indeed and the Deputy has asked me without notice to take a considered view on an issue that obviously has very far reaching implications, and I do not engage in that type of arrangement where it is then used against me that I stated I would be this, that or the other on an issue.  I like to consider a matter when those who propose it put all of the issues in front of me.  If people have a view that it should be done, perhaps they will put the case——
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	102	Will the Taoiseach initiate a consideration?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	103	No, I will not initiate any consideration.  Deputy Ó Caoláin is proposing that this is an issue which has validity and merit.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	104	The Taoiseach's predecessor actually——
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	105	I am saying the onus is on those who propose it to come forward with some case for consideration.  It is not for me to build their case.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	107	That is fair enough.With regard to matters generally, the question of what is being considered as a priority for the Government relates to the issues that we have just discussed.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	108	Can I take the Taoiseach back to the matter of the referendum on children's rights?  I put it to him that what has happened over the past couple of years in this House is a prime example of a serious and fundamental flaw in our parliamentary system.  We have a situation where consensus was reached on an all-party basis over a period of two years.  That all-party consensus was reported from this House to Government, which now, only when questioned, offers excuses such as unintended and unforeseen consequences.  I ask the Taoiseach to confirm that these consequences are, in fact, discussions across three Departments, the Departments of Health and Children, Education and Skills, and Justice and Law Reform, on issues that I accept are complex.It appears that we have now entered the politics of drift.  The Government received the report on 18 February.  There has been nothing in terms of any proposal from Government since that day other than unintended consequences.  In that regard, I ask the Taoiseach to inform the House as to who in Government is co-ordinating the various discussions between the Departments of Justice and Law Reform, Health and Children and Education and Skills, and when it is expected that these discussions will be completed?  It seems that there is not a timeframe, there are no time lines, and we are merely drifting along.The Taoiseach's Government colleague, the Minister, Deputy Gormley, speaks of consensus.  This is the prime example of consensus that this House has seen in the course of this Dáil and it is treated in a manner that is less than acceptable.  I ask the Taoiseach to outline to the House the process, who is co-ordinating and when it is expected that the co-ordinator will report to Cabinet.  I ask him to then confirm the necessity to reconvene the committee on the basis that the wording that will ultimately be published by Government will differ substantially from that which has been agreed by the all-party committee.Having regard to the fact that the Taoiseach reluctantly admitted that it is the Government's intention to hold the referendum next year, is it not timely that a public information campaign commence now on the matter of the rights of children and of a proposed constitutional change in advance of a referendum campaign?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	109	My reply to Deputy Flanagan would be that it is not a question of being reluctant.  It is a question of getting it right, as far as the Government is concerned.  Substantive work is being undertaken in these matters.  This work is being co-ordinated by the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, in the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.I made the point that there is work ongoing at the Attorney General's Office to bring forward.  I am saying also that we all are agreed on the objectives but there are, on examination by Departments, issues of substance being raised that must be addressed.It is not to take away from the work that has been done by the committee.  The committee brought forward a draft wording that it believed would meet the requirements of the situation.  That was agreed among the members of the committee.  That is fine and valid in its own right, but as Deputy Flanagan will appreciate, Government then has a responsibility that is distinct from that as well.It is not a question of a flaw in the parliamentary procedures.  The parliamentary procedures worked well.  Members went in with a view to coming forward with a clear understanding of what the objectives should be and what the proposed wording is.As the Deputy will be aware, the wording brought forward is lengthy and involved.  We all know that all of these matters must be very carefully worked through because every sentence is subject to judicial interpretation and if there are some unintended consequences which have been identified arising out of the good work that has been done, then it is right that should be interrogated and that we should come up with solutions so that we come back to the House, either at plenary or committee level, to go through them.  That is what I expect Deputy Barry Andrews to do once the work has been completed.Deputy Flanagan asked for a timeframe.  As I stated, it is not a question of drift.  There are issues that are being addressed.  The Attorney General's office is involved in a drafting exercise to try to address those issues.  Once it is brought back to the Cabinet committee and to Cabinet for our appraisal so that we can stand over it, we can defend it and we can say that it meets the requirements taking into account the work that has been undertaken by committees, etc., we can come back to the House to have that discussion and be able to interact with the House so that we can try to ensure that the all-party work that has been brought to this stage can hopefully be maintained.

Will the Taoiseach act on this recommendation contained in the report of the Joint Committee on the Constitution chaired by one of his party colleagues?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	111	I understand that is a recommendation in that report.  The question on the up-to-date position would be best directed to the line Minister concerned, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	112	I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 to 11, inclusive, together.I led an economic mission to the United States from 11 to 15 July last.  During this trip I met with leading figures in US business, politics and the media in New York and Atlanta, as well as representatives of the Irish American community.I attended the New York Stock Exchange on 12 July and I launched "Innovation Fund — Ireland", which is to support enterprise development and job creation.  The fund is a key pillar in the Government's smart economy strategy.  The following day I met with the New York Mayor, Mr. Mike Bloomberg, at his City Hall headquarters in New York.  The meeting was also attended by the New York City Council Speaker, Ms Christine Quinn.  We discussed the economic situation in the US, Ireland and internationally and shared our experience on tackling the global recession.  I listened with particular interest to the mayor's experience of improving public services in New York City, with a population of over 8 million people.  I expressed my gratitude for the continued interest in and support for Ireland and the Irish community from New York City.While in New York I also met with successful young Irish people based there who are part of the global Irish network and with Irish community leaders.  My schedule also included meetings with Irish companies who are creating new business in the US, as well as representatives of IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Tourism Ireland.  In addition, I met with Irish campaigners for immigration reform.Following my engagements in New York, I travelled to Atlanta, Georgia where I opened the first ever Irish diplomatic mission in the southern United States and met with Governor Sonny Perdue.  This new consulate has been opened as part of the roll-out of the new strategy for Ireland-United States relations which I launched last year.  In Atlanta, I also made a key-note speech on the Ireland-United States relationship to the Irish Chambers of Commerce USA and met with leading Georgia-based businesses that have invested and created jobs in Ireland.While plans have not yet been finalised, I expect that I will next visit the United States for the traditional St. Patrick's Day celebrations in March 2011.  I would expect to meet with the Ireland-America Economic Advisory Board in the course of that visit.  The Irish Embassy in Washington maintains very close contact with board members who are an important source of advice and assistance for us.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	113	When the Taoiseach met with the Irish community leaders in July in New York he stated that the Government remains firmly committed to supporting the cause of immigration reform.  What progress has been made on the follow-up on that statement and what progress has been made in respect of sorting out the worsening situation in so far as the undocumented Irish is concerned?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	114	That is an issue on which we campaign all of the time.  The Irish Embassy in Washington is very active on the Capital Hill in that regard.  As Deputy Kenny will appreciate, it is a very difficult issue on the domestic agenda of the United State.  President Obama, when I last met him on St. Patrick's Day in March, gave a strong commitment on his view that this was an issue that needed to be address but one understands that prior to the November elections the political situation is not conducive to getting the matter dealt with, certainly, on a bipartisan basis or, indeed, in any way.The issue is prioritised in all Government contacts with the US Administration.  We continue to focus on what is a three-pronged strategy — the reciprocal working holiday arrangement agreement which is now working successfully, the new bilateral arrangements to provide reciprocal long-term E3 working visas, and a solution for the undocumented.President Obama has made his commitment to comprehensive reform clear and, in his address on the issue delivered in Washington on 1 July, he signalled his willingness to move forward and shape what he called "a practical, common-sense approach".  Clearly, we would like to see a comprehensive resolution to this issue at the earliest opportunity.  However, the status of the undocumented can only be changed by virtue of legislation passed by both Houses of Congress and it is not merely a matter of bilateral engagement between the two Governments.  It remains a highly sensitive political issue and very considerable challenges remain.On 30 September, prior to the current congressional recess, Senator Robert Menendez published an immigration reform Bill that includes an E3 provision for Ireland.  Although the publication of this Bill is only the first step in a long process, the inclusion of an E3 scheme at this stage is an important achievement for the Government and the Irish community.The Government maintains close contact with the Irish community and immigration reform groups, as the Deputy will know.  We met the Irish lobby for immigration reform while in the US last March and with immigration reform groups during my recent New York trip.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs meets such groups regularly when he is in the US, including during his recent visit to New York for the UN General Assembly session.Practical support is provided through the Government's emigrant support programme.  Since 2006 the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform has received grants worth $325,000, and $20,000 has been provided to the Chicago council for immigration reform over the past two years.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	115	We will not see a comprehensive solution to immigration concerns in the short term because of the complex issues involved and because of the situation in both Houses of Congress in terms of the American Government.  Has the Government decided to more or less wait until the possibility or probability of a comprehensive solution happens, which might be a long way down the line, and in the meantime is there advice that can be given to undocumented young Irish people from all over the country who are living from day to day in an anxious state in the US?  Or is the Government moving to a point where it wants to follow up on a bilateral arrangement between Ireland and the US?Second, a scheme was to be introduced by the Minister for Foreign Affairs which was to result in up to 10,000 US visas being available.  I understand the take-up under that scheme has been poor with only a few hundred having applied.  Is there a reason for that or does the Taoiseach have any information to indicate why this scheme was such a failure?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	116	I do not have any detail on that.  I will ask the Department of Foreign Affairs to let the Deputy know the position.On the issue in regard to bilateral arrangements, I do not believe there is any political prospect of bilateral arrangements being agreed between countries on immigration reform.  As the Deputy is aware, there are various caucuses in regard to various groups which would insist that this matter can only be dealt with in a comprehensive fashion, dealing with everyone's problems rather than any specific sector of the émigré community being dealt with exceptionally.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	117	When the Taoiseach was in the US he opened a new consulate general office in Atlanta and it was termed to be a strategic long-term development.  He indicated that the consulate would be more streamlined than other long established consulates in the United States.  Atlanta has a population of 8 million.  It is also the location of the headquarters of Coca-Cola, CNN, DHL and CRH, which is Ireland's largest firm.  In the spirit of wanting to continue to foster relations between Ireland the United States — I note the welcome comment from the Minister for Finance that there is no intention of shifting from the 12.5% corporation tax rate — if the consulate is to be more streamlined and strategic, is it intended that personnel from Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland or Tourism Ireland should be seconded to Atlanta to deal at first hand and face to face with opportunities presented, firms, organisations and interest groups that would have an impact in terms of investment or travel to Ireland with obvious consequences for the economy here?  The Taoiseach might like to comment on that.Was there any indication in the Taoiseach's discussions about Ireland's commitment to meeting the millennium development goals of the UN?  The summit took place from 20 to 22 September.  I do not know whether the Taoiseach was invited to it but I know President Sarkozy and the Prime Ministers of Spain, Canada, the Netherlands, Denmark and Japan attended it.An interesting point was raised by Deputy Barrett here yesterday.  He said that we have a great number of young qualified brilliant people in the country, many of whom are now unemployed, and that their participation in assisting in other countries could be deemed to be part of the contribution that Ireland would make.  I am aware there is a difficulty with the economic situation and that we are committed to the 0.7% of GNP contribution by 2015.  In the Taoiseach's discussions in the United States with Irish-Americian interests, Mayor Bloomberg or whoever, was this matter raised or did the Taoiseach have any opportunity to reflect on that?  As a small country we have made a massive impact internationally in this regard and perhaps the point made by the Deputy Barrett should be worthy of consideration.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	118	Those issues were not discussed, the focus was very much economic and bilateral.  On the issue of the millennium development goals, I would refer the Deputy to the speech of the Minister for Foreign Affairs at the General Assembly where that matter was addressed.In regard to——
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	119	The consulate.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	120	——the question on the APSO-type contribution where people make their skills available to do development work generally, or across the world, we have a personal services organisation that does that work and it is part of the funding for development aid by the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I presume that can be augmented or increased, where demand requires it or skills are sought.  There have been many instances where Irish citizens have volunteered for that type of work and I commend them for it.On the issue in regard to Atlanta, a consulate has been set up there and it has been very much welcomed.  While it is located in Atlanta, it's remit is not limited to the Georgia situation, although, as the Deputy said, there are important firms in the Atlanta area.  It is an important commercial hub in the United States.  The other southern states will be part of the remit of work of the consulate.On the question of the people from the IDA being seconded there, IDA personnel who work in the United States work from a couple of offices nationwide but they are very much on the move all the time and are not located in a geographical space.  We have people of expertise in the various sectors who keep in touch with the foreign direct investment community on a very regular basis.  Operating in that way the work is company focused rather than geographically based, which is probably the best way to operate.  I would defer to the IDA's experience in that respect as to how it organises itself to best effect.On the question of the consulate generally, it was a question of increasing our presence in that part of the world.  We have a large number of Irish in that area, Irish from this part of the jurisdiction and Irish from the North of both traditions.  It is important to point out that this consulate gives us a foothold in the southern states and places us at the centre of a dynamic economic base.  I am also delighted to say that we have appointed new honorary consuls in Denver, Seattle, Pittsburgh and New Orleans.  That is another initiative.  As part of the strategic initiative on the Irish-US relationship, we have also, as the Deputy will be aware, established the Irish American Leadership Council.  Its first meeting last year in October was attended by representatives of the Irish-American community, including economic, social, political and cultural organisations and US based representatives of Irish Government agencies.  Delegates attended from all regions of the United States, including representatives from Houston to Chicago and from New York to San Francisco.   A second meeting was held in September of this year.  This is another important resource which is being developed.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	121	During his visit to the United States in early July, did the Taoiseach take steps to address, redress or rebut some of the negative commentary about Ireland that has been appearing in some of the influential US newspapers?  The Taoiseach was in the United States between 11 and 15 July.  On 29 June, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal each published a lengthy article on the Irish economy, both of which were negative.  The former described Ireland as “a once thriving nation” that is “struggling, with no sign of a rapid turnaround in sight”.  The latter had similarly negative comments to make about Ireland.  Did the Taoiseach hold briefings for the United States media during his visit?  Did he make any attempt to speak directly to The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, with a view to talking up the prospects of the country?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	122	I did television interviews, including an interview with Charlie Rose on Bloomberg Television, and met representatives of the New York Stock Exchange, the Bank of New York Mellon, one of the largest banks in the United States, the board of Goldman Sachs and various other business interests.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	123	The Taoiseach will have been conscious of the commentaries on Ireland published in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal shortly before his visit.  Was an attempt made to arrange a briefing or interviews for these two newspapers?  Was any effort made to use the occasion of his visit to the United States to influence these two highly influential newspapers about their take on Ireland?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	124	I did not have a direct briefing with the newspapers in question but I know it was covered.  We dealt with them and they are continually dealt with.  I also dealt with other media interests.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	125	On the undocumented Irish, the so-called illegal Irish emigrants in the United States, is it possible that the Department of Foreign Affairs would prepare a briefing for the leaders of the Opposition parties on its approach — the steps taken and areas of possible redress identified — to the very serious situation faced by countless Irish people, some of whom have lived in the United States for a longer period than they lived at home?  With the growing number of people now displaced as a result of the decline in the economy, it would be helpful, given that we all have engagement with people from the political, administrative and business life of the United States, if we were all at least singing from the same hymn sheet and pressing all the right buttons.  I ask if this could be done purely and solely in the interest of aiding and abetting the best possible outcome in terms of impacting on the US Administration and those who can help to bring about progress in this particular area.  Will the Taoiseach consider arranging such a briefing at the earliest opportunity?  It would be very welcome from my point of view.Is the Taoiseach aware of the growing number of state assemblies, city councils, municipalities and organisations in the United States which have, in recent months, passed resolutions encouraging the pursuit of peaceful and democratic resolution of the issue of partition and encouraging work towards the achievement of Irish reunification?  It is certainly a major issue of debate across all of the bodies in question.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	126	We are drifting somewhat from the group of questions.

I am asking the Taoiseach, in the context of his US visits, whether he is aware of this growth in interest which is a natural outworking of all that we have achieved moving from a peace process to a political process.  Is he aware of it?  Has he been briefed on it or has he discussed it with the Minister for Foreign Affairs?  Will he join me in the logical outworking of it by encouraging all parties and interests here to sit down and collectively seek to open up a respectful debate and process that would encourage exactly what the elected bodies in question in the United States are encouraging?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	128	The whole purpose of the peace process and political process in which we are engaged is to enable everyone, those of all traditions, to pursue their objectives peacefully and democratically, overcome past dissensions, recognise the commonality of our interests and, in due course, try to develop political structures which would be consistent with these objectives.  That is part of the normal democratic debate.  I welcome the decision of any institution, anywhere in the world to adopt motions that confirm that their interest in Ireland and Irish affairs is also on the basis that they promote peaceful and democratic resolution of issues.  Since the Good Friday Agreement was signed, we have been engaged in work that is dedicated to this purpose and to doing so democratically.On the Deputy's question on the undocumented, I can ask the Department of Foreign Affairs to give an update on the current position and on replies I have given concerning the work the Department is undertaking.  It has a three-pronged strategy which I have outlined in previous supplementary questions.  That is the focus of the strategy it is pursuing.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	132	It is proposed to take No. 12a, motion re membership of committees and No. 4, Education (Amendment) Bill 2010 — Order for Second Stage and Second Stage.  It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that No. 12a shall be decided without debate.  Private Members’ business shall be No. 75, motion re fuel poverty (resumed), to conclude at 8.30 p.m. tonight if not previously concluded.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	133	There is one proposal to be put to the House.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. 12a without debate agreed to?  Agreed.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	134	I note the European Commission indicated yesterday that the Government's four year fiscal plan would be submitted on 4 November.  I had not heard that date mentioned previously.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that this is the date by which the Government intends to submit its four year plan?  Will he give a commitment that the proposals in the four year plan will be debated in the House before 7 December, the date of the budget?  Second, I refer to a situation that has arisen regarding the proposed national children's hospital and the legislation covering it.  I note the comments made yesterday to the effect that work would start and regarding a proposed opening date for this children's facility.  However, it appears as though this project is to go ahead——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	135	Deputy, we are on the Order of Business and this is not appropriate.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	136	I will conclude within 30 seconds.  It will go ahead even though consideration of how to raise the €100 million that was to be raised through philanthropic donations has yet even to begin.  This constitutes an enormous sum of money and as the Taoiseach is aware, given the general economic circumstances charities are experiencing an extremely difficult time in raising money from consumers and people who simply do not have it.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	137	Deputy Kenny.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	138	I ask the Taoiseach to comment.  This proposal appears to be going ahead with at least €100 million of a shortfall.  Has the Taoiseach reflected on this or will it emerge that a major element of this project will not be capable of completion?
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	139	If I may ask a question on the same issue but within the context of the Order of Business——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	140	Just a question without the embellishment.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	141	I will try to impress the Ceann Comhairle.  On the same issue, Members undoubtedly are eager to address this matter.  Will the Taoiseach schedule, either for tomorrow or next week, an opportunity to address the subject of the national children's hospital and all the associated matters for debate, as well as the expected completion date in 2015?  It is a major cause of worry and concern and is being discussed and debated in all the various media opportunities and in much wider fields.  However, Members are not getting an opportunity to address properly this issue on the floor of the Parliament.  I believe that a short period could be set aside for the spokespersons, the Minister who has——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	142	This is not appropriate to the Order of Business.

The Minister has made no substantive comment regarding the resignation of the chairman of the board in this instance.  These all are matters that Members could address here.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	144	Deputy, you promised there would be no embellishment but you are heavily into such embellishment.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	147	As for the first matter raised by Deputy Kenny, the four-year plan will be published in the first half of November but the exact date has not yet been selected by the Government.  However, I have no idea why the spokesperson for Commissioner Rehn gave that date.  It is inaccurate and contact has been made with the Commission to clarify the correct position.  Consequently, it will be provided by mid-November to the Commission.  Obviously, Members also will have an opportunity to discuss it in the House before the budget and that is a matter for the Whips.On the question of the funding for the children's hospital, that is a matter for the development board.  It is envisaged that there will be fundraising through research in universities and various philanthropic sources of funding, as well as research funding, etc.  That is a matter for the development board itself to proceed with and I have no further comment to make.In respect of the issue raised by Deputy Ó Caoláin, there are a number of ways in which matters can be addressed in the House and that is a matter for him to consider.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	148	I wish to raise two matters with the Taoiseach.  First, when replying to me during Leaders' Questions this morning, the Taoiseach suggested that the vouched fuel allowance announced in the budget was to apply only when the carbon levy was to be applied to solid fuels.  I was somewhat surprised to hear this because, to my recollection, that distinction had not been made previously by either the Minister for Finance or any of the Ministers responsible.  I have taken the opportunity to have the matter checked in the meantime and there is no such distinction.  Indeed, a response given by the then Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Hanafin——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	149	Is a query on legislation coming?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	150	Yes.  In a reply to a parliamentary question tabled by Deputy O'Shea of 19 January 2010, the then Minister for Social and Family Affairs stated: "Before the tax is applied to fuels for home heating, arrangements are being made to assist those most at risk of fuel poverty."  In other words, no distinction was drawn between home heating oil and solid fuels.  Will the Taoiseach now take the opportunity to acknowledge that his reply to me earlier this morning was wrong?  I ask him to correct the record of the House.Second, I refer to the climate change Bill listed in section C of the Government's legislative programme and for which heads have yet to be approved by the Cabinet.  In July 2009, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government announced that Government approval had been given for the drafting of a climate change Bill.  At that time, he stated that it was hoped to have the Bill published in advance of the Copenhagen conference to be held in December 2009.  The aforementioned Bill appears to be a long way yet from being drafted or prepared.  Heads have not been prepared and it is one of the few Bills on the entire legislative list for which no indicative publication date is being given.  Later today, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security will publish its own draft Bill on climate change, based on work carried out by my colleague, Deputy McManus.  Given that the Government, and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in particular, are keen on having a consensual approach to matters of national importance and that the Government is not in a position as yet to produce its own Bill, will the Government accept the Bill that has all-party agreement on the Oireachtas joint committee and that is to be published later today?  This would mean the important matter of climate change would be addressed in the House and that a climate change Bill would be debated and hopefully enacted by it?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	151	In respect of the first matter, my understanding was that at the time of the discussion, the voucher associated with the vouched fuel scheme related to the need to deal with a solid fuel issue arising from the importation of lower grade coal and peat products, possibly from Northern Ireland.  There was some indication that a vouched scheme was required for that purpose.  I take the point that the then Minister for Social and Family Affairs was suggesting that from her perspective, she obviously wanted to see all recipients dealt with.  As I understand it, the overall affordable fuel strategy is at an advanced stage and has yet to come before the Government.  However, I cannot be any more specific than that.  I referred to the point that at the time of the discussions when the carbon levy was being introduced, the need to deal with that solid fuel issue was high on the agenda because of the problem of the possibility of lower grade imports coming into the jurisdiction.On the question regarding the climate change Bill, the heads, which will set out the proposed structure and provisions of the Bill in greater detail, are at an advanced stage and I expect them to be brought before the Government soon.  Following their approval by the Government, the heads will provide the basis for full stakeholder consultation on the proposed provisions of the Bill.  A framework for the climate change Bill was provided for last October and was presented prior to the Copenhagen conference.

#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	155	It is not appropriate.  We spent considerable time on this during the time for Leaders' Questions and to revisit the matter on the Order of Business is simply out of order.

#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	157	I allowed it because a query on legislation was forthcoming, which did come, albeit on the climate change issue.  However, we are pursuing this matter on the Order of Business and it is out of order.  I ask the Deputy to co-operate and to pursue it some other way.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	158	A Cheann Comhairle, it is not out of order to seek to have the record of the House corrected and that is what I seek to have done.  In his reply to me, the Taoiseach stated explicitly that the vouched fuel allowance was intended to apply only to solid fuels.  I have pointed out to the Taoiseach that this is not correct.  I have asked him to acknowledge he has made a mistake.  I do not want to make a big issue of this, I do not want to rub his nose in it.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	159	I ask the Deputy for his co-operation on this matter.  I have been more than tolerant.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	160	I just want the record of the House corrected.  The Taoiseach may wish to check the record himself.  If he does not want to make the correction now — and he certainly did not in his reply to me earlier — I am quite happy that he corrects it in this House at the next available opportunity.  I want the record of the House corrected.  If I ask a question of the Taoiseach and he responds with something that is factually incorrect, all I want is that the record be corrected.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	161	This is out of order but I will allow the Taoiseach to respond briefly.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	162	If it is out order, then it is out of order.  At Leaders' Questions I am asked questions without notice and I gave a full reply to the Deputy's query.  There is no intention on my part to do otherwise.  However, I do not have notice of these questions and cannot have the answer to every possible inquiry.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	163	Sure.  That is no problem.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	166	We will be here a long time.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	167	In that case we will talk about the bank guarantee.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	168	Any time, I would love to.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	169	It is important for the proper running of the House that I put this matter on record.  It is a long-standing rule of the Chair that the House is not a court and that a Member's disclaimer of the accuracy of a statement attributed to him or her or of a particular action attributed to him or her must be accepted in the House.  There is no other way of conducting business.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	170	That gets Deputy Gilmore off the hook.

#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	172	In light of all the discussion about reductions in social welfare and the fact that those on blind disability pensions had their allowance cut last year, will the Taoiseach explain why the legal costs Bill is still at No. 78 on the legislative programme?  Will he ensure that legislation is brought forward?Second, in view of the ongoing difficulties of small industries, particularly co-operatives, when will the industrial and provident societies and friendly societies (miscellaneous provisions) Bill be brought forward to introduce improvements in regulations?Third, there have been many promises about the number of hectares of forestry that will be planted.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	173	The Deputy can pursue that matter through other avenues, it is not appropriate on the Order of Business.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	174	It is appropriate.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	175	There are many other ways for the Deputy to raise it.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	176	It is appropriate to the Order of Business.  The forestry Bill is the first legislation listed on the pink sheet.  When will that Bill be introduced in the House so that we can discuss the crisis in the industry?
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	177	On the legal costs Bill, last year we spent €60 million on medico-legal outlays, €20 million of which went to the legal profession.  There must be an urgency in bringing forward this Bill.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	178	Doctors are charging too much.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	179	Deputy Reilly should confine himself to questions about the status of promised legislation.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	180	Likewise, the reference pricing for drugs Bill could be saving us €200 million per year.  Instead the Government has introduced a prescription charge for medical card holders.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	183	Four big ones.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	184	Only a percentage of the Minister's fee.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	185	The first issue raised by Deputy Crawford was raised yesterday on the Order of Business when I said that the legislation would be introduced next year.  On the second issue raised by the Deputy, there is no date for that legislation.  The third Bill to which he referred will be dealt with in this session.
#TomSheahan	unknown-#TomSheahan-party	unknown-#TomSheahan-dob	unknown-#TomSheahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	186	I thank the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, for invoking the grandfather clause to ensure that Dingle community hospital will be opened in the next fortnight.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	187	Does the Deputy have a query on legislation?
#TomSheahan	unknown-#TomSheahan-party	unknown-#TomSheahan-dob	unknown-#TomSheahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	188	Absolutely.  No. 63 on the legislative programme, the licensing of health facilities Bill, will provide for a mandatory system of licensing for public and private health care facilities.  The Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, was established in 2007 but this Bill remains at No. 63 on the legislative programme.  The Health Service Executive was aware of HIQA standards three months prior to commencement of construction of Dingle community hospital and it will cost the State millions to put it right.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	189	The Deputy will have to find another way to make these points.

HIQA is in operation since 2007 but this Bill has not yet come before the House.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	191	There is no date for that legislation.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	192	When does the Taoiseach expect the publication of the sustainable travel and transport Bill?  Does he anticipate that County Longford will be restored to the Twenty-six Counties under that legislation?  Every county in the State, with the exception of Longford, was included in the national cycle network.  I raised this issue on the Adjournment debate last week and the Minister flippy floppied around the issue, but he did not give me an answer as to why County Longford was excluded.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	193	The Deputy cannot revisit the matter on the Order of Business.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	194	I am aware that Deputy Bannon is at the head of the peloton in regard to this legislation.  I understand it will be next year before we will be able to ride that particular bike.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	195	When does the Government intend to introduce an amendment to the Road Traffic Act to set out clear limits on the level of prescribed or non-prescribed drugs for drivers?  This issue is of serious concern with increasing numbers of drivers testing positive for drugs use.  The report that was issued last week——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	196	We cannot have a debate on that issue at this time.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	197	We raised this 12 months ago and we have been waiting for progress since.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	198	The Deputy is going into far too much detail for the Order of Business.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	199	Does the Taoiseach intend to introduce an amendment to the legislation?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	200	I understand the impairment test in existing legislation allows for prosecutions where drivers have drugs in their system.  The legislative context already exists in this regard.  When the technology becomes more fine-tuned, further legislation will be required.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	201	It will not be introduced immediately.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	202	No, not until the science is developed further.  A parliamentary question to the Minister would provide the Deputy with the accurate detail.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	203	Has the Government agreed a date with the European Commission for the submission of the four-year budgetary plan?  If so, will the Taoiseach indicate that date?  Is it 12 November, and when does the Taoiseach then propose to present the four-year plan to this House?Second, in the course of his last budget speech, the Minister for Finance announced his proposal to introduce in the next budget a universal social contribution to replace the existing PRSI contribution.  A report was published yesterday——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	204	We cannot have a debate on this matter now.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	205	This was in the Minister's budget speech.  A paper was published yesterday setting out not a universal social contribution structure but a universal social charge.  I have several questions for the Taoiseach in this regard.  Does the Government, in the context of the briefings that are being made available to the Opposition parties, propose to request that the Department of Finance outline in detail the Government's thinking on the universal social charge?  Does it, for instance, protect the notion of a universal contributory old age pension and contributory widower's and widow's pensions?  Does the Government propose to publish a White Paper in regard to this fundamental change in Irish legislation?The Taoiseach spoke earlier about consensus.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	206	I have been very tolerant with the Deputy and we will endeavour to get the answers to some of her queries.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	207	With due respect, the Taoiseach has been on the public airwaves looking, understandably, for consensus and discussion.  This is one of the most fundamental changes proposed in the legislative structure of the State.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	208	Deputy, you are promoting a discussion on this matter on the Order of Business and it is the wrong time to do it.  There are other times.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	209	I want to ask the Taoiseach if he proposes to facilitate the Opposition in relation to these proposed changes or will the Minister simply stand up when he announces his budget and tell us what changes he has made.  It is a reasonable question, particularly in the current climate.  I put it to you, a Cheann Comhairle, that this is a very important question if the Taoiseach is serious about having Opposition parties engage in discussion.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	210	Deputy, if you need more detailed information on this matter you will have to submit a parliamentary question, and there are other ways.  On the Order of Business arrangements do not contemplate this sort of detail.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	211	The Minister for Finance announced this in the budget.  I am asking the Taoiseach will there be a White Paper.  As part of the briefings to the Opposition will we be briefed in detail about what the Government is doing on this or does the Government simply intend to stand up on budget day and tell us what it has done?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	212	As I have just said to Deputy Kenny, the four year plan will be published in the first half of November.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	213	Could the Taoiseach give us a date?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	214	If I may reply to the query, the answer is the same as I gave to Deputy Kenny.  The four year plan will be published in the first half of November.  The exact date has not yet been selected by the Government.  I have no idea why the spokesperson for Commissioner Rehn gave the date of 4 November.  It is inaccurate and contact has been made with the Commission to clarify the position.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	215	Another date from that source was 12 November.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	216	Deputy, please allow the Taoiseach to continue.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	217	What source?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	218	The Commission.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	219	Who is deciding when we publish the plan, the Commission or us?  I have just explained to the Deputy.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	220	We have a lot of views on who is deciding.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	221	Deputy Burton, we cannot have a debate on this matter on the Order of Business.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	222	There is no point, is there?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	223	Is the Taoiseach saying the Ceann Comhairle does not have control in the House?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	224	No, but there is not much point.  What is the point of asking a question and interrupting the answer?  It is the same old story every time.With regard to the other question on the social charge, it has been indicated by the Minister for Finance that he will bring forward reforms in the budget in relation to that matter.  It is a budgetary and taxation matter and will be dealt with then.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	225	Will the Government publish a White Paper on the matter?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	226	I am not aware that the Minister for Finance is preparing a White Paper at this stage.  A question directly to the Minister would give the Deputy an indication of that position.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	227	With regard to the sale of alcohol Bill, we are about two and a half weeks from Hallowe'en.  I am a member of two joint policing committees, in Fingal and Dublin city.  Concern was expressed that those two county councils will not have the resources to manage the Hallowe'en festival, which includes running parties for the kids.  Hallowe'en falls on a Sunday this year so we need people working right up to the festival.  Can the Taoiseach confirm that he will ensure, with Deputy Gormley, that local authorities will have the resources to run a Hallowe'en festival that does not end up in mayhem for communities?  With regard to the Bill itself, about seven years ago Deputy Costello proposed that each item of alcohol should include the retailer's name or code.  This is a key requirement of the Bill.  Can the Taoiseach confirm that the Bill will come forward and will he ensure there are resources for Sunday 31 October?  In urban areas it can be very difficult for citizens.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	228	I understand the sale of alcohol Bill will be published early next year.  That is the earliest we will have that legislation.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	229	Hallowe'en will be over then.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	232	I might get a chance to duck Deputy Broughan's head in the water.  He might catch an apple for himself.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	238	The Taoiseach would be very scared if he strayed in like the hero of that book.  If he strayed into certain parts of the country he would be pretty scared.  He should be careful.  Look what happened to him and where he ended up.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	239	It's dark.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	278	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."I am pleased to bring the Education (Amendment) Bill 2010 before the House.  The Bill provides for the involvement for the first time of vocational education committees in the provision of primary education as well as a number of other education related matters.  This legislation is one of several measures currently being progressed by my Department to cater for the changing requirements of education provision.  These include new arrangements for the recognition of primary schools and assisting the Catholic Church in its deliberations on the possible divesting of patronage of some of its schools.  The provisions of the Bill will allow VECs to be part of that changing landscape and to extend the important contribution they already make to education at second level to the primary sector.At present the role of the State in the establishment of primary schools is confined to facilitating the initiative of patrons in this area.  This contrasts with the role of the State at second level, where it has been actively involved for many years in the establishment of schools.  It is both appropriate and important that the State, through local VECs, should be in a position to participate in primary education provision in order to provide an alternative patronage model at this level.Last May we had a useful discussion in this House on the subject of diversification of primary school provision.  There was general acknowledgement of the significant role played by VECs at second level and I am pleased this legislation will extend their functions to the primary sector.A situation can also arise of a primary school being required but no patron being willing or available to establish one.  The current system cannot require that a patron establish a school and it is therefore possible that, despite a demand for a school in a particular location, there is no mechanism for its establishment.  The State cannot stand aside from its obligation in this regard and this is dealt with by the provisions of the Bill.In order to meet the challenges posed by the changing shape of Irish society and the needs of its emerging communities for greater diversity, the former Minister for Education and Science, with the approval of the Government, undertook to explore the possibility of developing a new model of patronage for primary schools.  This involved a consultation process with all the relevant education partners, including the main patron bodies, management bodies and union interests.  From that process the view emerged that maintaining the status quo would not address the new demands being placed upon the education system.  It also revealed a widespread general welcome for the initiative itself and for the main principles of the approach being adopted.The Government agreed that the new model of primary school patronage would be a new State model of community national schools under the patronage of vocational education committees.  It will have the capacity to cater for the wishes of parents for denominational, multidenominational and non-denominational education within the framework of a single patron model and a single board of management structure.  The emphasis in the community national school model will be on inclusiveness and respect for the diversity of cultures in our society and one of the central purposes of the new model will be to cater for this diversity within a single school setting rather than in more than one school.  Community national schools will welcome and respect all faiths and none and will proceed on the basis of clearly stated principles in respect of the availability of religious education during the school day, in conformity with the wishes of parents.  This commitment is an important distinguishing feature of the model.  A multi-belief programme will include provision for faith specific teaching for children of the main faiths represented in the schools, in accordance with the wishes of parents and subject to the availability of the necessary resources.  The schools will also seek to cater for parents who do not wish their children to receive religious education in any particular faith.  It is not the intention that the new model of patronage will replace existing models but that it will be a complementary alternative where the specific local circumstances warrant this new approach.The new patronage model is currently being piloted in five locations in counties Dublin, Meath and Kildare.  These community national schools are committed to a high standard of education and each child is helped to reach his or her personal potential.  They operate in a spirit of partnership between patrons, teachers, students, parents and the wider community served by the school.  I am happy to say that the experience to date indicates that the pilot schools are successfully addressing the changing demands and expectations of the society in which we now live, notably, the demand for diversity.  They are meeting the ensuing challenges with real determination, co-operation and enthusiasm.  Most important, the feedback from pupils, parents, teachers and school management, who are the key stakeholders in this project, is overwhelmingly positive.Moving on to the details of the draft legislation, sections 1 to 3 of the Bill are the standard provisions for the Short Title, collective citations, construction and commencement, interpretation and expenses.  Specifically in regard to the community national school model, the Bill provides for a new additional model of patronage for primary schools; amends and extends the functions of VECs to facilitate them in acting as patron or joint patron in the primary school system; and amends the Education Act 1998 to provide that a board of management of a community national school will operate in the same way as boards of management in primary schools generally rather than under the governance model used in post-primary VEC schools.Section 4 provides for a VEC to establish or maintain a primary school, either on its own initiative with the consent of the Minister or on the direction of the Minister.  A VEC may also on its own initiative seek the consent of the Minister to become patron or joint patron of an existing primary school or become patron, or joint patron, of an existing primary school on the direction of the Minister.  In considering whether to grant consent in any of these circumstances to the establishment of a school in a particular area, the Minister must be satisfied that the following requirements set down in section 10(2) of the Education Act 1998, as amended by this legislation, are met — that the needs of existing and likely future pupil numbers could not reasonably be met by the existing schools in the area and that it is desirable to establish a new school that can meet their needs; provision of the prescribed curriculum, co-operation with the inspectorate; compliance with health, safety and building standards; conformity with relevant ministerial regulations and with any other terms and conditions as may reasonably be attached to recognition of a school by the Minister; and the efficient and effective use of resources.Section 5 amends section 14(2) of the Education Act 1998 to remove the exemption for boards of management of community national schools established or maintained by VECs from the requirement to be constituted as a body corporate.  This is to enable the boards of management of community national schools to operate in the same way as boards of management in primary schools generally.  The board of management of a school established under this legislation will not be a sub-committee of a VEC, as is the case for post-primary VEC schools, but will instead be set up following the same procedures as apply to boards of management in other recognised primary schools.  This means, for instance, that teaching and non-teaching staff will be employed by the board of management in the same way as other primary schools and the board will receive capitation and other funding directly from the Department in the same way as primary schools generally.As patron, the VEC will provide the chair and one other member of the board of management and this will correspond with the position regarding two patron nominees to a board of management applying in primary schools generally.  The nomination of VEC representatives to a board of management will be an executive function.  However, the executive would not be precluded from nominating a VEC member or members to this role.Sections 6, 7 and 8 provide for some necessary or consequential amendments to the Education Act 1998 arising from the provisions in sections 4 and 5.As I have mentioned, the drafting of legislation to permit VEC patronage at primary level has also been availed of to deal with a number of other pressing education-related issues where primary legislation is necessary.  These are dealt with in sections 9, 10, 11 and 12 of the Bill, as follows.Section 9 of the Bill, the result of an amendment to section 2 of the Education Act 1998, provides for the amendment of the definition of "support services" in the Education Act 1998 to clarify the position on the delivery of speech therapy services and other health and personal services to students of school-going age.The Education Act 1998 lists the planning and co-ordination of support services, including speech therapy services, as a function of the Minister for Education and Skills.  While there is agreement at policy level that the HSE will continue to provide such services, the proposed amendments of the Education Act 1998 are necessary to clarify the position in regard to the delivery of speech therapy services to students of school-going age.  The legislative framework will be regularised in accordance with the de facto position, which is that the provision of speech therapy services is a matter for the HSE.  This position is already acknowledged by the Oireachtas through the provision of voted moneys to the HSE to deliver such services.The proposed provisions will not impact on the availability through the HSE of speech therapy services for children with special educational needs.  My Department's commitment to support the co-ordinated delivery of services to families of children with special educational needs is not diminished.  The Department will continue to work with partners in the health and disability sectors through the vehicle of the cross-sectoral team, as established under the auspices of the office of the Minister of State with responsibility for disability and mental health, and the national disability strategy stakeholder monitoring group.  This provision gives rise to a consequential technical amendment to repeal section 7(5) and (6) of the 1998 Act, as inserted by section 40 of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004.  This is provided for in section 10 of the Bill.Section 11 of the Bill supports the Government decision on rationalisation of agencies in the 2008 budget.  It provides for the abolition of the Educational Disadvantage Committee, a formal statutory committee which has not been in existence since 2005.  The committee was established under section 32 of the Education Act 1998 in order to advise the Minister on policies and strategies to be adopted to identify and correct educational disadvantage.  Its final report, Moving Beyond Educational Disadvantage, was published in December 2005.  That report, along with the previous work of the committee, was a valuable input to the development of DEIS.Section 11 repeals section 32 of the Education Act 1998 and in a consequential technical amendment, the definition of "educational disadvantage" contained in section 32(9) of the 1998 Act has been moved to section 2 of that Act by section 9 of this Bill.Section 12 of the Bill provides for the amendment of section 30 of the Teaching Council Act to allow for the employment, in certain exceptional and limited circumstances, of persons who are not registered teachers under the Act.  To safeguard the standards and quality of education in schools, it is our policy that all teachers should be fully qualified and registered by the Teaching Council.  To date, some 68,000 teachers have been registered by the council.  In primary and post-primary schools, the number of unregistered teachers, in full-time and annual contract posts, is decreasing steadily and has reached an all-time low, as schools are implementing that policy as set out in Circular 40/2010 and previous circulars.In this context, section 30 of the Teaching Council Act 2001, which has not yet been commenced, provides that only registered teachers can be remunerated out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  While it is still my aim that all teachers in schools be registered with the council, and, therefore, fully qualified, it is apparent that to commence section 30 as it stands would have a serious negative impact for a small number of schools where, in specific circumstances, unqualified personnel are required in the short term.The proposed amendment to the Act is necessary to allow the Minister for Education and Skills regulate in a measured way the use of unregistered personnel in exceptional and limited circumstances where the use of unregistered teachers may be necessary.  To date, the use of unqualified personnel has been unregulated.  The overarching aim of protecting the standards of education for students remains and the impact of this amendment is to strike a balance between the rights of students to be taught by registered teachers and the need for individual schools to deal with short-term difficulties.The move to mandatory registration of teachers will be an important factor in progressively ensuring a fully qualified and registered teaching cohort.  However, the reality facing schools is that it is not always possible to engage a registered teacher, particularly at short notice.  This may be because of geographical reasons or the lack of availability of teachers of particular subjects at a given time.  This reality exists despite the maintenance of a high level of output of graduates and it is important that provision be made for the exceptional and limited circumstances where the use of unregistered teachers may be necessary.I hope Deputies will agree that at a time of increasing diversity of demand and in challenging economic conditions, this is an important Bill.  I look forward to hearing the views of Deputies today and to further debate as the Bill progresses through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I commend the Bill to the House.

Molaimid cuid de na moltaí atá ann, ach feicimid lochtanna móra le cuid mhaith eile.  Tá sé tábhachtach go mbeidh díospóireacht againn, ní hamháin sa Dáil ach sa choiste.  Molaimid freisin, ach go háirithe, go scríobhfadh an tAire chuig tuismitheoir gach dalta chun díospóireacht a chothú sa tír faoin treo ina bhfuil an t-oideachas ag dul sa tír, go mór mhór an bunoideachas.  Ba mhaith an rud freisin tuairimí tuismitheoirí a chur in iúl don Aire agus don Roinn i dtreo agus go mbeidh fios cinnte againn an treo a theastaíonn ó thuismitheoirí.  Is locht mór ar an mBille é nach bhfuil an díospóireacht sin ar siúl agus nach bhfuil an tAire sásta go mbeidh díospóireacht ar phatrúnacht scoileanna go ginearálta.  Ba chóir go mbeadh an díospóireacht sin oscailte agus go mbeadh cead cainte ag gach éinne sa díospóireacht.Our country is at a crossroads.  There are many points in the Bill that I laud and support, particularly with regard to the new role for vocational education committees.  However, let me deal with some of the problems I have with the Bill, particularly in light of the last part of the Minister's address.  I want to make it very clear that my party will be against some of the provisions in the Bill because they are discriminatory, particularly against teachers who are fully qualified and registered.I get the impression from the last part of the Minister's speech, which I am addressing first, that there is inadequate preparation in the Bill for the fact that tens of thousands of qualified graduates who are registered with the Teaching Council cannot obtain positions at present.  I and many of my colleagues, including Deputy Quinn and, I am sure, the Minister, receive representations from fully qualified and registered teachers who cannot obtain employment in schools.The Minister is establishing in this legislation the right to have clearly unqualified personnel paid to teach in schools.  That is the most controversial aspect of the Bill.  It relates to the Minister's decision to allow unqualified personnel to continue teaching in classrooms at a time when we are exporting our graduates daily and when we have the highest level of unemployment in the history of the State.  It is not acceptable that the Minister and her Department are failing to deal with this issue.  Last year, there were over 300 unqualified personnel acting as teachers in classrooms.  The Department of Education and Skills makes the point that the number has dropped but there are still over 100,000 paydays claimed by unqualified personnel in schools right across the country.  This represents 100,000 days during which children lose access to qualified teachers.  That is not good enough.Qualified teachers are paying €90 per year to register with the Teaching Council, a body put in place to promote teaching as a profession.  Is it not surprising that many teachers now resent having to pay the annual fee for recognition as a teacher when people with no qualifications at all can pick up work in schools?  This is undermining the teaching profession and it undermines Government policy at a time when the Minister is making legal provision to pay people who are not qualified to work in this area.  I cannot and do not accept that a school principal cannot find a qualified person to work, even at short notice, in a school.  I understand the Irish Primary Principals' Network operates a texting service to people listed on its database as interested in taking up a temporary or short term teaching post.  Those interested then communicate directly with the schools concerned, supplying their qualifications and Teaching Council registration number.  The Minister should insist on this being the state of affairs here.  Many students, having qualified as a teacher at their parents' expense, are often unable to get a job because people who are not qualified to do the job have been taken on.  This sends out the message that this issue has not been addressed.  Surely, given modern technology — I do not wish to over-labour this point — we should be able to put in place a database which can be accessed each morning by principals seeking a substitute teacher from the following day.  They could then make their calls and get on with school business.  This is the simplest way of addressing this issue.  To continue to recognise, as is being done in this legislation, the employment of unqualified personnel is unacceptable.Another issue of concern is that a person wishing to check on the Teaching Council website if his or her teacher is qualified can only do this if he or she knows the Teaching Council registration number.  I believe that anybody should be able to check on the Teaching Council website, without having to know the teacher's registration number, whether he or she is qualified.  This, again, is a matter of using technology to provide people with the information they require such as whether a teacher is qualified or if he or she is being taught in the classroom by an unqualified person.  This could be easily organised.  Also, how does one ensure a teacher who has been struck off the Teaching Council register for whatever reason — I am not suggesting this is happening — is not as an unqualified teacher taken on by a school.  While I am not implying that is the Minister's intention, I believe this could happen.The Minister in the latter part of her speech referred to speech and language services, an issue of concern.  Like other Members of the Oireachtas, I, too, constantly receive complaints — properly so — from parents of children who cannot access adequate speech and language services.  This issue has been largely overlooked in the commentary so far on this Bill.  It is worrying that we are handing over to the Health Service Executive responsibility for speech and language services.  This appears to be another case of the Department moving away from adequate provision of supports for children with special needs.  Special classes have been abolished and special needs assistants, language supports and resource teachers have been withdrawn.  The Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 has been deferred and responsibility for a hugely important service is to be given to the most unaccountable and inefficient agency in the State.  What are the facts in this regard?The current system of provision for speech and language services is hopelessly inadequate, with the most recent figures published by the HSE in April 2010 suggesting that 23,646 children and teenagers are on waiting lists nationally for speech therapy assessment or treatment needs.  The Minister has suggested that taking responsibility for speech and language services from the Department of Education and Skills and making it the responsibility of the HSE will improve co-ordination and delivery of services to children on these waiting lists.  I ask that the Minister respond on Committee Stage to these fundamental and critically important issues.  Tens of thousands of young people need these services now but are not getting them.  The Minister is not providing a solution to this basic disability from which these children and teenagers suffer and which can be remediated.  If they get the services they are entitled to, they will be able to communicate in a proper manner.  It is unacceptable that the Government has washed its hands of this issue in this legislation.  They are the critical points I wished to put on the record of the House at the outset.We support the main provisions of the Bill.  Ireland is in many ways at a crossroads owing to changes in our demographics.  There have been significant changes in our population during the past number of years.  I take this opportunity thank my researcher, Ms Áine Kilroy, and the Oireachtas Library which produced an excellent and worthwhile document——

The Oireachtas is providing us with excellent services.  Much of what I am saying comes from that service although I do not state it as the author of everything I say here.In 2002, approximately 221,000, or 5.7%, of our population were non-Irish, namely, people born outside the State.  In 2007, this had grown to more than 417,000 so that one in every ten people in our population was not born in Ireland.  In 2006, some 3.4% of our population were of mixed background, namely, black or black-Irish or Asian or Asian-Irish.  Our population is diversifying.  An analysis of the change in religious diversity shows that while 92% of Irish people declared themselves, in terms of religion, to be Roman Catholic, 51% of non-Irish people were also Roman Catholic, suggesting a real need for change.  Some 2.8% of Irish people and 16.3% of non-Irish people stated they were of no religion.  There has been significant changes in our population and thus many schools in different areas have needs which must be met in terms of how students are taught and what type of school they attend, be it denominational, multi-denominational, non-denominational and so on.  I acknowledge that this legislation is being introduced in an effort to meet the changing needs of Ireland.  I commend and support the new role proposed for the vocational education committees, VECs, which themselves are changing and in respect of which further changes are required.  I believe there are other services which can and should be provided by the VECs.The Roman Catholic Church, in the person of Archbishop Diarmuid Martin, has acknowledged that it cannot continue to run 92% of schools when some 87% of the population are Roman Catholics.  There is a need for change and consultation.  A criticism we have of this Bill is the lack of open debate regarding patronage of our schools.  So far, discussions between the Department and, in particular, the Catholic Church, have been private.  We would like that debate to be opened out into the public domain.  One way of doing so is through the Oireachtas, in particular the Joint Committee on Education and Skills which could, prior to the taking of Committee Stage of this Bill invite in parents, representatives of the different churches and none and other interested parties to tease out where we want to go in terms of patronage.  While I acknowledge and support the changes being made, I do not believe there has been sufficient or adequate proper public debate on all of these issues.  There must be new choices for parents and students and discussions in regard to where the new schools of which the Minister spoke will be located.  It appears from the facts we have received that the new schools are likely, initially at least, to become VEC primary schools in city and urban areas as these are the areas wherein there has been significant growth.  That is also where a greater mix exists.The relevant research shows that, in the context of diversity, something of the order of 40% of schools do not have any new intake.  The position in schools in Dublin 15, where there have been significant changes, is different.  These schools have been obliged to take in children of different nationalities who speak various languages.  Many of these children do not have English as a first language.  These are multicultural schools and they are obliged to deal with people of all religions and none.In the context of the change that is going to come, using the VECs is a very good idea.  I welcome the fact that the Bill bestows on the latter the power to establish and run primary schools should they so wish.  The VECs may also take over the running of new schools.  I presume this will occur in circumstances where the voluntary relinquishment of the patronage of a primary occurs.  It will be at this point that the Minister's power to issue a direction will come into play.  We must recognise that change is taking place.  The Bill moves forward the agenda for such change.As part of the Bills digest pack relating to this Bill, the Oireachtas Library and Research Service has included statistics relating to a survey carried out by the Irish Catholic Bishops Conference.  In that survey, people were asked to identify the type of school, out of the various models on offer, they would choose for their children.  Some 48% indicated they would send their children to schools managed by religious denominations, 37% stated they would prefer schools in which common religious frameworks apply, 10% indicated they would choose schools not under the management of religious denominations and 5% stated they would seek schools with altogether different structures in place.  In the context of a public debate on patronage choices, it would be better if the Tánaiste rather than schools wrote to parents and sought their views.  Such action would inform the debate and would help to facilitate both the change and choice people are seeking.In many instances, VEC-run schools were viewed as being "second best" in the past.  Both I and my father worked in such schools and I am, therefore, well versed in their operation.  There was a time when these schools were known colloquially as "techs".  Students left such schools when they had sat the equivalent of the junior certificate and obtained their trade certificates.  They then sought work in their chosen trades or whatever.  It was only in later years that these techs developed into fully-fledged and excellent schools which competed on a level playing field with other schools.It is important that the new VEC primary schools envisaged under the Bill should not all be established in areas where large immigrant populations exist or where certain economic indicators apply.  They should not merely become schools for ethnic minorities or for those who live in areas of high unemployment.  There should be no cherry-picking in respect of primary schools.  I am sure that neither the Tánaiste nor her Department want this to happen.  However, we must ensure that it does not come to pass.A broader vision is required in respect of the choice that exists in the context of VEC primary schools.  As the Tánaiste is aware, there is not merely one type of VEC school.  One of the issues that arises is that in the event of a new national school being established, the VEC could share the patronage with a denomination.  In addition, schools could be multi-denominational and so on.  There are many permutations and combinations which can and will arise.  I reiterate the point made by some commentators that these schools should not become places of education which do not enjoy universal support among all the parents in the areas in which they will be located.My family has always supported the principle that one's children should attend the nearest national school.  I hope that this will happen.  However, I accept that this contradicts everything I have just said with regard to diversity.  My personal preference for these schools would be that they should be multi-denominational but I accept that other people have different preferences.  VEC schools must operate on a level playing field with all other schools.  In other words, they must access to the same resources, they must be as professionally run and the same rules relating to pupil intake must apply to them.There must be a broader role for VECs.  Among the major criticisms levelled at VECs is that they are inefficient, overly bureaucratic and too costly.  There are many different views in respect of VECs.  Having served on one for over 25 years, I agree with some of the criticisms that are made.There is a need for a new departure in the area of education.  Under this, a new type of VEC or the system that exists could offer support on a voluntary basis.  In other words, denominational-non-VEC schools could consider or opt for the provision of HR support.  One of the major issues that arises for small primary schools in the context of HR problems is where to find assistance.  I am aware that Monaghan VEC supplies IT services to primary schools in its area.  Issues arise in the context of building maintenance, financial expertise, etc., and VECs could provide support services in respect of these.  This would be a good development because the management in schools would not be obliged to be concerned with regard to issues such as those to which I refer.  If the model I have outlined comes into play, it could give rise to significant additional benefits and bring about the development of new synergies and ideas that would facilitate the change that is required.I have a number of real criticisms in respect of the Bill and I intend to be vocal about them.  I am aware that the teacher unions and those who are unemployed will be equally vocal.  Having registered and qualified, the latter are going to want to be able to stand shoulder to shoulder with everyone else.There have been many success stories in the context of broadening diversity at primary level in recent years.  This has been achieved through the gaelscoileanna and the Educate Together movement.  VEC schools will have a role to play in this regard in the future.  However, there is no timeline, no plan, no engagement with parents and no real commitment to bring about change in the process put in place by the Tánaiste.  It is difficult to understand the Department and the Tánaiste are taking in the context of catering for increased diversity.  Is there a masterplan which has been hidden from public view or is a piecemeal approach — as evidenced by this Bill — being taken?If the Tánaiste and her Department are keen to confront the issue of the direction we are taking, why can they not take on the views of all stakeholders and engage in an open and public debate.  In light of the increase in the school-going population that is expected to occur in the coming years and the changing nature of modern Ireland, there is surely a need to engage in a discussion on the direction we are taking and on how we want our schools to be run.  This matter is far too important to be ignored.My predecessor as education and skills spokesperson, Deputy Brian Hayes, and the Fine Gael Party have long been calling for a national forum on education to bring this matter into the public eye in order to give all stakeholders, particularly parents, an opportunity to indicate what they are seeking and who they want to run their children's schools.  Such a forum must be established.  Before this happens, however, the Tánaiste should write to every parent who has or will soon have a school-going child and ask them what they want.  This is a complex issue but the debate in respect of it is extremely valuable in nature.  The debate to which I refer is really focused on our country and the direction it is taking in light of the changes that have occurred.I look forward to the Committee Stage debate on the Bill.  I do not believe it will be confrontational in political terms.

When the debate to which I refer is completed, there must be a better education system which incorporates greater choice.  In addition, parents rather than any one single individual must be in control of that system.  In order to ensure that this goal is achieved, our main emphasis must be on consultation and on listening to the views of all interested parties to the greatest degree possible.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	284	I thank the Tánaiste and her Department for bringing forward this legislation.  I say that, despite the fact that the gestation period relating to it was extraordinarily long.  I read the Tánaiste's speech with interest.  She might in her reply indicate what section of the Bill specifically facilitates or assists the Catholic Church in its deliberations on the possibility of divesting of patronage in some of its schools.  If there is such an explicit reference I welcome it because there is an intention and desire for that.  The reference was in the first paragraph of the Minister's speech.  Archbishop Diarmuid Martin, the largest patron in terms of numbers of schools in the country, has expressed an opinion that he would be much happier with 50% of the schools for Catholic education rather than the 92% he currently possesses.The Minister refers to a new model of patronage which this Bill proposes, with the new model of patronage being the kind of idea which informed the debate articulated by many people, including the former secretary general of the INTO, who wanted a community school.  In this context we are talking about new schools but in the communities which are fairly homogeneous, these are 75% of schools across the country catering for 25% of the population.With all due respect, I point out that this is not the pressure point of this debate, rather it is about the quality and delivery of education.  Issues such industrial relations and three-teacher schools are for another place and another day.  With regard to accommodating a new patron, as distinct from a new patronage model, the Minister is bringing forward the VEC idea based on the initiative taken by one of her predecessors in 2007 in a panic.  She is requesting that the VECs manage schools under the temporary patronage of the Minister until such time that the legislation is enacted.The tone of the Dáil debate from the many contributions in May is that politicians are familiar with the VEC structure and like the way it functions.  Deputy O'Dowd has mentioned it today.  Politicians may believe that the VEC will be a very suitable and comfortable patron of schools.  I suggest to the Minister and my two Fine Gael colleagues in the House that this is because politicians, as county councillors, have a unique experience of the VEC system which they do not have of the primary school system in its current form of patronage or of the free voluntary sector schools.The thrust of this legislation is to remove that element of democratic accountability and control that is implicit in being a member of a VEC as an elected or appointed member.  Section 4 adds to section 10(2) of the relevant Act an additional definition relating to the school in question.  Notwithstanding what is done in section 5, although the VEC school will remain as such, for all intents and purposes it will be an autonomous corporate body independent of anything else in the VEC system.  All the relationships between such a VEC school and other secondary schools in Drogheda or Dundalk, for example, and all the access to the CEO of the VEC or members of the board of that school — a sub-committee of the VEC — will be swept away.This is not the typical user-friendly secular or modern VEC-type school accessible to elected representatives or people who feel they can come to a councillor or Deputy who stood for election and was on the VEC.  Being on the VEC, such representatives may feel that there is accountability, and having exhausted internal queries with the principal of a school — a primary school — that person may feel that he or she can outline concerns to the VEC member.  That was the way it was sold and it was suggested to everybody in this House that it would be a new model of patronage that is democratically accountable.That is not true  We are merely adding to the existing number of patrons under the current 1998 legislation for primary schools.  It is an eighth patron with no more or fewer powers than existing patrons.  That VEC patron will have no experience of primary education and one would question the capability of the VEC patron to deliver formal primary education.  I am not talking about the vast array of work that VECs do in adult education, literacy and a host of other areas but one could question whether the VECs, as they are currently constituted, have the ability to embark on a new world of exploration in the area of primary education.My two teacher colleagues, on the benches beside me, know that primary teachers get a specific education by means of a three-year degree.  It is a holistic education across the complete learning process of a young child, as distinct from a secondary school teacher who, for example, does an arts degree and subsequently a higher diploma.  If the candidate did honours maths in the leaving certificate and French and German in a university course, they could end up teaching maths in our secondary school system.  That happens.  This is not any new model of patronage but an addition to the existing array of patrons.  The VECs are being asked to do this, as they were asked to by the Minister's predecessor.  There are now five VEC schools working and this will now be the legislative process.There are a couple of questions that should be considered, although we will deal with the Bill in greater detail on Committee Stage.  What will be the ethos of the patron if it is to be the VEC?  We know the ethos of the Church of Ireland, the Roman Catholic Church and the Jewish and Muslim communities, as well as the gaelscoileanna movement.  Who will determine the ethos within the VEC?  Will it be the elected board members or the CEO?  We know how powerful those CEOs are.What will be the mechanism for appointing the two patron members of the VEC?  There are eight members on a typical board of management, with two nominated by the patron.  How are they to be selected?  The parents of the school in question, if they participate in the ballot, will elect the two parent representatives.  Teachers will elect two, one of whom must be the principal of the school.  After this the six people will decide, through a mechanism that can vary from place to place, who the community representatives will be.There is also the issue of the patron's nomination of the chairperson.  What sanction, role, democratic input or scrutiny will the elected members of the VEC have for that process?  This is not set out in the Bill.  Will it be done by the usual Kremlin or Vatican-like system of communication utilised by the Department of Education and Skills, which is the method of circulars?  Will we debate a circular, can it be amended and will there be any input from this House?  This is not a new model of patronage but an extension of the old system.  This is a relatively short Bill but it has deep and long implications.Deputy O'Dowd indicated in his comments that the thrust for this type of school comes from the changing nature of Irish society.  We are no longer the homogeneous, inward-looking, church-ridden island off an island off the coast of the rest of Europe that John McGahern and so many others characterised in literature.  The same John McGahern, because he spoke the truth of his time, was sacked as a primary school teacher at the behest of the then archbishop of Dublin.  Fortunately, he taught enough good young people like Declan Kiberd and others to leave us with a legacy of excellence which continues to hold the light up against that dark period in our history.The Catholic Church, through Bishop Leo O'Reilly — a very nice and reasonable man — has set out a clear attitude to the teaching of religion in primary schools.  He has articulated a view, which he is entitled to, in a publication and couple of articles for newspapers, that the church does not believe in non-denominational education.  It wants multi-denominational education in schools.It accepts one should have a religious curriculum taught in which the history and the diversity of the world's religions, including those without a belief system in a superior being, Humanism as well as Hinduism and Confucianism.  Considering we will be doing so much business with China in the future, we had better learn about Confucianism.  Schools, the Roman Catholic Church feels, should separate religious education from religious instruction while every child should have an understanding of the world's religions and should be free to decide — or their parents on their behalf — what religious path they want to follow and have the instruction to ensure they adhere to the path chosen.  This liberty for parents and their children is perfectly reasonable and one I support.For educationalists, the issue arises as to whether faith formation — religious instruction — should take place inside or outside school hours.  The Educate Together model, like the ones adopted in many other countries, opts for the latter option, outside of school hours.  A general education is provided during school time while a period after school is given in which the school authorities provide every facility for those parents who want their children prepared for, say, first communion and confirmation.  Many Catholic children attending Church of Ireland schools are also provided with this time.  The Archbishop of Dublin, Diarmuid Martin, has stated he wants those parents, who may seldom go to church, to become involved in the faith formation of their children for communion and confirmation and not delegate it to the teachers.The agreement made with the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, and the representatives of the church gave a commitment that the form of religious instruction, which will be an integral part of the primary school system, will be faith formation inside school hours.  Will the Tánaiste and Minister for Education and Skills confirm if this method of teaching religion will be extended to schools under VEC patronage after this legislation is enacted?  If it will be the case, will she explain how a class of 30 children will be divided up for the four-week faith formation in, say, confirmation?  Has she explored the implications, costs and logistics of this?  What happens to the other children of different denominations or of none?There has already been extensive correspondence between the chief executive officer of the County Dublin VEC and others involved in education seeking clarification on some of these questions.  I know the Department spends its time doing little else but thinking about these fundamental issues.  The questions, however, remain unanswered.Serious difficulties emerge with this.  Citizens in this republic have a right to choose the education they want for their children, irrespective of whether their birth certificate states they are Roman Catholic, Jewish or Protestant.  While Roman Catholics make up a large part of the population according to census statistics, these figures are not often reflected in choice of education or religious instruction.  Some Roman Catholic parents do wish to have their children educated in a multidenominational context to ensure they have an understanding of other people's beliefs.Coming from County Donegal, the Tánaiste and Minister for Education and Skills would know better than some of us from the south that a lack of understanding of other people's religions has been a source of suspicion, antagonism and, as we saw in the past, violence in this country.  Many argue that much of the conflict in the modern world is driven by religious intolerance informed by ignorance.  The only way to ameliorate this is through knowing a little bit more about each other's beliefs and practices.  Sadly, in this country most of us have little of such knowledge.  One would think that educating a child in others' beliefs and practices is best when the child is four years of age or more and has no prejudices or antagonisms.While 48% of parents would like a denominational education for their children, over one third of those polled would like a multidenominational education.  Is this provided for in or outside school hours?  How will the logistics for its provision be worked out?  More important in these days of cost consciousness, has anyone calculated the cost implications of this in the coming decades?Article 44 of the Constitution states:1. The State acknowledges that the homage of public worship is due to Almighty God.  It shall hold His Name in reverence, and shall respect and honour religion.2. 1° Freedom of conscience and the free profession and practice of religion are, subject to public order and morality, guaranteed to every citizen.2° The State guarantees not to endow any religion.Article 42 provides for primary education and insists parents send their children to school.  In cases where a parent opts to educate a child at home, the Constitution provides that the parent must demonstrate he or she is meeting certain obligations.  It is as much a protection of the child, as it is the right of the parent.  Schools, be they under the patronage of the local Roman Catholic bishop, Church of Ireland community or Educate Together, are denominational non-State organisations that, as established by the Stanley Letter of 1831, have been asked to provide primary education while in return the State provides the moneys for such provision.  This system of education, which we inherited, has, by and large, served us very well.  The VECs, however, are not a linguistic or cultural movement such as An Foras Pátrúnachta.  Neither are they multidenominational such as Educate Together.  The VECs are a State organ.  Can a State organ adhere to the constitutional provisions I earlier set out while employing teachers to teach religion?  Has this been assessed?  I hope it is not a contradictory or conflicting matter because I am looking for a formula which will accommodate everyone.  There are some concerns in this regard.I will read from the conclusion of a paper, Freedom of Religion in the Irish Primary School System: a Failure to Protect Human Rights?, the author of which is Dr. Alison Mawhinney from Queen's University.  The concluding remarks are worth listening to:The analysis presented in this paper suggests that the Irish domestic legal order does not provide protection against involuntary religious indoctrination conveyed through the practice of a doctrinal integrated curriculum in primary schools.  The conscience clauses found in the Constitution and the Education Act 1988 cannot operate to protect freedom of religion in a situation where a child is exposed to doctrinal teaching throughout the school day.  These provisions are designed for a school system which is non-denominational and where religious instruction is only given during specific timetabled hours.  By the standards set by international human rights bodies, the operation of a doctrinal integrated curriculum in an education system dominated by religious schools — where realistic alternatives are non-existent — raises serious concerns under both the Convention [the European Convention on Human Rights] and the UN treaties and should, if brought to the notice of the supervisory bodies, cause Ireland to be declared in breach of its international obligations.This is not fanciful because we have been cited and the Irish Human Rights Commission has responded to those suggestions and attempted to make submissions on them, something of which the Minister is no doubt aware.  I will complete the quotation, which has a conclusion I share:The difficulty the [Irish] state has in taking appropriate measures to comply with international standards stems from the fact that it has chosen to deliver primary education almost entirely through the medium of religious non-state actors.  In the absence of realistic alternatives to religious schools, the only alternative form of acceptable state-funded denominational schooling would be one where religious instruction is taught for a specific period of the day from which it is practically possible to opt out and where teachers refrain from any attempt at indoctrination.  However, this arrangement produces a tension between the rights of a child not to be exposed to unwanted doctrinal instruction and the rights of those parents who wish to see their children receive a full denominational education through the practice of an integrated curriculum.We have a problem.  Enough reputational damage has been done to this country. As the Minister's Department is no doubt aware, cases are going through the courts. Facts are facts and this Republic has signed up willingly and knowingly to conventions and obligations.  Have the implications of our international commitments been fully thought through and has the Attorney General been consulted on the constitutionality of this Bill?My view, as a non-lawyer but someone who has some parliamentary experience, is that the Bill, as presented to any Attorney General, would of course be deemed constitutional because it does not contain any specification about the ethos of a VEC.  There is no indication as to what the ethos should be and there is no reference at all to faith formation inside school hours which is the current practice of the model VEC primary schools.We could find ourselves in a very messy situation in which I would hate to see this country mired.  The Minister has access to the records and the people who worked with the previous Minister when the concession was made by the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, to adopt what the Catholic Church and Bishop Leo O'Reilly wanted, namely, faith formation inside school hours.  That issue may need to be revisited.Educate Together, which is the only group in this Republic with any experience of this thorny issue, would be the first to say that it took a long time to get it right, there was a lot of internal debate and dispute within it and it has now finally arrived at a model which so far seems to work.  Nobody has a monopoly on wisdom or experience but it is something that needs to be examined seriously — I say that in a constructive way.I would like to ask why the VECs are now being targeted and about their value for money.  Does the Department know the additional unit administrative cost for a secondary school pupil in a VEC, as distinct from a secondary school pupil in a free voluntary school?  Does it know the additional administrative cost for a primary school pupil in a VEC?  I refer only to the administrative costs and not capitation grants and teachers' salaries, all of which are common.Will the two nominated board members, who will be nominated by the patrons of the boards of management of the primary schools, get expenses for attending meetings, as they currently do?

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	291	I am disgruntled at the possibility that the State could be hauled before international courts for a breach of human rights, that the VECs as State bodies would be in breach of our Constitution and that people who have no experience whatsoever of running primary schools will now be asked to take on new responsibilities when the entire organisation from which they work will be in freefall turmoil with overruns of one kind or another if the Government's track record in the HSE is to be replicated with the amalgamations which are to take place.I will revert to the Minister on the Teaching Council at the relevant Stage.  In her reply she might answer a query which was put to me, namely, that part of the Minister and Teaching Council's difficulty is that a number of special schools, including ABA schools, have teachers who are not recognised as teachers by the Teaching Council.  In order to enforce the thrust of the Teaching Council legislation, which I support, specific definitions of "teachers" in certain areas will have to be accommodated in order that they can be registered without an open-ended extension of that provision coming into force.I agree in principle with what Deputy O'Dowd said.  There must be a better way of harnessing the resources of recently qualified teachers.  There must be some way of saying to somebody who is retired and may have been the preferred and favourite principal of the newly appointed principal that he or she cannot step in at short notice to provide standby provision for teaching.  It is something that is causing great offence to young teachers who cannot get the hours they need in order to get through their parole period.They could be substitute teachers.  It could be done for extended periods of illness, for people who take a leave of absence or women who, in a highly feminised profession, take maternity leave.  It can be planned in those areas.  If somebody calls a school at 8.50 a.m. to say he she cannot teach, that is different and there needs to be a panel of the standby teachers.  However, for long extended substitute periods I would like the Minister to outline on Committee Stage what kind of safeguards she will introduce.This legislation has been slow in coming but its arrival is still welcome.  However, it does not answer the big questions to which I want to hear answers and perhaps the Minister will be able to do this.  Will there be regulations to give effect to this legislation or will it be by circular?  If it is by circular we are back to the same old game again.  This is not a new patronage model; it is the eighth patron body being attached to the existing system.  This is not democratically accountable in the manner in which so many of our colleagues spoke about in the Chamber in May.  This could, if it continues in its current form, cause great constitutional difficulties for the country.  Most importantly of all, it could thwart the aspirations of that increasing number of parents who want a choice, within reason and cost, for the education of their children.We can get there but the Minister will have to face some demons in her Department and elsewhere who have been used to dominating the debate on education in this country.  I think she has the courage and strength to do so and I welcome the bringing forward of this legislation.  We will not oppose the Bill on Second Stage by calling a vote, but we will bring forward substantial and well thought out amendments.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	292	I welcome the introduction of the Bill and the opportunity to contribute to what has been so far a very important and interesting debate on the matters contained in it, and on some matters outside of the purview of the Bill itself.  I have engaged with the Tánaiste, Deputy Mary Coughlan, as the Minister for Education and Skills on parliamentary questions and Adjournment matters but this is my first occasion to engage with her on a legislative matter.  I welcome her to the Department and I think she will make a great go of it.  I also think, at the risk of being deemed sexist, that it is a Department which suits a woman.  I do not care what the Deputies all say; I believe it.

I wish her good luck in the Department and I have no doubt whatsoever that she will soon rumble the various subterranean plots which abound in Marlborough Street and which are bound to trip up a Minister at the very least opportunity.  It is a Department with a long-standing reputation for that and from what I note it has not deviated from it.

An unwitting Minister may and could stumble on many occasions.  Anyway, the Minister is welcome there and I have no doubt that she will make her mark, as have the other women who have occupied that position.I want to make my first point, which is on the new model of running a primary school.  When all of this came out, which was as far as I remember in February 2007, it was born out of a frantic realisation about the numbers and wondering where would we put all the children that were appearing, how would they be governed and what was the board of management ethos.  At the time, I read all about it because I have retained a huge interest in education.  Immediately, my suspicious mind jumped to wondering why the churches had such a huge interest in pushing it through.  I found it quite amazing.  Deputy Quinn has given many learned speeches and observations on the need for the church to remove itself from the running of primary schools.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	298	Not all of them; some of them.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	299	All right.I was a bit astounded at the alacrity with which this new model, the VEC community primary school, was being embraced, bearing in mind that we have had for a number of years — since the early 1980s with the Dalkey multi-denominational school — a very successful primary school model called Educate Together, which now numbers 57 primary schools.  This is quite a huge number and they have made their way and, I am sure, have had huge debate about how they will position the teaching of religion.  They have done so very well and against a background of pupils from all faiths and none.  Wherever Educate Together has been established it has been applauded and followed and it is increasing enrolment numbers everywhere.When the Minister spoke on the Bill this morning I would have thought a couple of sentences included in her speech would have pointed to the record of Educate Together in primary education and what it has done, and would have suggested looking at it.  However, there was no such mention.  It was as if it was being erased from the scene.  That is not so.  Educate Together is here and it is here to stay.  I have kept up my contacts with Educate Together, with its very active CEO and with the directorate which runs its primary schools and I know it is in the running for very large post-primary schools in Gorey and Lucan, and I am sure in other places also.I was quite amazed that there was no reference to the very successful and satisfactory model adopted by Educate Together.  I would be glad if the Minister, when she sums up on Second Stage, refers to why Educate Together was obliterated from the spoken scene here today and way she did not make reference in any way — either in applause or disdain — to the very fine record of Educate Together.  I am quite surprised that even if it had not been included she did not think herself to include it in the speech.  Be that as it may, I want to put it on the record that I inaugurated and initiated several new primary Educate Together schools in a time of huge austerity, quite similar to what the Minister faces now, and my record in the Department of Education and Skills will show it.  They have continued to operate to great advantage to their pupils and parents.Deputy Quinn spoke about a lack of democratic accountability because the VEC community primary school will be removed from the remit of the VEC committee.  I would not have any disagreement with this because there could be too much involvement of a committee in the running of primary school.  The Educate Together model has huge parental involvement.  Not only are they in the school, but they also run the financial remit and the curriculum.  They are very heavily involved.  I do not know whether the schools established by the Minister and three more to open will have that same type of democratic parental involvement, which is the hallmark of the earlier type of school of which I spoke.I have nothing against the VECs; they were a very fine start up when we had no education in this country and they do fantastic work.  I smiled when the Minister unveiled the amalgamation at our parliamentary party meeting last night.  I could tell on the floor of the House the story I told the Minister some time ago: in my time there was no bord snip nua, only Mr. Haughey who was then, in administrative terms, an bord snip nua.  I was told to reduce the number of VECs and I came up a plan not as ambitious as that of the Minister.  I guess there is a Machiavellian element in what the Minister has proposed.  She will tell an bord snip nua that she did better than it told her and that she is a very good girl to be patted on the back.  Fair dues to her she came up with a very low number, much lower than I had anticipated all those years ago.  I got my files together, the legislation was being prepared and everybody was saying well done and that it was a marvellous idea.  Then, in 1989, there were local and European elections.  They all importuned Mr. Haughey, who telephoned me one day to tell me to go slow on my proposal to amalgamate the VECs.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	312	The strategy pursued by my Department is an integral part of the whole-of-government framework for economic recovery and growth adopted in 2008.We are focused on employment creation through support for Irish firms, large and small, and winning foreign direct investment to sustain and expand job opportunities and boost our economic output, and they are achieving results.  Last month's official figures show strong growth in exports by Irish companies in the first eight months of this year.  Exports were up 8% between June and July and our trade surplus is up 29% to €4 billion.So far this year Enterprise Ireland, EI, with funding from my Department, has delivered 32 overseas events including trade missions to Russia, Australia and the United States.  Some 645 companies participated and significant business has been won.  EI brought 395 international buyers into Ireland to meet client companies and write new business.  Sixty-three international public procurement contracts for client companies have been won.  EI believes that over 70% of exports lost in 2009 will be recovered in 2010.So far this year, 44 new high potential start ups, 24 of which are outside Dublin, have been approved funding and there is a strong pipeline to the end of the year.  IDA Ireland has secured 75 investments to date in 2010, which have the potential to create 6,000 jobs.  These investments include the world's leading companies such as Stream, IBM and Google in Dublin, and United Healthcare, Lilly and Electronic Arts.  The majority of these companies are already in the process of recruiting staff.Building on these achievements, the new integrated trade, tourism and investment strategy is global in scope and covers both existing and new high growth potential markets.  It sets out ambitious targets to be achieved by 2015, that is, to create 300,000 new jobs in manufacturing, tourism and traded services, of which 150,000 will be direct new jobs and another 150,000 will be generated through spin-off benefit.  The strategy presents a suite of actions for building on existing strengths and driving trade relations in existing as well as new and emerging economies.My Department is pursuing a number of other objectives in support of the achievement of the 300,000 jobs target, including a continued commitment to investing in research, development and innovation, reducing administrative burdens on business, driving the response to the innovation task force and addressing issues of competitiveness.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21031	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	313	I thank the Minister for his reply, which, incidentally, talked all about the future and did not address the success of his Department.My difficulty with the Department is that it and the Minister make commitments and then simply ignore them.  The Department's strategy statement stated that it would deliver 62 targets in 2009 and it only delivered on 24, including the ones on which it was off target.  The Department was off target on export sales by 48%, growth companies by 20% and the rights commissioner hearings by 50%.  The PRSI scheme is now 90% off target.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21031	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	315	Why is the Department consistently failing to deliver the targets it sets for itself?I want to ask the Minister, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, specifically about his target of taking €500 million off compliance costs for business.  We are half way through that programme and the Department has delivered 4%; it is 96% off target.The Minister has failed to deal with the National Competitiveness Council's request for a process for delivering on competitiveness.  He has failed to deliver on his own commitment that he would review the Competition Authority's recommendations and have a process for implementing them.  When will the Minister deliver commitments that he and his Department make?

We have strategies for jobs, trade and innovation in terms of implementing the task force recommendations.  As I see it, we are meeting all of those targets.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21031	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	321	Pull the other one.  That is completely nonsense.

I am chairing the implementation group on innovation and the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, is chairing the trade council.  Both of us are determined to ensure that the targets we have set ourselves would be reviewed on an ongoing basis and that we will achieve them.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21031	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	323	The Minister is 50% off on the Department's export sales target for last year.  He is 50% off on the Department's employment target for last year.  He is off on the Department's trade performance target for last year, its business costs and its commitment on competitiveness.  He is off on every one of them, and then he expects us to believe him when he states he will create 300,000 jobs, boost exports and do the divil knows what.  What about the Minister's record and that of his Department?  He is not delivering on anything to which he commits and we cannot believe that he will suddenly transform himself unless he addresses these failings and honestly answers to the Parliament as to why he has not delivered on them.

We have met our commitment under the Asia strategy.  I note that Deputy Bruton took the 2009 figure but forgot to mention that Enterprise Ireland has indicated that this year it will get back 70% of the exports lost.  I note that he forgot to mention that there was an 8% increase in services exports up to the third quarter.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21031	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	325	I am asking the Minister about his Department's performance last year, which he reported to the Oireachtas, and he is not willing to answer for his failures.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	333	The provision of credit to our enterprise sector, especially SMEs, should primarily come from a properly functioning banking sector and any additional initiative on the State's part should not relieve the banks from their obligations in this regard.However, the Deputy will be aware that my officials are working with their colleagues in the Department of Finance, the Credit Review Office, Enterprise Ireland and Forfás to address access to credit issues for viable SMEs, including the option of a loan guarantee scheme to assist the working capital requirements of SMEs.  The most recent meeting was held on Monday last, 11 October.  A range of issues relating to SME credit were discussed and follow up action is under way.These meetings are aimed at building on the already substantial progress that has been made in identifying the critical elements for further initiatives.  It is important that any new initiatives complement, rather than substitute, the main banks' lending commitments and activities under the recapitalisation package and that they would represent value for money from the taxpayer's perspective.The Deputy's question refers specifically to criteria to be used in any new scheme.  While the specific issues are still under discussion, it is possible that a new initiative would only apply to commercially viable businesses that, despite having demonstrated the ability to repay, were unable to secure lending facilities due to known market failures.  An example of such a failure would be lack of information concerning certain business sectors, certain types of business models and many foreign markets.While the Deputy's question focuses on loan guarantees, this is just one of a range of possible measures being considered to address SME credit availability.  Proposals for any new measures will be considered by Government in the first instance
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	334	I thank the Minister for his reply.  It is amazing that this review is ongoing since June 2010.  Does that demonstrate a mind-boggling level of apathy and lethargy, in the context where small family businesses across the country cannot get the loans they need to keep the show, paying bills to suppliers is a struggle, viable, profitable and well-run businesses are going to the wall because they cannot access credit, and two years on from the introduction of the blanket guarantee our banking system remains in crisis?  We were promised that the guarantee, NAMA and the recapitalisation of the banks would assist, but the banks are risk averse.What is the reason for not proceeding with this measure?  Will the Minister not tell us the truth of the matter?  Is it not the that heavy hand of the Department of Finance, to which I referred in early July, has claws across the introduction of this scheme and is ensuring it does not proceed from the incubation phase?  That is what is going on.  Why are we the last country in Europe that has not introduced such a scheme?  It is not as if we have to reinvent the wheel.  Such a scheme is operating in Britain, China, Singapore and Hong Kong.  What is wrong here?  Why are we different?The Minister wants to ensure that additional moneys will be provided under such a scheme as opposed to moneys in substitution for funds that he expects will be provided.  Furthermore, he wants to ensure that the banks would not be left off in meeting the obligations they have.  Was a report not prepared by Forfás as part of the deliberation process?  What is contained in it and when will it be published?
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	335	I thank the Deputy for this opportunity to pay tribute to the Minister for Finance for all the initiatives he has taken.  I indicated that this matter would be brought to the Cabinet and it was brought to it in July without any fanfare.  The decision at Cabinet was that we would be given a mandate to work with the Department of Finance and the Credit Reviewer to examine the possibility of introducing a loan guarantee scheme.  Meetings on that are ongoing and the last meeting with my officials, the Credit Reviewer and Department of Finance officials took place last Monday.It is important to point out matters, which the Deputy skimmed over, namely, that we have recapitalised the banks and have assured SME businesses there will be €12 billion available to them by way of credit.  All the Ministers of State present went on a roadshow to meet SMEs around the country, get feedback and interact with the banks, and that has been done.  We are delighted there has been an improvement in the overall position.The Minister for Finance put in place a Credit Review Office to examine the operation of the banks, ensure they are lending to SMEs and to report back on a regular basis.  The Minister has also put a statutory code in place.  The Department of Finance and the Minister are understandably concerned to ensure that the banks must not be left off the hook and I agree wholeheartedly with the Minister on that matter.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	336	What we envisage is a co-guarantee in terms of risk sharing with the banks making a decision on a loan application and the Government stepping in to guarantee 50% of the loan.  The benefit of such an arrangement is that there is an alignment of interests between the loan originator and the guarantor.  I know the Minister has concerns in that there are ventures for which there is low collateral.  They may be new types of ventures and the banks are risk averse to those.  Surely the Government can intervene in the case of specified areas and deal with those applications.  As we saw on "The Frontline" programme on Monday, there are innovators waiting to take the plunge.  We should push them along the way by removing the obstacles and facilitating them.

It is also the belief of Forfás, which issued the report.  It indicated there were specialist areas where it may not be possible for the businesses concerned to obtain a bank loan and that in such areas the State should step in.  We are fairly positive that we can do so in certain circumstances.  However, the message must go from here that any guarantee would apply to only 2% to 4% of loans.  It is important to stress that point because such a guarantee scheme cannot be the panacea, as Mr. John Trethowan said, for all the ills in terms of businesses seeking credit.We target what we do in this sector.  We want to give additionality, particularly to the technology sector because businesses in that sector will have no collateral or cash and it will be important for those businesses to be driven to enable them to grow.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	338	The Government is pursuing a whole of enterprise approach to employment creation through support for Irish firms and winning foreign direct investment to sustain and expand job opportunities.  Many jobs that are being created are providing employment opportunities for our graduates.My Department's agencies are playing, and will continue to play, a key role in this regard.  For example, IDA Ireland has already won 75 investments this year spread around the country, with a good mix of new companies starting up and expansions of existing companies.  Enterprise Ireland has supported client companies in winning new exports and has announced 700 new jobs so far this year.  SFI is engaged with a range of innovative Irish and multinational companies and is investing €45 million in supporting more than 300 researchers.  In the next six months SFI will support three competency centres, a new energy research centre and collaborate with 88 companies to deliver sustainable jobs into the future.  The county enterprise boards are supporting existing small business owners and those who want to start new businesses.The enterprise agencies are all taking a range of actions to support client companies in ways best suited to their needs, that is, marketing, training, access to finance and advice across a range of issues.  In addition to these initiatives, Enterprise Ireland operates the graduates 4 international growth programme.  The programme aims to place 50 top-level college graduates with ambitious internationally trading companies.  Participants will be based for a minimum of 12 months in an overseas market.  Enterprise Ireland also operates the international graduate programme through which it employs 15 graduates for two years in its overseas office network.  I am examining how we can increase the number of graduates working with the enterprise agencies and their client companies.The Department of Education and Skills offers the work placement programme which provides up to nine months work experience to 1,000 unemployed graduates.  At the end of September 2010, 944 graduates had commenced their placements under this programme.  The work placement programme will continue to provide a vital opportunity for unemployed graduates to gain valuable work experience that will keep them closer to the labour market and will assist them in securing employment in the future.Other initiatives which support job creation include the employer jobs — PRSI — incentive scheme and the three-year corporate and capital tax exemption for new start-up companies in 2010.  We are positioning Ireland to be successful in selling our goods and services abroad, winning global investment and attracting visitors from around the world.  This is the most effective way to create sustainable, quality jobs for all our citizens.  It has been estimated that there will be a need to recruit up to 96,000 people on average every year up to 2014.
#DeirdreClune	unknown-#DeirdreClune-party	unknown-#DeirdreClune-dob	unknown-#DeirdreClune-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	339	My question refers to graduates in particular.  The Minister mentioned three initiatives in his reply, two of them under the remit of Enterprise Ireland, namely, the graduate link which will place 50 graduates and the foreign placements programme under which 15 graduates are employed.  Representatives of the USI appeared before a meeting of the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment yesterday, which is chaired by Deputy Penrose.  We were told there are currently 100,000 unemployed graduates.  The piecemeal figures the Minister has provided today are only a drop in the ocean in terms of what is required.  Could he not use his imagination and initiative to extend the internship programme to ensure that organisations in the public, private and voluntary sectors take on these graduates?  A major investment that has been made in these people in terms of their education but the economy will be at the loss of many of them who will go aboard and many more of them depend on jobseeker's allowance.These graduates are of value.  Something can be done to assist them.  The work placement programme could be extended.  Can the Minister not have some ambition in this area?  The relationship with FÁS in terms of the placing these people was described as abysmal by the representatives of USI yesterday, and I would agree with them.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	340	We all are concerned about graduates coming out of college and not having employment and we are all anxious to help address this situation.  We are examining a series of initiatives in regard to this matter.  The internship programme would be a matter for the Department of Education and Skills but my Department and the Department of Social Protection would have an input into that.  I have spoken to people in all my units to ascertain how many graduates could be taken into the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  I have asked them to produce a list of the types of graduates who could be offered places.  However, one significant difficulty has emerged which has stopped me from proceeding with this initiative.  If one is talking about graduates being placed and retaining their unemployment assistance, there is no problem in that instance, but the problem is that for many graduates there will be a cost in getting to work and in being at work.I spoke to multinationals to ascertain whether they would provide training to graduates for one year.  The difficulty, however, is that under current social welfare legislation, any payments they make would affect the social welfare payments of the graduate trainees.  For instance, if a graduate in training received €2,000 per annum from a company, this payment would be treated either as benefit in kind or income under the social welfare code and such moneys would have to be taken into account.  The current position can only be changed through legislation.  I am negotiating with the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Ó Cuív, on this matter and it may be examined in future.

IBEC's GradLink programme accommodates only 38 graduates, which is a drop in the ocean when one considers there are 100,000 graduates.  These programmes need to be ramped up because progress is much too slow.  Graduates from 2010 have now joined 2009 graduates in the employment market.  What are the Department's targets in terms of the number of graduates who can be accommodated under the programmes?

There are placements available for graduates.  In the past week, I took the trouble of speaking to two recruitment agencies, one of which informed me that recruitment had increased by 26% in retail, wholesale and purchasing, by 21% in production, manufacturing and materials, by 12% in engineering and utilities and by 12% in the medical, professional and health care areas.

We should not forget that a significant number of jobs are being created.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	345	The Deputy will be aware that the staffing levels for each Department and its associated offices and agencies are determined by an employment control framework agreed with the Department of Finance in accordance with the Government decision on reductions to be achieved in civil and public service numbers over the period to end 2012.  In allocating staff resources under the employment control framework I gave a particular priority to ensuring that Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland had the necessary staff numbers to deliver on their crucial role of supporting enterprise and job creation.In the case of IDA Ireland, I am pleased that the staffing arrangements have been finalised and the agency has confirmed to me that the levels of staff agreed will enable it to achieve the targets set out over the next five years.  In the case of Enterprise Ireland, the agency has indicated its overall satisfaction with the numbers allocated to it under the employment control framework.  I am pleased to confirm that Enterprise Ireland has received sanction to fill 12 priority posts that have been identified as critical to the efficient delivery of services.Working with other Departments and agencies, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland aim to increase the number of new, export focused jobs by more than 150,000 with a similar number of indirect jobs also being created, increasing the value of exports by indigenous companies by 33% and securing an additional 780 inward investment projects through IDA Ireland.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	346	In the context of 450,000 unemployed people, the important role performed by Enterprise Ireland and IDA  Ireland and their job creation capacities, is it not important that both agencies have more than sufficient staff to enable them to meet their job targets?  Is it not unseemly and pathetic that Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland have been in negotiations with the Minister regarding recruitment since September 2009?The chairman of IDA Ireland felt compelled to write to the Minister in May 2010 indicating that despite the fanfare surrounding its launch, the Horizon 2020 strategy would fall flat on its face and job replacements would not be delivered to Sligo and Limerick, areas which have recently incurred major job losses with the closure of Dell and other companies.  The letter stated that a lack of staff would have an enormous impact on staff in overseas offices as they work to bring investors to Ireland.  Is this letter not an indictment of the Minister and his Department and the Department of Finance and its control network?  What message does it send out?  Surely this is the one area where an exception should be made to the moratorium on recruitment.  Every job created by IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland saves the Exchequer, which is controlled by the Department of Finance, €20,000 per annum.  What better way is there to spend money?
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	347	In May, when I received the letter in question, I spoke to the chairman of IDA Ireland and indicated that I would give priority to the economic agencies that would deliver jobs.  I made him aware that this would take place when we completed the overall employment framework and that is exactly what happened.  I called in the chief executives of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland and asked what were their requirements to meet the targets that had been set out.  These were new targets because IDA Ireland had previously indicated that it would increase the number of companies it brought to Ireland from 640 to 750.  I agreed with both agencies on what were the necessary employment levels and ensured both organisations secured the number of staff they required.  As I indicated, Enterprise Ireland is recruiting 12 crucial staff members to help it achieve its targets.  Both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland have indicated publicly that they are satisfied that the number of staff allocated to them will allow them to meet the targets they have set.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	348	That is well and good.  We had great fanfare recently when the Minister and Taoiseach launched a report indicating that 300,000 jobs — 150,000 direct and 150,000 indirect positions — would be created.  I understand the BRIC economies — Brazil, Russia, India and China — are expected to play an important role in this regard.  I do not know how many staff Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland have in the BRIC countries but it is not a large number.  I recently had a discussion with a senior industrialist who indicated that relevant Minister should allocate 100 staff to these countries.  The individual in question, whom the Minister knows well, does not wave a flag for the Labour Party.  In any event, that is the enormity of the challenge facing us because many of the new jobs we seek will have to come from the four BRIC countries.  I ask the Minister to prioritise allocations to these countries to reflect the thinking in the recent Government report on job creation.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	349	The Government has given a commitment on job creation.  I have received a 25% increase in the allocation for the capital programme for the enterprise agencies up to 2016.  I know the Deputy does not mean it when he argues we should throw 100 jobs at a particular region. IDA Ireland is targeting high potential growth markets such as China and Brazil.  I will visit Brazil and the Middle East on trade missions.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, visited Russia and all the Ministers of State in the Department will take part in trade missions to assist Enterprise Ireland.Another important advance has been the decision to make our embassies economic entities.  This will ensure they become a focal point for all the agencies and individuals working on behalf of Ireland incorporated in the relevant countries.  We already have two people in Brazil making sure contacts are made and interacting with Irish people and the embassy.  We also have an outstanding system in place in China and we are building our strengths in India and the Middle East.  If further resources are needed to increase exports and interaction between Irish companies and firms in the countries in question, they will be provided.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	350	Your Business Your Bank is a draft document prepared through the work of the credit supply clearing group.  The document is aimed at bank business customers and seeks to bring greater clarity to the current realities of funding business and how business customers can best position their businesses to secure the funding they need.  The text of the document is currently being finalised and it should be possible to have the document published in the coming weeks.Other initiatives have been already introduced to assist businesses in their relationships with banks.  With the establishment earlier this year of the Credit Review Office under John Trethowan, small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, being refused bank credit have access to a formal mechanism for reviewing their cases.  This is in addition to the banks' own internal appeals mechanisms which have been formalised and strengthened.The code of conduct for business lending to SMEs introduced last year by the Financial Regulator under the provisions of the Central Bank Act 1989 sets out the processes banks are required to adopt in facilitating access to credit for businesses.  The code also promotes fairness and transparency in the treatment of SMEs by the banks.As the Minister, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, noted, under the 2010 bank recapitalisation arrangement AIB and Bank of Ireland have both committed to making available not less than €3 billion each for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs in both 2010 and 2011.  This must include funds for working capital for businesses.  The Credit Review Office is closely monitoring the lending policies of AIB and Bank of Ireland lending policies and their lending commitments in 2010 and 2011, thus ensuring that viable SME business customers get access to credit.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	351	I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  The document, Your Business Your Bank, clearly is an indictment of the Government's attitude towards business when one considers there will have been up to 1,500 insolvencies by the end of this year and that every closure has a great impact on business.  The three critical supports for business are, first, the Government has bailed out the banks, second, one would assume that banks would invest in small companies and, third, small companies in turn would retain jobs.  Unfortunately, difficulties are being encountered by all families in every situation.  I also listened to the Minister, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, with regard to the commitment given by the banks.  However, I refer to the costs associated with drawing down a loan at present.  Although the banks may sanction loans, they are placing caveats, legal charges and stipulations on them with the result that even though such loans are being granted, many businesses are unable to draw down the money.  The Minister of State should outline to Members what he intends to do about the banks' failure to facilitate businesses on the ground, despite committing the aforementioned billions of euro.  People are not getting working capital and viable businesses are closing.

I believe it will assist businesses when they prepare applications for loans from banks.  As for the broader debate on credit availability to small and medium-sized businesses, the Government acknowledged and realised some time ago that there would be difficulties in the context of credit availability to small and medium-sized businesses.  That is the reason that on 29 September 2008, the Government took a very difficult and brave decision to ensure there at least would be a functioning banking system that could make available the infrastructure to permit lending to small and medium-sized businesses.

Since 2008 and in the context of the subsequent recapitalisation, the Government has put in place systems to first ensure there is access to credit and that if businesses are refused credit, an independent appeals mechanism exists under which they can appeal to the Credit Review Office.  This is something businesses should take up and this document also will encourage people to make applications in writing.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	364	I will allow a further supplementary question from Deputy Perry.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	365	This is not good enough because the document, Your Business Your Bank, should be the first publication with regard to the criteria for drawing down funds.  Credit is not available.  The Minister of State should speak to Mr. John Trethowan of the Credit Review Office, who would tell him about the difficulties with banks at present.  It is not a case of giving credit to non-viable businesses.  This is about the sustainability of viable businesses that are being closed at present.  Cash is not being made available to viable businesses on the ground, regardless of the commitment made by the State-guaranteed Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland.  I again refer to the three supports for business.  Does the Minister of State not agree that as the Government has bailed out the banks, one would assume the banks would invest in business and that therefore, the third tier should be the retention of jobs but that this is not happening?
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	366	Briefly, Mr. Trethowan stated clearly recently that credit availability to the small and medium-sized sector was freeing up.  In addition, a report produced by a business representative organisation, namely, ISME, states that matters are improving on the ground.  Two issues arise in this regard.  First, some businesses are not viable and will not be able to access credit.  Unfortunately, this difficulty arises because of the contraction in the economy in 2009 in particular and the challenges that remain.  However, viable businesses exist and when such businesses make an application but are refused, they will use the independent appeals mechanism.  However, to suggest that no freeing up of credit is taking place is simply wrong and there is an acknowledgement among the people——

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	370	Ireland is one of the most entrepreneurial countries in the world and never has this spirit been more important.  The growth and development of small Irish businesses, is central to economic recovery and it is essential that Irish enterprises continue to be supported.My priority is to ensure that the business environment is supportive of enterprise and encourages growth in all areas of the economy including entrepreneurs in both the start-up and development phases.  We are driving change across a range of policy areas, from the costs of doing business, regulation to research and development and innovation, skills and tax incentives.  These all combine to foster an environment that supports entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship.The complementary remit and activities of both Enterprise Ireland and the CEBs ensure that as broad a suite as possible of State supports are available to start-ups in Ireland.  The CEBs assist micro-enterprises and are to the forefront in supporting viable business start-ups which can generate job creation at a local level.   The level of activity across the entire CEB network has continued to increase during the downturn in the economy.    This activity includes direct grant aid to businesses and project promoters and provision of a range of other important business supports such as mentoring, business training and business advice all of which help to stimulate indigenous enterprise creation.Since 2004, the CEBs have supported more than 3,000 greenfield start up companies with an initial job count of more than 4,000.  In addition, Enterprise Ireland supported 73 new high potential start-up companies in 2009.  These companies are poised to create 900 jobs over the next three years and no doubt more in future years.  We are increasing funding so that, by 2016, we will support 100 high potential start-ups each year.In the past decade, the Government has made significant investment in developing the broader environment for start-ups.  This has included substantial investment in incubators, seed and venture funds, angel networks and mentors.  Enterprise Ireland also support community enterprise centres which provide a range of facilities for entrepreneurs.  The establishment of Innovation Fund Ireland is further evidence of the Government's continued commitment to supporting start up companies in Ireland.The Government has also extended the three-year corporate and capital tax exemption for new start-up companies in 2010.  Firms benefit from a tax exemption for the first three years of trading.    All of these measures combine to provide an environment that supports entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship.

Many enterprise boards are starved of cash at present.  Will further funding be forthcoming?  What is the Minister's view of the role of enterprise boards from 1 January next onwards?  Will they continue in operation or will they be amalgamated into Enterprise Ireland?  Is the proposed bank loan guarantee scheme still Government policy and when does the Minister expect it to be introduced?  A recent Forfás report stated that Irish companies were not in a position to compete internationally because guarantee schemes are in place in other jurisdictions both in Europe and worldwide.

One concerns the county and city enterprise boards and funding thereof.  When I came into this office I asked Enterprise Ireland to undertake a trawl of the enterprise boards to ascertain precisely which projects were on hand, which projects were approved, and what was the requirement in terms of money.  After an initial response from 28 of the 35 boards we have since had a full complement of replies and now know exactly what jobs are approved and how much money is required.In line with my commitment to enterprise, I will be making an announcement in the very near future indicating clearly that I will make funding available for those jobs to be created.  Before that, however, I will take the opportunity to inform each of the city and county enterprise boards individually.  It is important that we support these bodies which do a valuable job in communities, encourage community enterprise——

#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	387	Is it likely that the number of county and city enterprise boards will be reduced?  The Minister recently hinted at an amalgamation in a speech he delivered in Mallow.  Second, in regard to start-ups, one of the first impositions is a State-imposed charge in the form of rates.  Will the Minister give consideration to a small business rates relief scheme for start-ups based either on turnover, the size of the business unit or a combination of both?
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	388	I will answer the second question first.  I am anxious to reduce costs for businesses, and I acknowledge that local authority rates represent a significant cost.  There is a widely held view that while the income and asset values of many small businesses have reduced dramatically, charges have not reduced as significantly as they might have done.  I recently spoke to all the city and county managers about inputs and asked them to come back to me with three papers on three different issues.  One of those issues is that alongside their planning role, they also have an important developmental role and, as such, it is within their remit to ensure costs are reduced.  My understanding as of last Friday is that I will receive those three reports in the coming weeks.  I will examine them in great detail.  The review carried out in local authorities indicates clearly that there is scope for significant savings, and I am happy for that to be done.On the Deputy's first question, I am looking at the structure of the county and city enterprise boards.  I am anxious to ensure that we have a unified and synergised enterprise strategy and that all elements of it work in consort.  I want to examine outputs from each entity.  I am not convinced that we should have 35 private companies where the cost of auditing is €250,000 and the cost of advertising across the board is another €250,000.  I would prefer that money to be invested in job creation.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	389	Does the Minister accept the concept of a one-stop shop?  Entrepreneurs are generally highly competent to advance their business plans but they may have one weakness in regard to, for example, preparing business plans, dealing with payroll or handling regulatory compliance.  It would be extremely helpful to have a one-stop shop that would offer this type of advice.  Will the Minister consider the establishment of one-stop shops rather than having entrepreneurs going to country enterprise boards, Enterprise Ireland, the Leader programme and so on?
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	390	I am taking everything into consideration and, as I said, I will take this matter to Government in the next two weeks.  Ultimately, however, it is a matter for Government to decide.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	393	I have called Deputy O'Donnell.  I would appreciate if the Minister would occasionally pay some attention to the Chair.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	394	I will join the Minister later for a cup of coffee and we can discuss the matter.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	395	Perhaps the Minister would like to go and have a cup of coffee now, or else allow me to conduct the business of the House.

The Government has already cut funding to the boards by €7 million this year.  It is about getting funding to the SME sector.  Will the Minister indicate precisely what form the proposed revision will take?
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	397	I apologise to the Leas Cheann-Comhairle for interrupting.

I will definitely retain the local input because that is extremely important.  The boards would not be as effective without that local input.

#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	402	Under the terms of the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004, recruitment to the Civil Service, including my Department, is a matter for the public appointments service, PAS, which is required to ensure that standards of probity, merit, equity and fairness are followed in the recruitment, assessment and selection of persons for appointment.  It is for the PAS to determine the qualifications and experience required for appointment to general service positions up to and including principal officer level.I understand the "senior positions" referred to by the Deputy to comprise the grades of Secretary General, assistant secretary and principal officer.  All promotions to principal officer in my Department are made on merit, either by way of internal competition or by way of competitions held by the PAS, some of which are open to non-civil servants.  Since 2004, in accordance with instructions issued by the Department of Finance, all vacancies that would normally be filled by way of PAS competitions have been filled by the redeployment of staff who were surplus to requirements in Dublin due to decentralisation.Appointments to Secretary General and assistant secretary positions are made by the Government and the relevant Minister, respectively, following — in most cases since early 2007 — an open competition organised by the PAS.  The latter holds a preliminary competition and selects a shortlist of candidates for interview by the top-level appointments committee.  It is for the committee to determine the qualifications and experience required for appointment to these positions.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21031	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	403	I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  However, it did not answer my question which was whether his Department has appointed any persons with experience in the private sector to senior positions.  I take it from his contribution that the answer is "no" in that he explained the procedure and how open it is but did not indicate the outcome.  As I understand it, across all Departments, of 81 positions at the upper level, only one has been filled by a person from outside.  That person was previously employed in the public service but had temporarily departed.Does the Minister of State not agree that his Department, which deals exclusively with the development of enterprise, ought to include among its senior management team somebody with experience in that field?  Since the Department of Finance has recently engaged a person of relevant experience, namely, Mr. Jim O'Leary, will the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation consider employing a person with experience in the private sector in order to bolster its management team?  The Department is clearly not delivering on its own agenda.

We tap into private sector experience across all our State boards——
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21031	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	405	The Minister of State is getting good at avoiding questions.  He is learning from his master.

#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	407	My Department has used the experience of the private sector extensively in all our operations and consults extensively with private sector experts on a daily basis.  The position of employing private sector people for the sake of it represents something of a waste of time.  We use their knowledge and experience for specific responses to specific situations.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21031	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	408	That is not what we are saying.  May I ask the Minister of State a question?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	409	Yes, but you might wait to be called.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21031	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	410	Are we being told that there are absolutely no people with private sector experience who are fit persons to hold a senior position in the public service?  That is what the Minister of State is implying.  Surely his own Department, which deals day to day with enterprise, ought to be open to bringing some of those people and those skills in-house.  Can the Department not employ somebody as the Department of Finance has done or is the latter saying that different rules apply to other Departments?
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	411	All senior appointments, from assistant secretary up, are made by open recruitment.  Over the summer the Government reconstituted the top level appointments committee, TLAC, to include more private sector people than were previously on it and to open up the opportunities.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21031	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	412	Is that more than zero?

That goes back to the Deputy's Party's last time in Government so he should be aware of it from then.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	414	The Government is working to ensure that SMEs can access public sector contracts in Ireland and abroad.  As well as being an important source of income, winning public sector contracts here can have a very positive impact when companies are looking to win contracts abroad.  We are continuing to drive the development of innovative public procurement processes across the public sector that improve access for SMEs.The 10-Step Guide to Smart Procurement and SME Access to Public Contracts was published in July 2009 and provides practical guidance to public bodies on measures which could boost the involvement of SMEs in public procurement.  In 2009, Enterprise Ireland established a public procurement team to focus on procurement opportunities in Ireland and abroad for indigenous companies and to accelerate knowledge within contracting authorities in the public service of the potential of these Irish companies.  Some 660 Irish companies took part in Enterprise Ireland's International Markets week recently where EI's public procurement specialists were present to discuss public sector procurement opportunities.I am speeding through this because it is a very good answer.
#DeirdreClune	unknown-#DeirdreClune-party	unknown-#DeirdreClune-dob	unknown-#DeirdreClune-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	415	That is for Members to decide.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	416	The Minister for Finance has issued guidelines to public contracting authorities aimed at operating their tendering processes in a manner that facilitates increased participation by SMEs, while ensuring that all purchasing is carried out in a manner that is legal, transparent and secures optimal value for money for the taxpayer.  The guidelines also highlight practices that are to be avoided where they can unjustifiably hinder small businesses in competing for public contracts.There has not been a review of the success of Irish small and medium enterprises in obtaining public procurement contracts here.  However, in the context of the foregoing initiatives which have already been taken in relation to improving tendering opportunities for SMEs, officials in the Department are engaging with the national public procurement policy unit to explore how statistical data can be captured going forward to measure the success rate of Irish SMEs in tendering for public procurement contracts.In terms of foreign public sector contracts, in 2009 some 80 overseas public procurement contracts worth over €210 million were signed with Enterprise Ireland input.  Already this year, 63 contracts have been won and Irish firms have secured €200 million worth of contracts with the Olympic Development Authority in the UK.   The Minister, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, was in London again last week encouraging Irish companies to look at the Olympic Games as an opportunity to win overseas contracts.
#DeirdreClune	unknown-#DeirdreClune-party	unknown-#DeirdreClune-dob	unknown-#DeirdreClune-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	417	The Minister of State used the word "guidelines" a number of times and said there has not been a review.  I think the review will point to the fact that Irish SMEs are not accessing public procurement contracts or orders.  For example, 17% of Irish public contracts go overseas while the average for other European countries is 1.5%.  Why is that?
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	418	It is important to compare like with like.  It is important to compare data from economies of similar size.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21031	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	421	To what country would the Minister of State compare Ireland?

#DeirdreClune	unknown-#DeirdreClune-party	unknown-#DeirdreClune-dob	unknown-#DeirdreClune-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	423	Let us pick a country.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	424	Some 95% of all public procurement contracts are filled by Irish companies.  We are an open, global trading economy.  We win far more contracts overseas than we would if we took the course many people are suggesting and narrowed our focus to make it difficult for others to tender for Irish contracts.  We are winning a sizeable share of public procurement contracts, particularly in the United Kingdom, from local authorities and health services.
#DeirdreClune	unknown-#DeirdreClune-party	unknown-#DeirdreClune-dob	unknown-#DeirdreClune-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	425	The question is about SMEs.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	426	These are SMEs.  They are small software companies that are winning substantial contracts right across the public sector in the United Kingdom.  It is important that we do not say Irish SMEs are unable to tender for public procurement contracts either in Ireland or abroad.  They are doing it very effectively and 95% is the figure.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	427	I have some brief questions.  First, is it not our problem that we overly adhere to a love of everything European?  We are too good Europeans.  We try to behave while other countries do not.  Second, why do we not unbundle more contracts and make them smaller so that more of our firms can compete for them?  Third, why do we put contracts together on a three or four year basis rather than a one or two year basis which would facilitate more of our small firms in terms of competing?
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	428	We have started unbundling some of the larger contracts to make it more amenable to small and medium firms to tender for contracts.  We are looking at this in the most imaginative and strategic way possible.  We must understand that many Irish companies, including small and medium-sized companies, are winning contracts abroad.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	429	I thank the Minister, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, for his earlier reply and apologise if I almost got him thrown out of the Dáil.Is the Minister of State proposing to further segment public procurement contracts?  I know some work has been done on this and I welcome it as I have acknowledged publicly.  Will the Government tackle the issue of capital construction projects such as school buildings and hospital extensions?  That is a huge problem.  There are many construction workers and contractors available for work.  What is the Minister of State's thinking on that?
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	430	The Deputy is clearly keeping a very close eye on what the Government is doing.  At present, the Government is reviewing the whole area of construction.  We are looking at it on a sectoral basis to see where we can make contracts more amenable to the small and medium-sized sector.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	431	When will that be done?
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	432	It is being carried out at present.  We are very conscious of the need to make it easier for small and medium-sized firms to tender.There are some areas of Irish public procurement for which no Irish company can tender because they may not have expertise in the area, may not have the capacity or may not be producing the required product.  This is the case in the medical, military and other specific areas.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	433	In light of the contracts being awarded, the credit terms being attached and non-payment within 60 and 90 days, will the Minister of State review the credit terms attached by State entities?  Many viable businesses are being closed due to the non-payment of debt by public institutions.  Extended credit is given by companies.  Something needs to be done about these credit terms.The Department opted out of the review of the extended credit given to State entities and private companies.  Will this now be reviewed?
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	434	This issue was publicised recently.  Most State agencies and the State itself pay within 15 days of receipt of invoice.  Approximately 97% of payments are made in that time.Contracts between private companies and individuals is another issue.  The State does not get involved in that.  Terms of credit is an issue between a vendor and a purchaser.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	435	The Department opted out of that.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	436	We are conscious that terms of credit are being extended way out and this is putting huge pressure on small and medium-sized businesses, particularly those that are supplying larger companies with products, goods and services.  However, that is a civil matter for the people concerned.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	437	No, it is not.  The Minister opted out of the review of that matter.  There should be legislation for that.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	438	The State cannot be involved in every aspect of life.  When two people are drafting a contract, it is important that there are clear terms and conditions about when payment scheduling is arranged.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	439	The Department opted out of it.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	440	I am only trying to give advice to the Deputy and to the broader business community.  Individual contracts can be drafted and are drafted continually.  Until recently the terms of reference were always very vague but credit terms have extended quite substantially.  We are conscious of the pressures this is putting on people.

However, my Department is focusing its efforts on reducing all costs to business, including waste costs, to enhance the competitiveness of companies in Ireland.The National Competitiveness Council, NCC, published two reports in July which act as useful benchmarks for analysing business costs in Ireland, the Cost of Doing Business in Ireland and the Annual Competitiveness Report 2010: Volume 1, Benchmarking Ireland's Performance.  Both of these reports found that, overall, Ireland has regained some of its competitiveness since 2008 as a result of a fall in price and cost levels relative to our main trading partners.The benchmarking report found that in 2008 Ireland was the most expensive of the locations benchmarked for waste costs, although costs in Ireland vary significantly by local authority.  However, the NCC also reported that market prices have fallen significantly recently due to the recession.  This finding is underpinned by Forfás's latest benchmarking report on waste management which was published on 6 October.Waste policy overall is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, who recently invited submissions on a draft statement of waste policy.  The enterprise development agencies under the aegis of my Department, namely, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Forfás, made a joint submission with a view to ensuring that optimal solutions for waste management are available for companies operating in Ireland on a competitive cost basis when compared with our trading and investment competitor countries.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21031	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	442	Can the Minister of State confirm that his agencies take the view that the Minister's policy in this area is damaging to our cost base and prevents the development of opportunities?  Does he accept that the NCC report indicates that we are not only the most expensive of the benchmarked countries but are also twice as expensive as Scotland, a country with comparable population?  Is he aware that the NCC and Forfás have been withering about the hamfisted way in which this sector is being regulated, with local authorities acting as both regulator and provider?  Can he indicate when a coherent policy based on enterprise needs will emerge and whether responsibility will, if necessary, be wrestled away from the Minister, Deputy Gormley, in order to develop this much needed coherence?

The agencies clearly recognise the importance of reducing costs.  The market price has fallen and there is evidence from landfill sites and other waste facilities that lower prices are being accepted.  The Department and its agencies continue to apply pressure to further reduce costs and we await with interest the statement of the Minister, Deputy Gormley, on the matter.

In this important area, both Forfás and the NCC have confirmed that the Government is pursuing a policy that is absolutely perverse.  Who in Government is taking responsibility for delivering change in light of the cost in jobs and opportunities?  Clarity is needed on this.  The fact that the Minister is defending constituency interests or pursuing a particular approach should not blind the Government to the need for a cross-departmental approach to creating and protecting jobs.  The Minister of State needs to get his finger out instead of supplying the standard answers.

#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	458	I propose to take Questions Nos. 77 and 85 together.I am aware of the recent report by the Migrant Rights Centre of Ireland, Work Permits and Exploitation: Time For Reform, in the context of proposing changes to the system of issuing work permits.  The employment permits system and the treatment of migrant workers has significantly changed in recent years.  These changes have sought to strike the correct balance between the rights of the individual employee, the employer and the constantly changing needs of the labour market.Under the Employment Permits Act 2006, individual employees were given the right to apply for their own permit and to change employer after a period of a year.  In August 2009 a new initiative was introduced dispensing with the requirement of a work permit for those who have been working lawfully and who have held an employment permit for five consecutive years.  This allows an employee full access to the labour market for any type of job and any employer.An undocumented scheme has also been introduced allowing those who have become undocumented through no fault of their own and who previously held a work permit to regularise their situations.  In addition, a scheme to assist persons made redundant has also been introduced and the period to allow a person get a job has been extended to six months.Ireland's body of employment rights legislation and in particular the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001 protects all workers employed on an employer-employee basis in Ireland.  The National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, is responsible for monitoring and enforcing compliance with certain employment conditions for all categories of workers in Ireland, including migrant workers.  Where evidence of non-compliance with the relevant employment rights legislation is found, NERA works with the employer in the first instance to achieve compliance.  Where breaches are not rectified or where there are substantial breaches of employment rights legislation, NERA may initiate a prosecution.  In 2009, €2.5 million in unpaid wages was recovered for over 6,000 workers, including migrants who were identified as having been paid less than their statutory minimum entitlements.A code of practice for protecting persons employed in other people's homes has been prepared under the Industrial Relations Act 1990.  The code sets out certain employment rights and protections, encourages good practice and compliance with the law and increases awareness of the application of relevant legislation for persons employed in other people's homes.There are also other avenues of redress where breaches of employment rights occur, such as referrals to the Rights Commissioners and the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  The range of new measures now in place has substantially improved the situation for all workers, including those on employment permits.  It is important to retain the current controls within the employment permits system as they operate to protect employees by allowing the system to trace employers who employ permit holders.  The current arrangements for moving jobs are sufficiently flexible in the current circumstances.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	459	I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive reply, even though I totally disagree with the last part of it.  The following is a statement from one migrant domestic worker:The permit is like a chain around your neck. I couldn't leave my job. I was told by my employer that if I leave I will be illegal here and not be able to find another job.  He said that I would be sent back home in shackles.On hearing this at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, one was ashamed to be Irish.  I believe the Minister of State is aware of the audio recording.  In fairness to him, he has some sympathy with the case.We all know the Minister must run the system correctly and that it cannot be blackguarded in any way.  I know the point Minister of State is making.  However, does he not agree that one should be allowed to change employer by notifying the Minister that is one is changing from employer Deputy Morgan, politician, to employer Deputy Penrose, politician, for example?  It is a case of moving from like to like — it is not a case of going all over the place within the 12-month period.Can what I propose not be achieved through a simple administrative change?  There is no need to introduce any legislation.  A simple administrative change would suffice.  It would give people the right to freely change employer to ensure they are not exploited, and that what was outlined on the audio tape, which shamed us as Irish people, will never again be visited upon people.  I am frightened to think that any of my six uncles and two aunts who emigrated in the 1940s and 1950s, or any others who emigrated, would have been subjected to what I heard about.  I was ashamed to be Irish on hearing it.

Is he considering doing anything in particular to try to rule out the exploitation that is taking place, particularly of domestic workers who were isolated?  Their circumstances are shocking.  I agree with Deputy Penrose that the audio recording was shocking.  Clearly, the circumstances described are fairly widespread in the domestic sector.

#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	473	I had forgotten that there was a lunch break on Wednesday and I was in full flight before the sos.  I am sorry that the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, is not present.  However, Deputy Haughey, an equally important Minister of State, is present so I can address my remarks to him.In my speech, I paid tribute to the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, and repeated my contention, without wishing to be deemed sexist, that women make the best Ministers for Education.  I am summarising what I said, as any good teacher would on coming back to class.  There have been excellent women Ministers for Education from all the mainstream parties.  I will not go into this again.We spoke about the amalgamation of the VECs, which is a very good idea.  I am very disappointed a cutback of only €3 million is all that will be realised.  I wish the Minister luck with this.  Everybody seems delighted — until his or her own VEC is swallowed up.  At that point, they will have great stories to tell.Section 12, which provides for the amendment of section 30 of the Teaching Council Act 2001 to allow for the employment in certain exceptional and limited circumstances of persons who are not registered teachers under the Act, is the reason I am speaking on the Bill.  I spoke on this at our parliamentary party meeting last night.  It is the daftest and least thought out measure I have ever seen in a Bill.  We spend great amounts of money training teachers, including primary and secondary teachers.  Although people pay for their education in many cases, the State contributes a huge amount.  If ever there were unemployed teachers, there are now.  I am sure that over the summer months many Deputies met very highly qualified young primary and secondary teachers, men and women, who teach a great range of subjects.  Why is the Government making it legal to take on people who are not registered as teachers under the legislation?  I do not understand this and cannot fathom why any Department in charge of teachers and which believes in teaching as a profession, as many in this House do, would want to have and legalise the position of teachers who are not registered.I was a secondary school teacher and my next point does not concern my own career.  Years ago there were teachers called JAMs, which stood for junior assistant——

#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	475	I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  The JAMs entered the system in the time of the late John Wilson, who was then a Deputy.  During that time, there was a great shortage of teachers.  Over the years, training courses were put in place for those teachers so they could become qualified, as was correct.  In this day and age, the teacher training colleges are bursting with people.  Hibernia College is bursting with people.  HDip courses are bursting with those who are studying to become second level teachers.I take very grave objection to section 12 on behalf of any properly registered and professionally trained teacher, be he a primary teacher or HDip teacher at second level.  It is not correct that we would give permission to a Department to do so.  Section 30 of the Teaching Council Act 2001 provides that a person who is employed as a teacher but is not a registered teacher shall not be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  What has happened since 2001?  I presume all the teachers employed since 2001 did not work for nothing.  Who has been paying them and from what fund have they been paid?  This question needs to be addressed.  It is nine years since that legislation was passed, at which time it was illegal to do this.  I appeal to the Minister to allow that part of the Bill to stand.I believe the Department, Minister and Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, have made a serious mistake in putting this forward.  On behalf of those who have toiled to qualify as a teacher, I believe it is wrong.  It is facetious and insulting to any fully trained-up member of the teaching profession.  I am appalled that any Government Minister or Department would seek to enshrine this in legislation.  The Minister told us last night at the parliamentary party meeting that this will apply in only exceptional circumstances.  However, exceptions become the norm.  I want to know what person or deed propelled this measure into this Bill.  All that was required was the removal of the provision in regard to teachers not being paid out of the public purse.   It was not necessary to insert another section which is heaping wrong upon wrong.We live in a very technocratic age, an age when everybody — at least everybody I know — has a mobile telephone.  Also there is ready access to computers even if one does not own one.  Why then do we not have in place a database of available teachers for specific hours and with particular subject qualifications who can be contacted by text message or e-mail by the principal of a school seeking a teacher?  There are plenty of qualified teachers.  It is ridiculous to suggest we could not put in place a database in which the proficiencies and excellence of teachers who remain idle can be noted.  There are many idle primary and second level teachers, in particular in the subject speciality area.  It is heartbreaking for them that we are legislating to allow a person who is not qualified to be employed while they remain unemployed.I do not accept the argument of a teacher being caught up in an accident and not being available to teach.  It should be possible for principals to access by telephone, e-mail or text message a teacher within a 20 mile radius of the school concerned.  Even if a substitute is required for only a few hours it is far better that a child is in a class which is being taught by a qualified teacher rather than that he or she is in a classroom being taught by a person who may be well meaning — nobody is taking that from them — but is not trained.  People treat the profession of teaching very lightly.  It is an intricate, hands-on, one-to-one job which calls upon the skills and resources of the person in charge of the students.I ask the Minister of State and his officials to bring back to Marlborough Street my distaste of this part of the Bill and my abhorrence at what is being done, which is wrong and incorrect.  It shows an ignorance of the professionalism of teachers.  I believe this matter should be rectified on Committee Stage.I would like a response in regard to what has happened since 2001.  I doubt if all of those who were not qualified were not paid.  I have grave reservations about this provision.  Another concern which I expressed this morning while complimenting the Minister is the lack of reference to Educate Together schools.  This Bill is all about the new vocational community primary school set up.  I would have very grave suspicions of the Church so readily and quickly embracing this with open arms while Educate Together is in situ.  There was not a word of praise or acclaim in the Minister’s speech of what the 57 primary schools operating well around the country have done.  As what would happen in the Soviet Bloc, they were air-brushed out of existence.

Tacaím leis an méid atá ráite ag an Teachta O'Rourke faoi mhúinteoirí ar fud na tíre atá dífhostaithe ag an am seo.I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Education (Amendment) Bill 2010.  While I welcome the main provision of the Bill I see no reason for inclusion of other aspects of it.  It is possible it is hoped they would go unnoticed or be considered unimportant.  I do not understand the reason for the provision in regard to untrained and unregistered teachers.  I will come back to this point later.The main provision of the Bill in terms of its dealing with new patronage of the VECs is to be welcomed.  There are many multi-denominational schools in this country which are functioning well with no difficulties in regard to the teaching of religion.  There may be minority groups that believe they will be omitted or suppressed for their religious beliefs.  I can understand from where they are coming in this regard.  This issue first developed in our schools in 1831 at which time the then commission allocated the functions and duties of schools.  Some 90% of schools in this country are Roman Catholic and 5.7% of schools are under the patronage of the Church of Ireland.  I recognise the statement a few years ago by Archbishop Diarmuid Martin.  He was the first senior person from the Roman Catholic hierarchy to acknowledge that there would be a compelling reason for the Catholic Church to divest the patronage of some schools throughout the country.  He opened up that debate.It is a pity the olive branch offered on that occasion was not taken up.  There was and remains a need for broad consultation between all the partners and interest groups in education.  This can still happen.  During a debate earlier this year in this House there was a declared resistance by the Minister to the establishment of a forum at which all those involved could discuss the best way forward in education.  I hope that the Minister and Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, in consultation with the officials of their Department, open up the window of opportunity that now presents.Last week, an important statement on education was issued by Mr. Martin Murphy, managing director of Hewlett Packard, on behalf of many of the US multinational companies which operate here.  Like me, Mr. Murphy understands that it is vital that those who come through the education system — from primary to second or third level — should emerge as fully-rounded individuals.  Mr. Murphy said:I have long argued about the urgent need for reform in Irish education — as a route to fulfilling Ireland's potential . . . However, education, if it is prioritised, can provide us with the single most important route to job creation — white collar, blue collar, any collar — full stop.This statement is extremely important and should not be allowed to go unnoticed.  The best way to obtain proper reform in education, and not merely that of the piecemeal variety that has been on offer to date, would be through the establishment of an forum at which the various partners in education could discuss the type of reforms that are necessary.I have the utmost confidence in the vocational education committees as they are currently constituted.  I am sure I will have the same confidence in them when they are reconstituted in the way in which the Tánaiste envisages.  However, I am of the view that the system of using single entities to cover large geographical areas will be somewhat cumbersome.  It is unfortunate that quite an amount of the detail relating to this matter is absent from the Bill.  I hope that the Tánaiste will outline the detail to which I refer.  All we are in a position to do today is suggest areas and matters which require to be addressed.I wholeheartedly support the comments of Deputy O'Rourke and others in respect of unemployed teachers.  No Minister can justify the argument to the effect that there are certain peculiar and individual circumstances which apply in some parts of the country and which make it necessary for school principals and boards of management to call on the services of untrained individuals.  There is no logic behind the provision being proposed in this regard.  The INTO made a very reasonable statement to the effect that it will not, beyond 2013, co-operate with schools in which untrained teachers have been employed.  Up to five years ago there may have been a justification for employment such teachers, particularly because there was a shortage of trained professionals and because the output of the teacher-training colleges was not sufficient to meet the demand that existed.  This matter was dealt with in a particular way at that time and the individuals to whom I refer received a particular form of ongoing training in order to allow them to take a final examination and thereby qualify.  Initially, these people were employed on a part-time basis.  There is no doubt that they made fantastic teachers once they were fully trained and there can be no questions posed with regard to their subsequent work as full-time professionals.It is terrible that the Teaching Council's registration process is being undermined by the relevant provision in the Bill.  I ask that the Tánaiste explain how she can make provision for the employment of untrained teachers when the process of registration is ongoing.  It is not possible to reconcile the two approaches and I want the Tánaiste to outline her thinking in this regard.Many ethnic and religious groups have been incorporated into our primary school communities in recent years.  County Dublin Vocational Educational Committee ran a pilot scheme in this regard and similar projects were also run in many of the centres of urban growth in Dublin, in which many of the new entrants to the country live.  There is a need to make provision for diversity in education.  However, we must not place the focus in this area solely on religion.  If we did so, it would be easy to become sidetracked and miss some of the other important aspects of this matter.  For example, there are many children who do not have a basic knowledge of the English language.  Such children also struggle with other subjects at primary level.We must not focus too much on the religious aspect.  The VECs, as the new patrons in the area of primary education, are well placed to provide assistance in respect of difficulties to which I refer.  The Educate Together movement has already made great strides in this regard.  Educate Together schools are fantastic, as are the gaelscoileanna.  There is a gaelscoil in practically every urban centre and elsewhere throughout the country.  These schools were established by those who have an interest in the Irish language and its promotion.  The gaelscoileanna have done more to promote Irish than did all of the previous initiatives taken in respect of the language.  At present, the vocational education system deals almost exclusively with second level and continuing education.  However, it has the capacity to become involved in the area of primary level education.I ask that the Tánaiste and her officials should examine the concerns expressed by the Atheist Ireland group.  Every Member received an e-mail from the latter in respect of its concerns regarding issues of human rights and also the management of schools.  The Tánaiste must acknowledge that there may be a difficulty in this regard and respond to the concerns expressed by the group to which I refer in a positive way.  I will say no more on the matter other than to remark that the Tánaiste must, when replying to this debate or on Committee Stage, deal with the concerns of this group and those of others.The Tánaiste's decision to transfer responsibility for speech and language services to the HSE is regrettable.As public representatives, parents and school managers, we all know of the failure of the HSE to provide speech therapy services for children in need.  Early intervention appears to be an absolute necessity for correcting, if possible, or improving the difficulties children endure in that instance.  I hope the Minister will consider the matter again.There is no doubt that speech therapy numbers have increased in the country, whether the specialists are employed in the Department of Education and Skills or the HSE, but the waiting list is unacceptable.  I hope the Minister will see fit to reverse her decision as neither I nor many others have confidence in the HSE.  It is so removed from reality in many different ways but giving it this responsibility is an admission of failure on the part of education and I am certain the executive will make a mess of it.  It is too serious an area for the many young people who want rapid access to services at a time of greatest need.I know services were provided at primary level but there was a failure when children moved to second level or into special schools.  This came about primarily because of bad planning and poor connections between primary and secondary schools.  The transition from primary to secondary level must be considered in that context.I will finish on the disbanding of the committee for disadvantaged people.  It had the opportunity to bring many people from disadvantaged backgrounds into third level education.  I do not know if there is any real commitment within the Department of Education and Skills to the disadvantaged student issue.  Two years ago the first real Scud missile was thrown into the area when the home school liaison officers were taken away from many of the DEIS schools in particular.  There was reference in the Minister's speech earlier with regard to DEIS schools but does she not realise what has happened in so many areas where the disadvantaged were denied an opportunity with liaison officers and the fantastic work that can be done?  The proof of this is that many schools classified within that category lost the label because of their competence and success; they were denied the ability to continue in the area.At third level we can see that there has been practically no change in 20 years.  We were told so many people from disadvantaged areas would be taken into third level but were it not for the Access programmes, many people who have gone through the system would not have qualifications.  We are not serious about bringing in people from disadvantaged areas.Disadvantage may take in the social and economic areas.  I hope the Minister will address this issue, although it may not be a provision of this Bill.  I cannot let the opportunity go when we are discussing disadvantaged students.  Currently, many people are looking for access to education through the back to education scheme but the barriers have continued to rise.  I know a person who has been told she is two days short of the requirements and is being denied access to the programme.  The person was on jobseeker's allowance and must continue on it for another year while losing out on an offer to go into nursing.  As she was two days short of requirements, she must wait another year and go through the process again.  Why could the Department of Social Protection not see this as a realistic case where the person could be given an allowance to continue her education?While this is happening, nobody will accept that we are serious about bringing people back to education.  Various statements have been made in the media by Government spokespersons and time and again the importance of going back to education has been mentioned as a means of improving people's skills in order to get better jobs.  The Government is denying such people so there is no consistency in the issue.

#MargaretConlon	unknown-#MargaretConlon-party	unknown-#MargaretConlon-dob	unknown-#MargaretConlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	478	I am delighted to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate on the Education (Amendment) Bill 2010, which comes on foot of announcements made relating to the amalgamation of VECs.  It is something to be welcomed and it has been spoken about for many years.  It is a unique issue in that there was broad agreement on all sides of the House and with the unions that something needed to happen in this regard and there was support for it.I spoke to a parent this morning whose child attends a VEC school in my constituency.  I mentioned that the proposed amalgamation had taken place and she said that it did not matter to her as her son was still going to a VEC school where the standard of education he got yesterday is no different from the standard today.  There is an excellent standard of education in the school so parents are primarily concerned about that.Part 2 of the Bill provides for the involvement of the VEC in the provision of primary education, which is to be welcomed.  For over 80 years in this country the VECs have been shown to have a proven track record with experience in the management of second level schools.  There are committees in the purest sense, with elected public representatives and representatives of all relevant stakeholders.  From my experience I know the VECs operate an open, transparent and accountable model of corporate governance and are well placed to provide primary education either on their own initiative or on the direction of the Minister.In my own county the VEC is under the stewardship of a visionary and dynamic CEO, Mr. Martin O'Brien, and it is leading the way in that we will have a multi-user complex on the site of the former Army barracks.  It will be one of the first multi-user complexes in the country, with a primary gaelscoil, a second level gaelscoil and the Monaghan Institute of Further Education and Training.  It is a unique project.  When the Taoiseach made the announcement about the project last year he told the CEO that he had the responsibility to deliver it on time and under budget; the CEO has given a commitment that it is on time and on course.

#MargaretConlon	unknown-#MargaretConlon-party	unknown-#MargaretConlon-dob	unknown-#MargaretConlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	480	Subject to the Minister's consent, the VEC may also become a patron or joint patron of an existing school.  I have previously spoken about patronage in the House and it is important.  I do not want to diminish this importance but parents, by and large, are not obsessed with patronage.  They want a school where the children are safe and the standard of teaching and learning is high.  It is important that the focus on the quality of teaching and learning is not lost.  We all want our children to have a positive learning experience, one in which each of them reaches their potential and becomes the best they possibly can be.  Parents want choice and our education system must offer it.  We must ensure the system is responsive and dynamic if we are to meet the challenges of rapid regional and global change.This new single patron and board of management model will have the capacity to cater for denominational, multidenominational and non-denominational education options.  It will be inclusive while respecting the diversity of cultures in our society.  Children in preschool or junior infants do not notice any differences between themselves.  They see themselves as equals.  These schools will provide religious education to the wishes of the parents.  It is important the schools will respect and welcome all faiths and none.  They will seek to provide religious education during allotted times for the main represented faiths in a school.Section 5, boards of management, states they will not become sub-committees of the VEC but have the same status as boards of management in other recognised primary schools.  I pay tribute and commend those who serve on school boards of management for their interest in our children's education.  Having served on one in the past, I am familiar with the demands made on board members and how seriously they take their duties.  They are volunteers and do not get enough recognition for the excellent work they do.There has been much comment on the Bill's provisions on the employment of substitute teachers, particularly non-teachers as substitutes in certain circumstances.  I appreciate the headache substitution can pose for principals and deputy principals.  Urgent staffing needs occur and a substitute, who is not a registered teacher, may have to be employed.  This should be the exception, not the norm, however.  There are many unemployed graduates in the teaching profession.  Where possible, they should be afforded an opportunity to gain valuable teaching experience which may help them secure full-time employment in the future.  Every teacher had to start somewhere; experience is the first item on a teaching candidate's curriculum vitae that is checked before a job interview.Non-registered teachers should be used only in exceptional circumstances.  Otherwise, it can be disruptive to the teaching and learning process.  I recall when I was a deputy principal using a database of substitute teachers but not being able to get a subject match.  From my experience at second level, if, for example, a physics teacher is absent, a parent expects a physics substitute teacher to be in place.  This is not always the case, however, as health and safety regulations require classes to be covered.We must be careful with this development involving non-teachers.  I accept such circumstances are extremely rare.  Every effort must still be made to ensure a class is covered by a properly and appropriately registered teacher.  A time limit for the employment of a non-teacher as a substitute in certain circumstances is also important as it is not a practice I would like to see continue indefinitely.  I know from my teaching experience that parents and pupils would not be happy to have a teacher who may not be suitably qualified.I know the Minister will take on board the concerns expressed by all Members on all sides of the House and give them due deliberation.  I welcome the introduction of this legislation and look forward to its passage in the House.
#MichaelMoynihan	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-party	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-dob	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	481	I welcome the initiatives presented in the Education (Amendment) Bill 2010.  While the existing patronage system served the education system and the country well for many generations, the debate on adapting it to the changing face of society has been going on for some time.One must acknowledge the contributions made by patrons, chairpersons and members of boards of management to the education system.  Many chairpersons of boards of management did not receive financial recognition for the contribution they made in education provision.  As public representatives, Members know well of local issues that emerged with boards of management, such as conflicts over discipline, which caused heartache for board members.  The State must acknowledge the voluntary commitment of those who served on boards of management to ensure the betterment of education in their communities.As society has changed, however, issues surrounding the patronage system have emerged.  Some argue it is time to fundamentally change the entire education system, taking primary school patronage out of the control of the various religious organisations and communities which have traditionally been in charge.  I contend that system worked well for us in the past.Statistics show that in the past 12 years, Educate Together has opened more primary schools than any other provider.  This is largely due to the changing face of society, particularly in urban areas.  Educate Together has done exceptionally well in bringing together all that is good from our educational tradition and new education methods.The Bill sets out a framework that will allow VECs to provide for primary education, a new departure.  Many VECs have already assisted primary school providers.  The Cork County VEC has been charged with advising and helping the Department of Education and Skills and the boards of management of the two primary schools in Kanturk in regard to finding a new site, which I hope will be brought to a conclusion in the not too distant future.VECs have huge strengths but, like every aspect of society, there are those who are critical of them.  Since the VECs started out they have done very well.  Following on from the late 1960s and the introduction of free education in community schools and colleges and comprehensive schools, they have done exceptionally well in what they have been charged to provide by the Department of Education and Skills, the State and the Minister of the day.While the issues in the Bill have been debated at length, when I and Deputy Enright were members of the Joint Committee on Education and Science we heard numerous deputations before the committee reflecting different views, standpoints and ways forward.  The Department and Minister have examined this issue very personally in introducing this Bill.  People in advice centres or those looking for meetings will sing the praises of the current system while others will criticise it.The Bill provides an initiative to ensure that we can provide primary education outside the control of the religious communities.  Everyone has bought into this, including the Catholic hierarchy.  The control the hierarchy sought in the provision of education was a difficulty that could not be overcome in the not too distant past.  It challenged the State at all times.  Many priests who are chairs of boards of management would be only too delighted to leave them because of the responsibility and difficult choices which have to be made.  In many dioceses laypersons rather than bishops are chairpersons of boards of management.The Bill amends some of the aspects of the Education Act 1998.  It reflects the position of the Constitution which is that education is to be provided in schools which are recognised or established by the State.  It is a constitutional requirement of the Government.Government policy over the years has changed to providing different types of education.  The term "pluralist" is probably too simple a way of explaining it.  The reality is that society has changed enormously.  The last major change, in terms of the provision of education in VECs, took place in the 1950s.  By and large the community schools and comprehensive schools amalgamated — they were known as the "tech" — and formed one new school.We are now moving into a new system of education which has not been a challenge for the State for up to 50 years.  We are moving into a new society and a different regime.  The Bill provides for patronage by the VECs and provides that each of the schools, even though they will have the patronage of the VEC in the city, county or the new regimes which were announced yesterday, will have their own independent boards of management.  That is a reflection of what has been in place heretofore when a bishop appointed the patron and the boards of management were independent units.The issue has been debated in the courts when disputes arose.  Boards of management have the ultimate responsibility for schools but perhaps it should be the State.  It will put huge pressure and responsibility on boards of management if the State and Government decide to submerge the responsibility into the Department of Education and Skills.  There will be issues with that as well because such a decision would take away local involvement and power from the community in schools.Since 1997, some 117 new schools have opened, 29 of which are Catholic and the majority of which are under the alternative system of patronage, Educate Together.  It is important to draw a distinction between the arguments that should apply where prospective patrons wish to establish a new school and those that need to be put in place to manage the change in patronage or the reconfiguration of existing schools.  Archbishop Diarmuid Martin indicated clearly that if there was no demand for a Catholic ethos or patronage in a school, the church was willing to consider releasing schools from its patronage, but that would only be done on the basis of discussions with parents, teachers and the general community.  It is vitally important that any decisions which are taken involve the community which should have a say on what system of education is available.I commend the Bill to the House.  Many issues need to be thrashed out and Members have numerous suggestions.  The Bill has to be welcomed.  It is a new initiative for the education system for the future.  Let us hope it will serve our country as well as the education system has done in the past.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on the Bill.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	482	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill.  It could be regarded as a contingency measure, as it is mainly forced into being as a response to a crisis in education that rocked the sector and has shaken the country as a whole to the core.  Whether its provisions have long-term viability remains to be seen.  It could be seen as merely adding another layer to an already over-large and formless education cake.I would not like to see this debate turn into a religious witch-hunt, but rather to focus on it as an opportunity to highlight the community aspect of such legislation.  While I am aware that it is essential to crawl before one walks, I see here an opportunity for community cohesion.  This could be extended to the realisation of the eventual aim of preschool to leaving certificate students sharing a campus in each town in Ireland.  For this to happen the VEC sector needs to be strong enough to bring in primary education.  Such a campus would provide an environment where the school community could pursue academic and sporting activities in purpose-built accommodation, sharing valuable resources under the umbrella of the VEC.In my county of Longford, Gaelscoil Longfoirt has proposed that the recently closed Sean Connolly Barracks would be well suited as school accommodation for the gaelscoil, which is currently overcrowded and has a long waiting list.  The proposal further suggests that it would make a fine educational campus, housing more than one school.  This is the vision that can reform the education landscape but without funding such aspirations will never become a reality, in particular under the current Government.However, this Bill is the stepping stone to such an educational utopia.  It provides for direct State involvement in the setting up of primary schools with the VECs becoming their patron.  Let us make no mistake about the fact that this is the opening salvo in the separation of church and State in the educational sector.  It could take us back to the position that existed in 1831 when the Whately commission was instrumental in giving Ireland one of the most progressive non-denominational school systems in Europe.  In 1831, a board of education was set up in Ireland under the chairmanship of Archbishop Richard Whately to support and run a State primary school system.  This was to prove a far more difficult task for him than chairing the Irish royal commission on poor relief.  The goal was to provide a free non-denominational primary education system, in which children of all religions would be educated together in secular subjects, an aspiration championed today by the multi-denominational and project schools.  This initiative was doomed to failure.  It was deeply resented by all the churches at the time, but proved highly popular with the people.  By 1849, approximately 500,000 children were attending the 4,321 national schools.  However, the churches gained control and support for their own church-run schools.  By the turn of the century, the education system in Ireland was denominational in practice.  What we are now looking to is a revitalisation of Bishop Richard Whately's vision.The VEC website provides details of secondary education, adult education and community education but seems shy when it comes to providing information of what is being heralded as a new era in primary education.  It is time for the VEC to put out its stall and keep us informed of its plans.  However, with an alarming lack of joined-up thinking, on the eve of the debate on the Bill the Government announced the closure of 17 of the 33 VECs leaving 16 multi-county VECs.  This will result in a situation where for the first time in 80 years individual counties will no longer have their own VEC.  However, this morning, the Minister stated the aim was to amend and extend the VECs.  This seems very strange to me as it goes much further than the McCarthy proposal for a cut to 22 VECs.  I would like the Minister to outline the impact this will have on proposals to bring primary patronage under the umbrella of the VEC.  The question for many counties now will be what VECs will be closed.  A withdrawal of the VEC structure will have a detrimental effect on many communities, especially those in rural Ireland.  My county of Longford is one of the counties that is supposed to lose its VEC and this is a cause of anger in the community.I heard Deputy Conlon praise the CEO of Monaghan VEC and I wish to compliment the new CEO of the VEC in Longford, Rosemary Killian-Johnston, on the fine work she does in co-operation with Councillor Sean Farrell, the chairperson of the VEC.  I also pay tribute to Josephine O'Donnell who was CEO of Longford VEC for the previous ten or 12 years and I wish her well in her retirement.I am puzzled by the Minister's contention that schools will benefit from the rationalisation of supplies and services.  I am sure she must agree with me that given the track record of the Department of Education and Skills, this is a load of codswallop — to put it politely.  These latest cutbacks are a severe blow to local democracy and another nail in the coffin of Irish education.With regard to the provisions in the Bill to give unqualified persons the legal right to teach in schools in limited and exceptional circumstances I wish to quote an e-mail from a disgruntled constituent, which sums up the feelings of outrage at this proposal:I am writing to you to express my deep concern at the Education Amendment Bill which was published recently.  I am horrified to read of the intention to amend section 30 of the Teaching Council Act (2001) to enshrine in legislation the facility for people who are not teachers to be employed as teachers and paid as teachers in schools.  Section 30 of the Teaching Council Act was what the Teaching Council was supposed to be about.  It was to end the ongoing scandal where someone who had nothing more than a Leaving Cert could stand in front of a class and be paid by the taxpayer for "teaching".  The excuse always given for this practice in the past was a shortage of suitably qualified teachers which necessitated the "emergency" employment of unqualified personnel.  That excuse does not exist now with hundreds of fully qualified teachers seeking work.  This was the ideal moment to commence Section 30, not to amend it.This correspondence sums up the outrage and disbelief of those involved in the educational sector as they see thousands of fully qualified and registered teachers who are unemployed.  We all have them in our parishes and communities.  Unfortunately many of them have to take planes and boats to places such as Canada and Australia to seek alternative employment.The fact that the Government has seen fit to publish this Bill against the backdrop of widespread teacher unemployment is nothing short of an insult.  There is no other profession where this would be tolerated and anyone who supports this section of the Bill and continues to talk about developing a knowledge economy is either stupid or hypocritical.  Again we see the lack of joined-up thinking and basic logic of the Government.  Has it escaped the Minister's notice that we are in a time of high unemployment, with 452,000 on the live register?  Now is the time to protect teacher employment, not to undermine it.  I request her to reconsider this retrograde step.  Surprisingly, I had support from my constituency colleague, Deputy Mary O'Rourke, on this issue.  It is beyond belief that any circumstances could possibly arise whereby an unqualified person could or should be paid to replace a teacher, given the high level of unemployment in the sector.  It is self-evident that non-teachers should not be employed when highly trained personnel are available.  There is also the question of the protection of children, which must be to the forefront of all our minds.   Such a move calls into question the Minister's own qualifications for her portfolio.I fully support the 2007 announcement by the then Minister for Education and Science, the idealistic aspirations of which included devising a new State model of community national schools.  However, the political landscape has changed in the interim and my fear now is that primary schools, which are a vital component of the education sector, will fall between two stools and funding will be further eroded.At this point I will let in my colleague, Deputy Enright.  I am sure she will have more to say on this subject.
#OlwynEnrightFG	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-party	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-dob	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	483	I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this long-awaited Bill.  However, I must say that it is somewhat limited.  I believe we are debating it without having had any national consultation on the issue.  I accept there has been a good degree of debate on the diversification of patronage.  However, the overall issue of patronage and whether we are happy with the system in general has not been subjected to the same level of scrutiny.  This scrutiny is crucial as we must examine how our patronage system is working and how it interacts with the Department of Education and Skills.  I feel there is a real lack of understanding among the general public, which only comes to someone's attention when something goes wrong in a school.  It is only then that people discover the Department does not have the say which the public thinks it has in the running of individual schools.I want to make clear that while I welcome greater diversification I must question why the only diversification being considered in the Bill is the VEC model.  There are pros and cons to the VEC model when it comes to primary schools.  There have been two pilot schemes in Dublin which have been successful.  I welcome those and I believe they were a good idea.On the positive side, the VEC has the advantage of having a clear structure.  It has strong administrative, legal and financial back-up which is important and as a patron, a VEC can offer a great deal of support to schools.  Effectively, there is that ready-made structure.  Importantly, it is possible for public representatives, parents and others to use those structures to follow up on problems where the local management system has failed.  A CEO of a VEC can step in, at second level in any event, where the management system is not working.  He or she has such power or authority.On the negative side and, as a member of a political party I still must say this, I would have real concerns about the politicisation of some VECs.  It is of genuine concern to parents and to many teachers.  In this regard, the VEC will be the patron.  It will not be running the school in the way it does at second level.  The point has been made by Deputy Conlon, and it is in the legislation, that it will not be a sub-committee of the VEC conducting the interviews for teaching positions, etc.  However, I would still have a concern about the politicisation of some VECs and that must be dealt with in order for this to work.  Having spoken to teachers, in particular, and to parents, there is a fear of going into the interview process without that concern being addressed.The Government refused some time ago to have a national debate on patronage, as Fine Gael, other parties, teacher union bodies, etc., have called for.  Surely a system that has evolved since 1831 could need reform and need debate.  We must look at that.We have an unusual system in that the State pays the bills by and large.  It pays for the teachers, it sets the curriculum and it carries out inspections and evaluations, yet it is effectively powerless when something is amiss in a school, with all the responsibility resting on the board of management.  In my eight years in this House I, like many colleagues, have met with parents and teachers on individual issues who have effectively met a brick wall when problems occurred and who find it extremely difficult to get adequate responses from some individual boards of management.  These might be isolated cases but the fact that I have had a significant number of them makes me question the whole system.Technically, parents and teachers have representatives on boards of management but it seems that these people, once they go on to the boards of management, buy into the board of management process.  This is understandable as they feel they are part of a team but they do not necessarily remember that they are were the representative of the parents, the teachers or whoever beforehand.  Being on a board of management is cumbersome and legalistic.  It is now an enormous responsibility and can be time consuming and it is difficult to get people to take on this role.  I spoke to one person who took on the role of chair of a board of management two or three years ago who was the twentieth person who had been asked.  There is a degree of personal legal responsibility that comes into it as well.The structure works fine until there is a problem.  When there is a problem it is almost impossible for me, as a public representative, to explain to a parent that the Department of Education and Skills and the Minister are not responsible here.  Parents do not fully realise that until something goes wrong and that is something that needs to be addressed.  Deputy Moynihan spoke about this as well.  I very much take his point about whether, if we want local autonomy and power, we want to centralise by having the Department of Education and Skills in charge as such but we need to have a debate about this, particularly if we will find it ever more difficult to get people to go on to the boards of management.However, this is one of the benefits of the VEC structure, in that the CEO is somebody who could then step in.  It is not always practical in the current system where almost 3,000 of our schools are under Catholic patronage to expect the parish priest or, in the case Church of Ireland schools, the local minister, who will probably know both sides to a dispute from being active persons in the community, to always be the ideal person to intervene.  If both parties are regular church attenders or if they both are persons one meets on the street, how does one adjudicate in that situation, whereas somebody like the CEO of a VEC may be in a better position to intervene.In her summation, I would like the Tánaiste to explain exactly how areas for the new pilot scheme were chosen.  Birr, where I live, is one of the chosen nine or ten places.  I learnt about it on the "News At One".  I spoke to teachers who learnt about it when I told them.  What sort of consultation was conducted?  It is fine if the church has decided that it will put forward these pilot areas, but who decided that these pilot areas were to be under the VEC structure or how did that come about?  Surely, the community should be deciding whether it wants the VEC, Educate Together, An Foras Pátrúnachta or whoever.  How will individual schools among those be chosen?It is interesting in the context of the model for amalgamations announced yesterday by the Minister.  I have no hang-up about the amalgamation of VECs.  There is common sense in doing so, particularly from an administrative point of view.  It may reduce the politicisation of it as well.  However, for example, the parish of Birr that has been chosen under this model goes into north Tipperary.  At least two of the schools in that parish are in north Tipperary.  They are not in the new VEC model, which encompasses counties Laois, Offaly and Westmeath.  How will that work under this proposed new system?  There are many matters that must be teased out before this legislation can be finally passed.  Who decided this and how will future local consultation on this issue take place?  Who will have the responsibility of driving?  Will it be the Department, the church or the VECs?  If Educate Together or somebody else wants to come in, does a facility exist for that body to enter the process at this point?I accept that the churches no longer have the manpower — it is very much manpower — to be the patrons of many of our schools but I do not agree with the polls that have been done in this area.  When people are asked the general question do they think the church should be involved, it is quick and easy to give a "No" answer, but when one is asked where one wants one's own children to go, maybe the answer would be somewhat different.  There needs to be real and substantial local consultation on this and parents need to understand how the system works and that the buck does not always stop at the Department of Education and Skills.What training, skills and expertise will be made available to the VECs to deal with primary education?  My experience of VECs has been that the CEO is usually somebody with a secondary school background, usually a former principal of a school or whatever.  They are alien to the operation of the primary school system and to the different curriculum and demands of a primary school.  That needs to be examined as well.I share the views of colleagues on the unqualified personnel issue.  This is a bizarre decision.  I have watched at first hand at home and with friends the considerable amount of work that goes into the starting of a primary school career, particularly the teaching practice end of it, such as projects, folders, lesson plans, computer programmes and wall charts, and the examinations and the inspections that are carried out.  There should be more of it later in careers.  To some extent it all is very much at entry level.  However, after all of that training there are so many unemployed primary school teachers and now the House is going to legislate — I will not be part of it — for someone unqualified to take up a position, albeit a temporary position, in schools.  It is ill-thought out.  If there are areas where they cannot get qualified teachers — from what Deputy O'Rourke stated, that is what the Tánaiste claimed at the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party meeting last night — and if the Tánaiste publishes a list of them tomorrow morning I guarantee there will be queues of teachers outside those schools by Friday morning looking to take up those positions.  There are enough qualified teachers willing to travel to where the employment is on offer.  If they do not travel to some rural place where it is difficult, the reality is they will be travelling to some other country to try to practice their trade.I seek clarification, more than anything, on the speech and language issue being transferred totally to the HSE.  The way it is being done, with the HSE and the Department of Education and Skills, is something of a fiasco.  I had occasion twice last year in two schools in my constituency to raise the issue of two speech and language teachers who were both out on maternity leave.  One of the schools, in County Offaly, was catering for children from counties Laois and Offaly.  There were nine children in the speech and language class, each of whom was being taxied individually to this school for normal schooling and speech and language therapy.  That teacher was not replaced while on maternity leave of almost nine months and the children missed almost an entire school year of speech and language therapy, despite the fact that one only gets the opportunity of two years of such therapy.As the HSE would not fund a replacement speech and language teacher for the teacher on maternity leave, the school was powerless, but the Department of Education and Science still paid for the cost of transporting those children to and from that school by taxi.  Those children continued to attend that school and they have received the regular education they would have received at the school in their own parish.  It was impossible to address the lack of that required service because of the moratorium on staff recruitment and so on.  How will the provision of such speech and language therapy work under this system?  If all responsibilities for the funding of it lies with the HSE,  who is responsible for the cost of providing taxis to transport children to the school where such therapy is provided and who will decide where it will be delivered?  There are a few issues in that respect that need to be teased out.If it were my choice, I would probably have opted for the other model where the Department would have had full responsibility to deliver such speech and language therapy within schools.  That model might have been more effective.  The involvement of two organisations, namely the HSE and the Department, poses a difficulty.  Children who need such speech and language therapy should receive it within school and the fact that responsibility for the delivery of this service rests entirely with the HSE could cause complications for some children.

#MaryWhite	unknown-#MaryWhite-party	unknown-#MaryWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	486	I very much welcome this Bill.  It is an important one for bringing about change in Ireland, particularly with the diversity of people here and the way our schools are developing.  Having recently launched the Department of Education and Skills intercultural education strategy, I have noted the extraordinary change in Irish schools with our new migrants.  The development of a community national school project is a good idea and I am in favour of it.  I am also very much in favour of the educate together model and I would like that model to also be in place at secondary level.  Not only are we delivering education at VEC level, second level and now moving into primary level but I hope that the Educate Together model will move from being in place at primary level to secondary level.As Deputy Enright mentioned, the VECs have done the State great service around the country.  I was chair of a board of management of a VEC in my constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny, Tullow Community School, and learning of the diversity and breadth of subjects, qualifications and the whole school ethos delivered in that school was a tremendous experience.  Dealing with staffing and policy issues in that school gave me a great understanding of what it is like to be in the heart of managing a school.To replicate the VEC model at primary level in face of a changing Ireland is an interesting development.  The VEC concept is a good model.  I know it will change due to a recent announcement, but as a wise person said to me in Kilkenny recently, "everything changes except a stagnant pool".  We must not look on things as stagnant pools, rather we must reflect on where we are at in times of economic recession, growth, well-being in our country and examine our structures.  Developing the community school concept is an interesting change.  It is a model that will ensure that the schooling needs for the coming year will embrace the huge diversity and interculturalism we have, which is a great boon and there is a great sense of new energy coming into Ireland and into our schools.  This concept has a diverse approach.While we have had our troubles with scandals in the church in recent times, there have been very good national schools with boards of management, on which the church was involved but we are moving into a new phase now.  This new phase is to be welcomed, particularly as we are becoming a more integrated society.  Askea boys' school and girls' school in Carlow in my constituency have more than 35 different nationalities, which brings to those schools a broad range of cultural diversity and tremendous difference whether it be language, food, faith or curriculum development, which all contribute to that broader new school ethos.The way we view the teaching of religion is one of the issues on which I want to focus in the short time I have to contribute.  The teaching of religion will change in these schools, and I welcome that.  These new community schools will welcome and respect all faiths and none and seek to provide for religious education during the allotted times for the main represented faiths within the school.  They also cater for parents who do not wish their children to receive a religious education based on any one particular faith.  That represents a move towards the new Ireland, taking account of the huge volume of inward migration we have experienced in recent years and the integration of which we have managed very well.   One of the good aspects of the intercultural education strategy is that it pinpointed the inclusivity of our education and the support particularly for English as an additional language.  Mindful of the myriad languages now spoken in our schools, one experiences a veritable microcosm of the world when one goes into some of our schools and sees the mix, diversity and that wonderful vibrancy of interculturalism, and I welcome that.That inculturalism will mean we will have to change the way we do our business in our schools.  The multi-belief programme is being taught in the new community national schools, particularly Scoil Cormac in Balbriggan and Ard RÍ community national school in Navan and in Naas, and they are pioneers in this development.  They are pushing out the boat in terms of developing this new model.  I love the title of the course for the development of this pilot belief programme in schools, which I am sure the Ceann Comhairle knows.  It is called "Goodness Me, Goodness You" and represents the good in all of us across the board of all different faiths and of none.  The person who thought of that working title deserves a pat on the back because it is good, punchy and different.  It is designed to cater for children of all beliefs and of none, with content appropriate for both theist and non-theist perspectives in keeping with the commitment to provide belief specific teaching in accordance with the wishes of parents.  The programme also provides for belief-specific modules to be delivered for children whose parents take that option.  If I had to say what I really like about this Bill, it is the inclusivity and respect for diversity of cultures present within the single school setting rather than in more than one school.  This approach is an important distinguishing feature of the community national schools, and I welcome that.  We are changing and we have to change with the times, develop, make sure that our schools cater for the needs of their new pupil cohorts and leave nobody behind and be inclusive in that respect.I welcome the provision to allow the VECs to operate primary schools with the board of management model of other primary schools rather than the governance model, and I believe that will be a good move.  The board of management model has worked well.  Having spent eight and a half years on the board management of a VEC in Carlow at post-primary level I am aware of the work boards of management do and the difficulties they face, whether it be a staff issue, a pupil issue, a governance issue, a problem with finance or a problem with the delivery of the curriculum.  The broad base that is the VEC system in our country has served us well.  This new model will be a great addition to our school provision network.  The intercultural education strategy covering five-year planning in education, which I launched a few weeks ago in Croke Park — before the All-Ireland final, when Kilkenny got its comeuppance, but never mind we will be back again — caters for the linguistic and cultural needs of our pupils.  This Bill is another part of that forward planning.I pay tribute to VECs throughout the country which have done the State a great deal of service in terms of the provision of education.  Turning their hand now to the community national school model will be a challenge, but it will mark this new development in a new way for a new cohort of pupils who are coming into the system and for parents who want a different system and a different methodology to be used in the way their children are taught, including or excluding religion and to have that freedom and respect for the diversity of cultures.  To me, that is a sign that in Ireland we are moving on in terms of how we look at changing trends in education.  It is good that we are doing this.  Unless we cater for the differences, it could possibly cause us trouble in the future.  We want to make sure that our education system with that broad depth of interculturalism can be applicable at second level through this new model.  I pay tribute to the boards of management of all our national schools.  The model they have delivered will change to a new type of patronage model under this legislation.  This move is to be welcomed in a changing Ireland.There has been considerable discussion of the reasons a new patronage model is required at this time.  Historically, as we all know, the church authorities acted as patrons or sponsors of primary schools by initiating the process of establishing new schools when they were needed to serve particular geographical areas.  Times are changing, however, and we need to adopt the new approach proposed in the Bill.  I look forward to seeing how the work of the vocational education committees and the VEC system at second level will cope with and adapt to primary level.  From frequent conversations with teachers, the initiative is receiving positive support.
#JimmyDevinsFF	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-party	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-dob	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	487	I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Mary White, for sharing time with me.I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak to this important Bill, which gives effect to the provision of primary education by the vocational education committees at the direction of the Minister for Education and Skills or on its own initiative.  It also allows a VEC to act as the patron of a primary school.It is interesting to note the following statistics.  Almost 85% of primary schools are currently under the patronage of the Catholic Church, while almost 6% are under the patronage of Protestant religions and 2.3% are either interdenominational or non-denominational.Some years ago, the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Mary Hanafin, announced the intention to devise a new model of patronage, one that was intended to allow those of many different religions and none to attend a school where the patronage would be representative of the students attending the school.  It is important to remember that the primary school system in Ireland is well established and has served the country well during the past 150 years or thereabouts.  There is no doubt that were it not for the active participation of the main religions in the establishment and running of schools during the past 150 years, we would not have the educational system we have today.I pay tribute to the many people who have served or serve on boards of management under the direction of the various school patrons and thank them for their time and expertise.  It is often overlooked in the current climate that these are given in a voluntary capacity.  Without these individuals, Irish education, especially primary education, would not be as strong as it is today.We have heard a great deal recently about third level education.  It is timely to remind ourselves that the foundation stone of education for all of us is that which we receive at primary level, hence the importance of ensuring that the primary school system is representative of Ireland in the 21st century.  This Bill is a recognition of modern Ireland in which all religions and none are recognised and practised and all our citizens and their children are treated equally.It is also worth remembering that funding for primary schools is State provided.  Hence, we have the strange position in which the State provides the funding but responsibility for the management of a school lies with its patron and board of management.  This model has worked well and all those involved deserve credit.  Nevertheless, stresses and strains are beginning to emerge and the circumstances in which this country finds itself must be taken into account.Last night, it was announced that the vocational education committees are to be reorganised and their number sharply reduced.  In the present climate, reorganisation and re-evaluation of all State services must be undertaken.  Giving the VECs an opportunity to become patrons of primary schools and become actively involved in primary education will be a severe challenge to the VEC sector.  However, when one considers their success at second level one concludes that the outlook is good.In my constituency of Sligo-Leitrim, the success of many of the schools under the control of the VEC is well recognised.  I will briefly refer to one such school, Ballinode Community College in Sligo city, which has developed great expertise in the provision of PLC courses and has more than 600 students attending PLC courses.  Students travel from all over Connacht, from north Donegal and as far as counties Mayo and Galway, to attend the school and avail of the variety of courses on offer at PLC level.  These courses have a great reputation in preparing students for the next stage of their education.I appeal to the Minister with responsibility for PLCs, who has been supportive of County Sligo VEC submissions in recent years, to look kindly on requests for further increases in funding for this ever-growing and important sector.  Ballinode Community College, with minimal funding, has been transformed in recent years and the ever increasing student numbers and wide geographical area from which its students come is testament to the success the principal, Mr. Joe Carolan, his staff and County Sligo VEC have achieved on the path they are travelling.  Taking this as an example of how the VECs can respond to new challenges, I have no doubt they will be able to fulfil their role as primary school patrons with equal if not greater success than envisaged in the Bill.I will briefly allude to a number of issues arising from the Bill.  I am sure most of them will be addressed in greater depth on Committee Stage.  It will be a challenge to the VEC sector to mobilise the voluntary help which is an essential support to primary schools.  One only has to think of the many voluntary fundraising events organised by parents and friends, whose support is vital to the everyday running of their local primary school and which, given the current financial climate, will become even more important in future.  While I have no doubt the VEC sector will be up to this challenge, it is important from day one that it recognises the challenges that will have to be faced in this area.A second issue that will arise is the teaching of religion and how the curriculum will be managed in this regard.  Early liaison with parents who choose to send their children to the proposed new schools should help resolve potential difficulties in this regard.  Parents have the ultimate right to choose what religious instruction is given to their children.  I am sure the main faiths will become actively involved in this area, if required.  We live in a multiethnic society.  It is important, however, that schools established under the Bill do not fall into the trap of becoming ghettoised and thus stigmatised.Other challenges also arise, including the employment of unregistered teachers.  If unregistered teachers are to be employed, strict criteria must be in place to safeguard the quality of the teaching supply.  This issue needs to be fully teased out on Committee Stage.  I concur with Deputy Enright's comments in this regard.Overall, this is a brave initiative by the Minister and I commend her on her courage in taking it.  I welcome the Bill which will, in time, be recognised as an important milestone in Irish primary school education.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	488	I wish to share time with Deputy Morgan.I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on this important legislation, which has arisen in part as a result of circumstances in my constituency of Dublin West.  Some years ago, the area experienced an extreme crisis in the formation of new schools as a result of an explosion in the number of children locally.  This was partially due to the very high birth rate in the area.  However, it also was because of a trend that the area of west Dublin shares with north Dublin and which probably also holds true around Drogheda, County Louth and in all the rapidly expanding areas of the country.  Although new primary schools were being formed in multiples every year in all the developing areas by both Educate Together and local Catholic parishes, a significant number of children, mostly of international origin, were not qualifying for places in any of the schools despite all of the new school expansion.  This was because there was such a population explosion of schoolchildren that this was not possible.  Thereafter, two additional schools were formed, one in the Dublin 15 area and the other in north Dublin.  The Catholic Archbishop of Dublin, Dr. Martin, took the patronage of the west Dublin school, called Scoil Choilm, on a two-year temporary basis, while Educate Together took the patronage of a school in the north County Dublin area, which meant that both principal patrons each took a school.  In the case of Scoil Choilm, which now is a highly active and thriving school in Dublin 15, the then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, indicated from the outset that it would be handed over to a VEC patron and after two years this decision was fulfilled.  The aforementioned school has been under the patronage of the County Dublin VEC since then, albeit without any legal status for the VEC to act as patron.  In so far as this Bill gives legal effect to what was promised and provides for the VEC to become a patron of Scoil Choilm in the full legal sense, this is to be welcomed.Scoil Choilm now is a significant primary school with a permanent premises in Castleknock and has an overwhelmingly international school population.  This leads to a point I wish to make because since the development of Scoil Choilm, a number of other VEC primary schools have been established in west Dublin that also cater to a significant international community.  While all schools in west Dublin have large numbers of international students in their population, the VEC schools have a particularly high number of such students.  Given that the students in such schools often come from more than 30 countries and therefore from a wide variety of backgrounds, it is important that, as the VEC is given responsibility by the Government for the patronage of such schools, one is clear about what one desires for these schools.The first and most important point is not necessarily to do with religion but pertains to the quality and reputation of such VEC schools, as well as to their ambition for the children who attend them.  Such schools under the patronage of the VEC must aspire to the very highest standards of education for the students in their care, regardless of whether they come from Ireland or an overseas background.  This will be absolutely critical.  The second principle is that in so far as is possible, these schools should be made sufficiently attractive for Irish families to be anxious to send their children to them.  Such schools must be centres of outstanding achievements, learning and experience for all children who attend them, whatever their background.  There is a great deal of phoney debate going on as though the only issue regarding these schools pertains to how religion is or is not taught or approached.  That is to miss the point.  The key element about any school is that all children who attend it should be invited into an attractive learning environment that enables them to make progress to the best of their ability and ambition, as well as that of their parents.  They then should proceed successfully into the secondary school system and I note that many of the schools in west Dublin have a VEC secondary school attached.  In turn, the children coming out of those secondary schools should then go on to do the same kinds of things as do children from primary and secondary schools with traditional patronage.  I refer to the statistics that well over 50% of the students from Irish secondary schools go on to some kind of third level education.  This is the ambition of most Irish parents and most international parents.I have met the principals and many of the teachers of the VEC primary and new secondary schools in west Dublin and have had the opportunity to visit for various different events.  It is clear that the quality of the teachers and leadership in those schools is absolutely excellent and outstanding.  Moreover, the parents are highly engaged in supporting the schools their children attend.  That is a most vital point when creating a successful school community.  From the moment one enters the entrance hall of such a school, it has about it a ring of confidence and ambition for the future success of its children, whatever the capacity or wishes of the individual child or his or her parents may be.As for the religious education and religious formation issue, Ireland has a model of denominational religious schools, which are highly valued by parents for obvious reasons.  This is a constitutional right they have and will continue to enjoy and that the Labour Party supports and upholds.  The model of Educate Together is multidenominational.  All schools should respect all religions, as well as people who have an ethical foundation that is not necessarily expressed through a particular religion.  Good models have been developed by Educate Together in particular to have a core curriculum that treats the basics of moral principles in respect of the approach to the world of the child and in terms of the school, home, village, town or city.  Moreover, particularly when children in a school represent 30 or more different nationalities, children should have an opportunity to understand broadly, perhaps when they enter fifth or sixth class, what are the different great faiths of the world, what are their principal tenets and that there should be mutual respect and understanding.It is relatively easy to make provision for a system of specific religious formation and different religious faiths have different traditions in this respect.  For example, in the case of the Protestant churches, the Jewish faith and many of those who practice the Muslim faith, much religious formation takes place in the actual place of worship outside of the school.  Members will be familiar with Church of Ireland Sunday schools, as well as various forms of education in synagogues for people of Jewish faith.  In Ireland, it has been traditional to make faith preparation an essential and integral part of a Catholic school.  In multidenominational schools, it obviously will be for the VEC, the school board and the parents to decide whether this should be done by making available the premises of the school.  Agreement can be reached whereby the school premises are made available for parents who wish to have their children partake of Holy Communion and Confirmation.  It could be arranged, for example, to have that faith formation and those particular ceremonies take place after hours.  Such solutions are eminently possible and would reflect the broad level of diversity that exists in areas like my constituency.  I hope the Bill will facilitate and recognise those types of solutions.  Moreover, I hope the diverse ethnicities and faiths of parents and pupils will be represented on VEC boards of management.  That will strengthen the multidenominational aspect of schools.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	489	I thank Deputy Burton for sharing time.  I very much welcome the Bill.  It is long overdue, although it is not quite the Bill I would have introduced were I sitting on the other side of the House.The separation of church and State must be completed.  In the Twenty-six Counties the State pays for education through capitation grants, teachers' salaries and a range of other funding.  However, the vast majority of primary and secondary schools are not under democratic control but instead are predominantly under the patronage of Catholic bishops and in the ownership of the Catholic Church.  It is a legacy of the old era of ecclesiastical power and control.  We must move toward a democratically controlled education system which is truly representative of the community, which respects the rights of people of all religions and none and is totally child centred.In that regard, I welcome the initiative taken in this Bill with regard to VEC patronage of primary schools.  This is a step in the right direction in terms of throwing off the shackles of our outdated church-dominated education system.  To allow denominational schools the discretion to disqualify some children from admission on the basis of religious belief, or lack thereof, is not sustainable in a modern, diverse 21st century Ireland.  It is a scandal that this discrimination has been allowed to continue for so long.The current patronage model has its foundations in the establishment of the national school system in 1831.  A lot has changed since then and we now live in an Ireland which is more diverse, more inclusive and more respecting of other cultures and religious identity.  We need to move with the times.  We cannot continue to base our education system, which is the bedrock of our society and moulds and shapes the lives of generations, on a system dating back to British rule.  The VEC system is a democratic one.  VECs across the state are comprised of elected representatives, parents and community representatives who are at the coal face of education and who have first-hand knowledge of their communities and how they work.I am disappointed that on the eve of this debate, the Government made an announcement that it is to amalgamate 29 out of the 33 VECs in the State.  This is a bad move.  While the Bill increases the roles and responsibilities of VECs, the proposal to amalgamate does the opposite and diminishes the role of the VECs.  We need only look at the Health Service Executive to see that centralising services does not work.  Under the old health board system, with all its faults, there was at least an element of democratic accountability.  There is no democratic accountability under the HSE.  Parliamentary questions the Minister for Health and Children are simply referred to an official somewhere in the system who may or may not reply.  If there is a reply it may well be in the form of a daft note which means nothing.  I hope the same mistake will not be made with regard to the VECs.  The Minister must publish a cost-benefit analysis of this proposal before proceeding with any changes.  VECs are anchored in democracy and are accountable.There has been much debate about the teaching of religion in schools.  Although the new VEC model of primary school will allow for faith formation during the day, it intends to cater for those of all religions and none.  Provision will be made during the school day, based on the level of demand, for the religious education of children in conformity with the wishes of parents.  The school will also cater for parents who do not wish their children to receive education based on any one particular faith.  This is very much welcome.  In a perfect world there would be no religious instruction during school hours in the classrooms of a secular state.  However, it must be recognised that this is a major step in the right direction to inclusiveness and tolerance, and I hope it will go some way towards the full secularisation of the education system.I have concerns about some sections of this Bill, in particular the move to disband the educational disadvantage committee.  What type of message does that send?  At a time when unemployment is soaring and social welfare provision is being reduced it makes no sense to disband a committee whose sole focus is to act on the issue of disadvantage in education.  The proposed saving arising from the disbandment of the committee is €300,000, a pittance in comparison with the billions being pumped into the banks.  It is clear that the Government has its priorities all wrong.  Educational disadvantage will not go away without a focused strategy but it seems to be last on the list of this Administration's concerns.  The Government has already cut student grants, Youthreach allowances and Traveller training centres.  Now it is proposing to disband the educational disadvantage committee.  I hope the Minister will reconsider this proposal.I also take issue with the provision in the Bill to allow unqualified persons to teach where a substitution requirement arises.  At a time when fully qualified teachers are in the dole queue, it is totally unacceptable that persons who are not qualified for the job are being employed in schools.  I propose to move an amendment in this regard, which will also be put forward by my colleague, Senator Doherty, in the Upper House.  A person who is not a teacher and who is engaged by a school to cover the absence of a teacher should be recruited in a supervisory capacity only.  Moreover, the appointment should be recorded as such so that the impact of the Minister's failure to make provision for qualified substitution can be monitored.  The availability of accurate monitoring figures would reveal the extent of this practice.Not only do children deserve to be taught by a qualified teacher but teachers who have trained and received their qualification deserve to work.  I propose the establishment of supply panels of qualified teachers so that every teacher absence is covered by a fully qualified teacher.  This makes far more sense than the current arrangement.  I am acutely familiar with the practice of teacher panels because such a panel was in operation in Dundalk town for a considerable time before recently being discontinued because of funding issues.  It was an excellent practice which gave principals some degree of certainty in regard to the inevitable absences that occur.There is a need for us to move on as a society by providing more choice in our education system.  We must throw out the archaic system of religious control over our education.  There is also a need for fundamental reform of our outdated patronage system.  I support the proposals in this Bill with regard to VEC patronage of primary schools.  However, I will reserve judgment on the legislation in its entirety until the concerns I have raised are addressed.I conclude by noting that it is unfortunate that there are Members of this House — qualified teachers — who are holding onto teaching posts and thus preventing unemployed teachers from taking up those positions.  I fully understand why a first-time Member would wish to retain the option to return to a teaching job after the next election.  However, once a Member has been re-elected, he or she should be prohibited from holding onto that post and therefore preventing teacher colleagues from securing their proper position in the education system.  I may propose an amendment to the Bill in this regard.

On the matter of registered teachers, to which Deputy Morgan referred, the explanatory memorandum to the Bill notes that in a small number of schools there are reasons for the engagement of certain unregistered teachers.  In the context, one can understand the Minister's motivation.Like all Members of the Oireachtas, I have had communications from individual teachers and from representative bodies expressing outrage that this may be the thin end of a wedge.  I do not believe this is the case but I agree with Deputy Morgan that the system must be tightened up.  One way to tighten it up would be to revisit the issue of supply panels.  Some months ago, the Joint Committee on Education and Skills, which I chair, looked at the issue of the north Clondalkin supply panel.  Despite the best efforts of members of the joint committee and the visiting delegation to put cogent points to the Minister, no progress was made.  Given our current financial constraints, it makes sense to have either one national or a small number of regional supply panels rather than several local panels.  Panels should consist of qualified teachers who are currently available for work rather than retired individuals.  Retired teachers may have considerable experience but in the current jobs market we want to ensure that people who have graduated can gain experience.  While one cannot be ageist, one must strike a balance.  By having a proper incentivised quota system on a national supply panel one can ensure a blend of recently qualified people with new ideas and experienced teachers.  There may be individuals who could go on to such a supply panel because of specific circumstances.  However, the principle should remain that schools should employ only fully qualified teachers.With every rule there is an exception.  I did not hear the issue of ABA schools being mentioned during the debate.  Several schools have not quite completed their deliberations, or their deliberations were prematurely concluded.  The Programme for Government contains a commitment that ABA, as a methodology, continues but within the strict departmental constraints.  The Programme for Government originally contained a commitment that 12 ABA schools would come under the departmental guarantee of ongoing funding.  While the letter of the commitment was not broken the spirit certainly was.  We have seen the rampant disassembly of ABA schools.  There are schools where students receive a little ABA, which is a methodology, but are also taught in TEACCH and PES.  These are not comparable with ABA, which is a way of interacting with the student.  It is not a pedagogical learning methodology.  One cannot combine them all but that is the eclectic mix the Department has been using.

The issue of special needs and autism is on the work programme of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills.  This will provide an opportunity to look at ABA and to revisit the rules on which the current Government policy on autism spectrum disorders is based.  There has never been a proper Irish study of the best methods.  All the research is imported.  ABA expertise is also imported but we need to find the best fit for Ireland.  There are tutors who are not qualified primary teachers but are qualified in ABA.  Because they do not have primary teaching qualifications they cannot proceed.  They could only be employed as glorified special needs assistants (SNAs).  I am not disparaging SNAs but these people's qualifications were greater than what would be required to be an SNA.  That is how some of them are operating in ABA schools at present.  The one size fits all policy is not working.This Bill would help the Department if it decided to enable ABA tutors to be employed as teachers.  This exception would help ABA schools and would help the Department to match the needs of parents and children to the departmental framework.  I do not wish to use the term "departmental lock" although people may feel they are being locked in.  That is a digression in terms of the legislation but it is an important one because it gives ABA teachers a chance to get primary teaching qualifications over a reasonable period and to be paid adequately for their skill set.  For many children with autism spectrum disorders ABA works.  I thank Deputy Morgan for his valuable input.  I will try to raise that point with the joint committee.The legislation formalises the current involvement of VECs at primary level and enables other VEC schools to come into the primary system.  Other speakers have referred to the decoupling of certain religious schools in the Dublin Archdiocese, which was welcomed by everyone at the time.  I know there is no pressure on the Catholic Church to divest specific schools but this will be done on the basis of demographics and the needs of particular areas.  I welcome that progress.There is not much to say if one welcomes the idea of VEC involvement at primary level, except to say one welcomes it.  Deputy Joan Burton spoke about the need for adequate resourcing and of the situation in her constituency, which is where the model was rolled out.I have a concern about how the roll-out of the VEC model relates to Educate Together schools.  Educate Together have been campaigning to become a patron at second level.  In my constituency there is an attempt by the Minister to get the VEC and Educate Together to look at the existing site in Clonburris.  There are two sites in Clonburris but because the growth of Adamstown has slowed there is no longer a need to open schools on both sites.  There will be only one site.  There is, clearly, a demand for an Educate Together second level school and for a school to meet the needs of children leaving Archbishop Ryan senior national school in south Lucan.  The model the Minister put in place provides an opportunity for the VEC and Educate Together to work together.   I hope this is a template for the future, notwithstanding the demand and need for a solely Educate Together second level school.There is a fear among the Educate Together fraternity — it may be misguided, paranoid or genuine — that the roll-out of VEC schools at primary level may call a halt to the roll-out of Educate Together primary schools.  Educate Together has had to drag itself up by its boot straps and set up schools that were very parent driven.  Theirs is a different form of democracy from the VEC model.  Both are equally valid but they usually get into spats with one another as to which is more democratic, which is a wasted debate.  However, there is a fear in Educate Together that they are looked down upon by the VECs and, possibly, by certain members of the education fraternity and that their model is seen as no different from the VEC model at second level.  There are significant differences between Educate Together and VEC schools.  That is why I hope the partnership works out.   The fear at primary level is that as VEC schools are rolled out, the opportunities to establish parent driven Educate Together schools will dwindle.  If this is part of an ingenious long-term plan to secularise Irish education, we could be waiting until 2116 until this aim is achieved.  Perhaps we should be up-front about religion in our schools.  I note Deputy Olivia Mitchell is nodding her head in agreement with some of my comments.It would be difficult to know whether a majority would vote against religion in schools were a referendum held tomorrow.  It is certainly the case that a large number of people want to maintain religious instruction, and this right is protected under the Constitution.  However, a growing number does not want anything to do with religion or is from a minority faith.  Multi-denominational education is important in this regard.Deputy Quinn has on many occasions raised the issue of atheists, agnostics and those who do not have any religious affiliation.  These individuals also have a right to educate their children in an ethos that respects their points of view.  It could be argued that atheism is a religious belief system in its own right.  At some point in the future we will have to decide whether belief systems should be an intrinsic part of our education system.A referendum, whether held tomorrow or in five years' time, would be divisive and could allow fundamentalist views to be expressed forthrightly.  It is not the kind of subject that leads to violence on the streets but it certainly would alienate a significant number of people.  It would not be constructive if hurtful comments were made.Like it or not, the present model encourages choice and diversity.  The introduction of VEC patronage is a further step on the long journey of ensuring all parents have a choice.  Where population growth creates demands for new schools, the new patrons will be VECs and people who desire a traditional Catholic education for their children may not be satisfied.  The VECs have to be more proactive than simply rescuing children who cannot get a place.  Those involved in education on the church side see space for more Catholic schools in various areas.My personal, as opposed to political, view is that perhaps we should grab the bull by the horns and phase out religious instruction.  While a school may continue to celebrate its Catholic or multi-denominational ethos, religious instruction would be given outside school hours.  This would reduce the pressure on students to differentiate amongst themselves  There may not be conscious discrimination but feelings of differentiation can also be dangerous.  The multi-denominational model, however, celebrates all faiths and none.The Bill limits itself to VECs and the issue of unqualified teachers.  However, the provisions for boards of management under the Education Acts also need to be addressed.  I am sure I am like other Members in that I have received information on boards of management which took decisions in what was perceived as an undemocratic manner.  Parents can feel isolated because they do not get enough training or are ganged up on by certain individuals.  Instead of allowing the patron to wield the power on boards, they should be community based, with stronger parental and staff input.  The days of a bishop dictating the wishes of parents should be long gone.Notwithstanding the despicable cases of abuse, we should be grateful to the Catholic Church for its contribution to education over the years.  Were it to divest itself of all its institutions tomorrow at a fair price for the work put in by religious orders, this economy would be doubly bankrupt.  We cannot force the church out of education nor should we try to do so but boards of management should be restructured to allow for more democratic involvement.  Under the VEC model, county councillors and parents' groups are appointed to boards of management, which is a form of democracy, but they are often overruled by principals or patrons.  Parents do not have enough say in what happens in their children's schools.  In the longer term, we need root and branch reform of our education law, particularly in regard to boards of management.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	494	I welcome the main thrust of this Bill, which gives formal and legal recognition to the VEC primary school model.  The legislation comes in response to demands for change in our educational models at primary level.  I support the demands for faith based schools and believe they should continue to be available to the many parents who want them for their children.  However, they should not be the only patronage model for our schools.Archbishop Martin has pointed out that 92% of schools are Catholic even though only 70% of the population follow that religion.  Only half of Catholic parents desire religious based education.  Ireland is changing with immigration and intermarriage and our population has become much more diverse.  The educational system has to meet the needs of this new diversity.  People want choice and if 50% of parents want Catholic education, they should be entitled to it.  A number of Protestant schools are located in my constituency and there continues to be strong demand for this model.  However, we must also reflect our changing population.  Parent groups are seeking different models of education, such as VECs, gaelscoileanna and Educate Together, all of which reflect a changing Ireland.On a recent Saturday morning, I attended a meeting held to establish demand for an Educate Together school.I was amused to hear that at 7.30 a.m. on a Saturday, there was a queue of parents forming to register their children's names on the grounds that they would be accepted on a first-come, first-served basis.  Within an hour, 120 children were registered.  There is certainly demand for a variety of school models.  We should take this into account.There is a need for a master plan outlining how we should move from the one model we had in the past to a variety of models.  We need a roadmap.  At present, we have an ad hoc approach that depends, perhaps, on a few enterprising parents in a particular area with some vision of the kind of education model they would like.  That is all very well but it is not the basis for a good, sound national educational plan.If the church wants to divest itself of school ownership and responsibility, as appears to be the case in many instances, we need an agreed mechanism for that to happen.  There is urgency in this regard.  In my area and, I am sure, others, parents are voting with their feet.  Schools are losing pupils, not because there is a lack of children but because people want alternative models.  Rather than have buildings go to waste and have people fighting change or trying to poach pupils in other schools, we should determine what people want in any given area and plan for that.  Thus, money would not be wasted building schools where there are existing schools that people have decided, for whatever reason, not to support.The VEC model is welcome and represents a possibility anywhere.  However, where are the schools to be?  What assessment has been done of the cost of the VEC school model?  Have other models been assessed?  Is the VEC model the best?  What is the plan?  Have criteria been laid down as to the kind of school models that will exist in the future?How is demand being established in any locality?  It is not a good idea for Educate Together schools and Gaelscoileanna to be running Saturday morning get-togethers.  I suspect parents would put their names down on lists at several such events.  Something needs be done on a national basis.  A mechanism needs to be put in place to determine how existing schools pass into State ownership from clerical ownership.  We must determine how existing schools can morph from faith-based schools under religious patronage to Educate Together or VEC schools.  There is urgency in this regard.  Fine Gael has called for a national forum to decide how to move forward.  It does not matter what it is called; we need something other than the ad hoc approach that seems to obtain at present.The transfer of responsibility for speech and language services from the Department of Education and Skills to the HSE ought to be mentioned.  It bothers me because I do not know what is behind it.  There has always been tension between education and health services where they interface.  Parents of children with special needs have always been going from Billy to Jack seeking health-related services in an educational setting.I welcome the change, however, in the sense that it allows for clarity of responsibility.  At least we know who is not responsible.  The Department of Education and Skills will no longer be responsible.  Where does responsibility now lie?  Children will still need speech and language services in a school setting.  Nobody in this House is unaware how woefully pathetic the speech and language services have been in our schools.  How will the relevant section of the Bill change this?  Will the services still be available in the school setting or will parents have to travel outside school hours to gain access to services?If I were a parent of a child with a disability, I would be extremely worried.  I just do not know what agenda is being pursued for special needs children.  For years, the impetus was towards integrated schooling in a mainstream setting but now responsibility for therapies is shifting out of schools.  In spite of this, children with disabilities need these therapies.  Supports in schools are being removed, special educational needs posts are being abolished and special classes are being closed down.  However, we do not know what setting the Department envisages for special needs children in the future.Integration into mainstream schools is now being dismantled.  Perhaps this is a good thing for some children; I do not know.  However, if there is to be a change, we should know what model is in place.  Parents need to know the model and need to be able to plan for their children's education, especially when those children have severe disabilities.  In many cases, it is necessary to plan where one is going to live because schools for children with special needs, if they are to comprise the model of the future, will not be as numerous as mainstream schools.  At present, parents, particularly of young children, are in a complete vacuum in terms of what the future holds.  We need a major debate on this to achieve clarity on the Department's thinking thereon.I want to deal with the section on the use of unqualified personnel.  To be honest, I do not know where the proposal came from in this era of surplus graduates.  Many of us were at the USI lobby meeting today where reference was made to the emigration of as many as 1,000 graduates per week.  This seems to be a very large number but, even if the number is only half that, it is far too many.  Everybody would agree that there is no shortage of teachers available at present.  It may be there is some very good reason behind the proposal.  Deputy Gogarty mentioned ABA schools, which may require different training and which may have different needs.  Perhaps the new curriculum for maths may require teachers who are not necessarily qualified as teachers but who have a superior qualification.  However, that is not what is being said.  Apparently it is being said there is no availability of teachers, but I do not believe it.There are databases of available teachers.  Young graduate teachers I know are willing to travel miles for work and across the country, if necessary.  The introduction of unqualified personnel to the classroom is a retrograde step.  We need to maintain a standard of professionalism in schools.  If we do not do so, we can kiss any future for our children goodbye.  That is really important to bear in mind.  We spend thousands of euro educating our teachers but then let them emigrate or languish in the dole queues.  Even if young people are only given part-time or temporary work, they must be given the opportunity to get their foot in the door and gain some experience, thus enhancing their prospects of obtaining employment in the future.I agree with Deputy Gogarty, whose point may be ageist, that principals have a responsibility to give available jobs to graduates rather than teachers retired on good pensions.  This may be controversial and perhaps I will be one of the teachers looking for a job in time to come.  However, who is going to pay the teachers' pensions but the young graduates of today?  If they are not working, who will pay the pensions?  It is time for a little intergenerational solidarity in this area.Fine Gael will not be supporting the introduction of unqualified teachers to schools.  It represents a retrograde step and unless there are very strict safeguards, I will not contemplate supporting it.  There are safeguards but they are very weak.  They state the principal "may" do this or that but there is no statement that he or she "must" do this or that to ensure the employment of unqualified teachers will only be temporary.  This needs to be re-examined.

It is not an earth-shattering Bill nor is it of any great importance.I acknowledge the role the religious orders have played in the running of schools over the past century or centuries.  It is easy to knock them in light of recent abuse cases.  Too much emphasis has been placed on the control of schools.  I have no difficulty with any model, be it the VEC, Educate Together or Gaelscoil model, but believe we have missed the point regarding primary education.  I would like children to have access to Gaelscoileanna country-wide.  It is important to acknowledge the high percentage of people who speak or are competent in Irish in Carlow town.  Gaelscoil Eoghain Uí Thuairisc, County Carlow was founded some 30 years ago by a Clare woman, Bríd de Róiste.  She has generated a love of Irish in that community and it is important that all children, resources permitting, have access to Irish.This Bill is not earth shattering.  The issue of primary education is dear to my heart.  It is an issue on which I have spoken many times since becoming a Member of this House.  Rather than improving, our education system has deteriorated.  I am concerned about the difficulties being experienced with numeracy and literacy.  Every child that comes out of the primary system should be able to read and write.  However, this is not the case.  I would hazard a guess that the statistics in this regard have deteriorated in recent years and for a number of reasons, the main one being that the curriculum has in recent times become too broad.  Teachers do not have the time to put emphasis on the basic foundation stones of any education, numeracy and literacy.  We are teaching children how to write creatively when some cannot join up letters or write at all.  Weaker children in particular are suffering as the teacher moves on with stronger students in the group.  I would like the Department or Minister to run a ruler over any available statistics in regard to the time spent on numeracy, literacy and Irish some ten, 15 or 20 years ago relative to today.  There is a strong correlation between the number of people who currently have literacy difficulties and the amount of time spent on teaching in that regard.I am a great believer in equality of opportunity.  One cannot guarantee equality of outcome but one should ensure equality of opportunity.  There are only two methods by which this can be achieved, namely, through the education system and the housing system.  Our housing policy in terms of social housing has failed dramatically.  Generation after generation of people are living in ghettos in various parts of the country.  On dyslexia, many primary teachers do not know how to recognise this difficulty.  Many children go through the primary system without this difficulty having been identified.  We must put resources into primary education to ensure equality of opportunity.  It is too late to address this difficulty when children reach second level.  I am sure the argument will be made that we do not have the resources to provide special needs assistants.I compliment the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Ó Cuív, on bringing forward the proposals in regard to work fare as opposed to welfare, a subject which is dear to my heart.  The vast majority of the 460,000 plus people who are unemployed would be happy to do some sort of work.  This would benefit their self esteem and society.  One of the greatest assistants a teacher can have in a classroom is the parent of a child experiencing difficulty.  Many parents who are in receipt of jobseekers or various other allowances would be happy to assist a teacher in the classroom.  I have visited schools where this is in practice and it is working well.  This practice could be introduced countrywide.I recall the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin, as Minister for Health and Children back in the halcyon days of 1998 making great pronouncements about every classroom having a computer.  Many of these computers are lying around covered in dust because teachers have not been trained to use them or are not competent in computer usage.  Parents could also be brought in to assist teachers in the use of computers.  Our most experienced teachers, generally principals, are caught up in administration of schools, leaving them little time to focus on education issues.  We must consider the concept of grouping schools and appointing an administrator to look after them, leaving principals, who very often have come through the school system and have 20 or 30 years educational experience, to concentrate on educational matters and the difficulties being experienced by many children owing to the breakdown in home units rather than counting sweeping brushes, checking car park spaces or potholes in the school car park.  This resource too is freely available.  I ask the Minister to consider the concept of appointing on a pilot basis an administrator to a group of schools.  An administrator could, for example, be appointed to look after three or four schools in the constituency of Cork North-Central, which is represented by the Acting Chairman, Deputy O'Flynn, thereby leaving the principals to concentrate on education matters.  Our educational difficulties are playing second fiddle to administrative difficulties.Many primary schools are in poor condition.  I will not list all of them but there are two in my constituency, St. Saviour's in Rathdrum and the primary school in Hackettstown, which has been designated as disadvantaged.  The Department needs to revise its list of disadvantaged schools as it may be dated, with some schools that should never have been included placed on the list for spurious reasons.  I am aware of some schools that have not been designated disadvantaged and I can only hazard a guess as to why.Another issue of concern to me, which is not directly related to this Bill but is related to primary education into the future, is that many fine facilities built around the country, for which the Department of Justice and Law Reform granted money, have or will become white elephants during the next few years.  These facilities were built with a view to providing easy access to child care for both parents as they were needed in the workforce.  The position has now changed.  Many of these facilities were built away from educational facilities.  We need a policy in regard to where these facilities are being built so that when they are no longer required they can be integrated with school facilities.  The facility in Tinahely, County Wicklow was built adjacent to the school.The HSE, in terms of accessing services such as dental and speech and language services, is the bane of every politician's life.  It is difficult to find out who is responsible for what.  I am not sure if providing in this legislation that these services will become the responsibility of the HSE will solve the problem.  It is difficult to get through to the HSE on the phone let alone get anything done.  These services would be better operated by the Department of Education and Science or some arm of it.  The health and welfare of our children should be the responsibility of the Minister for Education and Skills.We are sending out into the wider community children who cannot read and write because our curriculum is too broad.  The new curriculum introduced several years ago is flawed.  It is time it was revisited.
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	496	I wish to share time with Deputy Michael Kitt.I welcome the introduction of this Bill to the House which provides us with an opportunity to speak on it and to make observations on education in general.  We live in changing times in terms of education.  I come from a county which for many years had a conventional type of education system in the form of primary and secondary schools.  In recent years, however, there have been many changes in the area at primary, second and third level.  We now have Educate Together schools in Gorey and Wexford town.  Proposals have also been submitted for the construction of a new Educate Together school in Enniscorthy.  Also, there are gaelscoileanna in four towns in Wexford and a second level gaelscoil.  We have a wide variety of educational systems in our county.A new secondary school due to open in Wexford next year will cater for 1,000 students based in Gorey.  Competition in regard to who will get patronage of this school is already under way between the Educate Together community and County Wexford VEC.  This has created quite a stir, particularly in Gorey and the area surrounding it.  Public meetings have been held and the Tánaiste has set up a body which has been charged with engaging in discussions with the various groups to establish the model of patronage that should be put in place in respect of running the school.Politicians have been lobbied strongly by County Wexford VEC and the Educate Together movement, both of which are seeking to be appointed as patron for the school.  We should consider amalgamating a certain section of the VEC with Educate Together and charge this entity with running the new secondary school in Gorey.  What is most important is that the school should be brought into operation as soon as possible.  We are indebted to the Tánaiste because from next September she will lease a building in which the initial intake of first year students will be able to commence classes.  The new school is due to come on stream by 2013.  There is a strong commitment to it.As the Tánaiste stated, the purpose of the Bill is to facilitate the involvement of the vocational education committees in the provision of primary education for the first time.  It also deals with a number of other education-related matters.  As she pointed out, the Bill is one of several that are necessary so that we might cater for the changing educational requirements throughout the country.I have no difficulty with vocational education committees being involved in the provision of primary education, per se.  However, I have certain reservations regarding some of the operations of the VECs at present.  They have moved away from many of the ideals they pursued when they were first established.  In addition, I am not sure whether some of them are operating in the best interests of schools or students.  Perhaps the Tánaiste’s suggestion that a number of them be amalgamated will bring about a change.I cannot understand why it is proposed to amalgamate the Wexford and Wicklow VECs.  Wexford has a more natural relationship with Carlow and has always had a strong involvement with that county.  However, the Tánaiste and her advisers have seen fit to amalgamate the Wexford and Wicklow VECs.  Wicklow is a large county and, in Bray, it has an extremely large urban centre.  The concern in Wexford is that the centre for the new VEC structure will be based in that town rather than at a location that is equidistant from Dublin and Rosslare.  Given the size of the geographical area involved, it would be more suitable to situate the new headquarters in Gorey or at some other point on the border between the two counties.  We will leave that argument to another day but I am sure people will have much to say to the Tánaiste in respect of this matter.  I have no difficulty with the proposed amalgamation.  Under the existing VEC system, there has been too much bureaucracy and administrative waste.  There is certainly a need to bring about a change.  I welcome that change but I am not overly happy with regard to the amalgamation of the Wexford and Wicklow VECs.Some of the changes proposed in the Bill are extremely worthwhile.  However, I again request that the Tánaiste reconsider the position with regard to the abolition of the educational disadvantage committee.  I do not know why this proposed move is taking place.Under the Bill, responsibility for speech therapy services is to be transferred to the HSE.  That organisation has not been very progressive when it comes to the provision of speech therapy or other services required by young people.  Serious consideration must be given to this matter on Committee Stage.  Disadvantaged status is extremely important for schools.  Some of the schools that were previously in the DEIS programme have been removed from it, while others are trying to obtain entry to it.  I refer in particular to schools based in large urban centres which are obliged to deal with the problems to which their very location gives rise.  The Tánaiste must consider how we will deal with this matter in the future.  Students in some schools are not receiving the level of speech therapy they require.  Those who rely on the HSE for services in this area are certainly not receiving what they require.  Politicians are often obliged to make strong representations on behalf of young children who are expected to wait one or two years or perhaps longer for speech therapy and other services.The Tánaiste outlined the background to the Bill and referred to the pilot schemes that were launched in three counties.  Such a scheme should have been run in a rural area.  The areas in counties Dublin, Meath and Kildare in which the pilot schemes were run would not be regarded as rural.  It is important that there be a rural bias in the models that are being established.What is happening in this regard dates back to 2007, when the then Minister, Deputy Hanafin, announced her intention to devise a new model of primary school patronage.  The reason behind this move was that some of the Catholic clergy signalled that they wanted to either opt out of or did not want to be as involved in the running of schools in the future.  It was important, therefore, that a new patronage structure be established.  In light of the many religious denominations that are to be found here following the huge influx of immigrants in recent years, it is only correct that a new model be developed.The result of this process is that we are now discussing community national schools.  Community schools have been operating in the second level sector for many years.  There are community schools in Gorey and New Ross and these work reasonably well.  I have reservations with regard to the boards of management of such schools, which appear to be a law unto themselves.  Problems arose in Gorey in recent years when we tried to encourage the community school there to take in additional students while the new school was coming on stream.  The board of management was extremely difficult to deal with in that regard.It is important that the new boards of management should be widely representative and should, perhaps, contain a strong local bias.  In particular, the chairpersons of boards of management should be based locally.  In some cases in Wexford, the chairpersons of boards of management were based in Donegal or Dublin.  They were certainly based outside the mainstream of educational provision in the county.  Will the Tánaiste give serious consideration to the composition of boards of management?  I urge her to ensure that at least the chairpersons of these boards should be based locally and should have a direct involvement in educational provision in their areas.When she is replying to the debate, perhaps the Tánaiste will expand somewhat on the employment of unregistered teachers.  I do not have a major difficulty in this regard but when the Bill was published I was contacted by a number of qualified primary school teachers who have serious reservations in respect of this matter.  I understand from where the Minister is coming but the matter needs to be teased out further.  Perhaps it might be possible to reach some form of agreement with the INTO in respect of how we might deal with this issue.  This is a problem which must be tackled, although it must be remembered that there are not as many unregistered teachers as previously.I accept that there is a bone of contention regarding the practice of retired teachers re-entering the system to cover holiday periods, substitute for those who are on sick leave, and so on.  This type of thing is happening at a time when fully qualified teachers cannot obtain employment.  This is an extremely sensitive issue.I welcome the Bill but I have a number of reservations about it.  Perhaps the Tánaiste might consider introducing some changes on Committee Stage.  I am sure some of the positive ideas that have been put forward by Members on all sides will be taken on board and that, ultimately, we will be left with strong legislation that will cater for the changes that are required in the area of primary education provision.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	497	I thank Deputy Browne for sharing time.  I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution to the debate on the Education (Amendment) Bill 2010.  The first sentence in the memorandum states that the VEC will get additional powers in the Bill, which I welcome.  This is a model of patronage for schools at primary level and its introduction is to be welcomed.  Patronage has been debated for many years and I have always wondered about the role of the VECs in this area.  It is clearly a very local patronage and to have involvement with the VEC in any county is important.  I have often felt that we should deal with local vocational education committees in the primary school system rather than continuously dealing with officials in Tullamore with regard to buildings, Athlone for teaching positions or the Department of Education and Skills on Marlborough Street.  This is a welcome development.Patronage is not the only issue arising for boards of management.  As somebody with experience on the board of management in my local school of Castleblakeney, I would say many other issues arise regarding the upkeep of a school.  We welcome that there has been much money spent in refurbishing schools and carrying out extensions.  Deputy Connaughton and I would advocate new schools in places like Aughrim and Cahergal near Tuam, and that would be a major concern for boards of management in schools alongside the patronage issue.It is interesting that religious orders were not always the patrons of schools and chairpersons of boards of management.  Many lay persons through the years have been equally as good as local parish priests or the curate, who would normally be chairpersons of the boards of management in schools.An interesting question arises with regard to school inspections.  It is my understanding that the school inspection is a very important part of primary school involvement, with an inspection involving an inspector being in a school for a full week, perhaps, rather than a single day, as has been the case in the past.  It would involve an inspector meeting the board of management before an inspection and after the week's work.  I wonder how the VEC would work in such a role, taking into account whether the entire committee would be involved or a small section, or if it would be involved at all in the inspection.Many issues have raised the concern about young teachers looking for teaching positions.  Given that this Government has committed to 500 extra primary teachers over two years, it is an interesting question that should be teased out.  There cannot be a chicken and egg scenario where a young teacher is told that if he or she has no experience, he or she cannot have a job.  Teachers must start somewhere but in many cases schools seek teachers with experience.  Where will teachers gain experience if they cannot get even temporary teaching work in the schools?The Department of Education and Skills decides at primary level how many teachers to have in the primary system.  Somebody going to a teacher training college is looking to qualify, although we also have the Hibernia College system, which is an excellent course and a good way to train to be a teacher.  It is very different at secondary level, as people do a primary degree and if somebody does a bachelor of arts or a bachelor of commerce, we do not know if they will proceed to teaching as there are other opportunities in journalism, commerce and business.  We cannot estimate the number of people who will look for jobs at secondary level as a result.  The numbers at primary level are clearer.  People have mentioned teachers who retired in recent years but the vacancies still do not exist for the young teachers from the teacher training colleges.I am a member of the INTO so I declare an interest in the following issue.  That union has raised the matter of unregistered teachers who work in exceptional and limited circumstances.  Those in the teaching profession have asked if this would happen in any other profession, such as the legal or medical spheres, and I hope the Minister will reply to that query.  I remember some years ago it was difficult to get teachers to go to islands, for example, and it was sometimes difficult to get teachers in disadvantaged areas or the Gaeltacht.  There was a suggestion that extra pay or a bonus could be given to teachers in those cases.  I can see how the Minister refers to exceptional and limited circumstances but from the teaching and union perspective, the view is different.There are issues relating to speech therapy.  One of the most interesting parts of the Bill concerns the miscellaneous amendments.  Speech therapy services and other health and personal services will be transferred to the HSE as a result.  This should be clarified as we, as public representatives, have been wondering where the contact point is for speech therapy, physiotherapy, occupational therapy and the dental services mentioned by other speakers.  It is important that these issues be clarified.I mentioned the HSE and there was a question in the past about the abolition of health boards.  We are now to reduce the number of VECs but there is concern that when the HSE was established, apart from some CEOs, nobody seemed to lose a job.  More people were employed at the end of the day and questions on the same issue are now being asked about VECs.  How will the savings referred to by the McCarthy report be achieved?Before dealing with such matters, we should at least clarify that contact points exist for the health services, which are already very aligned to primary education.  The health services operate in very close co-operation with teachers, with doctors or nurses visiting schools and a dental programme is in operation.  It is very important that young children with health difficulties are identified at a very early stage, and it is important that the HSE and the Department work together.I hope the Bill, although limited in its amendments, will allow us proceed to a wider type of patronage.  There is certainly a very strong feeling among people that there should be more options and we are living in a different age than before.  There are gaelscoileanna and Educate Together schools, along with multi-education units.  We must also think about those who are often described as the "new Irish" and the provision of different language programmes for those who are newly arrived in the country.  We must work closely with a view to improving services.  The work we are doing in the Oireachtas, in tandem with the Department of Education and Skills, is important.  It is vital that teachers are registered with the Teaching Council so that people are qualified to deal with these various issues.  I hope the few questions I have raised will be taken on board by the Minister and she might be able to reply to them.The VECs will be reduced from 33 to 16, which is even more than what was sought in the McCarthy report.  People might envisage savings to be made in this but I am prepared to wait and see.  In Galway, I worked closely with the county VEC for which I have high regard.  Now that Galway county and city will have one committee, I hope public representatives, particularly, will still be represented on it.

I welcome any development of VEC involvement in the provision of primary education, as I have always been an advocate of the VEC's achievements in second level education.  The ethos and diversity they brought to this sector will now serve many communities well in the provision of primary school education.Some years ago the VECs got a bad press.  Thirty years ago this was a different country.  If it were not for the presence of the VECs, many men and women would be in far less favoured positions than they are now.  The VECs gave many across the country the ability to secure employment and make a good living for themselves.In a debate some months ago on an education motion, I was amazed at the common ground held by all Members on all sides of the House, between liberals and conservatives, young and the not-so-young.  All Members will agree no matter what education system we have, it must be parent and child-centred.Neither do I have a hang-up with who is the patron of the school.  Some people, particularly in the national press, give the impression that if the Roman Catholic Church could be got out of school patronage, that is 92% of all schools, the effect would be good for the country.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  I accept that swathes of people have gone away from organised religion and do not attend mass, a matter which is entirely their business.  On the other hand, they would still like their children to be educated locally at a Catholic school.  There will never be a question of throwing out the baby with the bath water in this regard.  However, the House must also ensure those who may wish to have their children educated at another denominational or non-denominational school have all facilities and an even playing pitch provided to them.This Bill is the first step towards achieving this.  While only a few VECs are already involved in primary school education, for many years there have been calls for more VEC involvement in the area.  I am delighted the Government has decided to introduce it through this legislation.  The education system must be parent and pupil centred.  The gaelscoileanna and Educate Together schools have made great strides in education provision over several years, largely due to the fervour of their campaigners.  Some of the most remarkable feats I have seen to get schools off the ground have been done voluntarily by these groups.  In Galway, I recall some of the gaelscoileanna starting in buildings no better than sheds.  Now these very same schools have some of the best facilities.  The VECs' track record in second level education means there should be no doubt about the implementation of this Bill's provisions.A primary school is a place of learning at which people entrust their children with a regime and hope that, as an extension of the home, they will be well looked after and their capabilities fully recognised and realised.  It is one thing for a second level school to announce 20 of its students got 600 points in the leaving certificate.  While I accept every school should aspire to academic excellence, those at the bottom with 300 points must also have realised their ultimate capabilities so they can move on to the appropriate next step in their education.  The VECs have been remarkably good at adult learning and making the connection for their students with institutes of technology.  Many thousands of people have jobs today who probably would not have made it if not for their experience with the VEC under one guise or another.On the boards of management of schools — the ones I know best are those of Catholic schools —  we all owe a great debt of gratitude to those people who work for nothing.  When something goes wrong they are the baddies in the parish even though they have almost nothing to do with what has happened. It is a remarkable responsibility, even more so when there is trouble in school.  If for some strange reason they were written out of the text in the morning who would replace them?  Would we be able to get somebody to do it for nothing?  A large number of things need to be discussed at this stage.  There is a need for an overall policy on this.  It is becoming a huge jigsaw.  There will be many stakeholders involved and I am not sure that this or any other Government until now had a real handle on where we are going next, given the shift in population and all the things that go with it.  There is a huge need to examine the issue.In the few minutes I have at my disposal, I want to discuss the switch in the Bill which gives responsibility for speech and language services to the HSE and removes any existing Department of Education and Skills responsibility for it.  I am totally against this provision.  It is wrong.  Who is more likely to identify a child with a problem at national school level than a teacher who has been standing in front of him or her since the day he or she arrived in at the age of four?  If the teacher is not able to identify what is going on at that stage, who can?  There are only three people who are hugely important at that stage of a child's life, the child's parents and the teachers that teach him or her from day one.I am not an educationalist but I have seen a great deal of education.  Many things are not picked up even with the sort of connection the teacher has with a child from day one in junior infants and throughout school.  If a teacher, for whatever reason, did not have a connection with the HSE who would do the connecting?  The connectivity would be gone.  Even with the switch-over if the facilities in future are not better than those we have now it will not be good enough.  The Minister of State is a lively local politician and knows that there is not a day in the week where we do not beg the HSE to give the all important few hours for speech therapy to ensure that at the particular stage in the child's life when it is needed it will be worth a great deal when he or she enters adulthood and faces what lies ahead in the big bad world.There are a few things I like in the Bill but there are a few things I cannot understand and I hope the Minister will explain the rationale behind them to me.  A large number of teachers tell me every year that they send out 60 or 100 copies of their curriculum vitae and never got an answer.  This has happened across several counties and all over Ireland.  The Bill contains a provision that people who do not have the same qualifications, or any qualifications as teachers, as far as I am aware, can get a part-time job or stand in in a school. I cannot understand why that would be enshrined in legislation.I fully appreciate that there are occasions when a principal receives a phone call from a teacher who was struck down on a Monday morning and cannot not come into work.  That principal is then required to find a teacher to take charge of the class.  We now have better IT systems and methods of identification of teachers more of whom are unemployed, and the Minister should take another look at the situation.  This provision would engender a great deal of anger in many people I know who could not get a job this year.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	501	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  It is important for many areas of the country.  I am well aware of the expansion in housing in the greater Dublin area and other places where no schools exist and new schools are wanted.  As the Minister said, in some areas there is no link with any church or structures and there is clearly a need for a new system which will cover such areas.  The VECs are well placed to take control of that issue in the context suggested by the Minister in the Bill.It is not a major issue in a constituency such as Cavan-Monaghan where churches on all sides still have a major interest in schools and most of them have independent parent-led committees that do a great deal of work in the running of the schools, along with the teachers, or fundraising where it is needed.  Many smaller schools have been fortunate enough to get devolved grants which meant that the committees run by the parents had to raise sizeable sums of money.  It was a great system and transformed many of the smaller schools. I would like the issue to be re-examined and instigated again if at all possible.The VEC schools have a proud record in my area, Cavan-Monaghan.  When I consider the great work done in recent years by the current vocational education officer, Mr. Martin O'Brien, it is fantastic.  The VEC in Monaghan has been given a lead role by the Taoiseach in a pilot scheme where it is building a new version of a college with a primary school and secondary school, both of which are gaelscoileanna, on the same site, which also has a theatre planned for it.  A site is still available for another educational authority if necessary.Mr. Martin O'Brien is the leader of the project and his ability is fantastic.  He has led the reconstruction of Beech Hill, added classrooms and sports facilities in Ballybay Community College and added significant structures and facilities in the college for sports and woodwork.  Additional land was purchased in Castleblaney for a much needed extension and he upgraded the existing building in Clones for a material technical class and woodwork.  One of the biggest areas that he has provided for is the Tanagh Outdoor Pursuits Centre for which he now has the money and which will guarantee sport and recreation for the future.  There are also new outreach centres there.This shows what can be done by a VEC.  However, there are questions over the State control of schools.  One example of that is the Model School in Monaghan, one of the few model schools in the country.  The Minister is its patron.

#MichaelWDArcy	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-party	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-dob	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	504	This is a very timely debate as we are beginning to move into autumn nights with the cold winter ahead.  We had a very good discussion a number of days ago on disconnections with the stakeholders in the industry, namely, Bord Gáis, Airtricity and the ESB.  The regulator was also present.  We were presented with options for a number of solutions, one of which is a system of paying upfront, which is being used by the ESB.  Airtricity proposes a swipe card, a little similar to a pay-as-you-go card for call credit.I would like to see the industry ensuring a level playing field between all of the companies.  At present, there seem to be different standards for different companies and the fact that we have two State companies does not mean that people should be given a free licence not to pay their electricity bill.  Some people are using the recession for debt hopping.  I made the suggestion that the regulator should get involved or find out whether it is permissible to allow information to flow from one company to another regarding any outstanding amount on a bill if somebody changes from one operator to another.  The main issue that came out of that debate was to ensure that we have in place structures to facilitate people who are unable to pay their electricity bill rather than those who choose not to pay.  We all accept that if we facilitate those who do not want to pay their bill for the wrong reasons then everybody else will end up paying more.  That would be particularly unfair.  We were told last December in the budget for 2010 that the Minister would put in place a structure to facilitate those people through a vouched system.  This has not happened and this is wrong.Another matter with regard to disconnection and reconnection is the charge involved which comes in at approximately €400, including VAT.  The Government is getting its slice from people who are misfortunate enough to find themselves in the difficult circumstances of not being able to pay their bill.  We have to ensure these issues are resolved.The installation schemes are a big help and the ESB must be commended for providing €3 million in this regard.  Bord Gáis also operates installation schemes.  Amazingly, the Government returned €35 million to the Department from the insulation grants made available.I know I am jumping about, but I have only five minutes and I want to refer to the carbon levy.  Introducing a carbon levy at this time is madness.  We in this country have an obsession with process and we will now charge elderly people and those experiencing fuel poverty a levy to stop them using fuel which they require to remain warm.  I view this as Dickensian at the end of the first decade of the 21st century.  This is not 1810 or 1820; it is 2010 moving towards 2011.For anybody to consider forcing the ESB or Bord Gáis to spend approximately €40 million each changing their name and brand is the highest form of madness in this economic climate.  It is something to which no sane person in this Chamber could put his or her name.  I call on whoever made this decision to cop on and stop this process.  We should not waste money.  It is hard won and we will find out in the first week in December how hard that is.  Let us not waste it.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	505	I compliment my colleagues in the Labour Party on bringing this motion before the Dáil.  As a colleague of mine from Mayo, I am surprised at the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Calleary.  The Green Party element of the Government is destroying rural Ireland and is having a serious effect, particularly on elderly people.  First we had the carbon tax, followed by the PSO levy.  The Fianna Fáil Party, particularly its rural Deputies, must have gone yellow because it is allowing those in the Green Party to do this.  We all love to have a green country and to have everything green but a big price is being paid for it.  Those paying this price are the elderly, the sick and the weak.  They will have to turn off the heat and will only be able to afford to turn on their fires at certain times of the day.  This country does not have a climate which will guarantee three or four months of summer weather.  People in this country need their fire every day of the week, 52 weeks of the year, particularly during a harsh winter such as we had last year which was shocking.Is the regulator living in the real world?  I know the regulator is on €300,000 or €400,000 a year and he will not depend on the €20 a week fuel allowance.  This country is in a most serious economic crisis and he allowed the price of fuel to increase.  First of all we had the Green Party and Fianna Fáil carbon tax and then we had the PSO levy.  The price of a bale of briquettes has increased by approximately 7% and the cost of oil and fuel has increased by approximately 8% as a result of the new levies.What is wrong with the Fianna Fáil backbenchers?  Are they not going to stop the Green Party people?  Do they want people to leave the country?  The Minister announced that in the past week he increased the units with regard to the ESB.  However, the fuel allowance will have to be increased if the prices of briquettes, coal and oil have increased while people's incomes are decreasing and social welfare has been cut back.  We have to do something to protect these people.I wish to address those on the Fianna Fáil wing of the Government.  I know they have gone yellow.  The Green Party has gone green but we can no longer afford the Green Party.  People in rural Ireland cannot afford it.  The carbon tax affects rural Ireland more than urban Ireland.  It affects us because we depend on our cars.  We do not have Dublin Bus or the Luas.  The new charges on fuel are having a big effect.Elderly people have to be protected.  Fuel is essential.  If one asks older people what they want, they will answer that they want security and a bit of heat in their home.  The Government must protect the most vulnerable.  We must protect the weak and the elderly.  I say to everybody involved in formulating the budget that the fuel allowance of €20 is not enough.  We need it increased to protect the most vulnerable.  These people must be protected.The regulator has to live in the real world.  He cannot be allowed to dictate policy in economic times such as these.  It was fine two or three years ago when we thought we were awash with money.  We are not awash with money now.  That guy is making decisions but he was not elected; he was appointed by the Government.  I blame the Minister, the Government and the Taoiseach because this Government has set up quango after quango, none of which is responsible to the House.  The regulator stated that the PSO levy was necessary but it was not necessary at this time.  It has put further pressure on businesses and the elderly and this cannot continue.We must protect the most vulnerable and those who need a bit of heat.  The increased charges on fuel introduced in recent years are wrong.  Some 110,000 people are now making weekly payments to the ESB and Bord Gáis.  These people have mortgages and are in jobs and they are doing so because they cannot afford their fuel.  There is an outrageous situation in this country where people must ring up Bord Gáis and the ESB to enter into arrangements because they cannot afford to pay their fuel charges.  Something has to be done.  These people have to be protected.  I say to the green wing of Fianna Fáil not to be so yellow and to stand up for the elderly people of this country who need to be protected.

#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	507	I am very happy to have an opportunity to speak in this Private Members' debate.I, too, am very concerned at the reports of high levels of disconnection of electricity.  I saw a figure of 2,500 disconnections and many of them would be in rural areas.  I have made a case for many people who have come to me on this issue and I hope that there will be some improvement in the situation.  I appeal to the ESB to engage in more discussion with those who have difficulties paying their electricity bills.  I have seen figures for gas disconnections at the rate of 20 disconnections a day.  Those disconnections probably are mostly in the city areas.In tonight's short debate, I want to look for more investment in energy infrastructure because there has been under investment in that area for a number of years.  I was heartened when I saw funding provided for the Tuam water and sewerage scheme over a year ago that at least we were putting in gas mains and pipes along with the work that was done in the town.  In fact, the gas pipes went in with telephone lines and broadband.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, played a pivotal role in ensuring that happened.  It would not have happened without his intervention.  That is an important point on infrastructure.I am glad that there has been a fall in electricity prices in recent years and there have been falling gas prices.  I understand our prices are close to the EU average which is a positive development, but I would like more competition and more reductions in electricity prices.On the question of the PSO levy which Deputy Ring mentioned, the Government has decided to cover the full cost of the levy for households in receipt of the free electricity allowance and, obviously, that is something I very much welcome.  The energy efficiency programmes are also very important.  I would hope that we will get the funding for renewable energy.  There is a great deal of talk about it but I would like to see more action on it.  Indeed, we in the west all know the great potential for wind power.There have been many references to those who are most at risk of fuel poverty or energy poverty.  I am certainly one who will be pushing very much for an increase in the fuel allowance.  Last year there was a particularly bad winter and we needed funding for that scheme.  There are now 340,000 recipients of the fuel allowance and €231 million was provided in the period 2009-2010.  Those schemes, both the fuel allowance and the smokeless fuel scheme, were very important to them.  The household benefit package, which has been improved in recent years, is a good scheme.  There are 380,000 people in receipt of that package and the costs involved are approximately €200 million for this year.

I hope the Minister will address that aspect.I welcome the warmer home scheme and the housing adaptation scheme.  Of course, if we had more money for the retrofit programme, as I hope we will next year, we would be able to deliver for 1 million residential, public and commercial buildings in Ireland.  I welcome this debate.  I am glad of the opportunity to say my few words in it.

At the outset, I compliment the efforts of Deputy McManus, who has given us all an opportunity to speak about matters we want to raise.The Leas-Cheann Comhairle allowed my colleague, Deputy Micheál Kitt, to mention Tuam and on that basis I presume I can mention Tallaght, Templeogue, Greenhills, Firhouse, Brittas, Bohernabreena and all of the areas that I represent along with my colleagues, the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan and Deputies Pat Rabbitte and Brian Hayes.  I try to bring to these debates the points that are made to us on the doorsteps, in the supermarkets and on the streets.  People are talking about this issue and although I am on the Labour Party benches and am comfortable here for the moment, I am a Government Deputy and I will not be afraid to speak out for issues that are of concern to people.  I hope — I say this directly to the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan — that the Government will continue to honour its commitment to deliver a sustainable, secure, competitive energy supply because that is very important.Deputy Ring made a number of points.  I can never rise to the level of debate he can——

He made some sense.  Many of these issues, as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will be aware, are raised on a regular basis at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social Protection, formerly the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs, where, as far as possible, we take an all-party approach.  I believe strongly that we all can echo what he said, that the Government must continue to protect the vulnerable.Over the next 55 days we all will be lobbied by all sorts of groups.  Even today, if one looked around the corridors, there were several groups in lobbying.  The USI students were across the road, and the Carer's Association and a number of other groups were here in Leinster House.  Everybody has a point of view to express to all the Government Deputies and to all the Opposition spokespersons and Deputies as to what should be done on 7 December and, indeed, beyond, and it is important that we would take that into account.  Certainly, I have no hesitation in saying that I have always believed — it is where I have come from politically — that the Government, irrespective of who is in power, must continue to protect the most vulnerable.I made the point at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social Protection meeting this morning that we are dealing not only with people who were traditionally in that situation, but with people who now constitute a new poor who find themselves having to seek assistance in a way they never did previously, and it is important that we would support them in every way.The committee I mentioned has taken on board a number of issues in recent times.  We demanded and sought assurance from the energy suppliers on disconnections, and I noted that other Deputies mentioned this.  We must be careful to note the distinction between those families who cannot pay and those who will not pay, but there are families that are struggling and are challenged.  This t is the same in every constituency, not only in the Dublin region, and not only where I live, work and represent.  People are finding it difficult.Some of the companies' policies on disconnections and associated issues need to be questioned.  They have claimed to the committee that they are looking at this in a caring way, but there is evidence available to all of us that sometimes they act in a way they should not, and I believe there is a responsibility on us to speak out in that regard.  The Government should protect those people and as far as possible ensure that disconnection is a last resort.The Society of St. Vincent de Paul, for example, which we all know in every one of our communities, also made the point at the committee that a level of acceptance will have to be reached by the companies and they will have to, as I stated, try to work with those families who are in difficulties.The key message we must put out is that customers should contact their suppliers in every case to make arrangements before it gets to the point where they are forced to disconnect, and I would hope that they would do so.I also take this opportunity to wish my constituency colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, well in his brief.  I will not rise to all of this stuff about bashing the Greens.  As far as I am concerned, the Minister, Deputy Ryan, has done good work.  I have heard Members from the Opposition benches say that.  I would like to wish him well also.  I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for his forbearance.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	513	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  It is always difficult to speak in the House having heard the eloquence and colour of Deputy Ring.  It is always interesting to hear his point of view but it must be difficult for the leader of his party to listen to him and still bring some coherence to the policy, presentations and matters which his party seeks to advance when we hear the tribalism and playing to the local gallery in which Deputy Ring engages.  Unfortunately, he has painted a rather negative picture of the Government's approach but I argue it has been one of forward thinking.Like Deputy O'Connor, I would be very much of the point of view that one tries to protect the most vulnerable and one does so at all costs and on all occasions.  In doing so, one must identify the most vulnerable and that is probably the most difficult thing to try to establish in the current environment.  The groups in society who were vulnerable in the past are no longer vulnerable in comparison to those who have suffered most as a result of the downturn.  There is little doubt of the necessity to keep a home warm; providing for one's family in that regard is an absolute requirement and the State must ensure that is possible.One cannot be blind to the approach the Minister has taken in encouraging people to better insulate their homes under the warmer homes scheme, which has been successful.  I spoke to a contractor recently who told me the number of homes to which his business had carried out external cladding, which is suitable for insulating older houses, the walls of which are not suitable to pump with insulation beads and in which houses the normal type of insulation common in many other homes is not suitable.  The advances that are being made in this area are truly the way forward.This approach is about ensuring that we do not continue to consume a resource with a finite existence.  We need to promote that idea in a way that grips people's imagination and attention, rather than relying on the old adage that it is the Government's duty to effectively ensure that everybody's home is heated through the conventional methodology.  We must examine the alternatives.  In the current tight financial constraints in which we find ourselves, we must be smart about how we spend money in this area while the underlying policy must be to protect those who are vulnerable and need our assistance.  However, the only way to do so does not have to be a direct payment on a weekly basis.  If we can assist people with some capital moneys to ensure that their long-term requirements are significantly less than they were heretofore, then that is the way forward.We must also invest significantly in the security of our energy supply.  I am disappointed Deputy Ring did not make greater play of the characteristics of his county, particularly in regard to the harnessing of wind and the development of the generation of electricity through wave and tidal power.  Much of this technology is at an embryonic stage but it is at a stage where Ireland can be a world leader.  If we invest money in research and development in this area, we can provide for the future.If Deputy Ring and others suggest that being in government is all about nearsightedness and looking in on oneself rather than having a policy platform or an agenda for the future, they need to reprogramme their thinking before they face the electorate whenever that be.  The approach being taken requires a much broader level of thinking and a much better understanding of what the future holds, recognising that carbon fuels are finite resources, whether they are used to provide heat or generate electricity.The Government has grappled with, mastered and effectively controlled a twin-track approach in this area while keeping a focus on those who are vulnerable, where they are at and who are the emerging vulnerability groups.
#ThomasByrne	unknown-#ThomasByrne-party	unknown-#ThomasByrne-dob	unknown-#ThomasByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	514	I am delighted to have this opportunity to take part in this debate on a Private Members' motion on electricity, energy and fuel, broadly amended by the Government.  I am glad that the Labour Party tabled the motion but I am more glad that the Government has amended it to reflect the reality of the good work that has been undertaken by agencies on behalf of the State.Perhaps the Labour Party has selective memory or perhaps its elected representatives are not aware of the good work that has been and is being done across the country under the warmer homes scheme.  I am astounded that it failed to mention it in its motion.  Then again it is always easier for the Labour Party to complain and be against everything than to be constructive or for something.It is on the topic of this scheme that I wish to spend most of my allotted time, as it is one that works and one that is of great benefit to my constituents in Meath East.  The warmer homes scheme was set up by the Government to systematically address the poor heat efficiency performance of low income housing.  The scheme provides attic insulation, draught proofing, lagging jackets, energy efficient lighting, cavity wall insulation, energy advice and, in some cases, even new central heating systems.  Many people are surprised to learned that central heating is provided under this scheme in certain circumstances.The scheme is targeted at householders who are in receipt of the fuel allowance under a scheme operated by the Department of Social Protection.  In addition to the works carried out under the scheme, information is also provided to the householder on energy awareness.  We know of many examples of how this scheme benefits people.  We had a discussion on fuel poverty at a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Social Protection and I battled to have the warmer homes scheme discussed.  We were given the figures for the reduction in energy bills that results from works under this scheme.  I have seen people across my constituency overjoyed with the work carried to their houses under this scheme and with the difference it makes.  As the winter approaches, the number of telephone calls to my office about this scheme have increased and interest in it is peaking as we approach the colder months.  Some 99% of people are extremely satisfied with the work under the scheme and if an issue arises, it is easy to get the contractor to come back to deal with it.  By the end of this year more than 22,500 homes will have benefited from the scheme.  It is making the lives of constituents better on a real basis and it demonstrates the commitment of the Government to tackling fuel poverty, not just by way of a handout but by way of reducing energy bills for individuals and for the State and creating employment among the contractors who carry out these works.  Constituents in Kells, Ashbourne, Duleek, Navan, Drumconrath and places like that have all received a fantastic service under this scheme and they will see considerable reductions in their heating bills this winter.  Ultimately, they will have a better quality of life.Members of the Carers Association were in the precincts of this House today to present the association's pre-budget submission.  Carers and the people they look after are often some of the people most in need of ensuring they have fuel efficiency.  Some of them have the highest fuel and heating bills in the country.  The warmer homes scheme directly addresses some of the issues affecting this crucially important sector of society.I hope that in the next budget the Government can increase the allocation for the warmer homes scheme and progress further with the national retrofitting programme.  Not only does it reduce fuel poverty, it increases local employment opportunities for people who otherwise might be out of work.  Perhaps the scheme's eligibility criteria could be expanded.  It has to have some kind of a test and the test is whether one qualifies for the fuel allowance but, unfortunately, that excludes people in receipt of jobseeker's allowance or jobseeker's benefit.  It would be worthwhile to have those groups included because they face substantial heating bills.  While this would cost additional moneys it would no doubt be recouped through PAYE and PRSI paid by the contractors carrying out those works.  The scheme serves the twin purpose of reducing fuel poverty and increasing local employment.  Anyone who is not aware of the scheme, is in receipt of the fuel allowance and wants to find out if they would be eligible to have works carried out under this scheme will get a positive answer from the Government that this Government is prepared to improve their homes, the fuel and heat efficiency and, ultimately, reduce their bills by the most effective means possible.

#PeterKellyFF	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-party	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-dob	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	516	Will the Leas-Ceann Comhairle the Minister?The Government has introduced a wide range of comprehensive actions aimed at delivering a secure, sustainable and competitive energy supply.  The Minister outlined these actions in some detail last night.  However, I will touch on some of them this evening.I will first examine the issue of pricing.  We must keep our electricity and gas costs down.  The fact remains that Government policies, along with falling natural gas prices, have led to significant reductions in electricity prices.   In some cases, prices are below the European Union and eurozone average for both domestic and business customers.  Given that the Minister cited statistics from EUROSTAT when he spoke on this issue at length last night, I will not repeat his figures.One of the reasons for the improvement in prices has been the opening of the energy market.  A host of suppliers offers a range of products to different segments of the market and significant discounts are available to domestic and business users who switch suppliers.  Immediate discounts can be as high as 14%.  Competition is the way forward and in that respect and I welcome the opening of the market.At all times the Government has remained committed to protecting those who are most at risk of energy poverty.  We are in the process of producing a comprehensive affordable energy strategy which will outline actions to protect vulnerable people.  When published, the strategy will significantly influence energy affordability for years to come.  As the Minister stated last night, while it has taken longer than expected to bring the strategy to Government, it is important that we get it right.  After all, it will influence our approach to energy affordability for years to come.Recognising the difficulties that can arise from fuel poverty, the Government provides various supports to low income households.  The warmer homes scheme, for example, has helped community based organisations and private sector contractors to provide nearly 51,000 energy efficiency improvements in low income households over the past nine years.  This year alone we spent close to €30 million on energy efficiency in vulnerable homes.  I compliment and congratulate the staff working on the warmer homes scheme in County Longford on the magnificent job they have done.  They are pleasant and courteous and have visited homes at short notice and strive to help people to the best of their ability.A further 380,000 people are in receipt of either the free electricity or free gas allowance under the household benefits package.  The Minister for Social Protection recently announced that this scheme will also cover the cost of the PSO levy.  In addition, 340,000 customers receive fuel allowance payments of €20 per week to help with home heating costs for 32 weeks from September to the end of April.  More than 20% of domestic electricity customers are in receipt of some form of direct financial support for their energy costs through the Department of Social Protection.On the issue of disconnections, I favour the use of pre-pay meters.  I compliment the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service in my constituency on the great work they are doing.  While some people support the Commission for Energy Regulation's proposal to rebrand Bord Gáis, I cannot justify or support such a rebranding if it will cost money.I share the concern expressed by many people at recent newspaper headlines concerning an increase in the number of disconnections.  I was somewhat heartened to learn, however, that all suppliers are required to put in place codes of practice setting out the steps that must be taken before initiating a disconnection.  Protections are also in place for vulnerable customers to prevent electricity suppliers from disconnecting elderly customers in the winter months.  I appeal to the Commission for Energy Regulation, as a matter of urgency, to bring together the various stakeholders and publish a review of disconnections shortly.  I await the commission's document with interest.If we have learned anything this evening, it is that criticisms of the Government's energy policies do not stand up to scrutiny.

Is í fadhb an bhochtanais breosla ceann de na fadhbanna is mó lena bhfuil mé ag plé mar Aire Coimirce Sóisialaí.  Is ceist an-chasta í, ar ndóigh, os rud é go gcaitheann go leor daoine go leor airgid ar teas ach go dtéann an teas sin amú orthu.  Creidim go bhfuil fíor-thábhacht ag baint le déanamh cinnte de go bhfuil tithe te teolaí ag daoine  — a dtithe féin nó tithe atá ar cíos acu.  Cé go bhfuil go leor oibre ar bun faoin warmer homes scheme, creidim go bhfuil sé thar a bheith tábhachtach dlús a chur leis an obair sin, go mórmhór trí na scéimeanna fostaíochta atá faoi chúram mo Roinne.  Tá sé i gceist agam díriú isteach ar an obair sin.  Chuige sin, bhí cruinniú agam le gairid leis an Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, féachaint an féidir tuilleadh oibre a dhéanamh maidir le tithe nach bhfuil clúdaithe ag an warmer homes scheme.While I am pleased to have an opportunity to say a few words on fuel poverty, I will not be able to do justice to the issue in the five minutes available to me.  I will briefly discuss a number of issues of concern to me.  If we want people to be warm in their homes, it is vital that we tackle the issue of energy efficiency.  I recently had a meeting with officials from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland to discuss using increased numbers of scheme places to do extra work on the warmer home schemes through voluntary bodies.  The schemes are operating very successfully in some areas, while in others the SEAI has private companies doing the work, which is also fine.  In other places, however, adequately trained people are not available to do the work required under the scheme.I also discussed with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland the need to continue to increase the quality and sophistication of the work.  While this work is being done correctly, it is reasonably basic.

As Deputies are no doubt aware, a high percentage of rented accommodation, especially that rented by those on low incomes, is paid for indirectly through the rental subsidy scheme.  In conjunction with the Private Residential Tenancies Board and my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, I have been examining whether it is possible to ensure that people who rent accommodation could be sure of the BER rating of their accommodation.To cite an example, 2% of owner occupied households versus 14% of accommodation rented below the market rate and local authority rent-free households reported that their accommodation was not comfortable in the winter.  Similarly, 2% of those residing in detached houses versus 9% of those residing in apartments, bed-sits and flats reported that their accommodation was not comfortable or warm in the winter.In addition to the warmer homes scheme, which is of great importance and in which my Department can play a central role, it will be necessary, through the rent allowance scheme, to address the issue of rented accommodation because all the evidence points to the effect that those in rented accommodation are suffering grievously from fuel poverty, despite being in receipt of the free fuel scheme.  A large body of work remains to be done in this area and I will direct my attention towards this phenomenon in the coming months to try to ensure that this specific highly vulnerable group is dealt with.Every statistic available to me shows that one parent families are the most vulnerable cohort in society.  All the poverty statistics, when done analytically, including those on fuel poverty, show that this group always comes out on top in terms of deprivation.  I will focus my attention on ensuring that this particular cohort is not left behind when fuel poverty is being addressed.

#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	529	No Member on either side of this House is unaware of the problems emanating from such a high percentage of family homes at present.  I have listened to Members refer to the warmer homes scheme and I agree that the number of people in towns in south County Kildare such as Athy, Newbridge or Kildare who have installed a system is highly positive.  A drawback to the scheme is that many people who have a small pension, etc., do not qualify for the fuel allowance scheme and consequently do not qualify for this grant.  This is to the scheme's detriment because it is doing such good work in making provision for families.  However, someone with a small post office pension or small occupational pension and who did not qualify for the fuel allowance scheme does not qualify for this scheme.  Consequently, those who wish to avail of the grant must make down payments.  Hopefully this will be addressed.In his contribution, the Minister for Social Protection spoke of one-parent families and the major problems they encounter in life when trying to provide for their loved ones in the present economic climate.  This is one sector of the community that requires assistance at present.  Moreover, according to the stories recounted by the director of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, such problems can emanate right down to local branches of that society nationwide and each branch has its back to the wall when trying to provide for vulnerable people within their respective communities.  We have learned of the energy regulator's proposal to make people pay their energy bills by imposing a reconnection fee of €200.  Who will pay that €200?  This is the amazing thing about regulators and their wonderful flair for developing theories in their own mind.  Such reconnection fees will be paid for by either the Society of St. Vincent de Paul or a community welfare officer and in the case of the latter, it will come from State funding.  These families will be put through the mill while trying to get that €200 to ensure there is light and heat in the house and that something will be ready for the kids when they come home from school.  While the regulator has been wonderful in his assessment of what he has done to ensure they will suffer, it will be the kids in those families who will suffer and not the regulator in his big high office.In the context of the difficulties arising from our present economic difficulties, I refer to the insistence by the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, that Bord Gáis and the ESB must spend €80 million to rebrand and rename themselves.  When one considers what could be done with such an amount for one-parent families and senior citizens with regard to the matter under discussion, it is a sacrilege that the energy regulator should be allowed to get away with this proposal.  I appeal to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to invite representatives of the commission before it.  They should be put through the mill to explain why this should happen at a time when the energy regulator is making families suffer because they are unable to meet the reconnection payment requirements.  The children of those families will suffer because of the fine — which is the only way one can describe this fee — of €200 being imposed on families to be reconnected to gas or electricity supplies.I note that a statement regarding Bord Gáis talks about how 59% of the households being disconnected are in private estates.  However, that figure is not relevant because many local authority estates are not connected to the gas lines.  It is merely a figure Bord Gáis came up with itself.  Only Members of this House are familiar with the hardship being experienced by families nationwide while trying to ensure there is heat and electricity in the house.  Consequently, Members should stand up and be counted in opposition to the expenditure the regulator is imposing on every family in this country both to rebrand the ESB and Bord Gáis and in respect of the proposed fine to have one's electricity or gas supply reconnected.  The aforementioned joint committee should invite representatives of the CER before it and should ensure that these two matters will be addressed in order that funding and facilities will be made available to families to ensure they will not be scapegoated by the energy regulator's high-flying ideas.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	530	I am disappointed by the response thus far from Ministers to this debate.  In particular, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Ó Cuív, spoke a few minutes ago and went off on all kinds of tangents but did not address the central importance of the issue raised in the motion tabled by Deputy McManus on behalf of the Labour Party.  Although the Government clearly promised that a vouched fuel allowance scheme and a strategy would be put in place, no one appears to be taking this matter seriously or giving it the sense of urgency it truly needs.  Deputy Wall is correct to note that public representatives know what this issue is about.  This is about people who are afraid their kids will not have heat, light or electricity in their homes.  All Members have encountered such people and I was particularly struck by a man with three kids who had been made redundant fairly recently.  He was so worried about the prospect of being disconnected that he approached me and pleaded with me to make contact with the ESB to ensure he would not be cut off.  This mirrors the experience of many Members.When bills build up, people approach community welfare officers or the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  In some cases, they already will have received help for something else and therefore help may not be forthcoming in this particular instance.  They are terrified that they will put their children into a position of going into the winter without heat, light or cooking facilities.  This is the reality that exists at present and knowing this, the Government should be acting with a sense of urgency about these issues.  It should be dealing with them and responding to the commitments it has made, instead of putting them on the long finger or going off on tangents, as did the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Ó Cuív.In her contribution last night, Deputy McManus noted that Bord Gáis conducted a survey of a sample of 500 disconnected households, of which 59% were owner-occupiers.  Therefore, this does not simply pertain to one small category or section of society with which somehow, someone else must deal.  This pertains to people right across the divide who are truly worried about their position.  Another particularly striking statistic cited by Deputy McManus is that for Bord Gáis, debt management problems have multiplied by a factor of 40 over the past year.  This is the stark reality for those people who now face this problem, and for their families.Another issue that many Members have raised is the crazy initiative proposed by the energy regulator.  While I do not know who regulates the regulator, the idea that €80 million will be spent on rebranding Bord Gáis Éireann and the ESB is absolute madness in the current economic climate.  Someone should tell the regulator that the country simply cannot afford it.  I assume the Government is in charge of the country and can do this.  As for the reconnection fee, a person who cannot afford to pay his or her bills certainly cannot afford an additional €200 to be reconnected and we should follow the example of Britain in this regard and abolish reconnection fees.  This fee has also been imposed by the regulator and it must be abolished immediately.In the time that remains to me, I wish to address a particular issue to which the motion tabled by the Labour Party refers.  It pertains to a national retrofit programme to public buildings, including schools and hospitals, to bring unemployed construction workers into the workforce and enable apprentices to complete their apprenticeships in line with Government commitments for a 33% energy saving across the public sector by 2020.  Such a proposal makes sense as homes are already being retrofitted and grants are being provided for such work.Many of our public buildings, including buildings in which children and sick people spend a great deal of their time, need that type of attention.  Such an initiative would also provide employment at local level.  I have in mind in particular some of the older hospitals and nursing homes, both public and private.  We have seen public nursing homes under threat of closure because of the physical condition of the building and the difficulty of complying with HIQA regulations.  This would be a perfect programme for older community nursing homes which are greatly appreciated by their local community and against whose closure people are protesting throughout the State.  The scheme might also be suitable for private nursing homes which are based in large old houses.  Those nursing homes are often closest to their own communities because they may have been developed by local families rather than by a conglomerate which operates private nursing homes throughout the country.  This is a positive proposal for the sick, elderly, children and the large numbers of unemployed.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	531	I thank Deputy McManus for introducing this timely and thoughtful motion.  Nobody can argue with the desirability of retrofitting; of course it should be done.  The difficulty is that the insulation should have been undertaken when the houses were built.  Record numbers of houses were constructed in this State with virtually no insulation.  People can hear their next-door neighbour turning on the kettle, assuming the neighbour still has an electricity connection.  The lack of regulation in regard to insulation was another scandal this Government allowed to happen.The chairman of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, Mr. Brendan Halligan, told the Oireachtas Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security that it costs €20,000 to retrofit a standard house, including the condenser boiler, attic, walls, new windows, flooring and so on.  Who in this age has €20,000 to retrofit their home?  It is pie in the sky thinking unless the Government is willing to provide reasonable grant aid.  Such a scheme would also create employment.I do not normally stand up in this House and kick any particular party.  One's politics are one's politics and we all must stand up for what we believe.  However, the Green Party has no concept of poverty.  Its Members have never been there and never will be there.  If one questions party Members, one is subjected to a lecture about how we must save the world.  A person sitting at home in the dark and cold with three small children is bound to conclude that the world can take care of itself because he or she is having difficulty enough taking care of his or her family.  That is what people are facing into this winter.Three years ago a friend of mine built a large new house.  She was delighted with her new home but shocked to discover that her electricity bill was double what it had been in her previous house.  Her larger home included a lot more lights.  I wish to share a story I used to tell my children.  The story is funny in itself but I used to tell it on the basis of my conviction that the times it depicted would never come around again.  It involves a neighbour of my mother, a woman with six children, whose husband was in England working to support his family at a time when work was also scarce in England.  Hearing a knock on the door one night she opened it to discover a man dripping wet in the rain that was dancing off the ground.  Being a very kind person, she invited him inside.  When he asked for a chair she hurried to the kitchen to fetch one, afraid he might faint.  The man stood on the chair and cut off her electricity.  When I asked her what she had done she responded that in those days there was nothing one could do.  I told her that if it were me, he would have been hanging off two bare wires, as wet as he was.

As children, we could tell walking up the street the families whose electricity had been cut off.  Those houses would be in darkness or lit by a few candles.The regulator acts on instructions from the Government; he is not a free agent.  He tells us he is imposing a 5% surcharge on fuel even though people cannot pay their bills as it is.  The regulator has also stipulated that the two main energy suppliers must rebrand their businesses.  ESB is the most recognised brand in the country, a brand that is recognised internationally as a state-of-the-art quality company.  The regulator is living in 2006 and needs to be told, "Honey, that ain't happening" because we cannot afford it.Whatever else we do with the proposed €80 million, it will not be rebranding.  We should begin investing it in fuel poverty which is a particular issue for the elderly, people with young children and the many unemployed who have never experienced times like these and who do not know what it is to walk down a street and see every house in darkness.  Moreover, in the past people did not have a television in every room and mobile telephones to plug in every night.  We cannot live without electricity in this day and age.  We cannot live without heating because our homes are not sufficiently insulated.  We are living on an island off Europe where it gets cold and it is damp.  The Government is a disgrace.  It must begin to give consideration to those for whom it is responsible, the poor and the newly poor.  The Green Party will never think of them because they do not know what it is to be poor.  I had hoped to say different of Fianna Fáil.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	534	I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak in support of this motion on fuel poverty which was introduced by my colleague, Deputy McManus, on behalf of the Labour Party yesterday.  I thank Deputy McManus for her well thought out and provocative contribution.  Every percentage increase in electricity and fuel prices for consumers, whether domestic consumers or SMEs, imposes a further burden upon sectors that are already fighting hard to make ends meet.In response to the hidden crisis of fuel poverty the Government must be proactive in implementing the policies and promises to which it has committed.  It is particularly striking that it has failed to date to publish a fuel strategy.  This is somewhat mind boggling in the context of the introduction of a carbon levy alongside a marked failure to protect the many people put at risk by the imposition of that levy.  I appeal to the Government to act cohesively and consensually in this respect.  It must increase the fuel allowance to compensate those affected.  We need a comprehensive strategy to deal with fuel poverty.  The Labour Party was ahead of the curve in 2008 when we published the Fuel Poverty and Energy Conservation Bill.  The Government should examine that legislation in line with its talk of consensus.  We must have a concerted effort to ensure all households will be able to heat and power their homes during the winter period at least.The difficulty many people are experiencing in discharging utility bills to the ESB, Bord Gáis and others is an increasing problem in the current straitened climate.  It is important that new payment plans are made available to customers who are struggling to meet their commitments.  Utility companies must be facilitative of and responsive to customers who find themselves in trouble.  How can the reconnection fee have been set by the regulator at €200?  These people cannot be expected to meet that payment when they could not afford to pay their regular utility bills.I support Deputy McManus's call for a zero reconnection policy in order to arrive at fees that are more reasonable and manageable.  I have spoken to a constituent of mine who was in personal difficulty and who fell behind with ESB payments.  Somebody called out and explained the difficulty.However, an €80 call-out charge was imposed.  This person does not take things sitting down.  He fought the matter tooth and nail and the charge was eventually waived, but he was disgusted that anyone would contemplate imposing an €80 call-out charge.The plan by the Commissioner for Energy Regulation to insist on the re-branding of Bord Gáis and the ESB at a potential cost of €40 million, which will ultimately be borne by the consumer, must be scrapped.  It is ludicrous, especially in the current economic environment and when the brands are already well established.I and the Labour Party have always supported a national retrofit programme.  We were the first party to initiate this proposal.  Payment plans will ensure participation from all sections of society and not just from those with disposable income.  Deputy McManus has emphasised this and it is alluded to in the terms of the motion.  This is important in view of the need to curb climate change.  The world is in transition and a low carbon society can only be achieved by a massive reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.  We are approaching the end of the oil era and of energy inefficiency.  The shift from the brown to a green economy is well under way.We know the formula for a low carbon society is threefold: improving energy efficiency; switching power generation from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources; and electrification of all surface transport.  We must have a plan for the next 40 years.  This is important in the context of employment.I cannot understand why the Government was so reluctant to bring forward a stimulus package that would have created a number of jobs, particularly in this area.  A retrofit programme would facilitate many people finishing apprenticeships.  This is a high labour intensive industry.  Many apprentices are just one year short of finishing their courses.  All existing houses will have to be retrofitted to A1 standard and that implies an increase in energy efficiency of ten to 15 times the present levels.  All new buildings will be energy positive.  Retrofitting will require the two million houses built before 1965 to be brought up to an A1 building energy rating and 200,000 commercial units will have to be brought to the same standard.The cost of retrofitting to this standard is between €20,000 and €25,000 per unit.  That is huge.  We will have to put in place an appropriate grant system that will facilitate achievement of that laudable objective.  That will involve a spend of €50 billion over the next 40 years, or €1.25 billion per year.  At present, €100 million is being spent, so we can see how far we have to go to achieve this objective.We will have to create a new industry of retrofitting.  The importance of this industry is that it is highly labour intensive and requires a significant supply chain.  It will create approximately 10,000 jobs in building and 5,000 in the supply chain.  We all assume the 1:1 ratio of direct to indirect jobs which the Government announced in its own policy last week so we could be talking about 30,000 jobs in all.  Some 30,000 jobs could be created in retrofitting commercial buildings so the programme would create between 50,000 and 60,000 jobs.  This would represent a significant benefit to the State in the form of high tax and PRSI payments into the State coffers and a decrease in social protection payments.  There would also be significant savings on the import of hydrocarbons.  It would serve as a stimulus to the economy, something the Government seems reluctant to embark upon, and would allow apprentices to complete their courses.  This would be part of a complete package.

The motion deals with the harsh realities of people's lives in the middle of a recession.  We are in the cold winter of a recession, and we are coming into the seasonal winter and facing a number of budgets where this situation will be aggravated.People are not able to heat their homes.  Their electricity and gas supplies are being disconnected.  Suddenly, tens of thousands of people are at risk of fuel poverty.  The situation will not get better.  It will continue to deteriorate.We have seen social welfare cutbacks in the past two years as well as levies on taxpayers.  Home owners are moving into negative equity and homes are being repossessed.  We have seen the difficulties faced by small and medium sized enterprises in dealing with their energy bills.  This is only the beginning of it.  The Greens do not understand what is happening in the real world.

#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	538	That is part of the problem.  There is no proper understanding of the harsh realities of people's lives as they struggle with the income coming into the home.  People are saying they are just not able to meet the bills that are coming through the door, and the biggest bills are the energy and fuel bills.  This is a recipe for disaster.  For people who are disabled, elderly or ill this will create a disaster in the coming months and, if the austerity measures continue, years.Last year, the ESB disconnected 2,500 householders and Bord Gáis disconnected 4,000.  Approximately 20 people per week are being disconnected by Bord Gáis at present.  Is it not incredible that disconnection should cost €200 and reconnection a further €200?  How can that be allowed by the Minister?  The Minister authorises the regulator.  Without the Minister's permission the regulator would not be in a position to impose those charges.  They bear no relation to the cost of the disconnection or reconnection.  What is the justification for them, other than that the Minister has no interest in the matter and is disregarding his position of responsibility in this area?The Minister seems to be hell-bent on imposing his carbon tax.  This is an excuse for a policy.  There is no policy on climate change but there is a tax on carbon.  That seems to be as far as the Minister can think about the matter.  Other than that, his emphasis is on competition within the energy sector.  The end result of this policy has been an increase in energy prices.  Competition is supposed to mean a decrease but he has brought about an increase.  Our energy costs are above the European average rather than below it.In last year's budget the Minister for Finance promised the opposite of what he is doing.  He said €50 million of the carbon tax yield would be used to fund measures such as help for households at risk of fuel poverty.  What has happened to that?  He went on to say local authorities would receive additional funding to retrofit the social housing stock.  That is not happening.  Local authorities are not getting money to conduct a proper programme.  They are merely dealing with the voids.  The building energy rating has to be dealt with when the voids come up for repair.  In Dublin City Council, for example, that amounts to only a couple of hundred houses.  Where is the programme to deal with retrofitting social housing?  It is not there.  The Minister then said this represents a significant boost to the plan to retrofit more than 1 million homes by 2025.  That is not exactly the target that has been agreed with the European Union.Re-branding is another indication that the Minister is totally out of touch with reality.  The Minister's amendment describes re-branding as "a necessary part of deepening the EU internal market liberalisation process and enhancing competition in the national market, in the best interests of the consumers".  Is €40 million for Bord Gáis and €40 million for the ESB in the best interests of the consumers?  It is ludicrous to think about those utilities that are well branded as it is.  I would expect no more from the Greens in matters of this nature because they have always been out of touch with reality but I would have thought Fianna Fáil would have had some cop-on.   One would at least expect that given its tradition, it would have some concern for people in the less well off categories of society.  Sadly, this is not happening at present.

This group's wide membership reflects the complexity of the issue and recognises the need to identify those who are at risk of energy poverty.The forthcoming affordable energy strategy will be an essential tool in building upon the many measures already in place to protect households at risk from the effects of energy poverty, which vary from financial supports like the fuel allowance and household benefits package to thermal efficiency-based measures such as the warmer home scheme.  There has been considerable discussion about the need for a national retrofit programme and I am delighted to see support from both sides of the House for the new efficiency programme which will commence in January 2011, following the successful consultation exercise that concluded in September.

As all speakers agreed last night, energy efficiency is not only the most cost-effective means of permanently reducing energy use but it also delivers considerable health and well-being benefits.The new retrofit programme will seek to significantly increase the pace of the uptake of energy efficiency measures by radically changing the way householders are incentivised and supported.  One of the most commonly identified barriers to retrofitting is that the upfront costs can appear prohibitive.  Under the new proposals energy efficiency measures will be made more accessible through upfront discounts which will alleviate the need to wait for retrospective grant payments.Ensuring that customers have the appropriate information to make informed energy use decisions is an important element in reducing energy demands.  We will continue to develop the wellandwarm.ie site and will distribute a further print run of the very popular Well and Warm booklet.The promotion of competition is essential to ensuring that alternative suppliers are available.  I do not think Labour Party Deputies have acknowledged that customers can switch providers at no charge.

I am confident that additional moneys will be made available to those dependent on the fuel allowance to stay warm this winter.  I advise Deputies to watch this space.We advise those who are in difficulty with their bills to contact their suppliers in order to make revised payment arrangements before they reach the point of disconnection.  The Commission for Energy Regulation has announced that it will review the regulatory policy on disconnection in the context of improved customer protection, with a specific focus on how costs are allocated across the industry and to the customer.  I acknowledge that some of the information we have heard regarding disconnection has been crude in the extreme.I welcome Deputies' support for onshore renewable energy generation but I emphasise the importance of a stable regulatory environment for the investment needed in our energy infrastructure.

As we near the end of this debate, it is important to remind ourselves that we are discussing the issue of fuel poverty in the first place because the Government failed in a number of key commitments.  In the renewed programme for Government, Fianna Fáil and the Green Party committed to a fuel poverty strategy by the end of 2009.  We have not yet seen that strategy.The programme stated that the Government would introduce a carbon tax in budget 2010 and cited one of the guiding principles governing the tax as protecting those most at risk of fuel poverty.  We got the tax but those most at risk of fuel poverty received no compensation.

No such scheme has materialised.  In a reply to a parliamentary question asked on 19 January, the then Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Hanafin, stated: "Before the tax is applied to fuels for home heating, arrangements are being made to assist those most at risk of fuel poverty."  She clearly stated that assistance would be provided before the tax was imposed on home heating and not just on solid fuels, as the Taoiseach mistakenly claimed this morning.During Question Time on 20 April, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Ó Cuív, indicated that he would receive a report from the interdepartmental group by the end of April.  Six months later, there is still no outcome.  On his own website, the Minister declared that the interdepartmental working group was to report to Government by the end of June to allow for any proposed measures to be implemented when the heating season starts again at the end of September.  We are now beyond that point, and still we have heard nothing.  What is taking the interdepartmental committee so long?Even today, the Government's amendment to the motion does not mention fuel vouchers.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources did not refer to them last night.  This morning the Taoiseach stated that vouchers will not be introduced until the carbon levy is imposed on solid fuels.  The goalposts are being moved.  Ten months after the budget day announcement, the Government has not yet developed a plan to help the poorest in our society deal with the cost of the carbon levy.The fact of the matter is that budget 2010 was littered with half-baked measures announced without first working out how they would be implemented, chief among which was the carbon levy.  The Government should not have introduced the levy without a plan to offset its effects on those who cannot afford to heat their homes.  It was the act of a stubborn and reckless Administration.  The failure of the Minister, Deputy Ryan, to even mention the matter in his amendment reveals how out of touch his party and Fianna Fáil have become.  Some 340,000 households in this country receive fuel allowance.  As it is a condition of the scheme that recipients must be on social welfare payments, we are discussing the poorest cohort of people in the country.   For the thousands of households that are reliant on oil and gas for heat, the carbon levy has resulted in a significant extra cost.  The households are not just paying extra via the carbon levy because, owing to some inane EU ruling, they are also paying VAT on that levy.  For many, it has come at a time when their basic social welfare payment has been reduced.The cost of home heating oil, which was already on the increase, rose by nearly 9% as a result of the carbon levy alone.  The Taoiseach should note this has contributed to a 27% increase in the cost of home heating oil in the past year and a staggering rise of 124% since the start of 2007.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will correct the record in view of his misinformed comments this morning.Many more poor families, including thousands who would be considered the working poor, do not qualify for a fuel allowance because they are not in receipt of a social welfare payment.   Since they do not get a fuel allowance, they are also excluded from the warmer homes scheme.  Their income is generally too low to be able to afford the works under the home energy savings scheme so they are caught on both fronts.  These are the people who pay for everything but get very little in return.  The Government is not interested in people in these circumstances.When the Government is coming to a decision, whenever that may be, I urge it to consider a proposal put forward by Active Retirement Ireland to the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs earlier this year.  At that meeting, it was suggested that home heating oil should be added to the categories covered under the household benefit package.  The current structure of the scheme disadvantages people who rely on oil for their home heating.  Allowances under this package are currently available in respect of electricity, gas and bottled gas, but not oil.  Given that the carbon levy has impacted most on users of oil, this suggestion really is worth considering.It is time the Government delivered on its promise to produce a fuel poverty strategy.  The litany of missed deadlines and forgotten commitments is the reason we are debating this motion.  The measures have been agreed by Cabinet and were to be introduced long before now.  We are not asking the Government to do anything it does not agree with or anything it cannot afford.  We are simply asking it to do what it promised it would do.  We have yet another reason to ask why this Government is still in power.  It has clearly lost all interest in the people it is meant to be serving.  Sadly, the promise to produce a fuel poverty strategy is yet another broken promise.

I sensed across the House concern about people at risk of fuel poverty.  Winter is setting in.  There are people alive today who will die this winter because the conditions they live in are too cold or damp.  Winter mortality levels in Ireland are particularly high but we can do something to save lives if we deal with the problem in a coherent way.  Regrettably, the Government is not doing so.There have been between 2,000 and 2,500 electricity disconnections per month this year and 4,000 by Bord Gáis.  The most extraordinary aspect of this is that VAT is paid on every disconnection.  The coffers of the State benefit from what is happening.The Minister of State, Deputy White, is speaking tonight on behalf of her party.  The Green Party has been subject to some criticism to the effect that its Ministers are out of touch.  That is a little unfair in that the Government as a whole is out of touch, regrettably it is not just the Green party.  This happens when Ministers are in warm offices and driven around — the Greens are very good at being driven around — in heated cars.

The Minister of State should look to the program for Government and consider how she has failed to live up even to her own promise.  Every Minister made a direct commitment that there would be a fuel poverty strategy published in 2009.  There is nothing more telling of the Government's disdain for those living in fuel poverty or other forms of poverty than the fact that it did not deliver on that commitment.When Ministers from the Green Party lecture us in the House about renewables, changing our ways and climate change, they should note that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security published today a draft Bill on climate change.  The Government should prove itself on climate change by debating the Bill in the House.  It has all-party agreement.  Let us do what needs to be done to meet the big challenge, which the Green Party preaches about but on which it does not deliver.

We know this.  We want to know why the promise made in the budget has not been delivered upon.  Why is the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government talking up the increase in fuel allowances while the Taoiseach is trying to slap it down?  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Ó Cuív, is not telling us anything at all although he is the Minister responsible.  That is not coherent government.  Let us be practical.  Given that taxes announced in the budget are always imposed, let us see the commitment to which I refer honoured.Deputy Jan O'Sullivan asked who regulates the regulator.  It is very simple to answer that question, it is the Minister.  I am very uncomfortable with the abandonment of responsibility evident when I hear the Taoiseach or Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Ryan, talk about the regulator as if he were above the clouds or God the Father.  It is implied that the diktat comes down and we must all understand this is the way the world is and that it cannot be challenged.  That is not the way it is.  Under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999, the Minister has the power to direct the regulator on any matter that he considers appropriate.  It is clear in the legislation that the regulator must report on how he has implemented the directive of the Minister.If this debate has but one result it should be that the Minister should tell the regulator to stop acting the way he is doing, as a little god, in terms of directing the big utility companies to misspend their customers' money by way of a rebranding exercise that nobody needs or wants and which will cost a lot of money, be it €40 million or €80 million.  That money could be ploughed back.  Utility companies are in a position to direct at least part of that money towards benefiting people who are living in fuel poverty and in terror that they will no longer be able to turn on the cooker to cook the dinner to feed their children or turn on the electric fire to keep themselves warm.  These are people who are living in fuel poverty and are terrified they will no longer be able to turn on the cooker to cook food to feed their children or to turn on the electric fire to keep themselves warm.  That is a reality we all thought was part of our past.  We are now back to the future.  Let us get real and let us ensure this debate produces results.

#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	566	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this important issue tonight.  It is not often I get an opportunity to raise an issue in this Chamber that concerns my own parish, so I am delighted to have that chance.  This serious matter relates to the embankments on the Fergus estuary, which cover the inner part of the Shannon estuary from outside Ennis.In the 1960s the Office of Public Works, OPW, did a major upgrade on the embankments from Clarecastle to Islandavanna, and I compliment the work done at the time, along with the ongoing work on the embankments on the Fergus estuary.  I am delighted to see the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Martin Mansergh, is in the Chamber because he is in charge of these matters.  Unfortunately, when the Office of Public Works did the work it ran out of money, or some parishioners have said the money was diverted.  As a result, the job was unfinished.  Through the years many efforts have been made by the local people, landowners and politicians to continue the upgrading but unfortunately, successive Governments have turned a blind eye to the issue.  I remember as a young man being part of a deputation to the Office of Public Works on St. Stephen's Green, where we spoke with the late Joe Bermingham when he was a Minister of State.  He was a colleague of the Acting Chairman.  That is how long this problem is ongoing.I raised this matter last year and at my request the Office of Public Works carried out a feasibility study on the conditions of the embankments and cost of repair.  Unfortunately, the study found the cost of the works required on the embankments would outweigh the benefits that would accrue.  This was a short-sighted view and although I understand the OPW has existing commitments to prioritise flood relief works in other areas, these embankments should be treated as a priority.  I praise the work done by the OPW and the contracts signed recently for upgrading the Fergus embankments in Ennis; that came about as a result of the flooding from this time last year and I hope the work will continue.The river could flood many houses in the urban areas but in rural areas much land — the livelihood of many farmers — can be flooded.  Unfortunately, last weekend there was a very high tide covering the embankments in the area which resulted in a number of breaches in very weak areas.  Nothing has been done with many of the banks through the years and with winter approaching and the likelihood of windy and stormy weather, more damage will be done.  Hundreds of acres of land are likely to be flooded if some emergency works are not carried out on these embankments, which will result in farmers' livelihoods being affected.  It is a significant issue in my own parish.  I am not talking about just a few landowners but rather many farmers stretched over many miles.I do not expect that in these recessionary times the OPW will be able to put in much money but I expect that following the feasibility study, some funding for emergency works will be provided to deal with current breaches.  There is an old saying that a stitch in time saves nine and if breaches are allowed to continue, it would cost much more to fix damage done to the land.  We are in a recession and landowners do not have excess money to fix these breaches because it is expensive to do so.  The OPW has the dredgers to deal with the issue and has done great work in the areas along Clarecastle and Islandavanna.I am delighted to see the Minister of State here tonight and I ask him if it is possible for him to procure emergency funding to fix the breaches in the embankments.  There has been significant waste in public finances and a small amount of money would make a big difference to farmers in the region.  I am pleading with him in my capacity as a parishioner in the area for any money to fix those breaches and prevent a bigger catastrophe later.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	567	I thank Deputy Breen for raising the matter of breaches to the Fergus embankments this past weekend.  I welcome the raising of such issues in the Dáil as before December 2009 such issues were practically never raised, and certainly not in my time as Minister of State.This matter had not been brought to the attention of the Office of Public Works and it is understood that Clare County Council was also unaware of the event.  The primary role for the immediate response to a serious flood event rests with the relevant local authority, which is in this case Clare County Council.  In line with national flood policy, the OPW works with local authorities and other State bodies to implement programmes to mitigate future flood risk.  In this regard, the OPW, in addition to implementing a range of non-structural measures, carries out a programme of major capital flood relief projects, such as the Ennis flood relief scheme, the second phase of which is currently at tender stage.  The aim is to ensure that the preferred solution is one that will afford the required level of protection while also addressing any environmental issues and providing the best value for money.The Office of Public Works also maintains those drainage schemes undertaken by the office under the arterial drainage Acts, including elements of the Fergus embankment system.  Although designed primarily for drainage of agricultural land, these schemes also provide a degree of flood protection.  The embankments in the Fergus system fall into three categories.  There are those which are the responsibility of the Office of Public Works, those forming part of the Fergus drainage district and those that were in the past the responsibility of the Land Commission.Following a survey in 1999, a comprehensive programme of major refurbishment works was carried out by Office of Public Works on approximately 14 km of those embankments for which the office is responsible at a total cost of approximately €1 million.  The Office of Public Works continues to carry out weekly inspections of these embankments and, where maintenance works are considered necessary, they are undertaken as part of the office's annual programme of maintenance works, in accordance with its statutory obligations under the arterial drainage Acts.Responsibility for maintenance of the embankments between Clarecastle and Ennis, which form part of the Fergus drainage district, rests with Clare County Council.  It has been agreed recently with Clare County Council that a section of these embankments, which is closely linked to and impacts on the Ennis flood relief scheme, will be included in proposed additional flood defences for the town that will be undertaken by the Council with funding from the Office of Public Works.The embankments that were formerly maintained by the Land Commission include those at Ballynacally, Inishdea, Kildysert and Carrickerry.  Following the abolition of the Land Commission, maintenance works in some places have been carried out on these embankments by the relevant landowners.  Following representations of behalf of property owners, the Office of Public Works undertook a preliminary study on the feasibility of upgrading the former Land Commission embankments in these areas, which was completed in 2008.The study examined 27 separate embankments with a total length of approximately 30 km.  These embankments generally protect polders or areas reclaimed from the estuary.  No dwellings were found to be at risk of flooding in these areas.  The study found that the cost of bringing the embankments up to the same standard as the embankments for which the Office of Public Works is responsible would exceed the benefit that would accrue, in most instances by a wide margin. It was concluded that upgrading the embankments to that standard could not be justified having regard to demands on the Office of Public Works for priority flood mitigation works at other locations.In 2009, the Office of Public Works introduced the minor flood works scheme to provide funding to local authorities to address localised flood problems, where a solution had been identified or could be readily identified.  The level of protection afforded by these works varies having regard to the level of risk in each location.  To qualify for funding under this scheme, the local authority's proposals must be economically viable and environmentally sustainable.In 2010 to date, in excess of €11.5 million has been allocated to local authorities under this scheme with approximately €600,000 allocated to Clare County Council.  It is open to Clare County Council to apply for funding for mitigation works to those Fergus embankments not maintained by the Office of Public Works that meet the eligibility criteria of the minor flood works scheme.  If an application were submitted by the council, it would be given every consideration having regard to the overall funding available to the Office of Public Works for flood risk management.  The scheme is still open for further applications this year

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	571	A prosthetic clinic has been operating in St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital, Cork, for the past 21 years.  I have testimony after testimony from patients, their parents and four plastic surgeons attesting to the quality, speed and delivery of services at this clinic.  One of its patients recently participated and won a medal at the Paralympic Games.  Her prosthesis was admired by other athletes for its flexibility and quality.  The clinic in question deals mainly with children who have lost a limb, usually a leg, through meningitis or congenital deformity for example.  The clinic has ensured they have a service second to none.The clinic, however, is about to become defunct.  I must declare an interest.  The National Rehabilitation Hospital was extraordinarily good to me when I had to attend it and no one would deny it provides an excellent service.  However, recently its consultant rehabilitation medical clinical director sent a letter to St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital stating that because the manufacture of prosthesis is not regulated, the clinic must be shut down and a new supplier put in place, Ability Matters, an English company with clinics in other parts of the country.  When I checked its website, it appeared to deal mainly with aids for the elderly.  While I do not doubt the company does a good job, in this case the provider does not know the children in question.There also seems to be a large move towards centralising services.  For the past five years I have been seeking the roll-out of the National Rehabilitation Hospital's services in the Cork area.  What Cork does not need is a new provider of prostheses. A female doctor in a report on prosthetic clinical delivery in 1998 for the then Southern Health Board stated St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital was much more satisfactory on all counts with a strong emphasis on the humane aspects of service provision related to the economic support and information.  The report further stated the average cost of a prosthesis per patient at the National Rehabilitation Hospital was 16% higher than at St. Mary's hospital.The director of the Cork clinic told me of fitting the first limbs for a girl when she was a year old.  She still returns to him at 21.  This shows how some of the patients have developed with the clinic.  One mother informed me how the clinic has no waiting list for children.  If a child requires a prosthesis, it is made at the clinic.  If it needs adjustment, as a result of growth, or a repair, it will be done on the same day.  One cannot tell a child who outgrows his or her prosthesis that he or she will not get one for another six months.  Instead, they would be condemned to a wheelchair and immobility.  Moving this clinic makes no sense and should be stopped.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	572	This service has been in Cork for more than 20 years with a proven and exemplary record in providing prosthetic services.  There are two essential elements to prosthetic services.  First, there is the measuring and fitting of the limb.  Second, there is the provision of aftercare and support services required by patients.  There are concerns among users of this service as to what will happen to them in the future.  Many of them are asking why should a service that works so well be dismantled by the HSE and the National Rehabilitation Hospital while a lesser service is put in its place.  This is a local service meeting local needs that has built up a wealth of experience in the past 20 years.  Deputy Kathleen Lynch attested to this with her example of the young woman who grew up with the service.Were studies carried out into the costs of moving this service and, more importantly, its impact on patient care?  People are really worried about this.  People who have had limbs fitted and are getting aftercare, support and adjustments are now asking who will provide the aftercare and adjustment services if there is a change of company?  It is a critical question which the Minister needs to answer.  We could have a situation where people who have had limbs fitted in the past 12 months or two years now find that they will have to have their limbs refitted because the new company is coming into operation which will not deal with patients who had their limbs fitted by another company.

Prosthetics services in Cork currently involve a number of private service providers working out of St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital, St. Finbarr's Hospital and North Valley Business Centre, Blackpool, and the National Rehabilitation Hospital, which provides a service on the St. Finbarr's Hospital campus.  The service currently operating from St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital campus is one of a number of services to which the HSE has been referring a number of its patients over the years.  I wish to assure the House that the HSE has no plans to change the arrangements whereby public patients can access this service.The HSE is, however, planning to move the prosthetics services currently based at St. Finbarr's Hospital.  The premises being used for this service are no longer fit for purpose and the HSE is satisfied that the interests of the users of the service will best be served by relocating the current National Rehabilitation Hospital-delivered and HSE-sponsored amputee clinic from St. Finbarr's Hospital to a purpose-built facility at the Mercy University Hospital, Cork.Amputee rehabilitation is specialist rehabilitation and needs to be done under the care of a consultant in rehabilitation medicine.  The HSE's aim is to ensure that a comprehensive rehabilitation service is available to persons who have had or will have an amputation.  The service which will operate from the Mercy University Hospital will be a consultant-led service, subject to all the tenets of good clinical governance and best practice.  The necessary specialist technical staff will be available on a daily basis and a consultant in rehabilitation medicine with a sub-specialty interest in the rehabilitation of amputees will provide a service on a weekly basis.  This represents a substantial upgrading from the service levels currently available at St. Finbarr's.  It will be open to patients currently attending the service at St. Mary's to switch their attendance to the new Mercy service, if they so wish.The consultations on the new facilities at the Mercy Hospital were undertaken at every stage of planning and development.  This included meetings with representatives of Amputee Ireland.  These initiatives demonstrate the HSE's commitment to improving the provision of this important rehabilitation and ongoing care services for people who have undergone an amputation or who have otherwise suffered the loss of a limb.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	574	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter.  I would have raised it as a priority question but the latest event occurred past the date for submitting such questions.The abuse of Irish passports is gravely worrying and reflects a failure, I am sad to say, on behalf of those responsible for the implementation of effective security measures to protect the security of Irish passports following the events that occurred in Dubai earlier this year.  It is becoming increasingly clear that international undercover agents are accessing the passport information of Irish citizens with ease for use during their covert operations.  It has taken the exposure of a Russian spy ring to highlight the latest abuses and as was the case in Dubai the Irish authorities were completely oblivious to the theft of information until other governments pointed it out.It was initially reported that only one Irish passport was involved in the uncovering of the spy ring in the United States but it has now emerged that several Irish passports are involved.  The security of British passports was significantly reinforced immediately following the Dubai assassination but no such security enhancements have been implemented to protect Irish passports, despite the fact that they were abused in exactly the same manner.  I would like to mention the sort of security reinforcements which have occurred in Britain.  It has changed, with effect from 1 October, the passports it will issue.  New passports will incorporate images of well-known scenes recreated through special printing techniques.  The new passport replaces the e-passport which was brought in four years ago to comply with the United States' visa waiver programme.Other security features, I understand, include moving the chip that stores the holder's details to the inside of the passport cover so it is no longer visible and adding a transparent covering, which includes several holograms.  The new passport images will also stretch across two pages instead of one.  I point this out because there is research on how one can further improve the security of passports.  I have no doubt that if we do not have the wherewithal in this country to do that we could perhaps contact the identity and passport service in the United Kingdom to see if we could copy its new methods of improving security.I was also disturbed that until yesterday it would appear that no contact was made with the Russian Embassy despite the fact that when the Dubai scandal broke the Government called in the Israeli ambassador and, ultimately, an Israeli diplomat was expelled.  I do not know why we seem to have failed to act as quickly with the Russian Embassy but I also read that visas were issued from that embassy in respect of passports which were ultimately forged, with the original user's passport was forged.There are serious questions to be answered.  I hope the Minister of State will give an assurance that every possible step is being taken to guarantee the sanctity of the Irish passport which for many generations was regarded very highly.  I hope it will continue to have a high reputation throughout the world.  We do not want to be involved in spy rings and other activities of a corrupt nature.  I sincerely hope that the Minister of State, Deputy Power, whom I am delighted to see in the House, can give us a guarantee that these security steps will be taken, answers will be obtained from the Russian Embassy and the appropriate action taken, if necessary, so that we will not have any recurrence of this situation and that other possible abuses may be sent a warning that Ireland will not tolerate this type of behaviour under any circumstances.
#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	575	I thank Deputy Barrett for raising this important issue.On Sunday, 27 June, US federal agents arrested ten people in the states of New York, New Jersey, Virginia and Massachusetts for allegedly carrying out long-term deep cover assignments in the United States on behalf of the Russian Federation.  A total of 11 defendants, including the ten arrested, were charged with conspiring to act as unlawful agents of the Russian Federation within the United States, while at that time one defendant remained at large.  The affidavit lodged by the Federal Bureau of Investigations, FBI, to justify the bringing of charges against the defendants alleged that one of the defendants travelled to Moscow using a false Irish passport and that another travelled on a false British passport.  A search of the Irish passport database confirmed that a valid Irish passport with the same details as those on the alleged false Irish passport had issued in 2001 to an Irish citizen.On being made aware of these allegations, the Minister for Foreign Affairs asked the passport service and An Garda Síochána to undertake an investigation into the alleged use of a false Irish passport.  This investigation is under way at present and it would be inappropriate for me, at this stage, to speculate on its conclusions.  However, I can inform Deputy Barrett that the Garda has since received information alleging that as many as six Irish forged passports using material cloned from the valid passports of Irish citizens may have been used and involved in the case in question.I can confirm that a small number of citizens have been interviewed by the Garda and the passport service.  While there is no evidence that those whose passport details have allegedly been used are under any threat or have been inconvenienced while travelling, they are, as a precautionary measure, being issued with replacement passports.There has been no delay in carrying out the ongoing investigations.  The allegation of the fraudulent use of Irish passports was made by the agency of a foreign government in a foreign jurisdiction and concerned events outside this jurisdiction.  Accordingly, the investigation requires the assistance of agencies from other countries.  The process of gathering and substantiating evidence in such circumstances has therefore been time consuming but it is hoped that the investigations will be completed within a couple of weeks.The Government regards the fraudulent use of Irish passports as a most serious matter and we constantly seek to improve the security of passports.  I understand that the passport books allegedly used were of a type produced by the passport service prior to 2005.  There have since been major enhancements to the security features of the current passport book and the Government is satisfied that this now makes the production of a counterfeit Irish passport much more difficult, although clearly not impossible for agencies with substantial resources.  In addition, procedures for confirming the identity of first-time passport applicants have been tightened with a view to preventing fraud during the application process.The Government's concern about these allegations has been conveyed to the Russian authorities.  On 1 October, senior officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs informed the Russian ambassador and a senior official from Moscow who was visiting Dublin on other business that the Government was investigating US allegations on the use of forged Irish passports by Russian agents and made clear that the Government takes serious exception to the forgery and misuse of Irish passports.  The Russian officials were also informed that, depending on the outcome of the current inquiries, the Government may seek the assistance of the Russian authorities in furthering this investigation.I would point out that there are significant differences between the current case and that involving the use of forged Irish passports by Israeli agents earlier this year.  In the Israeli case, the announcement by the Dubai authorities of the alleged use of forged Irish passports was accompanied by the publication of photocopies of the documents in question and video evidence linking the persons whose photos appeared in the forged passports with a murder for which Israel refused to deny charges of responsibility.  In the circumstances, it was entirely appropriate to immediately call in the Israeli ambassador and to ask for Israel's assistance in explaining the matter.  In the current case, where less evidence was publicly available at the time the allegation was made, the Minister for Foreign Affairs decided first to assess the nature of the evidence collated by the Garda and the passport service before deciding whether he himself should meet with the Russian ambassador.I am aware many Members of the House will have seen a headline in a newspaper this morning which suggested that the Russian ambassador, in a meeting with the representative of an NGO operating in Russia, sought to link the passport allegations with progress on the negotiation of a bilateral agreement with Russia on adoption.  These reports have been checked out, including with the NGO representative in question, and I can assure the House that there is no substance whatsoever to this headline.  Furthermore, I can categorically state that there has been no attempt by the Russian authorities to link the passport allegation to any aspect of our bilateral relations.Ireland and Russia have traditionally enjoyed very good relations as evidenced by the successful visit to Russia undertaken last month by President McAleese.  Russia is an important trading partner and growing market for Irish goods and services as well as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.Situating this matter in its international context, we should not forget that the US allegation that a Russian agent had used a fake Irish passport was part of a wider US claim that a Russian spy ring was operating on its territory.  This announcement was made only days after a highly successful visit to the US by the President of Russia.   The spy ring episode was quickly and amicably settled with no apparent harm to US-Russia bilateral relations.  Furthermore, the British Foreign Secretary is in Moscow today seeking to develop UK-Russia relations, notwithstanding recent strains and the allegation concerning the use of a forged British passport by a member of the same spy ring.This is not to belittle the importance of allegations which, if confirmed, would represent a very serious affront to Irish sovereignty and to the Irish citizens whose identities have allegedly been cloned, but rather to situate this incident in the wider perspective of the conduct of international relations.  Regardless of such considerations, whenever the Government has solid evidence that Irish passports have been forged or misused by a foreign government or its agents, we will, in accordance with the Irish national interest, make clear our strong objection in a firm and appropriate manner.Once the Minister for Foreign Affairs, my colleague Deputy Micheál Martin, has received the reports of the Garda and the passport service into these most serious allegations, he will consider the evidence presented to him before reporting to the Government and recommending whatever course of action he believes appropriate.  He will then inform the House on the findings of the investigation and any action the Government should decide to take on foot of those reports.
#TomSheahan	unknown-#TomSheahan-party	unknown-#TomSheahan-dob	unknown-#TomSheahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	576	I wish to discuss the amount of time it takes to process disability allowance and disability benefit claims.  Recently, I spoke to a community welfare officer who told me that either 6,500 or 8,500 claims are in that office at present awaiting decision.  To make my point I will recount two anecdotal cases.A man claiming jobseeker's benefit working at home with a disk saw mutilated his finger.  He contacted the social welfare office and stated what had happened.  The jobseeker's benefit payment was stopped immediately and the man was told he would have to apply for disability benefit, which he did.  I must stress this man would not know the system inside out.  The accident happened last March and his claim for disability allowance arrived in the office on 27 May.  On 4 October he received a reply to state that he was refused.  He was told by the social welfare office to give up his jobseeker's benefit because he was not available for work because of his injury.  He applied for disability allowance and was refused.  He was told that his case had been considered by a medical assessor who expressed the opinion that he was unsuitable for disability allowance because all of the required medical criteria were not satisfied.  He meets both required criteria.I thank the Minister for coming to the House and I appreciate and understand that he inherited the Department.  Will he tell the House what medical qualifications do the medical assessors have?  To the best of my knowledge they have none.  If any medic saw the state of this man's hand and finger he or she would not disallow him disability benefits.  We will appeal it but I believe this man has been victimised by the system.  He has not received a cent since the accident happened last March and it is now October.  I do not know how long it will take for this appeal to go before the chief appeals officer, who will not see his hand either, but he has received no payment whatsoever since March last.In another case, while in hospital for a minor procedure there was serious harm done to a neighbour of mine, so much so that today I applied for an E111 form where he must go to England for treatment.  Ten months ago that man applied for disability allowance.  He has been refused because he was considered by a medical assessor to be unsuitable for disability allowance because all the medical criteria listed were not satisfied.  That is ten months ago, and his wife and two children have got nothing from the State.  In those ten months he has spent 83 days in hospital and he has not got a shilling from the State.  Will the Minister tell me the number of medical assessors in his Department who can make the assessment, without seeing the injuries of these two particular persons, that they cannot work?
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	577	First, I thank Deputy Tom Sheahan for raising the question on the Adjournment.  I assure him that, within the law and the terms of the scheme, every effort is being made to deal with all applications under the various schemes as expeditiously as possible.  As he is probably aware, there was a significant increase in the number of applications under the various schemes in recent years.There are currently 6,477 disability allowance claims awaiting decision and this represents 6.4% of the total number currently in receipt of disability allowance, DA.  The numbers in receipt of disability allowance have increased year on year.  At the end of September 2010, there were 101,042 in receipt of the allowance, representing an increase of 4,970 or 5% over the number of recipients in January 2009.  The average number of weeks taken to decide a disability allowance claim in September 2010 was 10.69 weeks, and 59% of all claims were decided within 12 weeks.To be eligible for disability allowance, a claimant must satisfy a medical assessment, a means test and be habitually resident in the State.  All aspects of the claim must be decided before the customer is notified of the decision.The processing time for individual disability allowance claims may vary in accordance with their relative complexity in terms of the three main criteria to which I referred.  Certain claims have to be referred to social welfare inspectors for means investigation and this can add to the overall processing times.  One third of the claims awaiting decision are currently with inspectors.  In addition, factors outside the Department's control can have an impact, for example, incomplete application forms, the supply of relevant information by the customer, that is, bank account details, details of spouses earnings, information from employers or third parties.Anyone who is under financial pressure while awaiting a decision on his or her claim can apply for supplementary welfare allowance from his or her local community welfare officer.My Department is committed to delivering the best possible service to its customers.  Operational processes and procedures and the organisation of work are continually reviewed in all areas of the Department, including disability allowance section, to ensure that claims are processed and decided in the most efficient and expeditious way possible, having regard to the eligibility conditions that apply to each scheme.Measures introduced by the Department to address the efficiency of DA claim processing include the review of existing processes and procedures with the objective of reducing delays in claim processing, the review of ongoing staffing deployment and the judicious application of overtime working.An increasing number of claims are now desk assessed for means purposes, thus reducing the numbers being sent to social welfare inspectors and improving the overall times for claim processing.  With regard to medical assessment, all claims are now being desk assessed by the medical assessors of the Department, thus obviating the need to call the vast majority of claimants for medical examinations.This is where certification from the medical practitioners who fill up the application forms is so vital.  In an effort to speed up the operation, and rather than call everybody for medical examination as there are many black and white cases of eligibility for disability allowance, we are trying to have better certification from the doctors coming in so that the doctor assessing does not need to see the patient because he or she already has the information from the original medical examination, in other words, that we take it that the examination carried out by the applicant's doctor is thorough and gives us the information.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that this approach makes sense.  Of course, it leads to a situation where some applicants will not be happy with the decision.  In such a case, obviously, the person can look for a revised decision and then we can carry out a physical examination.I have been encouraging the Department to look at, as a first process, having better documentation coming in because we can only make decisions on documentation coming in.  If we get good documentation and if it answers the questions clearly — remember in many cases it is disability to work is the issue — then we can make quicker decisions and need not have to physically have a medical officer check everybody.  Obviously, however, if that does not resolve the issue, then one must fall back on the physical examination, and, of course, the right of appeal also exists.One argument I have with some commentators is that they are always on about policy.  I agree with the Deputy, that for the ordinary punter in the street it does not matter how good the policy is if the actual delivery of the service does not match it.  I could have the best policies as Minister for Social Protection but unless the person can get the payment to which he or she feels entitled, or get a fair process to show he or she is not entitled to the payment after the appeals process, all of the policy is a waste of time.We are trying systematically, in view of the increased number of applicants to get a speedier decision making process in the first round, have a review within the Department, and then one goes to appeal.  Even at appeal stage, if new information is provided we go back to the deciding officer and ask him or her to review it again before we go through the appeals mechanism.  In that way, we would hope in a range of processes that we can reduce processing time and give a much more satisfactory service.I must state on behalf of the appeals office, in justification, that the number of appeals grew significantly with the number of applications, but that is cold comfort to the public.  Therefore, they are working with me proactively to try see how we reduce the waiting times for decisions, both at the first application and on appeal.

My understanding is they are medical practitioners.  On that matter, the Chief Medical Officer, the person with whom I mainly have had dealings in the Department, is a very fine medical practitioner and I understand is very experienced in occupational medicine, and I have found him to be a very fair minded person.  He is working to try see how all of these procedures can be improved.  He has done a great deal of work, even on the design of the certification so that we manage to get the information we require to make good decisions.  It is partly medical and partly also related to the design of forms, etc., so that the information we get in is perhaps better than it was in the past.While I am taking the Deputy into another subject here, I genuinely feel this is an important matter where we all can make progress.  As he is probably aware, often doctors give a certificate to an applicant for all sorts of schemes only outlining the medical condition.  However, as I stated in the Dáil committee today, schemes often have an issue, not only on what is the actual medical condition but on whether, for example, a person applying for carer's allowance needs full-time care and attention or a person applying for disability allowance or illness benefit is capable for work taking into account his or her qualifications, experience, etc., depending on one's qualifications and experience, and the type of work one does.  A roofer in a wheelchair could not operate, but the Deputy and I know other people in wheelchairs who are in very senior roles because they have desk jobs.  From my personal experience as a Deputy, one of the problems up to now has been that it was not enough to get the medical assessment, but that the next issue was whether the person was capable for work in the opinion of the original doctor taking into account whether he or she was labouring or had a desk job, and the kind of work concerned.  There is work we can do to speed up the process by trying to get that information in the first round and save all of us, particularly the applicants for our schemes, much heartache and grief.I sometimes hear people saying that the Department is holding back for some financial reason.  I can assure the Deputy nothing is further from the truth for a great many reasons which he can figure out.  With the amount of money involved, if the allowance is given in the end, there is no saving for the Department because we give the arrears to the date of application.  There is no messing like that going on; everything is done to the staff's best ability.  There is no hidden agenda.That said, we can do the job better and the Department is open to doing so.  I have been very impressed going around to the country to the various offices.  I was down in Killarney recently where we spent two hours going through all of the mechanisms there discussing how we can have better delivery mechanisms right throughout the Department.  My experience of the staff is that they are definitely up for it.  They are fantastic staff committed to the work they do and I believe we can do things better in the future.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	580	Along with my Government colleagues, I will continue to drive the competitiveness agenda across the economy to promote an environment that is conducive to creating jobs and enables all businesses to flourish.  The Forfás Annual Competitiveness Report 2010 states that Ireland's regulatory environment is one of the least restrictive in the OECD in relation to product market regulation.  The time taken to comply with tax payments is one of the lowest in the OECD across all categories, and Ireland's employment framework is less rigid than the OECD average.  However, we are not complacent and my Department is leading the work to reduce red tape.The High Level Group on Business Regulation works to fast-track simplifications to specific red tape issues identified by business.  The High Level Group has processed thirty specific red tape issues brought to its attention by business and continues to drive progress on a further thirty-eight items.  To date, the Group has measured over €20m of annual business savings and continues to work with business interests.  The Inter-Departmental Group on Regulation coordinates the measurement and reduction of administrative burdens in a systematic manner, based on the internationally recognized Standard Cost Model. It is this second, systematic process that will result in the large-scale reductions in red-tape.In relation to the fees charged to business by my own Department these have either not increased in the last few years or have been reduced.  33 Local Authorities have either frozen their commercial rates at 2009 prices or reduced them for 2010.  I met with the Local Authority Managers in July to discuss what initiatives they can and should take to support business and facilitate training, to foster the business environment in their areas and to ensure that their procurement strategies promote innovation and provide greater SME access to public contracts.  I also reinforced the message that competitiveness at local level is as important as it is at national level.  Decisions made at local level have a huge role to play in determining the success of enterprise.More generally, we are seeing lower costs for business, particularly in areas such as energy and rental of prime industrial space and office space.  Electricity and gas prices fell for all types of energy consumers in the second half of 2009, and have moved closer to the EU average for most business users.  Electricity prices have fallen by 24% in some cases.  I will continue to work with my Ministerial colleagues to ensure that State charges for the provision of services to business take account of the impact which such charges can have on the competitiveness of companies and their potential to create jobs in the economy.

The relevant legislative provisions vary from body to body. For example, in certain cases the legislation provides for the appointment of persons nominated by specified stakeholders, such as employer or trade union representative bodies. In other cases there may be no such provisions. In general, appointments are made having regard to several factors including the expertise and experience of individuals, the balance of skills and attributes in terms of the overall composition of the board, the gender balance of the board and the availability and commitment of people to serve on the board.

Enterprise Ireland and the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) will manage the Fund and investors have until November 26 to signal their interest in establishing a presence here.Innovation Fund Ireland will have up to €250 million available to make commitments. This funding runs along two parallel tracks.The first comprises a €125 million pool of funds provided by the exchequer and managed by Enterprise Ireland. Successful applicants who receive an investment from Enterprise Ireland will have to commit to investing an equivalent amount in Irish companies or companies with substantial Irish operations over the lifetime of their fund.The second is for a similar amount and designed to allow Ireland's National Pension Reserve Fund to make a similar level of commercial investments assuming its criteria are met.  The National Pension Reserve Fund announced its first investments under the ‘Innovation Fund Ireland' on 7 October 2010.The establishment of Innovation Fund Ireland builds on existing enterprise policies including the Government's continued commitment to the Irish venture capital sector through Enterprise Ireland. It is part of a suite of policy initiatives to position Ireland as a Global Innovation Hub. The objective of the Fund is not just to increase the availability of capital but also to transform the market by attracting top tier Fund managers to Ireland.The Funds will invest in Europe with a focus on Ireland. Over the lifetime of the Funds, the State envisages making a return on its investment and in terms of economic growth where the Funds invest in Irish start-up, scaling companies or companies with operations in Ireland the State can expect to see an increase in employment; an increase in the number of high potential start-ups; the attraction of high potential start up and scaling European technology and life science companies requiring growth capital investment to Ireland;   increased commercialisation of the ideas and R&D coming out of the Universities and Institutes of Technology in line with the Government's Strategy for Science and Technology and the persistence of Ireland as a centre for technology, life sciences and venture capital investment within Europe through multiple fund iterations.The Government is committed to increasing the number and scale of innovation driven and high-growth businesses in Ireland and a dynamic and progressive venture capital market is a pre-requisite in this endeavour. This Fund is further evidence of the Government's continued commitment to generate high quality jobs in Ireland.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	583	Specific objectives for growth are set out in the Government's five year integrated Trade, Tourism and Investment plan which is designed to increase the value of indigenous exports by 33%; to diversify the destination of indigenous exports; to increase overseas visitors to 8 million; to secure an additional 780 inward investment projects through IDA Ireland and create up to 300,000 sustainable jobs across the economy.  The Government recognises that a diverse range of enterprises will support both direct and indirect employment requiring a broad range of skills across all sectors of the economy, both internationally and locally traded.Presently, manufacturing firms' total direct spend in the Irish economy exceeds €26 billion and contributed 25% (or €40bn approx.) to Irish GDP in 2009.  Over 180,000 people are employed in manufacturing and in addition to these it is estimated that there are an additional 74 jobs in related services for every 100 directly employed in manufacturing.  Not only does manufacturing contribute directly to employment, economic output and exports but it is also a key driver of innovation and technological advance. It increases opportunities for attracting and embedding research and development activities, collaboration with the higher education sector and stimulating networks.In order to sustain and grow employment in manufacturing, Irish based enterprises will have to continue the progression to high value added sectors and activities, and continue to increase productivity through investments in human capital, technology and innovation.Our aim is that by 2020, Ireland will have a significant number of large, world-leading, innovation-intensive companies. These companies will provide high quality employment and generate exports and tax receipts. They will vary in scale, type of activity and pattern of company ownership. What will be distinctive about these companies is that they will be ambitious, export focused and, above all, innovative. Manufacturing will have a central role to play in the realisation of this vision.Many companies in Ireland have built world-class high value-added manufacturing and services capabilities, particularly in food, information and communications technology, software development for manufacturing technology, pharmaceuticals and medical technologies.   We envisage that Ireland's manufacturing base will continue to move up the value chain.  Programmes such as SFI's Centres for Science Engineering and Technology and Strategic Research Clusters programmes, along with the EI/IDA Competence Centre programme all have the same objective which is to harness the benefits of research collaboration for the benefit of the Irish economy.We have seen in this recession, that the companies that have invested in R&D and ensured their products or services have a competitive edge, are the same companies that have held or grown market share, held or grown employment.  This has reinforced our belief that our R&D Strategy is the right one.  Keeping the manufacturing sector strong is based on keeping ahead of the competition through market-focused research and development.  Enterprise Ireland and IDA are working closely with companies to strengthen the research and technological base of the enterprise sector in order to drive productivity, competitiveness, exports and jobs.IDA Ireland offers information, advice and ongoing support to companies setting up or expanding High Value Manufacturing Operations in Ireland. Support is available to companies making the required changes to be at the leading edge in terms of production processes, global business models and organisational structures.  In 2009, almost €29 million was approved to industry for 100 manufacturing industry R&D projects under Enterprise Ireland's R&D supports.  Further, significant support was made available by IDA to the companies they assist.The model of manufacturing in developed countries is changing and Irish-based enterprises are adapting to those changes and engaging in higher value added activities in order to compete in the global marketplace.  Science Foundation Ireland is playing a critical role in building our human capital — the knowledge, skills and creativity of people — and our ability and effectiveness in translating ideas into valuable processes, products and services.

I also understand that issues relating to cross-directorships and the dual role of Chair and Chief Executive will be among the matters addressed in the new regime.  In addition, these issues are also being considered by the European Commission as part of a possible corporate governance initiative at EU level on financial institutions generally.In relation to Irish listed companies (those trading on the main market of the Irish Stock Exchange), the corporate governance code that applies on a "comply or explain" basis has recently been revised following the financial crisis.  Among the changes introduced is a provision recommending that all directors of listed companies should be subject to annual election by shareholders. The revised code continues to provide that the roles of Chairman and CEO should not be exercised by the same individual.In the area of company law, the Companies Consolidation and Reform Bill currently being drafted will implement the recommendations of the Company Law Review Group in that the fiduciary duties owed by directors to the company will be stated in the new companies code.  Currently, company law does not prohibit cross directorships, whereby a person is a director of more than one company at the same time. The general position is that a person may not be a director of more than 25 companies subject to certain specific exceptions. Neither do the Companies Acts prevent a person fulfilling the dual role of chair and chief executive of a company. This would in my opinion be unworkable for smaller companies.  The Government is committed to ensuring that our corporate governance regime for the corporate sector generally, accords with best international practice.

As both bodies will be required to continue to carry out their respective important statutory functions until they are formally merged, I do not envisage any significant organisational change to either body prior to the enactment of this legislation.However, in advance of the merger, both bodies are working together to identify the scope for operational efficiencies. In this context I understand that work on finalising a Service Level Agreement (SLA) between both bodies is almost complete.  The SLA will facilitate the payment by the Competition Authority of non-pay related expenses on behalf of the National Consumer Agency.

Substantial progress has been made in identifying the critical elements involved in any further initiatives. However, in developing any further initiatives, it would be important that they would complement, rather than substitute, the main banks' lending commitments and activities under the recapitalisation package and that they would represent value for money from the taxpayer's perspective,The provision of credit to our enterprise sector, especially SME's, should primarily come from a properly functioning banking sector and any additional initiative on the State's part should not relieve the banks from their obligations in this regard.  As indicated already, we are looking at options to address known market failures regarding access to credit for SMEs including a loan guarantee scheme.

Any plans or proposals to refine Public Procurement policy is, therefore, a matter for the Department of Finance.My Department also helps to support Irish business in obtaining public contracts.  I am acutely aware of the importance of public procurement contracts for the Irish enterprise base.  Since the launch by my Department last year of the 10 Step Guide to Smart Procurement and SME Access to Public Contracts, substantial progress has been made in assisting SMEs gain public procurement business.  Enterprise Ireland has also established a new Public Procurement Unit to better connect companies with public procurement opportunities both in Ireland and overseas.The Department of Finance recently issued new guidelines, entitled "Guidance for Contracting Public Authorities: Facilitating Participation of SMEs in Public Procurement", to all public contracting bodies outlining a number of new initiatives being undertaken to facilitate access to public contracts for small and medium sized firms including subdividing contracts into smaller lots which would facilitate participation by small and medium sized companies.

Cork.  GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) currently employs over 1,500 people in Ireland, at its various sites in Cork, Dublin, Dungarvan and Sligo. The current job losses are a result of market conditions resulting in a fall in demand for the drugs GSK manufactures in Cork. IDA Ireland consistently engages with the company at both local and corporate level in an effort to secure further new investment to maintain and increase the company's base in Ireland.Schering-Plough was acquired by Merck Sharpe and Dohme (MSD) in November 2009 and a review of global manufacturing facilities is under way in the new MSD. On 10th September, cost reduction proposals designed to secure the plant's future and to increase its competitiveness were announced by the company.  This involves cutting the workforce by 160 people. It is expected that the staff reduction will take place over a three-year period, with management hoping the reduction can be obtained through voluntary redundancies.  The site currently employs 497 people.IDA is continuously working with the company with regard to skills and technology uplifts and the introduction of new products to the facility to strengthen Schering-Plough Brinny's bid to secure its future as a strategic site in MSD and for future investment in upgrading the existing plant.  With IDA assistance, Schering-Plough Brinny will continue to make a significant contribution to the regional and national economy.  I am acutely aware of the impact of the job losses on employees and their families.  I have asked the State development agencies to make their full resources and services available to the employees affected by the company's decision.FÁS will meet with management and staff representatives at GSK and MSD to formulate a plan of action to deliver FÁS services and supports to the staff due to be made redundant in 2010 and future years.  The Cork County Enterprise Boards, together with Enterprise Ireland, will provide a range of supports and services to anyone wishing to start their own business.  Cork has been particularly successful in attracting foreign direct investment over the years.  Over the past 10 years, direct employment in IDA supported companies in Cork City and County has grown from just under 16,000 in 1999 to 20,000 now.In 2009, foreign direct investment decreased globally by 30% and the average scale of investment was smaller than in previous years.  Despite these trends, since 2009 IDA has announced 9 projects for Cork with a job potential of approximately 1,070.  While it is clear that we are operating in a very difficult economic environment, there are still investment opportunities in global markets and IDA will continue to compete vigorously for projects for Ireland.  IDA Ireland will continue to actively promote Cork and the advantages of locating in Cork.  In addition, since 2008, Enterprise Ireland (EI) has approved €50M approximately to client companies in the Cork area.  EI has a client base of over 700 companies in Co. Cork employing about 18,000 people.

The Bill, which has passed all stages in the Seanad and has completed Second Stage in the Dáil, aims to modernise and strengthen the existing arrangements for the making of Employment Regulation Orders and Registered Employment Agreements and to provide for their more effective operation. The Bill provides for a mechanism whereby the Minister makes the order giving effect to proposals for Employment Regulation Orders.The Bill provides for a number of amendments to the existing legislative framework surrounding the Joint Labour Committee (JLC) and Registered Employment Agreement (REA) systems, including improved procedures, and clear principles and policies to be taken into account by JLCs when formulating proposals for EROs. The Bill also provides that EROs and REAs will be given legal effect in future by Ministerial Order and that a perceived gap in the scope of parliamentary supervision will be filled by providing for Oireachtas scrutiny of these instruments.I also announced at the time of the publication of the Bill that I propose to introduce an additional provision in the Bill — to be effected by means of an amendment to the Bill at Committee Stage — to facilitate the inclusion in EROs and REAs of an "inability to pay" mechanism, along the lines of the mechanism provided in the National Minimum Wage Act, 2000 in the interests of further strengthening these mechanisms against future court challenges and to protect employment in situations where employers are faced with severe economic challenges.

The report includes 40 high level recommendations, supplemented by a number of sector-specific recommendations aimed at addressing barriers to growth and accelerating potential in particular sectors.The Forfás report notes that the Government's role in delivering the optimum environment for business requires a whole of Government response, involving a range of Departments and agencies.  I agree that such an approach is appropriate.  The whole of Government response is already reflected in existing structures through which Departmental officials and Ministers engage on a regular basis.  I am confident that these structures provide the basis to progress the delivery of the competitiveness agenda.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	593	The Government's five-year integrated plan for trade, tourism and investment aim to create 300,000 jobs.  The new plan, "Trading and Investing in a Smart Economy", is the first integrated strategy to promote overseas trade, tourism and investment.  With this new strategy, the Government aims to position Ireland for strong export-led growth to 2015, resulting in high levels of job creation.The Department of Social Protection has introduced the Employer Jobs (PRSI) Incentive Scheme.  Where an employer creates a new job and takes on a person who has been unemployed for 6 months or more, the employer will be fully exempted from the liability to pay PRSI for the first year of that employment.  I understand that, to date, there have been 849 applications under the scheme.  The Department of Education and Skills offers, through FAS, the Work Placement Programme, which provides up to 9 months work experience to 2,000 unemployed individuals.The Programme is open to all sectors of the economy, including the private and public sectors, as well as the community and voluntary sectors. Participants on the programme retain their existing social welfare entitlements for the duration of their placement.  At the end of September 2010, 1,916 individuals had commenced their placements under the Work Placement Programme (WPP).  A provider of a placement under the WPP can avail of the PRSI Exemption Scheme if they employ a person who has completed 3 months on the WPP. This will give employers an 8%-10% saving on employment costs for each new job created.The Labour Market Activation Fund was launched by the Tánaiste in March of this year, in order to assist in the creation of training and education provision for specific priority groups among the unemployed, namely the low skilled, and those formerly employed in declining sectors — construction, retail and manufacturing sectors, with particular emphasis on the under 35s and the long-term unemployed.  Following an open tender competition, 370 tenders were received. A total of sixty organisations have been successful in securing funding. These organisations encompass the private, not-for-profit and public sectors, providing approximately 12,000 training places for priority groups of the unemployed.The Fund provides an exciting mix of programmes covering a broad spectrum of activities in potential high growth areas of the economy. These programmes have been selected in order to deliver on Government's objective of strengthening our human capital by enhancing education and skills levels in line with the national Skills Strategy and the needs of the ‘Smart Economy'.Through the Department of Education and Skills, the Community Employment scheme provides eligible long term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a fixed term basis. The programme helps unemployed people to progress to the open labour market by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to work routine and assists them in enhancing and developing both their technical and personal skills.  In Budget 2010, an additional 500 community employment training places were announced bringing the total number of places available to 23,300.  The Government will continue to pursue a whole of economy strategy to support Irish firms, win foreign direct investment and increase visitor numbers in order to sustain and create job opportunities and boost economic output.

As regards listed companies (those on the main market of the Irish Stock Exchange), these have, for many years, been subject to the Combined Code on Corporate Governance, the provisions of which applied on a "comply or explain" basis. The Combined Code has recently been reviewed in the UK and revised in light of the financial crisis. The revised code, now known as the UK Corporate Governance Code, applies to Irish listed companies with effect from 30 September 2010. While the provisions of the new code will continue to apply on a comply or explain basis it will also be necessary for companies to state in their annual report how the main principles of the code (these are separate from provisions) are applied.The new code re-emphasises the role and responsibilities of the board. It recommends that all directors of such companies should be subject to annual re-election by shareholders. This should give shareholders a regular opportunity to take account, in deciding whether they should be re-elected, of the number of directorships held by an individual director and whether or not they are in a position to give sufficient time to the company to discharge their responsibilities effectively.  In addition, the new Code stresses the leadership role of the Chairman and provides that the Chairman report personally on the role and effectiveness of the board in the annual report. Furthermore, in addition to the board undertaking a formal and rigorous annual evaluation of its own performance and that of its committees and individual directors, the new code includes a new provision for external evaluation of the board at least every three years.The Irish Stock Exchange (ISE) and the Irish Association of Investment Managers (IAIM), who represent institutional investors here, jointly commissioned an independent and detailed review of the level of compliance by Irish listed companies with the Combined Code in Quarter 4 2009. The review showed that while listed companies are meeting disclosure obligations, further steps could be taken by boards to enhance the quality/meaningfulness/usefulness of disclosures contained in annual reports. The ISE and IAIM published a report in the matter in March 2010, which contains a number of recommendations for consideration by the boards of listed companies. The recommendations for enhanced disclosure focus largely on board issues such as board balance and board refreshment.The ISE has indicated that it proposes to implement these recommendations by including new provisions in their Listing Rules. Consultation on the exact nature of these provisions is ongoing but the ISE's intention is that these provisions will apply to Irish listed companies from the financial year commencing on or after 1 January 2011. Companies will be required to provide a separate statement in their annual reports on a comply or explain basis regarding these provisions.In relation to financial institutions and insurance companies, which are the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Finance and the Financial Regulator, the Regulator published a consultation paper setting out proposals for a Corporate Governance regime for these sectors earlier this year. One of the proposals in this paper is that the number of directorships of credit institutions and insurance companies held by a director should be limited to three.The consultation paper also proposes certain restrictions on the number of directorships a director of a financial institution or insurance company may hold overall.  I understand that the Financial Regulator received over 130 responses to the consultation paper and that it is hoped to finalise deliberations on the new regime in the coming weeks.  Finally, the European Commission is actively looking at the question of whether   Corporate Governance measures are needed at EU level both as regards financial institutions and listed companies, The Commission's intentions in respect of these matters are unlikely to become clear until 2011.

The Agreement (para 9.4) also commits the Government to bringing forward legislative proposals to prohibit the victimisation of trade union members and to prohibit the incentivisation of persons not to be members of a trade union.In furtherance to these commitments, two informal meetings took place late last year, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach and at which my Department; the Department of Finance; trade unions; and employers were represented. Position papers were prepared by the employer and trade union representatives on the issues which they saw as requiring to be addressed by any new legislation in this area.While consideration will continue within Government on proposals to address the issues involved, progress in bringing the work to a conclusion will have to take account of other priority legislative commitments to be delivered in the employment area, resource constraints within Departments, and the extent of agreement between the trade union and employer sides in this area.

The Forfás Annual Competitiveness Report 2010 states that Ireland's regulatory environment is one of the least restrictive in the OECD in relation to product market regulation, the time taken to comply with tax payments is one of the lowest in the OECD across all categories and Ireland's employment framework is less rigid than the OECD average.The work to reduce red tape in Ireland is being progressed on two fronts. The High Level Group on Business Regulation works to fast-track simplifications to specific red tape issues identified by business; and an Inter-Departmental Group of officials from all Departments, having regulation affecting business, coordinates the measurement and reduction of administrative burdens in a systematic manner, based on the internationally recognized Standard Cost Model.  The High Level Group has processed thirty specific red tape issues brought to its attention by business and continues to drive progress on a further thirty-eight items. To date, the Group has measured over €20m of annual business savings and continues to work with business interests.In addition, further burden reductions achieved and in the process of being measured will contribute to the Government's overall target of 25% administrative burden reduction by 2012.

In addition, further burden reductions achieved, and in the process of being measured, will contribute to the Government's overall target of 25% administrative burden reduction by 2012.The measurement of administrative burdens using the Standard Cost Model is an exercise that was called for by business, as a baseline for the 25% administrative burden reduction programme, and is being carried out across all Departments with any substantive regulation that affects business.  My Department and the Central Statistics Office have already measured burdens arising from regulations under their responsibility and all other relevant Departments will shortly measure the current red tape costs on business arising from their regulation.  Measurement is expected to be completed in 2011 and, following this, simplification plans will be developed in consultation with stakeholders, for implementation.The Business Regulation Forum estimated that upwards of €500 million in annual savings for business would result from the 25% administrative burden reduction initiative.  A number of projects are already proceeding in Agencies and Departments across Government as part of their continuing drive to improve efficiency and streamline the interface with business and these will also contribute to the Government's overall target to reduce the administrative burden by 25%.

In 2005, the then Minister for Trade and Commerce asked the Company Law Review Group to consider the matter.  The Review Group recommended a revised text which was published as part of the Heads of the General Scheme of the Companies Consolidation and Reform Bill.  The Bill is currently being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	600	The strategy pursued by my Department is an integral part of the whole-of-government framework for economic recovery and growth adopted in 2008.  We are focused on employment creation through support for Irish firms — large and small — and winning foreign direct investment, to sustain and expand job opportunities and boost our economic output.  And they are achieving results.  Last month's official figures show strong growth in exports by Irish companies in the first eight months of this year. Exports are up 8% between June and July and our Trade surplus is up 29% to €4 billion.So far this year Enterprise Ireland, with funding from my Department, has delivered 32 overseas events including trade missions to Russia, Australia and the US. 645 companies participated and significant business has been won. EI brought 395 international buyers into Ireland to meet client companies and write new business. 63 international public procurement contracts for client companies have been won. EI believe that over 70% of exports lost in 2009 will be recovered in 2010.So far this year, 44 new High Potential Start Ups have been provided funding, 24 of these outside Dublin.  And there is a strong pipeline to the end of the year.  IDA Ireland has secured 75 investments to date in 2010, which have the potential to create 6,000 jobs.  These investments include the world's leading companies such as Stream, IBM and Google in Dublin, and United Healthcare, Lilly, and Electronic Arts. The majority of these companies are already in the process of recruiting staff.Building on these achievements, the new integrated Trade, Tourism and Investment strategy is global in scope and covers both existing and new high growth potential markets.  It sets out ambitious targets to be achieved by 2015 i.e. to create 300,000 new jobs in manufacturing, tourism and traded services, of which 150,000 will be direct new jobs, and another 150,000 will be generated through spin-off benefit.  The strategy presents a suite of actions for building on existing strengths and driving trade relations in existing as well as new and emerging economies.My Department is pursuing a number of other objectives in support of the achievement of the 300,000 jobs target, including a continued commitment to investing in Research, Development and Innovation, reducing Administrative Burdens on business, driving the response to the Innovation Taskforce, and addressing issues of Competitiveness.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	601	I propose to take Questions Nos. 101 and 245 together.My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social Protection.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.  I am circulating with this reply some information in tabular form.Table 1   sets out the number of statutory redundancy claims received in the years 2002 to 2009 and provisional figures for January to September 2010.  These figures reflect the number of employees who actually qualified for statutory redundancy lump sum payments.  They do not reflect those who lost their jobs with less than two years service in employment.  It is not possible to project the number of redundancies that will arise in 2010 as this will depend on a number of factors, including economic factors and the rate of recovery in the economy.  However, it is clear from the statistics available for the first nine months of 2010 that there is a welcome fall off in the level of new claims being lodged at my Department.  In the nine month period January to September 2010, an average fall off in claims received of 20% is in evidence over the corresponding nine-month period in 2009 — 47,587 as opposed to 58,202.Table 2   sets out the monies paid out of the Social Insurance Fund in respect of redundancy claims for the years 2002 — 2009 and up to 30 September, 2010.  It should be noted that all figures provided for 2009 and to date in 2010 are provisional figures.It is not possible to project the amount that will be paid out in 2010 on redundancy claims as this will hinge on a number of variables including the number of claims received, the length of service of individual claimants etc.The Redundancy Payments Section of my Department is currently processing rebate claims from employers in general dating from March 2010 so that the waiting time is currently between 6 and 7 months.  In respect of lump sum payments paid directly to employees in instances where employers are unable to pay the statutory redundancy entitlements, claims dating from March 2010 are currently being processed.  Of course in some instances, where the necessary supporting documentation for lump sum claims is not provided to my Department, or where queries arise, processing of claims can be further delayed until the required documentation is provided and/or outstanding queries are resolved.Efforts continue to be made by my Department to reduce claims processing times.  Measures already taken in the Department to alleviate the pressures on the Payments area include:Almost doubling the number of staff   working solely on redundancy payment claims through reassignment to a current level of 52 full time equivalents;Prioritisation of the Department's overtime budget   towards staff in the Section to tackle the backlog outside normal hours;Establishment of a special call handling facility  in NERA to deal with the huge volume of telephone calls from people and businesses concerned about their payments;Better quality information relating to current processing times on the Department's website;Engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate the offset of redundancy rebate payments   by employers against existing outstanding tax liabilities which those employers owe to the Revenue Commissioners.The backlog and waiting times remain at unacceptable levels.  However, improvements are evident.   In 2009, my Department processed 50,664 claims, up 70% on the previous year.  Furthermore, the level of new claims processed in the first nine months of 2010 was 58,202 — up over 81% on the corresponding 9-month period in 2009 (32,127) and surpassing the total amount of claims processed for the full year 2009 which came to 50,644.  The backlog of claims is decreasing — reducing from its highest level in November 2009 of 43,608 to a current level of 29,776.Responsibility for the payment functions arising under the Redundancy and Insolvency payment schemes is due to be transferred to the Department of Social Protection with effect from 1 January 2011.  In transferring the functions between Departments, it is the intention that this will operate seamlessly and without any adverse impact on the service levels being experienced by individuals or the business community awaiting payment of redundancy claims.YearNumber of Redundancy Claims200224,432200325,769200425,041200523,156200623,684200725,459200840,607200977,001201047,587**Provisional figures.YearExpenditure on Statutory Redundancy€000200253,978200388,9332004152,1622005149,1722006166,4832007183,3282008193,7112009335,861*2010363,284**All figures for 2009 and 2010 are provisional subject to audit.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	602	The proposal for a Consumer Rights Directive was published in October 2008 and has been drafted on a full harmonisation basis which, if retained, would preclude member states from going beyond its protections in national legislation.Though some provisions of the proposed Directive would strengthen consumer rights in Ireland, others would potentially have a less positive effect. Concerns about the proposal's impact on Irish consumer rights centre mainly on its provisions on consumer remedies for faulty goods and in particular, as the Deputy's question suggests, on their implications for what is known as the right to reject.  By this is meant the right to return faulty goods, obtain a refund of the price, and, in so doing, to terminate the contract.  A fully harmonised provision along the lines proposed in the draft Directive would, if adopted, mean that the right to reject would be a remedy of second rather than first resort for faulty goods.I would like to assure the Deputy that my officials have expressed our reservations about the relevant aspects of the proposed Directive in clear and forthright terms. Those concerns were restated at political level at the Competitiveness Council in December 2009 and May 2010. I also raised our concerns directly with Vice-President Reding who now has responsibility for the proposal at a meeting I had with her on the occasion of the May Competitiveness Council.It is important to recognise that discussions on the proposed Directive have a considerable way to go at both official and ministerial level and in the European Parliament. The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection of the European Parliament is currently finalising its consideration of the proposal, and the proposal is expected to have a first reading in the Parliament before the end of the year.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	603	Consumer protection law obliges traders offering a product for sale to indicate the selling price and, where appropriate, the unit price of that product and to ensure that the indication of the selling price and of the unit price is clearly visible. Complaints in relation to products being offered for sale where the price or unit price is not clearly visible should be brought to the attention of the National Consumer Agency who have responsibility for enforcing consumer law.Insofar as instances where a wrong indication of price is concerned, traders who provide false information in relation to the price of a product may be engaging in a misleading commercial practice and may, therefore, be committing an offence under consumer law. Again instances of such practices should be referred to the National Consumer Agency in order that they can be investigated. I understand that the cases referred to by the Deputy follow on from concerted enforcement activity by the Agency in this area in the course of the first half of 2010.  This involved the Agency visiting 237 retail premises from which a total of 48   separate enforcement actions have been taken to date, of which 23 were compliance notices issued to traders who charged more for consumer goods than the price displayed.  In addition, I understand that a number of other cases will be before the courts in the coming months.  As I indicated previously,   I very much support the Agency’s proactive approach in this area which I am sure will act as a salutary reminder to those who would seek to mislead consumers through the provision of false information.I am satisfied that the law provides strong protections against traders who would seek to mislead consumers through the provision of false information, such as by the wrong indication of prices.

It has set a number of ambitious targets to be achieved by 2015 i.e. to create 150,000 new jobs (manufacturing, tourism and traded services).   The jobs total figure of 150,000 direct new jobs, is from agency estimates based on their growth targets over the strategy period to the end of 2015 i.e. 75,000 (IDA-Ireland), 60,000 (Enterprise Ireland) and 15,000 in the tourism sector.  The new strategy also foresees the creation of a similar number of new indirect jobs. This latter figure takes into account the differing impacts from new jobs in manufacturing and services based on the numbers of projects, job intensity, purchase of raw materials and services, re-spending of salaries, and impact of taxation.The overall objective of the strategy and action plan is to marshal and coordinate the resources of the State in a way that best supports firms, of all sizes, in all parts of the country, which are trying to trade and grow their business overseas. Its implementation will result in the sustained, concentrated and coordinated efforts of all the key Government Departments and agencies, including our embassies and consulates abroad in support for Irish companies in overseas markets. Departments and agencies will implement the strategy and action plan from within their current budgets.The strategy presents a suite of actions for building on existing strengths and driving trade relations in existing as well as new and emerging economies. These actions are aimed at: strengthening Ireland's international image and brand; strengthening in-country presence and support; developing and internationalising our enterprise base; developing Ireland as a hub for global high-technology enterprises and clusters; aligning visa policy with priorities in the strategy; support for SMEs; continuing to develop international trade agreements; joint actions and partnerships with other countries; effective engagement with the business community.The new Foreign Trade Council to drive implementation of the strategy and action plan will hold its inaugural meeting on 27 October 2010. The terms of reference and membership will be in line with Section 6.11 of the Strategy. The membership will comprise the relevant Departments and agencies. It will be managed by my Department from within existing resources.

Following the announcement, FÁS contacted the company and has since been heavily engaged in providing its full range of services to the workers being made redundant.  This has included 11 days on-site by FÁS and one-to-one interviews with employees.  In 2009, foreign direct investment decreased globally by 30% and the average scale of investment was smaller than in previous years.  Despite these trends, since 2009 IDA has announced 9 projects for Cork with a job potential of approximately 1,070.IDA Ireland is actively promoting the greater East Cork region (which includes Cobh, Little Island, Carrigtwohill, Midleton and Youghal) to prospective investors across the full range of IDA targeted sectors, such as Pharmaceuticals, Medical Technologies, Information and Communications Technologies (ICT), Clean Technologies and Global Business Services via its network of overseas offices and project divisions.While the town of Youghal has experienced a significant loss of employment in recent years, employment in overseas companies in the East Cork area has grown significantly.  Cork has been particularly successful in attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) over the years.  Over the past 10 years, direct employment in IDA supported companies in Cork City and County has grown from just under 16,000 in 1999 to 20,000 now.    In addition, since 2008, Enterprise Ireland (EI) has approved €50M approximately to client companies in the Cork area.  EI has a client base of over 700 companies in Co. Cork employing about 18,000 people.

Amgen subsequently entered into contracts to purchase the entire holding from IDA and, in 2006, applied for Planning Permission for a Bulk Manufacturing facility and associated works.  Site ground works commenced in late 2006.  The terms of the agreement, between IDA and Amgen included a provision for the reversion of the beneficial interest in the site to IDA in the event of the project not proceeding and this occurred formally in January 2010.In October 2007, Amgen announced a postponement of its Cork Project.  At that time Amgen gave an undertaking to maintain the site in a good secure manner in order to protect the asset and maintain good local community relations.  Amgen subsequently concluded that it no longer wishes to proceed with the project.  In keeping with the terms of the agreement, ownership of the Carrigtwohill site has now reverted to IDA Ireland.  IDA Ireland will continue to market this Strategic Site and the Cork City Gateway.

As for other offices and agencies, this has included frequent discussion between my Department and IDA and between myself and the IDA Chairman Mr Liam O'Mahony. My Department has maintained similar contacts with the Department of Finance, as I have with my colleague the Minister for Finance.The staffing level for the period 2010 to 2012 for IDA has now been determined in the context of the Employment Control Framework currently being finalised with the Department of Finance.  In that process, approval has been given to the agency to fill 10 vacant posts which it had requested.  The Agency has confirmed to me that the levels of staff agreed will enable it to achieve the industrial employment and other targets set out for the 5 year period 2010 to 2014.

I am aware of an arrangement whereby insurance companies actively recommend certain approved repairers to their policyholders with the approved repairers selected on the basis that they meet various qualitative standards and, in return, are guaranteed a minimum flow of work. Service Level Agreements are generally entered into by the insurance company and the approved repairer.The Competition Authority, which is the independent statutory body responsible for enforcing competition law in the State, has previously advised my Department that such arrangements do not appear to breach competition law but, in fact, appear to result in a more cost effective service being provided to the general public.  It is, of course, open to any aggrieved party alleging anti-competitive practices, including abuse of a dominant position, to take a private action under Section 14 of the Competition Act 2002.

I have received the Review Group's Report at the conclusion of its 2008-2009 Work Programme and I am considering its recommendations in the context of the drafting by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel (OPC) of the Companies Consolidation and Reform Bill. The Report is available on the CLRG's website at www.clrg.org.While there is no obligation on my part to legislate in respect of any recommendation from the CLRG, the main focus of the Group's work to date has been in relation to the General Scheme of the Companies Consolidation and Reform Bill which was published in July 2007. The proposed Bill will consolidate all the existing Irish Companies Acts, dating from 1963 to 2009, as well as other Regulations and common law provisions relating to the incorporation and operation of companies into a single Act, comprising more than 1,300 sections. Given its size and complexity it is envisaged that the Bill will be published in 2012.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	610	Access to bank credit for businesses, particularly SMEs, has been central to Government Initiatives in addressing the crisis in the banking sector. Both the 2009 and 2010 Bank Recapitalisation arrangements provided specific commitments from the recapitalised banks to assist SMEs.  Under the 2010 Bank Recapitalisation arrangement, AIB and Bank of Ireland have both committed to making available not less than €3 billion each for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs in both 2010 and 2011. This must include funds for working capital for businesses.  The Credit Review Office is closely monitoring AIB's and Bank of Ireland's lending policies and their lending commitments in 2010 and 2011. The Credit Review Office is also available to pursue cases where SMEs are refused credit from the recapitalised banks.Over recent months, I have met separately with Allied Irish Banks, Anglo Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland to discuss the availability of bank credit for businesses, especially SMEs. The last such meeting with Bank of Ireland. took place in early September.  On 26 July 2010, my colleagues, Ministers Brian Lenihan and Eamonn Ryan, and I held a further meeting with AIB to discuss that bank's lending practices to SME's.  At the various meetings, I raised concerns about the claims of many small businesses that some bankers were stonewalling loan requests and were not providing credit to viable enterprises. I reminded the banks of the purpose of the recapitalisation package and of the huge investment of taxpayers' money into the banks aimed at getting our economy moving again.The message from the two main banks was that they were open for business and available to provide credit to viable businesses. They assured me that they were fully committed to supporting businesses and would meet the requirements laid down for them in the recapitalisation package of 30 March 2010.  I have ongoing contact with the main banks in relation to their lending to businesses and will, together with my colleague the Minister for Finance, and John Trethowan of the Credit Review Office, continue to ensure that they meet their lending commitments under the 2010 Recapitalisation package in terms of providing sufficient credit to the business sector. In this regard, John Trethowan recently indicated that the situation was much more positive for bank customers than it was six to nine months ago.

Following a very positive meeting in May this year when I met senior Kraft Foods executives, Enterprise Ireland has been in ongoing discussions with Cadbury Ireland in relation to the planned investment programme, the redundancy programme and the Kraft/Cadbury integration process.  The redundancy programme announced in June 2009, which will reduce the workforce by 200 people, is progressing following agreement with all key employee groups at Coolock and at its facility at Rathmore.Kraft Foods has outlined its commitment to planned investments by Cadbury Ireland in its manufacturing facilities, which are currently being implemented.  The investment in new chocolate moulding technology for the Coolock plant, which is grant supported by Enterprise Ireland, has been agreed and commissioning is underway.  Enterprise Ireland met with management of the Cadbury's facility in Tallaght on the 17 September and support is being provided by the agency to initiate a strategic training and management development programme as well as a research and development programme.   Interaction is ongoing to facilitate the plant in its drive to improve competitiveness and to develop new added value products.The Government has outlined its commitment towards working in partnership with Kraft Foods to explore and to capitalise on strategic opportunities that Cadbury Ireland can deliver.  Enterprise Ireland will continue to actively engage with Kraft Foods and Cadbury Ireland on strategic initiatives relating to research and development, improving competitiveness and strengthening manufacturing operations.

The attached tabular statement shows the number of projects won in each of those years.One of the high level targets set out in IDA's strategy "Horizon 2020" is that 640 investments will be won in the period 2010 to 2014.  Ireland continues to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) from many of the world's leading companies and, to date 2010 has been promising.  There have been 63 announcements in relation to new and expansion investments, with the potential to create over 4,600 jobs.  Of course, some projects go ahead without any announcement.As the investment Agency charged with the attraction of foreign direct investment to Ireland, IDA executives are in constant discussion with potential investors throughout the world.  In addition, as Minister, I regularly meet with and have discussions with potential foreign investors both here in Ireland and abroad on promotional visits arranged by IDA.  These discussions work towards the creation of a pipeline of new business.Year2006200720082009Number of projects won125114130125
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	613	It is evident from international research that providing suitable property solutions for sale or rent to newly-establishing industrial projects is often a key element in the attraction and facilitation of such projects.  In Ireland it has since the late 1950s been an integral part of industrial policy that the State, through the industrial development agencies, will have available land that is suitable, zoned and serviced for industrial purposes, so as to ensure that industrial projects will not be prevented or delayed in setting up operations.  When land or buildings are sold or leased to industries the assets are transferred at market prices.The industrial property scheme is operated by Shannon Development in the Mid West region and part of Offaly, and in the rest of the country by IDA.  IDA and Shannon Development provide land and buildings both for their own client companies and for Enterprise Ireland client companies.  Shannon's property holdings have a somewhat broader sectoral coverage than IDA's, reflecting the fact that Shannon's remit extends to matters such as regional development, tourism and energy.Income from property sales is usually retained by the agencies and re-invested in property development activities focused on promoting industrial jobs and exports.  The property function exercised by both IDA and Shannon is largely a self-financing operation, although the State has on occasion contributed investment funding.  For example, as part of the National Spatial Strategy focus on Gateway development, IDA acquired ‘large scale sites' in the Gateways and some Exchequer funding was provided for that purpose.  The Shannon Development property operation, in addition to meeting the ‘self-financing' criterion, also covers the pay and non-pay current costs of running the agency, as Shannon Development has operated a self-financing model since the 1990's.I am satisfied that there is a justified rationale for the existence of a property programme within the Agencies, and that it operates in a streamlined fashion.  The McCarthy Review Group on State Assets and Liabilities is at present reviewing all State assets and liabilities and the Group's conclusions will be considered by Government in due course.

A Government Statement on the progress made issued in April.  The Government has decided that it will review, twice-yearly, progress on the implementation of Competition Authority recommendations and, in line with this decision, I will be updating the Government in the coming weeks on the progress achieved to date.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	615	The enterprise development agencies under my Department's remit have, as a matter of course, collaborated extensively on an on-going basis through a range of formal and informal mechanisms.  However, in 2009, my Department established a High Level Group comprising representatives of each agency to identify areas for further collaboration.  In addition to involving my own Department's agencies, the High Level Group also includes a representative from Údarás na Gaeltachta.  The Group has made progress in a number of areas, for example in ensuring that access to supports is defined by business need rather than agency "ownership", in enhanced sharing of information, and in identifying initiatives to maximise potential synergies between foreign and indigenous firms.  The Group will to continue to identify areas where agency collaboration can be strengthened and where the effectiveness of support to enterprises can be improved.The recently published Forfás report Making it Happen — Growing Enterprise for Ireland   includes a specific recommendation that programme evaluations should be carried out to ensure that the programmes managed by the enterprise development agencies under my Department’s remit are efficiently and effectively delivered.  The report recommends that, as a priority, at least one programme evaluation should be carried out by mid 2011.  I am currently considering the most appropriate means of conducting these evaluations as part of my Department’s overall response to the report and its recommendations.

One of these Directives is currently overdue: Directive 2006/123/EC on services in the internal market.  This Directive will be signed into law by me very shortly.My Department has received 27 Reasoned Opinions from the European Commission relating to Directives since 2002.  These issues have all been settled apart from one remaining Reasoned Opinion received on 24 June 2010 regarding the non transposition of the Services Directive 2006/123/EC.  Full details of the state of play of all current Directives due for transposition are maintained on the Department's website, www.deti.ie.  The transposition of EU Directives is an ongoing priority in my Department and is reported to the Management Board on a regular basis.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	617	Since I became Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, in March last I have undertaken one marketing trip organised by IDA for the purposes of attracting foreign direct Investment (FDI) to this country, to the US in April 2010, and I am due to undertake another such visit to the US in the last week of October.During these visits, I meet and have discussions with Chairmen, CEOs and other senior executives of key companies across a range of sectors.  Many of the companies already have substantial and valuable activities in Ireland while some are considering major investments here for the first time.  In addition, the Taoiseach and other Ministers, when they are abroad on official business, also meet with senior executives of multinational companies to discuss investment in this country.  When the Taoiseach went to the United States last St Patrick's Day, he was accompanied by Barry O'Leary, Chief Executive of IDA, and that itinerary included meetings with a number of high level investing companies.Of course I have also met a number of potential foreign direct investors on many occasions in this country since my appointment.  In addition, senior executives of IDA Ireland are in constant discussion with potential investors around the globe.  While all these meetings and discussions work towards the creation of a pipeline of new business, it is impossible to link the number of jobs created in any one year to discussions/ marketing undertaken in that year.  The business of FDI generation is a complex process that takes place over a period of time and is not necessarily completed in any one year.There has been a steady stream of job announcements by IDA supported companies and to date in 2010 there have been 63 announcements with the potential to create over 4,600 jobs across a range of sectors.  In addition to missions to attract FDI, my predecessor, the Tánaiste, my Ministers of State and I have, in the last 12 months led eighteen Enterprise Ireland organised trade missions to the following locations: London, Paris, Rennes, Moscow, Madrid, Barcelona, Warsaw, Libya, Australia, USA, Dusseldorf, Canada, United Arab Emirates and China.These Trade Missions are an integral part of the work of both my Department and Enterprise Ireland (EI) to develop and expand Ireland's exports to existing and new markets abroad.  They raise Ireland's profile as a world-class supplier of goods and tradeable services, and increase awareness of Ireland as well as projecting Ireland as a competitive source of world-class expertise and products.  They win access for EI clients to key decision-makers and influencers in target sectors.

The CEBs can assist micro-enterprises i.e. businesses with 10 employees or fewer and are to the forefront in supporting viable business start-ups and in assisting the development of growth-orientated micro-enterprises which can generate job creation at a local level and which, over time, can develop into strong export entities and transfer to the Enterprise Ireland portfolio.  The CEBs can provide both direct financial assistance in the form of Priming Grants, Business Expansion Grants and Feasibility Grants and non-financial assistance in the form of Programmes such as Start Your Own Business Programmes, Business Training and Management Programmes, Mentoring Programmes etc.  In providing support to the micro-enterprise sector the CEBs must give priority to manufacturing and internationally traded services.  The CEBs work closely with other Agencies such as Enterprise Ireland and with other Bodies active in their local area such as LEADER, Partnership Groups etc and where a CEB is not in a position to support a client they will direct them to another appropriate organisation.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	619	On Thursday last, 7th October, I undertook an Enterprise Ireland Trade promotion visit to London.  The programme included meetings with relevant officials of the London Olympics Development Authority and with Irish companies involved in pursuing contracts on that major project.  For a number of these companies, the Olympics has acted as a key driver of internationalisation activity and significant contracts have already been won by them.  This was an opportunity to build on that success, as a considerable amount of work on the project remains to be carried out with significant contracts yet to be awarded.In addition, I officiated at an event for a group of 32 Enterprise Ireland companies in the renewable energy and energy efficiency sectors.  This was organised to help them develop new opportunities in doing business in Britain and I was able to meet senior executives representing their British customers and partners.  It was an opportunity to demonstrate the importance of Ireland as a source of high quality energy solutions and services, as illustrated by the wide-ranging capability and experience of the companies attending.

The capital allocation for the CEBs in 2010 is almost €15m.  This allocation represents a strong State investment in the micro-enterprise sector notwithstanding the significant pressure on the Public finances.  I expect to be in a position shortly to announce additional capital allocations to the CEBs from within my Departments Vote to meet their demand for funds to support approved job creation requests from clients over the remainder of this year.  However, I will be working with my Ministerial Colleagues to ensure we maximise the use of available funding for enterprise including the Leader Programme.

Responsibility for statistical information rests with the Central Statistics Office (CSO).  Information is collected by the CSO under a new format under the EU Business Demography Regulation which only came into force in late 2007 and is subsequently published under the CSO Business Demography returns.  I understand that some preliminary information covering business cessations, or "enterprise deaths" under the CSO classification, should be released by the CSO in November.Information relating to company liquidations over the last two years provided by the Companies Registration Office is contained in the table attached below.  It should be noted that this information covers companies of all sizes and that members liquidations would involve solvent companies.  The Government's priority is to ensure that the business environment continues to be supportive of enterprises.  Addressing the needs of SMEs is a particular priority that my Department will continue to support.Our Enterprise Development Agencies continue to play a key role in stimulating the development of new businesses, facilitating the expansion of existing companies and targeting new foreign direct investment through a broad range of initiatives, including direct financial and non-financial supports to enterprises.  These supports are aimed at improving productivity, market knowledge, competitiveness and leadership and management capabilities so that firms can compete successfully and grow their businesses and exports.The Government have significantly expanded the range of measures and supports specifically targeted to assist unemployed individuals to get back into employment.  The Department of Education and Skills have almost doubled the job search support capacity of FÁS this year to over 154,000 referrals from the National Employment Action Plan. From a training and education perspective, this year the Department of Education and Skills will be providing:Over 160,000 training and employment places for the unemployed.

The financial crises within the banking sector has had and will continue to have, implications for employment levels within individual banks.  It is a commercial matter for the banks concerned to determine their staffing requirements having regard to changes in banking practices and re-structuring arrangements.  In the context of job losses arising, banks are required to follow statutory industrial relations procedures including notification and consultation with staff and providing for appropriate redundancy arrangements.  The staff complement of the banks represent a highly-skilled resource and I would expect that any bank reducing staff numbers would provide appropriate assistance and guidance for staff leaving.The full State support mechanisms will be available to any staff let go by the banks, including, in particular, the measures and supports specifically targeted to assist unemployed individuals to get back into employment.  The Department of Education and Skills have almost doubled the job search support capacity of FÁS this year to over 154,000 referrals from the National Employment Action Plan.

The Court subsequently invited submissions on the issue.  Various submissions were received, including from IBEC, ICTU and the Department of Finance.  The Labour Court also held discussions with these parties.Under the National Minimum Wage Act, 2000, the Labour Court can seek to establish, in the context of such consultations, whether a general agreement can be reached between the parties.  If, however, the Labour Court is satisfied that such a general agreement cannot be reached, it may still make a recommendation.  The Labour Court has not made any recommendation to date in relation to the application made under the National Minimum Wage, 2000.  It would be inappropriate for me to comment further while the matter is still with the Court.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	624	Access to bank credit for businesses, particularly SMEs, has been central to Government Initiatives in addressing the crisis in the banking sector.  Both the 2009 and 2010 Bank Recapitalisation arrangements provided specific commitments from the recapitalised banks to assist SMEs.Under the 2010 Bank Recapitalisation arrangement, AIB and Bank of Ireland have both committed to making available not less than €3 billion each for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs in both 2010 and 2011.  This must include funds for working capital for businesses.  Their lending plans were reviewed by the Credit Review Office and the Department of Finance and were found to be credible.  Both the Credit Reviewer, Mr. John Trethowan, and the Department of Finance receive monthly progress reports from the two banks which allows them to ensure that they deliver on the strong commitments given in their plans to support viable businesses in all sectors of the economy and in every area of the country.  The Credit Review Office is also available to pursue cases where SMEs are refused credit from the recapitalised banks.The first Quarterly Report published by the Credit Review Office last July outlined that Office's outcome in reviewing the lending policies and guidelines of the banks concerned and also presented the Office's experience emerging from the initial cases reviewed by it.  These issues will continue to be reported on in subsequent quarterly reports.I would urge any viable SME's who have been refused credit by any of the recapitalised banks to make use of the review services of the Credit Review Office.  Applicants for bank credit should ensure they submit formal applications to their banks so that outcomes on these applications can be closely monitored and information gaps identified.I have ongoing contact with the main banks in relation to their lending to businesses and will, together with my colleague the Minister for Finance, and John Trethowan of the Credit Review Office, continue to ensure that they meet their lending commitments under the 2010 Recapitalisation package in terms of providing sufficient credit to the business sector.

I understand this initiative is part of a wider strategy to update the domestic regulatory framework applying to credit institutions and insurance undertakings and that the Regulator plans to develop corporate governance frameworks for other sectors of the financial services industry such as funds and credit unions.The Financial Regulator envisages that while the proposed new rules should apply to all credit institutions and insurance undertakings, he has not adopted a one-size-fits-all approach.  I welcome the Regulator's openness to implementing the rules proportionately, where appropriate, and to recognise institutions with a lesser economic significance and lower risk activities.  I understand the Financial Regulator has received over 130 responses to the consultation paper.  I also understand these responses have been considered by the Regulator and that it is hoped to complete deliberations on the new regime in the coming weeks.  I look forward to seeing the new corporate governance standards for the financial sector published by the Regulator in due course.

The programme provides vouchers worth €5,000 to enable a small business to seek assistance, whether skill or knowledge, from publicly funded researchers to address problems or proposals in relation to the business activity.The Initiative aims to drive an innovation cultural shift within small enterprise by promoting and encouraging a transfer of knowledge between Ireland's public knowledge providers and the small business community and in the process creating on-going and lasting synergies between the two.  Small companies across the Irish economy are eligible to apply for an Innovation Voucher, apart from enterprises in the transportation and agricultural sectors which are excluded in accordance with EU State Aid guidelines.  Companies can apply for more than one voucher and up to 10 companies may pool their vouchers for a single project.Innovation Vouchers can be used for any kind of innovation such as:new business model development;new service delivery and customer interface;new service development; ortailored training in innovation management.Through this initiative Irish companies are being supported to rapidly and effectively develop and commercialise new processes, products and services, profitably.  They are helped to acquire, develop and integrate the technologies and supporting knowledge required.  They are also supported in developing the leadership skills and capability of company management necessary to drive innovation.The level of interest and engagement by companies speaks for itself — 1098 Vouchers worth almost €5 million have been redeemed by small companies since the programme was launched in mid-2007.  The initiative is clearly both successful and popular with small Irish business.  It is playing an important role by opening up access for small companies to a wide source of innovative acumen.  It has also encouraged a transfer of knowledge between Third Level educational institutions or research providers to the business community, very often at local level.Feedback from companies has been positive, confirming that the application procedures, level of funding, the low level of bureaucracy and the frequency of calls are welcome features of the initiative.  Since the programme was introduced, Enterprise Ireland has continued to improved the support and assistance that is provided to assist the engagement of companies with the third level sector.  A web site was introduced to assist companies in identifying the location of the various areas of skills and knowledge in academic and research institutions.Companies can avail of two standard Innovation Vouchers totalling €10,000.  After that they can avail of co-funded vouchers, a new initiative introduced in 2010.  The Co-Funded Vouchers are awarded to companies who are willing to pay half the cost of the research project and to date 30 companies have availed of these new vouchers.This year, discussions with the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food led to an expansion of the scheme to target Food Companies, and a new Innovation Voucher call was introduced for the Food Sector.  The call took place in July/August 2010 and resulted in the award of 114 (€570,000) vouchers aimed particularly at encouraging small food companies to begin collaborating with colleges.  This is part of a new approach directed at building on the current success of the scheme and it is planned that other specific sectors will be targeted.  Improvements will continue to be put in place, to make participation easier as experience is gained, and to help business people identify the key researcher who is best placed to address their proposal.

To date in 2010, 16 of the 63 investments announced are located outside of Dublin and Cork.  Of the remaining 47 projects announced, 39 are located in Dublin and 8 are located in Cork.  The locations of the 16 projects located outside of Dublin and Cork are set out in the attached tabular statement.IDA is fully committed to securing a balance in regional development including winning investment for the Border Region.  The challenge in achieving an even spread of investment is intensified as the sophistication of investments increases.  A key aspect of the high value, knowledge intensive FDI, for which Ireland now competes, is that it increasingly favours locations in or near centres of urban scale, where it has access to the concentrations of infrastructure, skills and services it needs.Frequently, competition for Foreign Direct Investment comes from city regions with populations in excess of one million people.  Dublin is the only recognised city region of scale in Ireland.  If FDI is to continue to contribute to balanced regional development the other regions of the country must be promoted as regions of scale with urban centres that provide the range of infrastructure and services that high value investment projects demand.  IDA continues to vigorously promote such regions to potential investors.While IDA Ireland continues its focus on winning investment for locations outside of Dublin and Cork, it must be remembered that in the final analysis it is the investor who decides where to locate.DateCompanyLocationOriginInvest.Jobs19/01/10StreamServeGalwayUSN/A2026/01/10Freund CorporationTullamore, Co.

I am satisfied that a greater reduction than suggested by the Group is desirable in order to deal with the issues of scale and taking into account the current and prospective requirements of the education sector.The Government has decided to reduce the overall number of VECs from 33 to 16 and has decided on the merger of particular counties in order to arrive at the new configuration.  Many of the detailed aspects of the restructuring will fall to be considered and worked through by my Department in conjunction with the VECs involved in any one merger before decisions are taken.

Agreement on transitional arrangements for the pilot centres was reached following a long process of discussions and engagement with the representative body of the pilot centres.  Each of the centres has now applied for special school status.  I am pleased to advise you that I have been able to respond positively to applications and all, but one, of the centres have now been granted recognition as special schools for children with autism.  The application from the remaining centre is currently being processed.The Department is committed to ensuring that all children with autism can have access to an education appropriate to their needs preferably in school settings through the primary and post primary school network.  This facilitates access to individualised education programmes, fully qualified professional teachers who may draw from a range of autism-specific interventions, including ABA, special needs assistants, and the appropriate school curriculum.I fully appreciate that change in any organisation can cause concern and anxiety.  This is particularly true when the organisation is a centre catering for children with special educational needs.  However, I understand that each of the centres engaged with parents and staff before applying for special school status.Managers have been appointed by the Patrons to manage the transitional process from centre to special school.  As part of this process, my Department is arranging for training in a range of autism-specific interventions for the new Principals and Teachers once they have been appointed.  In addition, training is being provided for the Managers and the new Boards of Management.  It is my intention to continue to support the transitional process.

The safety and welfare of pupils travelling on school transport services are of paramount importance to my Department and Bus Éireann, which operates the school transport services on behalf of my Department.Bus Éireann is responsible for matters such as the planning of bus routes, the timetabling of services and the designation of pick up and set down points in such a way as to ensure that, as far as possible, pupils have a reasonable level of service consistent with school transport policy while at the same time, ensuring that school transport vehicles are fully utilised in an efficient and cost effective manner.  Parents/Guardians have a responsibility to ensure that their children are brought safely to and collected safely from designated pick up and set down points.  There is no provision within the scheme to facilitate pupils with pick up or set down points on existing bus routes other than those designated by Bus Éireann.

The application has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects and assigned a Band 2 rating.  Information in respect of the current school building programme along with all assessed applications for major capital works, including this project, is available on the Department's website at www.education.ie.The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of the Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.  However, in light of current competing demands on the Department's capital budget, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of a project at the school in question at this time.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	635	I can confirm that the school to which the Deputy refers has applied to my Department for major capital funding.  All applications for large scale capital funding are assessed against published prioritisation criteria which were introduced in 2004 following consultation with the Education Partners.  Under the criteria, each project is assigned a Band Rating which reflects the type of works required and the urgency attaching to them.  There are four Band Ratings in all, with Band 1 being the highest and Band 4 the lowest.  Projects are progressed in accordance with the Band rating assigned to them and the availability of funding.  The application from this school has been assessed in accordance with the criteria and assigned a band 1.1 rating.In 2005, the school was selected as one which was suitable for delivery of its building project under the Permanent Accommodation Scheme 2005 and the school authority was offered funding of €300,000 to build an extension.  The school authority accepted this offer and proceeded with the planning of this project while, at the same time, appealing the amount allocated to the project under the scheme.  Subsequently, the school authority notified the Department that they had decided to withdraw from the scheme and requested that they be progressed to delivery by the traditional method.In January 2007, the school was notified that the long term projected staffing would be Principal plus 8 assistant mainstream class teachers.  As the existing school site could not accommodate a new 8 classroom school, the Patron offered adjacent parish land to accommodate the provision of a new 8 classroom school building.The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.  The Department is committed to providing suitable high quality accommodation for St. Catherine's National School.  However, in light of current tight economic circumstances, and with competing demands on the capital budget, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.In the meantime the Department is in receipt of an application for additional accommodation to accommodate additional Special Education Resource hours.  I am pleased to advise you that the application has been approved and my Department will be in contact with the school authority in this regard in the coming days.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	636	The selection and enrolment of pupils in schools is the responsibility of the authorities of the individual school. My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in an area. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. As schools may not have a place for every applicant, a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.Under section 15(2)(d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected.  Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, or in the case of a Vocational Educational Committee (VEC) school to the VEC in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school. My Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a pupil, except in the case of an appeal under Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 being upheld.The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The NEWB will be able to offer assistance and advice on securing a school placement. I understand the NEWB have been in contact with the parents of the student in question on the matter.  The Deputy will be aware that the home tuition scheme provides funding to parents to provide education at home for children who, for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school. The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting a suitable educational placement and also to provide early educational intervention for pre-school children with autism.

In that regard, I wish to inform the Deputy that there are no specific proposals at present to make changes to the Community Employment Scheme in Waterford.  The Employment Programmes and Services and Skills Training (Transfer of Departmental Administration and Ministerial Functions) Order of 2010, which came into force on 1 May 2010, provided for the reallocation of responsibility for FÁS as an Agency and its funding related to training and skills from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation to my Department.  Responsibility for the employment service and community service activities of FÁS and its related funding has also transferred to my Department.  However, following the enactment of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2010 in July, the Department of Social Protection will, following commencement of the relevant sections of the Act, assume funding and overall responsibility of FÁS employment services and community services which would include the Community Employment Programme.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	638	I propose to take Questions Nos. 142 and 148 together.I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners, who are responsible for the collection of tobacco products tax, and for tackling the illicit trade in cigarettes and tobacco products, that there is no internationally recognised method for precisely determining the amount of tax lost as a result of the illicit trade in cigarettes.  However, on the basis of a 2009 survey carried out independently on behalf of Revenue and the Office of Tobacco Control, Revenue estimates that approximately 20% of cigarettes consumed in the State had not been taxed in this jurisdiction.  It is important to emphasise that this estimate includes both illicit cigarettes and legal cross-border purchases brought into the State for personal consumption.  Revenue would further tentatively estimate that this figure of 20% comprises 14% illicit product and 6% legal cross-border purchases. Based on an estimate of 14%, the loss of excise duty to the exchequer from illicit cigarette consumption during 2009 would be in the region of €200m.The strategy of the Revenue Commissioners for tackling this illicit trade is multi-faceted.  It includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, ongoing review of operational policies, development of analytics and deployment of detection technologies, optimum deployment of resources at point of importation and internally to intercept the contraband product and to prosecute those involved.Interception at the point of importation is achieved through a combination of risk analysis, profiling, intelligence, and the screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages.  Revenue enforcement officers also target this illicit trade at the post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.  Revenue and An Garda Síochána also carry out regular multi-agency operations, particularly in relation to large maritime importations and in checks at inland markets.In relation to the staff resources available to combat cigarette smuggling, enforcement officers are deployed at all key ports and airports. While staffing levels have generally remained static during the period in question, they are subject to continuous review, and staff numbers deployed at these locations are often augmented by additional staff from other areas when specific operations are organised. Although Revenue's overall staff numbers have been reduced over the past two years in the context of Government policy on civil service numbers, Revenue has ensured that the resources deployed in this work have been maintained.In terms of detection equipment resources, a second mobile X-ray container scanner, to augment the one first deployed in 2006, was commissioned by Revenue in January 2010 and is now fully operational. Container scanning is one of a number of detection technology applications used to detect contraband. However, its deployment must take into account the principle of free movement of goods within the Community as well as the objective of minimal disruption to legitimate trade.  Revenue also uses a tobacco detection dog in addition to the smaller baggage/ parcel scanners which are deployed at all major ports, airports and postal depots. Two new X-ray scanners were also purchased within the last 12 months for use in postal depots.Revenue's approach in relation to the detection of tobacco-related offences is under continuous review.  For example, in July of this year Revenue launched a nationwide tobacco operation, which concentrated additional Revenue resources at ports, airports and at various retail points for the purpose of identifying illicit tobacco products.  This resulted in 561 seizures totalling 13.7m cigarettes and 195 kgs tobacco in the course of the two-week period of the operation. Further such intensive operations are planned, to supplement the normal ongoing level of detection and enforcement activities.The Revenue Commissioners have also established a high level internal group, chaired at Commissioner level to examine the risks related to tobacco excise, and to monitor and optimise performance in relation to detection of counterfeit and contraband tobacco products. This group has promoted a number of initiatives aimed at counteracting the illicit trade in tobacco. These include improved profiling of passengers and freight to identify tobacco smugglers, the recent establishment of a tobacco hotline, coordinating national blitz style operations, evaluation and acquisition of scanning and other detection technologies and learning from best practice internationally.In relation to legislative measures, Revenue reviews the relevant legislation on an annual basis in the context of the Finance Act requirements and submits proposals to my department as necessary.  As regards the provision in the 2010 Finance Act which increased fines relating to tobacco smuggling, I am advised that due to the timeline involved in bringing indictable cases to court stage, it is too early as yet to assess the impact of the new penalties.The multi-faceted approach that Revenue has adopted has resulted in the seizure of 150m cigarettes and more than 2,400 kgs of tobacco to date this year. The details of the number of persons brought to court, convicted, imprisoned and fined for tobacco smuggling and the average fine for tobacco smuggling in each of the past five years and to date in 2010 are set out in the tables below.Offence CategoryNo. of ConvictionsFines TotalNo. of Prison Sentences ImposedOf which sentences were SuspendedNo. of Community Service Orders & Total HoursAverage Fines Imposed€€Cigarette Smuggling10541,850550400Cigarette Selling (Unstamped Tobacco Products)32,235000745Offence CategoryNo. of ConvictionsFines TotalNo. of Prison Sentences ImposedOf which sentences were SuspendedNo. of Community Service Orders & Total HoursAverage Fines Imposed€€Cigarette Smuggling14056,87510103,380 hours in total405Cigarette Selling (Unstamped Tobacco Products)65,775000965Offence CategoryNo. of ConvictionsFines TotalNo. of Prison Sentences ImposedOf which sentences were SuspendedNo. of Community Service Orders & Total HoursAverage Fines Imposed€€Cigarette Smuggling11847,76015131,180 Hours in total405Cigarette Selling (Unstamped Tobacco Products)33,4500001,150Offence CategoryNo. of ConvictionsFines TotalNo. of Prison Sentences ImposedOf which sentences were SuspendedNo. of Community Service Orders & Total HoursAverage Fines Imposed€€Cigarette Smuggling8134,529842,360 hours in total425Cigarette Selling (Unstamped Tobacco Products)47,0001101,750Offence CategoryNo. of ConvictionsFines TotalNo. of Prison Sentences ImposedOf which sentences were SuspendedNo. of Community Service Orders & Total HoursAverage Fines Imposed€€Cigarette Smuggling14660,360271771,360 hours in total413Cigarette Selling (Unstamped Tobacco Products)1933,150621,200 hours in total1,750Offence CategoryNo. of ConvictionsFines TotalNo. of Prison Sentences ImposedOf which sentences were SuspendedNo. of Community Service Orders & Total HoursAverage Fines Imposed€€Cigarette Smuggling6328,7751070423Cigarette Selling (Unstamped Tobacco Products)3074,3009 (2 cases under appeal)52,350 months in total2,477

Under section 28(4) of the Act, a Revision Officer of the Commissioner may carry out a revision of valuation in relation to a particular property only if a material change of circumstances (MCC) has occurred since the property was last revised. MCC is defined in section 3 of the Act as a change of circumstances, which consist of a new building, a change in value due to structural alterations of an existing building, total or partial demolition of a building or a sub-division or amalgamation of relevant property.  The definition does not allow for a revision of valuation where the change in value is due to economic factors, differential movements in property values or other external factors such as roads or other infrastructural development in the vicinity of a property. The valuation of commercial property is determined by reference to the values of comparable properties on the same valuation list.I have no plans at present to introduce amendments to the legislation; however, my officials are reviewing various provisions of the Valuation Act 2001 to achieve greater efficiencies, including streamlining the appeal process and I will ask them to include this issue in their deliberations.

As accountable persons for VAT, they would be entitled to claim input credit for VAT charged on the installation of an alternative energy generator, such as a wind turbine, for use in their taxable activities. In so far as farmers who are not registered for VAT are concerned, they are not in the normal course entitled to credit for, or repayment of, VAT incurred by them on their business inputs.  The Value-Added Tax (Refund of Tax) (No 25) Order, 1993  provides for refunds to unregistered farmers for tax borne on the "construction, extension, alteration or reconstruction of any building or structure which is designed for use solely or mainly for the purposes of a farming business".  However, while the installation of an alternative energy generator may be the construction of a structure, such a structure is not "designed for use solely or mainly for the purposes of a farming business".  It is designed rather to generate electricity for wherever required.  Consequently, the installation of alternative energy generators does not come within the scope of the VAT refund order.

Qualifying rent for the purposes of Section 473 is rent paid for the bare right to use, occupy or enjoy the premises.  Accordingly any payments in respect of the provision of goods and services are not eligible for relief.  In addition, rent paid to local authorities, government departments or the Office of Public works does not qualify for tax relief.  Currently, a single person aged under 55 can claim a credit on rent paid of up to €2,000 per annum.  For married or widowed persons under 55, the limit is €4,000. For individuals aged 55 or over, the specified limits are doubled.

In these circumstances the amount of tax revenues collected in respect of the activities specified in the question cannot be readily identified from the overall corporation tax yield.  There is, therefore, no statistical basis on which the Exchequer impact of the changes mentioned in the question could be estimated.  I am further informed by Revenue that even if the basic information was available the obligation on the Revenue Commissioners to observe confidentiality for taxpayers and small groups of taxpayers might preclude them from disclosing it.Section 45 of Finance Act 2008 introduced new tax provisions in relation to profits derived from petroleum exploration and production activities.  A new tax called a "profit resource rent tax" will apply at rates of 5%, 10% or 15% in addition to the corporation tax rate of 25% that currently applies to profits from petroleum activities.  It will apply when profits exceed certain defined levels.  This will be worked out by a formula that relates the profits from a petroleum field to the capital investment in the field.  The new tax provisions give effect to the Government Decision of 30 July 2007 that a new regime would apply in relation to petroleum profits from discoveries made from 2007 onwards.

However, there are a number of occasions where an exemption from the payment of VRT tax may apply.  One such exemption in respect of VRT and VAT, subject to certain conditions, is provided for in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations.  Statutory Instrument No. 353 of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994 (Regulation 12) provides the requirements for Organisations to apply under this Scheme.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	648	The scheme of capital allowances for the construction or refurbishment of buildings used as private hospitals was introduced in Finance Act 2001 and came into effect in May 2002.  As announced in the 2009 Supplementary Budget in April 2009 and reflected in section 8 of Finance Act 2009, the scheme of capital allowances for private hospitals was terminated from 31 December 2009 along with certain other health-related capital allowances schemes, subject to transitional arrangements for pipeline projects. Under the transitional arrangements, if certain qualifying criteria are met, the termination date for qualifying expenditure is extended. For example, where planning permission is required for the project involved and a valid application for full planning permission is submitted on or before 31 December 2009 (and acknowledged by the relevant planning authority), the termination date for qualifying expenditure is 31 December 2013.I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, based on the information that has been received and collated for the tax year 2008, (the latest year for which full data is available) there were 339 claims for €30.1 million capital allowances for the construction of private hospitals. This figure would correspond to a maximum Exchequer cost of the order of €12.3 million for these returns in terms of income tax foregone.  The information required in tax returns on the annual amounts of claims for this tax relief would not be sufficiently detailed to provide a basis for deriving an estimate of the remaining legacy cost to the Exchequer. I am not therefore in a position to provide the information requested by the Deputy.I should also point out that the provisions of section 23 Finance Act 2010 severely curtails the amount of tax reliefs that can be used to reduce the income tax liability of those on high incomes. These provisions ensure that, in addition to PRSI and levies, those with high incomes and using reliefs will have an effective income tax rate of about 30%. This measure applies to a list of specified reliefs, including property-based tax reliefs, the use of all of which has been curtailed as a result of this change.

However, by way of general information, the following is the position:The tax code provides for full Income Tax exemption for any statutory redundancy payment made under the 1967 Redundancy Payments Act (the 1967 Act).The question of whether a payment comes within the 1967 Act is a matter for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation and the Revenue Commissioners will follow their determination as regards the tax treatment of any payment made under that Act.For non-statutory lump sums, there is a basic exemption of €10,160 plus €765 for each full year of service. For employees who are not members of an occupational pension scheme, this basic exemption is increased by a further €10,000.There is an alternative exemption, called the "Standard Capital Superannuation Benefit", which generally gives a more favourable tax exemption for employees with long service and higher-than-average earnings.If any part of the lump sum is not exempt, there is a further relief, called "top slicing" relief, which ensures that the lump sum is not taxed at a rate higher than the employee's average rate of tax for the three years prior to terminationThe question of whether tax relief is available on non-statutory lump sums is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners. Whether a lump sum qualifies on the basis that it is made in connection with a genuine termination, change of function or commutation of pay will depend on all of the particular facts and circumstances of an individual case.There is no "template" for such arrangements. If the Revenue Commissioners are asked to approve the proposed tax treatment of redundancy or change of function arrangements, or if the tax treatment of such arrangements is audited by Revenue, all of the facts, not just the contractual arrangements, will be looked at to determine the true nature of the payments.In some instances, businesses do approach the Revenue Commissioners in advance about particular redundancy packages, but there is no obligation to do so.  Where they do, the Revenue Commissioners will give a view based on the facts as disclosed, which is open to review when all the facts are known.

The taxation of individuals in the State is in line with that prevailing in most other OECD jurisdictions, that is to say:individuals who are resident in the State for tax purposes (based on the number of days of presence in the  State) are taxable here on their worldwide income; andindividuals who are not resident here for tax purposes pay tax here only on income arising in the State and on  income derived from working here.A person is regarded as resident in the State for tax purposes in a tax year if he or she spends:183 days in the State in that year, or280 days in aggregate in that tax year and the preceding tax year.An individual who is present in the State for 30 days or less in a tax year will not be treated as resident for that year unless s/he elects to be resident.  As with other areas of taxation, these rules are constantly kept under review.The Deputy may be aware I made two significant changes in recent years which affected Irish domiciled individuals and Irish citizens claiming to be non-resident.  Firstly, I abolished the so-called "Cinderella rule.  From tax year 2009 onwards, an individual is regarded as present in the State for a day for tax residence purposes if s/he is in the State at any time during the day.  This change makes it harder for individuals to arrange their affairs to become non-resident for tax purposes.  Previously, for years up to and including 2008, an individual was treated as present in the State on a day for tax residence purposes only if s/he was in the State at the end of that day.Secondly, in Finance Bill 2010 I introduced the Domicile Levy, which applies for the tax year 2010 and subsequent years.  The levy is payable by an individual who:is domiciled in and is a citizen of the State in the tax year (regardless of her/his residence status);has worldwide income for the tax year of more than €1,000,000;has a liability to income tax in the State for the tax year of less than €200,000; andthe market value of whose Irish property on the valuation date, 31 December in the tax year, is greater than  €5,000,000.The Domicile Levy will ensure that wealthy citizens make a contribution to the national finances at this time of difficulty.

The figures for 2010 and 2011 are the Budget 2010 projections. It has been signalled publicly by my Department that debt interest costs in 2010 will be approximately €350 million lower than was forecast at Budget time.  The estimated 2010 outturn and 2011 forecast are currently being revised by my Department and the National Treasury Management Agency in the context of the publication of the four-year budgetary plan.

The NAMA discounts quoted by me in my statement of 30th September were estimated by NAMA taking account of the detailed loan-by-loan data available to the agency from the transfer of the first two tranches and supplemented by information now available to it on the remaining loans. With this detailed information NAMA has been able to refine to a reasonable degree of accuracy its estimates of the discounts on the remaining loans to be transferred.  The Deputy will be aware that the transfer process is expected to be completed by the end of the year.

A facility management contract is where a single company is contracted to provide services in the management of a facility that could include, building fabric maintenance, specialist services maintenance, landscape maintenance, energy management, minor works project management, health and safety management, static security, catering, cleaning, waste management, reception, porter service, post and courier services, tenant billing, accommodation management, and any other service that may be required in the management of a building or facility.  The facilities management contract was tendered in 2003 for a five-year contract.  The value of the contract at the award of contract was approximately €300,000 per annum.  The requirement for services in a number of facility management contracts, including this particular facility, is currently under review and will be tendered next year. The issue of the security contract has been raised by the Deputy in a previous recent parliamentary question and in a representation directly from a local security company. The procurement of security services in the facility is a matter for the existing facility management company or the future management company when the contract for the management of the facility is re-tendered.

The National Procurement Service (NPS) was established in the Office of Public Works following a Government decision in 2009. The NPS has a lead role in modernising procurement practices for goods and services across the public sector.  The NPS groups its work around three main strategic goals namely (1) strategic sourcing; (2) education/development/guidance and (3) eProcurement.  During the past 12 months it has been involved in extensive activities to further each of these goals. During the past year the NPS has launched major procurement campaigns in areas that have a reach across the majority of the public service and therefore afford an opportunity for heightened levels of collaboration and also promise the possibility of maximum return on investment.The NPS has, to date, in conjunction with InterTrade Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and ISME given workshops and presentations to over 300 suppliers. This initiative will continue into 2011.  Recognising the necessity to have access to the best of national and international advice on procurement and supply chain management, a procurement Advisory Group was established in 2010.Since its establishment in 1831 the Office of Public Works has been restructured and re-organised on numerous occasions as its remit has changed and expanded and as National and EU legislation, eg the EU Floods Directive, demanded to meet changing political, social, cultural and public service demands. The present decentralisation programme has effected another restructuring of the organisation. The management of the Office of Public Works continually review work practices and structures to ensure the best service delivery model.

Perpetual subordinated debt was excluded.   The overriding concern in the weeks before the State Guarantee was to preserve the stability of the entire banking system at a time when it was at serious risk of collapse.  Given the highly volatile state of international financial markets in September/October 2008, it was essential that the commitment provided by the Irish Government to stand behind our banking system was entirely credible, clear and consistent.  In those circumstances, there were significant risks in an approach which sought to discriminate between different types of bank liabilities. Such an approach could have resulted in the financial markets concluding that the guarantee was not acceptable or indeed credible.The report on the banking crisis by the Governor of the Central Bank, Patrick Honohan, refers to what he called the "hysterical" state of the markets at that time and concludes that decisive and credible action was needed the restore stability.  In particular, there was a requirement to maintain access to wholesale capital markets.  It was also crucial to guard against the risk of a default on any liabilities. Had there been a default on subordinated debt, a cross-default could have arisen which would have had the effect of triggering the Guarantee on other liabilitiesAs far as opportunities for risk-sharing are concerned, I understand that holders of subordinated debt in the three largest banks, through various buy back exercises at a discount, have incurred losses of more than €5 billion so far.  In addition, credit rating agencies have downgraded subordinated debt in some of the Irish institutions on the basis that they expect further costs to be imposed on these bondholders.  As I outlined in my statement on banking of 30 September last, my Department in conjunction with the Attorney General is working on resolution and reorganisation legislation, specific to Anglo Irish Bank and INBS, which will address the issue of burden-sharing by subordinated bondholders.  The legislation will be consistent with the requirements for the measures to be recognised as a re-organisation under the relevant EU Directive in other EU Member States.Very significant volumes of both short-term and longer-term funding were secured by the banks from wholesale capital markets in the weeks following the introduction of the guarantee.  This has subsequently provided an important foundation to the funding of the banks and a bulwark against funding pressures that have arisen at various times since.  Finally, the Deputy may wish to note that with the expiry of the original CIFS guarantee scheme on 29 September last, no guarantee is available from the State in respect of dated subordinated debt.

With the exception of chief executives, the Minister for Finance does not control the pay of staff of these bodies. I brought proposals to Government to review the arrangements governing the pay of chief executives. The Government has agreed that such a review should be undertaken. I will shortly announce further information on the nature of the review and the group to undertake it.  Unlike the position in the commercial State Sponsored Bodies, staff of non-commercial State Sponsored Bodies, including the chief executive officers, come within the legislation referred to above and are subject to both the pension related deduction and to the reductions in pay.

This facility will provide single room en-suite inpatient accommodation (100 rooms) and a dedicated day unit for people with Cystic Fibrosis, including 10 single day treatment rooms with en-suite sanitary facilities.  St Vincent's University Hospital and the HSE are committed to this project and are taking every possible step in order to ensure earliest possible delivery of the new ward block.  My Department understands that the signing of the contract is imminent.  The site has been cleared and is ready for construction to begin and the contract, once awarded, will require 18 months for construction of the new facility.

Under the current eligibility framework, a patient must be categorised as public or private on admission to a public hospital.  It is not open to a patient to opt to have both public and private status during a single episode of care.  As the regulator of the private health insurance market, I have no role to play in the day-to-day running and commercial decisions of private health insurers.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	664	I have responsibility for implementing the free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme, which provides for a free pre-school year to eligible children in the year before they commence primary school.  Children qualify for the free pre-school year where they are aged more than 3 years 2 months and less than 4 years 7 months in September of the relevant year.  This means that children born between 2 February 2006 and 30 June 2007 are eligible for the free pre-school year which commenced in September 2010.  There is no provision under the scheme to enrol children that are below the qualifying age.The objective of the ECCE scheme is to make early learning in a formal setting available to all children in the year before they commence primary school.  Services participating in the pre-school year are expected to provide appropriate age related activities and programmes to children within a particular age cohort.  It is necessary, therefore, to target the pre-school year at a particular age cohort and to set minimum and maximum limits to the age range within which children participate in the scheme.In setting the minimum and maximum age limits, account was taken of a number of factors, including the variation in school admission policies and the fact that the majority of children commence primary school between the ages of 4 years 6 months and 5 years 6 months.  I understand that the person referred to by the Deputy has a child who will qualify for the ECCE scheme in September 2011 but is outside of the lower age limit for qualification in September 2010.I also have responsibility for implementing the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) scheme which provides funding to community childcare services to enable them to charge reduced childcare fees to disadvantaged and low income families.  Parents can qualify for support with their childcare costs through the CCS scheme which is open to community not for profit childcare services.  Some 950 services throughout the State are participating in the CCS scheme and receive funding which is passed on to qualifying parents in the form of reduced childcare fees.Eligibility for a GP visit card is based on net income and takes account of outgoings such as rent and mortgage repayments and other expenses including childcare costs and travelling expenses.  As a result, parents with substantial gross incomes can qualify under the CCS scheme.  Parents who do not qualify for subvention are charged the cost price for their childcare service.  Parents who consider that they qualify for support under the CCS scheme should contact their local City and County Childcare Committee to establish exactly what participating community facilities are available in their area.

Due to the age of the hospital, and despite investment over the years, some building infrastructural issues have come to light recently which gives rise for significant concern and they are being assessed.  While the question relates to a service matter, I understand that the Health Service Executive has taken no decision yet in relation to the future of the hospital.  Under the Health Act, 2007 statutory responsibility is given to the Chief Inspector of Social Services, part of the Health Information and Quality Authority, for inspecting and registering categories of designated centre for older people.  This new registration and inspection regime commenced on 1 July 2009.The Authority carried out an inspection of Wicklow District Hospital on 24 August 2010. The Authority's inspection process comprises three parts: pre-assessment, the inspection visit and report completion including a process of fact-checking and verification. Following inspection, the inspection report is drafted by the inspector(s). Once complete, the draft report is issued to the provider for a factual accuracy review. The provider must submit an action plan to address any issues identified during the inspection. Finally once the action plan has been submitted and approved the report is published by the Authority on-line at www.hiqa.ie.

Environmental Health Officers of the HSE carry out food safety inspections of all food establishments under service contract to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI). Data regarding inspections of food establishments is captured in six broad categories of establishments, including the services sector, which includes restaurants, pubs,  hotels and other service sector establishments. The FSAI have informed me that the numbers of food inspections carried out in the service sector between 2007 and the first half of 2010 are as follows:2007 — 32,909;2008 — 31,810;2009 — 31,206;2010 (up to end of June) — 13,381.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	673	Under the Health Act 2008, a much simplified system of assessment for eligibility was introduced in respect of persons aged 70 or over, based on the significantly higher gross income thresholds rather than the standard net income limits.  The gross income thresholds are €700 per week for a single person and €1,400 for a couple, as against net income limits of €201.50 for a single person and €298 for a couple.Under the net income assessment system, the assessment of eligibility is based on the combined income of an applicant and spouse (where applicable) after tax, PRSI and income levy contributions have been deducted.  Additional allowances may be made for rent/mortgage, travel to work and child care costs.  However, these would not be a factor for the vast majority of older people.  Where an applicant's income is in excess of the net income guidelines, the Health Service Executive (HSE) will take medical issues and expenses into account in determining whether or not "undue hardship" exists.  Where a person aged 70 or over does not qualify for a medical card by virtue of their gross income being over the specified thresholds, the HSE will assess if the person qualifies for a medical card or GP visit card under the existing net income thresholds.Notwithstanding the above, the HSE may issue a medical card on a discretionary basis, if the applicant would otherwise be caused undue hardship in providing general medical and surgical services for himself/herself and any dependants.  To assist the HSE in making such a determination, it is necessary for the applicant to provide information about medical issues and expenses.

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities own resources and are supplemented by State road grants paid by my Department.    Local authorities provided details of exceptional road related costs, which fell outside the normal financial provision for winter maintenance as a direct result of the damage sustained in late 2009/early 2010.  I took account of this information received when deciding on the allocations to local authorities of €411million for 2010.I decided to defer the planned rehabilitation works on regional and local roads in 2010, in order to provide greater flexibility to local authorities to address the damage sustained and I requested that they carefully target resources to address, on a priority basis, the most urgently required repairs.  It is not, therefore, possible to isolate specific amounts of money from the funds allocated to each Authority in the manner sought by the Deputy, but I understand that all of the funding allocated to local authorities for regional and local roads in 2010 (€411 million) will be drawn down by year-end.However, the following table shows for information the amount allocated to each local authority, the amount paid to date and the balance remaining to be paid as at end September 2010.PayeeAllocationPaid YTDAllocation Remaining€€€Arklow Town Council  Total195,000—195,000Athlone Town Council  Total395,00010,271384,729Athy Town Council Total195,000—195,000Ballina Town Council Total195,000—195,000Ballinasloe Town Council Total195,00038,580156,420Birr Town Council Total195,000—195,000Bray Town Council Total425,000—425,000Buncrana Town Council Total195,000—195,000Bundoran Town Council Total139,000—139,000Carlow County Council Total5,602,6993,568,3892,034,310Carlow Town Council Total410,000—410,000Carrickmacross Town Council Total195,000—195,000Carrick-on-Suir Town Council Total195,000—195,000Cashel Town Council Total139,000—139,000Castlebar Town Council Total195,00090,000105,000Castleblaney Town Council Total139,00040,83198,169Cavan County Council Total12,886,9987,273,4335,613,565Cavan Town Council Total195,000—195,000Clare County Council Total15,586,4988,389,5337,196,965Clonakilty Town Council Total195,000—195,000Clones Town Council Total139,000—139,000Clonmel Borough Council Total470,520—470,520Cobh Town Council Total195,000—195,000Cork City Council Total4,317,0503,283,7651,033,285Cork County Council Total42,384,71323,398,66918,986,044Donegal County Council Total26,173,93114,879,94811,293,983Drogheda Borough Council Total445,000—445,000Dublin City Council Total10,583,7763,998,8056,584,971Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council Total5,632,4491,758,2573,874,192Dundalk Town Council Total425,000—425,000Dungarvan Town Council Total195,000—195,000Ennis Town Council Total410,000—410,000Enniscorthy Town Council Total195,000—195,000Fermoy Town Council Total195,00043,397151,603Fingal County Council Total6,646,8662,962,5423,684,324Galway City Council Total3,725,000919,6052,805,395Galway County Council Total23,101,89412,142,38510,959,509Kells Town Council (Ceannanus Mór) Total169,701—169,701Kerry County Council Total17,935,94211,336,5706,599,372Kildare County Council Total12,922,8937,557,1595,365,734Kilkenny Borough Council Total430,000166,160263,840Kilkenny County Council Total10,490,6996,488,5754,002,124Killarney Town Council Total195,000—195,000Kilrush Town Council Total139,000111,25027,750Kinsale Town Council Total195,000—195,000Laois County Council Total9,286,2994,746,6394,539,660Leitrim County Council Total8,316,6995,030,8223,285,877Letterkenny Town Council Total395,000290,000105,000Limerick City Council Total2,406,0001,341,3071,064,693Limerick County Council Total12,665,5988,628,0274,037,571Listowel Town Council Total195,000189,7985,202Longford County Council Total5,837,7993,264,6302,573,169Longford Town Council Total195,000—195,000Louth County Council Total6,249,3683,193,5503,055,818Macroom Town Council Total139,000—139,000Mallow Town Council Total195,000—195,000Mayo County Council Total20,670,74616,745,6223,925,124Meath County Council Total13,157,3976,194,5286,962,869Midleton Town Council Total195,000—195,000Monaghan County Council Total12,393,4997,334,5505,058,949Monaghan Town Council Total195,000—195,000Naas Town Council Total410,000—410,000National Roads Authority Total2,030,500151,4141,879,086Navan Town Council Total410,000—410,000Nenagh Town Council Total195,000—195,000New Ross Town Council Total195,000—195,000North Tipperary County Council Total10,807,5985,649,8365,157,762Offaly County Council Total8,152,6996,309,0621,843,637Roscommon County Council Total13,748,5986,034,9517,713,647Skibbereen Town Council Total139,000—139,000Sligo Borough Council Total430,00058,706371,294Sligo County Council Total9,988,6996,130,9003,857,799South Dublin County Council Total9,012,608198,8088,813,800South Tipperary County Council Total10,716,0987,808,4032,907,695Templemore Town Council Total139,000—139,000Thurles Town Council Total195,000—195,000Tipperary Town Council Total195,000—195,000Tralee Town Council Total410,000—410,000Trim Town Council Total195,000—195,000Tullamore Town Council Total195,00014,975180,025Waterford City Council Total3,610,0001,188,8562,421,144Waterford County Council Total10,336,9265,191,3445,145,582Westmeath County Council Total12,064,8997,840,3364,224,563Westport Town Council Total195,000127,00068,000Wexford Borough Council Total470,000—470,000Wexford County Council Total13,140,24810,614,0002,526,248Wicklow County Council Total9,118,0987,569,5451,548,553Wicklow Town Council Total195,000—195,000Youghal Town Council Total195,000195,000—Grand Total414,964,005230,500,733184,463,272

A fee is charged by these organisations for the issue of permits in order to cover the cost of administering the scheme and producing the cards.  For some time, the fee charged by the DDAI and IWA has been €25.  While I as Minister have power under the Road Traffic Act 2004 to make regulations setting a maximum fee, I have not to date done this.     Last July I published a review of the disabled parking scheme conducted by my Department.  One of the recommendations of the review, which I have accepted, is that a maximum fee which may be charged for the issuing of a disabled parking permit should be set at €35.  The reason for this is to allow the IWA and DDAI to invest in improving security features of the card.  It would remain open to the issuing organisations to charge less than this maximum.  My Department is currently preparing regulations to give effect to the recommendations of the disabled parking review.

In that context, a Visa Officer would normally expect to be satisfied that the conditions of at least two previous visas had been observed.   A multiple entry visa may be issued for a one year period with a subsequent similar visa issuing for a maximum period of two years unless there is a significant change in circumstances.  My Department is happy to continue to provide this facility into the future.The persons concerned created on-line visa applications on 26 September 2010.  However, the necessary supporting documentation in regard to their applications has not been submitted.  I should remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual Immigration cases may be made direct to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  The service enables up-to-date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek this information through the more administratively expensive Parliamentary Questions process.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	683	It has always been the case that the rules with regard to family reunification have differed between the various classes of migrant present in the State. The rules are developed by reference to certain factors including the purpose for which the primary migrant entered the State, the category of residence granted to the primary migrant, the ability of the family unit to be economically viable in the State and other more general immigration matters such as public policy and security issues.  It is therefore the case that certain classes of migrant, for example, certain classes of international student,  are not eligible for family reunification by virtue of their status in the State while those who may be entering the State as an employment permit holder are eligible. In developing the rules in relation to family reunification and in the examination of such applications regard is had to the provisions of the Constitution and of relevant International conventions so as to ensure that our practices are in conformity with our obligations in the area.With regard to my comments during the debate on the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill,  I simply illustrated the fact that there are certain classes of migrant who would not in the normal course be considered eligible to migrate to the State but who have entered the State under whatever guise and who it may not have been possible to remove from the State.   To provide that such persons are eligible for family reunification while denying eligibility to those who entered the State in accordance with immigration rules is not acceptable.

I note that the nationality of neither the person referred to by the Deputy nor the two children referred to has been mentioned.  Further information on the exact circumstances of the family concerned, including their place of regular residence,  has also not been provided.I can however advise the Deputy that Chinese nationals are required to be in possession of a valid visa prior to seeking entry to the State.  All persons who are visa required and who are not in possession of same may apply to their nearest Irish Embassy or Consulate for the appropriate visa.  Where a visa required national is ordinarily resident in the State and wishes to exit and re-enter the State, such a person must be in possession of a re-entry visa, prior to exiting the State.   Each visa application is considered on its individual merits the onus resting with the applicant to satisfy the Visa Officer as to why a visa should be granted.  Comprehensive information when making a visa application (including the re-entry visa process)  is available on the website of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (www.inis.gov.ie).I am informed by Officials in the Visa Office of my Department that on the basis of the information provided they can find no record of a current visa application for the Chinese national referred to.  I should remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual Immigration cases may be made direct to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  The service enables up-to-date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek this information through the more administratively expensive Parliamentary Questions process.

The GCVU has managed a substantial increase over recent years in the numbers of vetting applications it receives — 187,864 in 2007; 218,404 in 2008 and 246,194 in 2009. At present, there are approximately 60,000 vetting applications in the course of being processed.The processing time for vetting applications fluctuates during the year due to seasonal demands when the volume of applications received from certain sectors can increase.  Additional time may be required to process an individual vetting application in cases where clarification is required as to the details provided or where other enquiries need to be made, for example, when the person in question has lived and worked abroad. There will always be a reasonably significant time period required to process a vetting application.  Registered organisations have been advised to take account of this in their recruitment and selection process. However, the Gardaí make every effort to reduce this to the minimum possible consistent with carrying out the necessary checks.  I am informed by the Garda Authorities that the current average processing time for vetting applications received at the GCVU is in the region of ten to 12 weeks, given that demand is particularly high at present.The allocation of Garda resources, including personnel, is a matter for the Garda Commissioner. Due to the high volume of applications, an additional ten persons have recently been recruited to the Vetting Unit on a temporary basis. In addition, overall staffing arrangements at the Unit are under review at present, in the light of the increasing demands being made upon it.

To obtain the detailed information in relation to persons deported by charter and commercial flights and the dates and flight information for each such flight in the last five years requested by the Deputy is not readily available and would require an inordinate amount of time to obtain and an inappropriate expenditure of limited resources.The travel agent involved in making arrangements for commercial flights is Club Travel.  In this regard, the Department avails of the services of Club Travel under the contract negotiated centrally by the Department of Finance.  In relation to chartered flights, Air Partner PLC currently hold the contract to supply the aircraft and flight crew for charters.Removals carried out using commercial flights arranged by Club Travel usually involve transit through other European airports as Ireland does not have direct flights to most of the countries of return.  In addition, most flights have to be booked at short notice, near to the date of departure, which involves higher costs than if booked well in advance.  However, such costs must be looked at in tandem with the considerable expense arising from the continued presence in the State of persons who have no valid basis for being in the State.  Such costs would include accommodation, health, education and social welfare costs as well as detention costs in certain cases.  While it is important to keep deportation costs to a minimum, to not remove persons who have no valid basis for being in the State would call into question the integrity of the entire asylum and immigration systems.  This would leave this State open to further illegal immigration and even greater expense to taxpayers.My Department also works in co-operation with other EU Member States, through the EU-wide FRONTEX network, to carry out joint deportation operations to destinations of shared interest.  This has the effect of reducing the overall costs to the State of charter flights.  Additionally, the Department receives EU funding through the European Return Fund for charter flights.The detailed information in relation to the cost of commercial flights and all other costs involved in relation to the travel agents in the last five years required by the Deputy is not readily available and would require an inordinate amount of time to obtain and an inappropriate expenditure of limited resources.

Garda investigations into two incidents in the area are ongoing.One Sergeant and six Gardaí are attached to the Community Policing Unit in Clontarf Sub-District, one of whom is allocated specifically to the area referred to and who regularly meets local residents to address any issues arising.  The area is subject to regular patrols by uniform and plain-clothes personnel, including the Community Policing and Mountain Bike Units and the District Detective and Drug Units, supplemented as required by the Divisional Crime Task Force and Traffic Corps personnel.I am further informed that under Operation Tombola policing plans are in place to prevent and detect the importation for sale of fireworks in the lead up to Halloween.  Operational orders will also be in place, in consultation with other stakeholders, including the local authorities, public transport providers and other emergency services, to prevent and detect anti-social behaviour particularly associated with the Halloween period.Local Garda management closely monitors and keeps under review patrols and other operational strategies in place, in conjunction with crime trends and policing needs of the communities in the area, to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.  Current policing strategies are designed to prevent crime, public order offences and anti-social behaviour, and community policing is a central feature and core value of policing policy.  This will ensure an environment conducive to the improvement of the quality of life for residents.

This is a discretionary scheme and there is not an entitlement to the Technical Assistance and Training Scheme as of right.  Where appropriate, the fund can also be used to provide support to other social welfare customers who may require assistance in accessing the labour market or are trying to establish an enterprise and need training or other supports.  Take up of the Technical Assistance and Training Scheme has been very positive in 2010.  The Department has reviewed funding for the scheme for the remainder of the year and the allocation has been increased by over 30%.

It is a statutory requirement of the appeals process that the relevant Departmental papers and comments by the Social Welfare Services on the grounds of appeal be sought. When received, the appeal in question will be referred to an Appeals Officer for consideration.

The person concerned will be informed when arrangements have been made.  There was a 46% increase in the number of appeals received by the Social Welfare Appeals Office in 2009 when compared to 2008, which in itself was 27% greater than the numbers received in 2007. There was an increase of a further 44% in the number of appeals received in the first eight months of 2010. These increases have caused delays in the processing of appeals.  In order to be fair to all appellants, oral hearings are arranged in strict chronological order.A number of initiatives have been put in place to enhance the capacity of the office to deal with the current caseload and inflows.  In that regard:2 additional Appeals Officers were assigned to the Office in 2009,A number of additional staff were assigned to the administration area of the Office,The organisation of the Appeals Officer's work has been changed so as to increase productivity,A project to improve the business processes in the office was undertaken which has resulted in a number of improvements being implemented, andSignificant enhancements have been made to the office's IT and phone systems.In addition, it was decided to use experienced retired staff strictly on a short term basis to supplement the current resources and the services of eight retired officers have now been secured on a part-time basis and have been operating since July.I am assured by the Chief Appeals Officer that she is keeping current processes under continuous review with a view to achieving a more effective throughput of appeals, while ensuring that any progress does not conflict with due process in terms of the rights of appellants and adherence to the requirements of natural justice.  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.

Its objectives are to reinvest in the unique cultural relationship between Ireland and America, strengthen links with the Irish diaspora, enhance Ireland's reputation and profile as a global leader in creativity, expand the reach of Irish culture to new audiences and provide a strategic platform to promote Irish tourism, trade, investment and innovation.  This initiative was announced by the Taoiseach during his visit to Washington DC in March this year. It draws on the recommendations of the Ireland-US Strategic Policy Review, and also on the strong strategic focus on culture as a unique long-term strength and door-opener for Ireland and Irish business, at the Global Irish Economic Forum in Farmleigh.Mr Gabriel Byrne, in his position as Cultural Ambassador for Ireland, has been closely involved in developing the initiative, in collaboration with Culture Ireland and our Embassy and Consulate network in the US.  The programme, scheduled to run from January to December 2011, will comprise a range of events across artistic disciplines in key cities (for example New York, Los Angeles, Washington DC, Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Atlanta and Philadelphia) and in other locations where there are strong presenting partners.  Funding for this strategically important initiative will be made available from my Department's allocation for 2011 and will be finalised in the context of the ongoing Estimates process.

The development of the White Paper has had regard to a number of relevant policy developments and publications, including the report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes.  Currently, there are 34 city and county councils and a further 80 town councils.The report of the Local Government Efficiency Review Group, established to review the cost base, expenditure of and numbers employed in local authorities, is of relevance. The Review Group recommended the delivery of corporate service functions on a joint basis across contiguous local authorities, achieved by establishing joint management structures. The Review Group recommended ten such joint administrative areas.The Limerick Local Government Committee, in its September 2009 report, contained a recommendation to merge Limerick City Council and Limerick County Council.  A dedicated Cabinet Committee has been engaged in finalising the policy decisions for inclusion in the White Paper on Local Government. I intend to publish the White Paper as soon as possible following completion of the Government's deliberations. On the specific issue of local government in Limerick, I will bring proposals to Government for discussion, with a view to early implementation of the Government's decisions.

The total value of contracts underway and those proposed for commencement during the period of the programme in County Donegal is some €116m.The Dungloe and Glenties Sewerage Schemes, which are to advance jointly, are included in the Programme among the list of contracts in the county to start in the period 2010 -2012.  Donegal County Council's Tender Documents for the contract are under examination in my Department and are being dealt with as quickly as possible.  Burtonport Sewerage Scheme is not included among the contracts and schemes in County Donegal to be progressed under the Water Services Investment Programme over the period 2010 — 2012.A key input to the development of the Programme was the assessment of needs prepared by local authorities, including Donegal County Council.  These were subsequently appraised in the Department in the context of the funds available and key criteria that complemented those used by the authorities. Inevitably, through this process, certain projects that had been proposed had to give way to others that are more strategically important at this time, as the total value of contracts and schemes proposed by local authorities exceeded the level of resources likely to be available in the period.The scope and format of the Programme for 2010 to 2012 is designed to better reflect ongoing environmental and economic priorities, to maximise the return on public funds being invested in the sector and to ensure that the Programme is realistic in its level of ambition.   The contracts and schemes that did not rate sufficiently for inclusion in the Programme on this occasion were those which did not feature highly on public health grounds or other environmental compliance requirements (for example those relating to European Court of Justice proceedings,  or those required in the context of the River Basin Management Plans, Shellfish Pollution Production Programmes, EPA reports etc) and projects that were proposed simply for capacity expansion (which was unrelated to the National Spatial Strategy/developing areas priorities), and which in the case of water supply can be deferred, in many cases, in favour of accelerated water conservation measures.

There has been subsequent correspondence and bilateral meetings have been held with the Commission by way of clarifying aspects of Ireland's response. Significant progress has been made in satisfying the court judgment, and this has been acknowledged by the Commission.A further letter of formal notice has recently been received from the European Commission in relation to a number of outstanding issues where the Commission contends that there are continuing problems of compliance, and it includes reference to particular sites on which further action is required. My Department is  engaging with the necessary authorities, including the Office of Environmental Enforcement, to ensure that these issues are resolved to the satisfaction of the Commission. A further bilateral with the Commission is envisaged in relation to these issues.  While it would be open to the Commission, were it not to be satisfied with Ireland's response, to seek the imposition of fines by the Court, my focus is on addressing the outstanding issues in this case, thereby ensuring compliance with the judgment of the Court.

Building Control authorities review the design of buildings from a fire safety perspective and, if satisfied, issue a fire safety certificate in respect of the design. Building Control authorities have a range of enforcement powers available to them where breaches of building regulations come to light.Section 18 (Part 3) of the Fire Services Act 1981 and 2003 places a duty on persons having control over premises, such as apartment complexes, to take all reasonable measures to guard against the outbreak of fire and to ensure the safety of persons on the premises in the event of an outbreak of fire.  Section 4 of the Act provides that it an offence for any person to contravene any requirement of Part 3 of the Act.Section 22 of the Fire Services Act 1981, as amended, empowers fire authorities to inspect any land or building, including apartment complexes, for the purpose of the Act, including enforcement of fire safety matters. Fire authorities have a range of powers available to them, updated and strengthened in 2003, to ensure fire safety in buildings.  I have no role in the day to day exercise of these functions.

Payments under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme commenced on 22 September, with an advance payment of 75% issuing in respect of those parcels cleared for payment at that stage.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	721	There are 1,083 herds in the Wicklow East region, 75% of which has been tested to date this year. The number of new herd restrictions is 127 compared with 77 at the same time last year. The number of reactors disclosed since 1 January is 641, compared with 365 for the same period last year. The average number of reactors per thousand tests in Wicklow East is, at 8 reactors per thousand tests, well above the national average of 2.5 per thousand. This is partly due to the fact that the region has experienced a number of very large breakdowns, with one herd alone disclosing 121 reactors. In addition, 56% of the reactors in the region came from just 11 herds and 8 of those herds involved breakdowns that disclosed more than 20 reactors.I can assure the deputy that the testing programme is on schedule and the District Veterinary Office is performing epidemiological assessments in the region including, where applicable, the use of gamma interferon blood testing.  The District Veterinary office is also assessing the specific resource requirements as part of the re-organisation of the local office network and, subject to budgetary constraints, additional resources will be assigned to the region if this is deemed necessary. I am satisfied that all appropriate measures are being taken to deal with the disease situation in the region and that the area is being very closely monitored by my Department.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	722	My Department's Laboratory Service provides a range of diagnostic services for the tuberculosis eradication programme, including culture and/or histopathological examination of samples, tests on blood samples to aid the diagnosis to TB and Spoligotyping, to determine the strain type for M. bovis isolates. This latter service is used in particular for research and investigation of TB outbreaks in certain areas or regions.   With regard to the trials referred to, a collaborative study between the Dublin District Veterinary Office and the Regional Veterinary Laboratory was undertaken in 2009 in the context of an increase in TB levels in the Wicklow area. The objective of the study was to estimate the prevalence of M. bovis infection in deer and badgers in three selected project areas and to compare the strains types in cattle deer and badgers.The study has been completed. It found that there was one predominant strain in the deer and badger isolates and that this strain was also found in a high proportion of the cattle isolates. This strain has not been identified outside of Wicklow. Two other strain types, also unique to Wicklow, shared the same spoligotype.  Strain typing is an ancillary support to a range of measures undertaken by my Department and is performed where deemed necessary.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	723	All payments for 2009 have issued except in cases where there are outstanding matters to be resolved.  The EU Regulations governing the Organic Farming Schemes provide that payments issue in two instalments, the first of which, amounting to 75% of the payment, may be released once all administrative checks have been completed.  The remaining 25% may be paid once all on-farm checks have taken place and the participant has submitted an end-of-year declaration of farming activity.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	724	In accordance with Regulation (EC) No. 1774/2002, poultry offal is classified as a Category 3 animal by-product (ABP). This is the lowest risk category of animal by-product. Poultry offal is not generally regarded as hazardous waste.  The normal method of disposal of poultry offal is by rendering. The above mentioned regulation provides for a number of other approved methods of disposal of poultry offal. These include using it as a raw material for manufacturing petfood.The Diseases of Animals Act 1966 (Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies) (Fertilisers & Soil Improvers) Order 2008 — S.I. No. 253 of 2008 — places restrictions on the types of ABP that can be used in a compost or biogas plant. Raw ABP from abattoirs or poultry processing plants is not allowed be used in a compost or biogas plant. This is intended to help prevent the spread of diseases and to protect our valuable meat industry. These national restrictions are permitted under EU regulations.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	725	The agreement concluded with pig processors in December 2008 involved making available a facility of up to €180 million to assist processors in funding the recall and destruction of certain pork products from the market.  The closing date for the Pigmeat Recall scheme was 16th April 2010. A total of €100m has been paid out under the Scheme to date: €35m in 2008, €55m in 2009 and €10m in 2010.  Cofunding in the sum of €8m was provided by the EU in respect of some 7,500 tonnes of affected pigmeat product.  A total of 120 companies benefited from the scheme.As regards imported pigmeat, the position is that no compensation was paid on product which could be shown to be wholly derived from pigmeat of foreign origin.  All such product which could be identified was released back to the market. However, if the product was comprised of a mix of Irish and foreign pigmeat, it all had to be recalled and destroyed, even if it contained only a small proportion of Irish meat. This was specifically provided for in the Scheme in the best interests of public health and the restoration of public confidence.  In addition to the payments a further €28.3m has been paid out in respect of culling of affected herds bringing the total expenditure to date to €128.3m.

Assistance for small businesses and services in Ireland is delivered primarily through the County and City Enterprise Boards who are the primary initial contact point for business start-ups. They are responsible for providing support to small businesses with 10 employees or fewer in the start-up and expansion phases, to promote and develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level.Subject to certain eligibility criteria, financial assistance to new and developing micro-enterprises may be available for a range of eligible business costs from the CEBs in the form of priming, expansion/development and feasibility/innovation grants. However, I would stress that priority is given to projects in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors.  It is considered inappropriate to support other areas such as retail enterprises, personal services (e.g. hairdressers, gardeners, etc), professional services (accountants, solicitors, etc) lacking export potential, construction, as it is considered that these enterprises generally give rise to unacceptable deadweight (where projects would have proceeded anyway) and/or displacement (where the projects simply displace business from other players in the market) concerns.Whilst not all projects are eligible for direct financial assistance, CEBs also deliver a range of non-financial supports such as training, mentoring and general business advice services, designed to help new and existing enterprises to operate effectively and efficiently so as to last and grow. I would therefore recommend that potential entrepreneurs or existing business owners contact their local CEB to discuss the particular needs of their business. Contact details for individual CEBs can be found by accessing the following website: www.enterpriseboards.ie  .Furthermore the Government is also encouraging employers to create new jobs through reducing the costs associated with employment through the Employer Jobs (PRSI) Incentive Scheme. For each new eligible job, the scheme gives an 8%-10% saving on employment costs for the first year of employment.  For further information regarding this new incentive, a prospective employer should contact the Department of Social Protection at   www.welfare.ie

According to the information supplied by the Deputy, the Circuit Court issued an Order which was passed to the County Sheriff for execution and the Sheriff has failed to recover the sums due. As the matter appears to rest with the Court and the Sheriff, there is no further role for the employment rights bodies which operate under the aegis of my Department.

There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidationI can confirm that a statutory redundancy lump sum claim was received by my Department on 6 October, 2010 in respect of the above individual.  In view of the particular set of circumstances outlined by the Deputy in this case, I have asked my Department to bring forward the processing of this claim and I understand that this claim will be processed over the next 3 to 4 weeks. I regret that the individual concerned had an unsatisfactory customer service experience and I have brought this matter to attention in my Department.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	735	I propose to take Questions Nos. 250 to 255, inclusive, and 257 to 259, inclusive, together.The Industrial Development agency figures for job gains and losses are compiled annually in the Forfás Annual Employment Survey, the most up to date of which details employment figures up until 2009.  The figures are in respect of numbers of persons employed in firms assisted by IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Shannon Development, which come under the aegis of my Department.  As the information is compiled on an annualised basis, the figures in respect of 2010 will not be available until 2011.  Details of the agency figures for job gains and losses are set out in Table 1 accompanying this reply.  There are no figures available specific to ‘high tech' jobs.  The data in the tables in respect of services relates to the services sectors supported by the enterprise agencies.There are no figures available in respect of jobs relocated to other economies.  There are many differing and complex factors that can influence a firm's decision to relocate and these are a reality of the modern globalised economic environment. Notwithstanding this, IDA Ireland has continued to attract and retain high value manufacturing investments from leading global corporations.Job ‘churn' occurs in the internationally trading sector of the economy, in a number of ways and for a variety of reasons.  Companies adjust their plant location and utilisation strategies to address matters such as accessing new markets, moving production nearer to customers, meeting firm or market specific customer relationship issues, accessing technology, in addition to business takeovers and consolidations.  For much of the last decade, this churn has been positive for Ireland with companies replacing lower value activities with activities of higher value, resulting in better-paid, more highly skilled jobs.In terms of supporting the creation of new employment opportunities across the country the State development agencies, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, together with the County and City Enterprise Boards assist and promote enterprise development and employment growth in businesses. Despite operating in a very difficult economic environment, there are still investment opportunities in global markets and IDA will continue to compete vigorously for projects for Ireland. So far this year, there have been 63 IDA announcements with the potential to create in excess of 4,700 jobs.Enterprise Ireland delivers a wide range of supports to Irish companies, targeted at the specific requirements of clients throughout all regions to ensure that they develop to their full potential in terms of innovation and exports, which in turn, stimulates job creation.  In addition, the Employment Subsidy Scheme and the Enterprise Stabilisation Fund have been introduced to assist vulnerable but viable companies to maintain employment and to develop and sustain their businesses respectively.The role of the County and City Enterprise Boards is to provide support for micro-enterprise in the start-up and expansion phases, to promote and develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and to stimulate entrepreneurship at local level.  Subject to certain eligibility criteria, the Boards support individuals, firms and community groups provided that the proposed projects have the capacity to achieve commercial viability. The Boards give priority to businesses in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors.Statistical information in relation to CEBs is collated annually. My Department does not collect or retain information on the number of specific job losses in CEB assisted companies. Information on existing jobs in CEBs-supported companies for the years 2007, 2008 and 2009 is set out set out in Table 2 accompanying this reply.SectorNumber of Permanent Full-time Jobs Gains 2007Number of Jobs lost 2007Net Gains/ Losses 2007Number of Permanent Full-time Jobs Gains 2008Number of Jobs lost 2008Net Gains/ Losses 2008Number of Permanent Full-time Jobs Gains 2009Number of Jobs lost 2009Net Gains/ Losses 2009Manufacturng12,89515,465-2,57010,13820,695-10,5575,99230,487-24,495Other Industry1,4921,1513411,6091,776-1679412,878-1,937International Services8,9757,0671,9088,8726,6532,2194,42110,282-5,861Financial Services3,3475592,7882,6381,0681,5709751,946-971Total26,70924,2422,46723,25730,192-6,93512,32945,593-33,264200720082009Number of jobs existing in CEBs-supported companies*34,545.533,81130,726.5*Based on CEB Annual Employment Survey.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	736	In 2010 Enterprise Ireland (EI) has been working closely with its clients to maintain and build their business relationships with existing key customers and target and win new customers in existing and new markets.  There has been a large number of targeted sector visits and a number of cross-sectoral visits led by Government Ministers to strategic overseas markets with an emphasis on High Growth and Emerging markets.EI continue to identify and support the entry of appropriate clients to the selected markets of Brazil, Russia, India, China, the Gulf, Japan and most recently South Africa.  Of particular significance is the work that is already underway with the construction products and services sector in the Gulf States.Enterprise Ireland has identified and targeted a number of sectors and sub-sectors in individual markets that offer clear opportunities for those EI clients that have the expertise and experience to potentially win sales and grow exports in each market.  A successful example of this approach has been the work around the construction sector in the Gulf States.  By recognising and validating the opportunity in construction in the Gulf and matching it to the capabilities of a cohort of Irish companies Enterprise Ireland built the knowledge and expertise in the market to facilitate clients in building contacts and relationships thus enabling them to win significant business.The High Growth Markets (Brazil, Russia, India, China, Gulf States, Japan and South Africa) are a diverse group of markets at different stages of development and sophistication.  Over the period 2008-present the combined total number of clients doing business in these markets has risen by 13% from 932 to 1,052.  EI clients have also established 76 new presences in these markets during 2008 and 2009 reflecting this increased commitment to these markets.  Work is also underway to identify opportunities that may be available to clients in other emerging economies such as Indonesia, a significant market with untapped potential.  Growth was achieved despite the difficult trading conditions encountered from the second half of 2008 onwards.EI is continuing to work with a large number of companies to target and win business right across the globe and demand from companies in targeting export markets is very strong as evidenced by EI's recent International Markets Week (20th September — 23rd September) in Ireland when EI's International staff met with over 670 Irish companies (>1,700 meetings) to agree joint action plans to target export market opportunities.  These action plans are now already underway.Details on the performance of Ireland's merchandise and services exports to priority markets are detailed below.2007200820092010 (Jan – June)€’000€’000€’000€’000Brazil161,630183,234211,313119,444Russia326,847344,469242,649188,392India168,344160,976158,49280,611China1,320,3721,609,2771,632,227830,160Gulf States785,119833,107833,967509,010South Africa368,943311,686214,177137,340Japan1,738,0631,708,2391,701,897867,077Source: CSO.20072008€’000€’000Brazil122,000199,000Russia1,165,0001,382,000India374,000398,000China1,233,0001,423,000Gulf States540,000*673,000South Africa590,000538,000Japan897,0001,066,000Source: CSO.*Does not include confidential figures for Kuwait.Questions Nos. 257 to 259, inclusive, answered with Question No. 250.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	737	I propose to take Questions Nos. 260 to 262, inclusive, together.Jobs are the central priority of Government policy.  Recently, the Taoiseach launched the five-year integrated Government plan for trade, tourism and investment aimed at generating 300,000 jobs.  The new plan, "Trading and Investing in a Smart Economy", is the first integrated strategy to promote overseas trade, tourism and investment.  With this new strategy, the Government aims to position Ireland for strong export-led growth to 2015, resulting in high levels of job creation.In terms of supporting the creation of new employment opportunities across County Kildare, the State development agencies, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, together with the Kildare County Enterprise Board assist and promote enterprise development and employment growth in businesses.  Enterprise Ireland delivers a wide range of supports to Irish companies, targeted at the specific requirements of clients to ensure that they develop to their full potential in terms of innovation and exports, which in turn, stimulates job creation.  In addition, the agency has refocused its efforts on strengthening and sustaining viable companies through a range of initiatives focused on the needs of their client base.During 2010, the Kildare County Enterprise Board has continued to support enterprise development through the provision of both financial and non-financial assistance and will ensure that available funds are targeted to maximise entrepreneurial development and to enhance employment creation within the county.  While it is clear that we are operating in a very difficult economic environment, there are still investment opportunities in global markets and IDA will continue to compete vigorously for projects for Ireland. Kildare has in recent years attracted some world class manufacturing companies and at present there are 26 IDA Ireland supported companies in Kildare employing approximately 9,131 people.In March 2009, Hewlett Packard announced the creation of up to 500 jobs for Leixlip Co Kildare.   It must be remembered, however, that jobs announced are typically created over a period of up to three to five years. In addition, the IDA has arranged two site visits for potential investors to date in 2010.Details of job gains and losses in companies supported by Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, in the county are set out in the first table.  Statistical information in relation to jobs supported by the County Enterprise Boards (CEBs) is collated annually and the second table shows the numbers of jobs existing in Kildare CEB assisted companies for the years in question. Figures in relation to job losses in CEB-assisted companies are not collated.20052006200720082009TotalJob Gains1,0339566784633803,510Job Losses4407141,3271,3332,1145,928Net Position593242-649-870-1,734-2,418Year20052006200720082009Net Jobs Existing in CEB assisted companies in Kildare8158571,004.5975897.5

While jobs announced are typically created over a period of up to three to five years, it should be noted that, in the 5 years from the beginning of 2005 to the end of 2009 (the latest date for which figures are available) a total of 1,679 jobs were actually created in IDA supported companies in Waterford City and County.  At present there are 31 IDA Ireland supported companies in Waterford City and County employing over 5,900 people.

#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	742	The centre referred to by the Deputy is funded under my Department's scheme to strengthen and support volunteering.   In 2010 the centre received funding of €122,957.As the Deputy is aware, the Government is currently engaged in preparing the Estimates for 2011 in the context of the forthcoming Budget.  While at this stage I cannot give a commitment to any individual organisation, I will be endeavouring to make the best possible use of the resources available, taking account of the need to prioritise frontline services and ensure value for money.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	743	The Department has now completed a review of the contents of available files that were located following a review of file listings.  Given that the initial question related to contracts that may have been placed up to seventy years ago, there was very little material found that referred to institutional laundries and much of what is available is incomplete.   It is clear however from a review of the files that such laundries had tendered for the award of contracts from the Department.  However, it has not proven possible to confirm whether any institutional laundry was actually awarded a contract.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	744	Within the context of consolidating the public finances, the Government is firmly focused on maintaining the operational efficiency of the Permanent Defence Force. Government approval was secured in the context of Budget 2010 for a level of 10,000 all ranks. This reflects the reductions in personnel recommended in the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes.  Targeted recruitment is being carried out in 2010 in order to maintain the operational capability of the Defence Forces.  To this end I approved the recruitment of 40 Recruits to the Naval Service, limited recruitment to the Army and the intake of 30 Cadets from the Cadetship Competition 2010 which closed on the 28th July 2010.  I intend, with the support of the Chief of Staff and within the resources available, to retain the capacity of the organisation to operate effectively across all roles while contributing to the necessary public service economies.
