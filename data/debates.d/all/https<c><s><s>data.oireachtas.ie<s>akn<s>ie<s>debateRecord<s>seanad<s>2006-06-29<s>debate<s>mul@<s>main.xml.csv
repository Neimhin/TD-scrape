An attempt to rerun the divisive and opportunistic debates which occurred during the 1980s will bring about a major blow to the body politic. I welcome the fact that differences exist in political parties, including my own, on this issue. In a recent European Parliament vote, four of my colleagues took one view, while another colleague took a different view. I welcome that.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	13	I appeal to political parties to allow a free vote on this issue to stop the rerun of the 1980s debate and for them to stop corralling people. Let us be open and honest with one another as individuals. No manifesto commitments were given on this issue at the last election. The idea that political parties can take collective views on an issue of personal conscience is simply ridiculous and they would be taking a far more fair and mature view if they chose not to so do. I hope this House will take a lead in this regard by debating the issue as individuals, rather than as members of political parties.

He may be due another trip for the same purpose. His comment was quite appalling.A reasonable argument has been put forward on an issue. I did not hear the "Morning Ireland" radio programme this morning, on which I understand the issue was discussed.

#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	18	However, I read the piece in the Irish Independent this morning. It was the only newspaper to carry the story, and it has no by-line. This is a matter of extraordinarily serious consequence and I accept that people hold different views. I suspect that views differ on both sides of the House. This morning I had made special note to raise this issue in the House, because people should discuss it seriously and should consider all the views.Members have seen the suffering that has come to families which cope with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and a range of other issues. While I neither know nor purport to put forward the answers in this regard, apparently such conditions may be alleviated to some extent by stem cell research. I also understand that people have different views in this regard. Last week, they were articulated in this House by Senators Ó Murchú, Quinn and other Members in respect of the difference between embryonic stem cells and adult cells. I am not familiar with the various arguments for and against such research.However, this is absolutely crucial. For me, it recalls a debate in this House in 1989, when my colleague, Senator Norris, asked for a debate on AIDS. Debate on that subject was absolutely resisted for a long number of months. Eventually, this was the first House in which it was discussed. That was in 1987 or 1989, I cannot remember the exact date. This is a major issue and while it sits in the ether, ordinary people will be led down the garden path. Perhaps they will go to quacks who do not know anything about it and purport to provide treatment which will not be effective at all. This issue must be regulated and co-ordinated.I am concerned the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, apparently stated something different to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin. They are entitled to hold different views. My purpose is not to open up or create splits in the Government. It is to highlight the fact that we need to discuss this matter. One of the Ministers should come to the House for a debate. It will not be a party political debate as the Leader's side of the House will have as much interest, information and concern as this side.We must approach the matter by listening to one another's points of view. We may differ on the issues but we will come to conclusions or at least become more informed. We will be able to tell our constituents what are our views. We may not all agree but we will be able to progress the matter in a way that reflects the views of the country, and everybody will have their views on the record. This debate is essential and urgent. Will the Leader find time to have it?This time last year the Leader gave me a commitment to debate early child care on the first week back after the summer recess and she delivered on it. I do not want a rushed debate on this issue.

If the Leader states the only time it is possible is during the first week back that makes sense.The House should welcome an initiative described in The Irish Times today. The newspaper will make its archive which goes back to 1859 available to every school and researcher worldwide. This is an extraordinary and mind-boggling initiative. It opens up information and provides access to people at all levels. It should be recommended to all newspapers.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	21	Yesterday morning I was accused of being ambivalent about killing. I read what I stated, which was "though I may find it morally wrong". I previously stood up in this House and condemned the murder of Rachel Corry. I also condemned the murders of 43,000 civilians in Iraq. I frequently stated that the deliberate or reckless targeting of civilians is a profound wrong. Whether it is deliberate as in a suicide bombing or reckless as in rocketing cars containing 15 year old girls, it is profoundly and morally wrong.I will not allow anybody to suggest to me that he or she will dictate the language I will use when oppressed people are treated in the way Israel treats the people of Gaza. Israel bombed a power station, and without a doubt, children will die throughout Gaza because electricity is not available to them and because the roads have been destroyed.I have a hierarchy of values and the victims of oppression come at the top of my hierarchy. My great hero of Irish politics is Daniel O'Connell.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	23	I subscribe fully to his views on the uselessness and futility of violence. I also remember his extraordinary courage in refusing to visit the United States because it was a slave owning country. He refused to shake the hands of citizens of states of the union which practised slavery. He condemned the oppression of the Aboriginal people in Australia in 1840, before anyone else had noticed. I am a pygmy by comparison with Daniel O'Connell. However, I take my inspiration from him and I will not be lectured into a moral hierarchy in which the killings by oppressed people are worthy of much more unqualified condemnation than the murder of 43,000 civilians in Iraq by so-called civilised democratic governments. I will not be bounced into that position.Regarding the matter raised by my two colleagues, I was on the other side of many of the arguments during the controversies of the 1980s. However, my memory is apparently better than theirs. I remember the name of the Lord Jesus Christ being insulted in this House by somebody who chose to use appalling language here today. I remember what he said then and I remember what I said then too, and I will repeat now. It is a gross abuse of proper political debate.That said, this raises a profound ethical issue. It is extraordinarily wrong that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment should decide the views of this country and the Government on an issue with such profound ethical implications.

#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	33	Senator Ryan and I agree on one particular aspect of this matter, which is that it is not simple. The House has an good tradition of debating extremely difficult and sensitive moral issues without heat and in a balanced and fair way. I particularly recall when the all-party committee reported on the matter of the X case and abortion. We must be careful in our use of language and our reactions. It arouses strong emotions and feelings, which is understandable.It is claimed, which I believe is correct, that a moral clause should exist whereby in matters of conscience people should be able to vote as they wish. It is a rule in my party and on occasions we voted in different ways and I accept what Senator Brian Hayes stated. If such a moral clause exists, it should apply to Government Ministers in the same way as to every other Member.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	34	Yes, exactly.

#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	36	Therefore, I defend the right of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, to state what he did. In addition, the Minister was adamant that his view was not that represented by the headline in the newspaper. That assertion was subsequently endorsed by the journalist, who replied to the matter.We must be extremely careful about these matters. Serious ethical and moral considerations are involved which evoke strong feelings. It is appropriate for this House to debate those issues fully. However, we must be conscious of our responsibilities. It would be most unfortunate if these matters were to be politicised because freedom of conscience is extremely important.Senator Leyden yesterday raised the matter of the Middle East, which was also referred to indirectly today by Senator Ryan. It is most urgent that we debate it, particularly the situation involving Palestine, Israel and the West Bank. The trend of events suggests a capacity for major impact not only in the immediate area but throughout the Middle East.The Finnish ambassador attended yesterday's meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee European Affairs to outline the list of priorities for Finland's European Presidency, which is about to begin. I made an appeal to him that the Finnish Presidency keep the matter of Palestine dominant within its considerations of foreign affairs. At least the EU would then be able to bring its voice to bear on the matter, particularly to ensure that humanitarian aid gets to the people most affected by these conflicts, who are without electricity and water. I refer particularly to the children as it is important that they be well looked after.These are important issues and I ask the Leader to try to provide time for debate. I understand and fully appreciate that we have a very busy schedule next week, during which legislation will be a priority. However, it is important that even a small amount of time be allowed to consider these matters.

Iarnród Éireann has been marketing itself positively and trying to streamline its operations to facilitate its customers, yet I was delayed for two hours on the early morning train yesterday due to the maverick action of a worker in Mallow Station. The knock-on effect was that the train was packed with people standing and schoolchildren on a school tour from Kilflynn in Tralee were delayed for two hours on their journey to Dublin.I raise this issue because the unions have a responsibility. If there is industrial relations machinery——

With the partnership talks and Sustaining Progress, we are building a mechanism to protect ourselves against these eventualities. I saw at first hand yesterday how people were affected by them.I contacted Iarnród Éireann this morning and officials told me industrial relations machinery is in place regarding the issue in question but that the person concerned took unilateral action. Unilateral action should not be affecting the public as in this case. We cannot seriously market Iarnród Éireann if this kind of maverick carry-on continues, and it is about time we left it behind us.

I asked for a debate to start with and explained why I believed it necessary. I spoke on this subject last week and I was very taken by Senator Quinn's suggestion on that occasion that the place for these debates is here in Ireland and not necessarily in Europe. I support that. I very much support Senator Brian Hayes in what he said this morning. I have always believed votes of conscience should be allowed in any Parliament. We have done a great disservice to this nation by railroading people into corrals, exactly as the Senator described, on the occasion of votes. This does not help debate.I am a little worried that people's hopes are being raised although their expectations may not be substantiated in any way. It is not right to raise the hopes of people who are suffering from terrible ailments. I do not have all the answers and each speaker in the House is correct in saying this is a very complex issue on which we need advice and guidance. With all due respect, this House is the place to debate the matter. I have my views and the other Senators will have theirs. Some of these views will be articulated on ethical grounds and others on different grounds. I am particularly worried that an element of this debate is more commercial than ethical.

I am sorry about the way I spoke to the Leas-Chathaoirleach.I find myself generally on the side of Senator Ryan on many human rights issues. I was particularly worried to hear a power station had been bombed in Gaza because we know electricity is necessary in hospitals, etc. Children will certainly suffer, as will old people, but they will not make the headlines. If Hamas has any influence in regard to the young Israeli soldier in question, it should ensure his release immediately and have him sent back to his unit and family. The Israeli Government should note that the individuals it captured or kidnapped over the years, who are now in Israeli prisons, should also be released.

Is it not very strange that the current events are occurring at such a time?I apologise again for what I said to the Leas-Chathaoirleach.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	60	I heard the debate on stem cell research on RTE this morning and it seemed that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, was giving a kind of post-dated cheque and saying that if stem cell research proved effective and to have results, a case might be considered. This is an interesting position. He also referred to the question of ethical subsidiarity, which involves a free vote of conscience for different European countries. This is welcome.I note that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, was recently in Rome. I raised this issue yesterday. One of the subjects the Minister discussed concerned the political aspects of embryonic research. I hope the Vatican will not attempt to instruct people on how they should vote based on their religious affiliation. It is very important that we have a reasoned debate and that words such as "murder" are kept out of it.I listened with interest and sadness to an Irish Member of the European Parliament referring to five-day old embryos as "daughters" and "sons". They plainly are not; they are a form of life but to describe them and someone's "daughters" or "sons" is totally unhelpful as they lack a central nervous system.It is very important that we have a debate on the Middle East. The Americans and Israelis are talking about "asymmetrical warfare". The current events represent asymmetry at its highest. I agree with Senator Ó Murchú that it is very suspicious that this kind of situation should develop just when Hamas made a major diplomatic advance in terms of recognition, to which matter I referred yesterday. I believe the current events are an attempt to disturb this. They are very worrying and appalling and my belief is confirmed by a report by Michael Jansen in The Irish Times today. We appear to have no concern whatever in Europe for the human rights of the Palestinian people, even for their basic right to survival. If we did, we would have operated the human rights clauses of the external association agreement.The bombing of the power station may well cause difficulties for hospitals but even more widespread will be the difficulty in acquiring the very basic element of water. The pumps and sewerage systems do not work and people are being deliberately driven back into the Stone Age. This is appalling and is being done by the army, an arm of the Israeli state. The home-made rockets sent in from the territories are the work of maverick groups.I note with great sadness that the Israelis are once more talking about Mahmoud Abbas as not being a partner for peace. This is the way they discredited Mr. Arafat. It reminds me of the kind of language used all the time by Ian Paisley in Northern Ireland in that it was said that Captain O'Neill must go, Mr. Faulkner must go and nobody is a partner for peace. They should grow up.It has been reported that the CIA has been monitoring banking transactions. Did Irish officials know about this? Was our Government aware that the bank accounts of individual Irish citizens were being monitored secretly by the CIA, apparently in flagrant violation of international data protection law? We are entitled to know that, particularly in light of the ongoing concern about the rendition flights.A Fianna Fáil Member, the Vice Chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, tabled a motion to that committee and the Joint Committee on European Affairs requesting an invitation to be sent to Senator Marty to address those committees. The motion was passed in both cases. Would the Leader consider it appropriate for Senator Marty to come to this House, if he comes before the other committees, because we have taken a particular interest in that matter? People who have been critical of the report would then have the opportunity of directly questioning him.

I realise the Leader has a very busy schedule coming up to the end of the session but we should ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to call for a meeting of the Security Council because the United Nations is standing idly by in this regard. The direction is coming from Washington. The President has stated Israel's right to defend itself. In this case a soldier was kidnapped. A settler has been murdered. Fourteen young Palestinians were murdered by the Israelis. It is tit for tat and excessive force is being used. Israel does not want to rescue the soldier. It wants to murder because it suits its cause to go back into Gaza.

#TerryLeyden	unknown-#TerryLeyden-party	unknown-#TerryLeyden-dob	unknown-#TerryLeyden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	63	If Israel wanted to get the soldier released it would not attack people, take out power stations and bridges and go door to door in Gaza. It would engage in a negotiated settlement to get the soldier released. It is trying to eliminate the Palestinian state. Members of the Hamas Government, who are democratically elected parliamentarians, have been arrested by the Israeli forces. As someone who supported America's involvement in Shannon — my nephew served with the forces during the war — I say to the American people that this action is being carried out in their name through a proxy, Israel, with the support of Condoleezza Rice and George Bush. I call on the United Nations to have a special meeting of the Security Council to curb the ambitions of the Israelis who are determined to wipe out the Palestinian state. That is the reality and if we do not make that call and stand idly by, we are not taking our position as Members of this House seriously.

The Oireachtas health committee had a meeting yesterday on the related issue of assisted human reproduction. It is regrettable that it was leaked to The Irish Times even though it was agreed at the meeting it would not be reported. I compliment the work of Senator Henry on that important topic. The message I got from the meeting yesterday was that a commission has sat for some years on the issue, a report has been published and there is a major gap in the law in terms of protecting women, especially those undergoing IVF treatment. If we do not fill that gap as legislators, terrible scenarios will arise. Senator Ó Murchú made a valid point about commercialisation in the area of stem cell research but if we allow a scenario such as that the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, envisaged, namely, that we would not allow stem cell research here but are willing to benefit from research carried out abroad, we will have no control over——

We should have a debate in the early autumn on this important issue. One person whose views on the matter we must hear is the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children. We now have a report from the commission. We are due a report from the Oireachtas health committee shortly. It is now time for action on this matter. There is no regulation in this very complicated area. Some parts of it can be done immediately. Others require legislation in both Houses, which can be debated at length, while some require constitutional amendment, which will warrant further debate. It is important we debate this issue in a measured and calm way.
#MaryMWhite	unknown-#MaryMWhite-party	unknown-#MaryMWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryMWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	67	I call for an urgent debate with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, to discuss the abhorrent issue of sex trafficking, a burgeoning business worth an estimated €28 billion per annum worldwide. That makes this heinous crime the second largest source of profit of organised crime after drug trafficking. The United Nations estimates that more than 1 million persons are trafficked every year, mainly women and children but some boys and men also.We were all rightly horrified by the "Prime Time Investigates" programme of 8 May but the issue appears to have left the political radar and conscience. I take the opportunity to laud our Leader, Senator O'Rourke, who proposes to introduce a Bill on sex trafficking.

The "Prime Time Investigates" programme highlighted the way the women are being exploited in towns and cities throughout the country. There must be a concerted effort to highlight the fact that this is a modern day slave trade——

We, as legislators, must initiate a zero tolerance approach to those who are engaged in trafficking human beings for sex. The idea that they are acting with relative impunity makes me sick to my stomach. I want to see this issue accorded the priority it deserves and zero tolerance legislation introduced as quickly as possible.

That was not my intention. My concern was that killing and kidnapping by any side in a conflict should always be condemned, regardless of the respective moral standing of the opposing sides. Senator Ryan's concern was that the Palestinians who carried out those actions should not be considered terrorists. Listening to him I got the impression, perhaps wrongly, that he was condoning those actions or seeking to excuse them whereas I personally take the view that such actions should always be condemned. That was the simple point I was trying to make and I am sorry that, in doing so, I may have expressed myself badly or given offence when none was intended. I wanted to make sure that was understood.

I will not repeat what Senator Ó Murchú said but I agree this is the House in which that debate should take place. I also support Senator Hayes's view — we do not have this problem on the Independent side — that it should be a free vote and not controlled by party leaders. That would be a worthy debate.Figures show that the personal debt of our citizens is huge. That is a worrying and potentially destabilising situation. Credit card debt is in the region of €2 billion and that is being paid for at a rate of approximately 19% by those generous banks which I am sure are happy to do so. There are perhaps 1 million SSIA holders, many of whom may have credit cards. It is up to us as a State to remind those people, as they receive this huge sum of money from these savings accounts, to first pay off their credit card debts. They will have plenty of money to spare but there is a danger that people will spend it on other items and end up paying huge interest rates to banks on credit cards. I hope there is some way we could get across that message. Perhaps it is in the hands of the State through the Minister for Finance but whoever sends it, that message should go out strongly and clearly.

Perhaps it might be a suitable opportunity for the Leader to outline next week's programme, in so far as she is aware of it, and the proposed sitting days. Will she tell the House when the Government intends to debate Committee Stage of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill, Second Stage of which was debated here last week?In view of yesterday's statement by the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Noel Ahern, on the prohibition of stage payments, of which everyone spoke in favour for all the obvious reasons, his comments would be more appropriate for the contracts section of that Bill. We would need to hear from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the matter.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	77	I support the call for a debate on stem cell research. What Senator Browne said was very important. We need to include in this debate what our attitudes will be towards any treatments that may be found useful. Will we, in fact, insist that they are not allowed in this country? Another topic that should be included in the debate is what our attitude will be towards the various pharmaceutical companies in this country who are carrying out stem cell research in other countries. How do we feel about that?We must ensure that this debate is broad and realistic. Like many people, I have concerns about the ethics of working with embryonic stem cells. At the same time I recognise the possibilities with them. There has not been much concrete evidence yet of cures as regards various neurological diseases, in particular. However, given the responses of people with conditions such as motor neuron disease, multiple sclerosis and so forth, perhaps my attitude my be different if I was suffering from any of those diseases.We must, however, address the situation of the pharmaceutical companies as well. It must be recalled that these are the people who are making the profits from such research, not the individual research workers. We must look at the pharmaceutical companies as well.

It is notable that there have been Europa Nostra Awards for two projects. The OPW was involved in one for the fine restoration of the curvilinear glasshouse project at the National Botanic Gardens, in which the Taoiseach was interested and promoted. The work of the Irish Georgian Society over 40 or 50 years was also recognised. That society's main contribution, perhaps, was at a time when there was very little money in the country and when for understandable historical reasons people had mixed feelings about that part of our heritage. However, its advocacy has been such that ultimately there is very little equivocation in this regard anymore, which is to the benefit of the country. Members on all sides of the House will probably welcome the opportunity for a wide-ranging debate on our cultural heritage in the autumn, perhaps, because very little legislation comes forward on this area.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	81	I should like the Leader to invite the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to the House for a debate on Ireland's drop in domestic competitiveness as a result of high business costs imposed by the Government. We must end the process by reducing the costs of business through the process of taxation by stealth. Rising costs are having a serious impact on businesses, particular small to medium-sized enterprises and it is important to review our industrial policy in the light of what is happening. We see, virtually on a daily basis, small companies folding up and moving elsewhere in Europe where they have better services and fewer stealth taxes, etc.There is no evidence that the Government is doing anything as regards this whole issue. It stands idly by as jobs are being lost. We all received copies of the IDA Ireland report for 2005, which was published during the week. It was alarming to read that while something in the region of 12,000 jobs were created by IDA Ireland last year, some 9,000 were lost countrywide. That is a serious situation and needs to be addressed.On the issue of Iarnród Éireann, as raised by my colleague, Senator Finucane, I had a similar experience last week where a number of people across the midlands were stranded on a train that had left Sligo. It had to change drivers at Maynooth, but no driver turned up there. As a result, a number of people travelling to the UK missed their flights. I wrote to Iarnród Éireann as regards compensation for those people, because they are entitled to it. The fault lies solely with Iarnród Éireann that they missed their flight and action must be taken. I want a debate in the House as soon as possible on the reliability of Iarnród Éireann.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	82	I was just thinking about how Senator Finucane rightly expressed his anger over what happened to the train, yesterday. It is about time that many of us got angry and demanded better services. I am also thinking of An Post. Every summer the same thing happens with our postal service. Postmen have to take holidays, but no system is put in place to ensure that the post is delivered every day. How can companies in this country function, where the post may come only every second day? In some cases, I have been told, people are waiting for post for three or four days. That is not good enough and it happens every summer. It will happen at other periods, too, when one knows the postman is on holiday. These matters have to be planned and systems should be put in place to ensure that services continue as they should.At the very least, An Post should tell us that during the summer we will only get post every second day, or twice a week. It should just let us know what is happening. The present system is unacceptable. We have come to accept that things do not work properly. We do not shout loud enough and demand we get a proper service. This is one area where the service provided is not good enough.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	83	I very much welcomed the opportunity, last night, to speak on cancer services. It was an opportunity for the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, to put forward the Government's policy, as well. Good arguments were made. An obvious one was that where specialised cancer services are required there has to be a critical mass of expertise, knowledge and skills. That is acceptable and we must live in the real world, when that is the case. However, we cannot use peripherality as an excuse for not locating cancer services in particular areas. There is a very active group in my area, known as the Donegal Action for Cancer Care group. The people who underpin that group have suffered cancer in the past. They are the people who know, and who have suffered the arduous journey from Donegal to Dublin, sometimes taking seven hours. They argue that cancer services are needed in our area.I know Senator Norris has difficulty with this because he has argued before that there cannot be cancer services, willy-nilly, all over the country. However, the people of the north west do not just include Donegal. They also live in counties Derry, Tyrone, Fermanagh, Donegal and Sligo. Senator Scanlon flew the flag for Sligo yesterday. There is a critical mass of population to justify a single satellite service facility in the north west. If there are radiotherapy services in Dublin and units proposed for Waterford, Limerick, Cork and Galway, we still have to look at the north west region.People are talking about trains not being on time. The people in the north west do not have a train from Letterkenny to Dublin. We cannot even make the argument about poor punctuality when it comes to train services. Those who underpin a campaign group dealing with concerns over cancer services being downgraded in the north west are shouting out loud that they want facilities near them because they do not want to engage in arduous journey times of up to seven hours from Letterkenny to Dublin.As legislators, we have a duty to listen to them and take on board their viewpoints.Yesterday, the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power, indicated that the Government will not be sporadically putting satellite cancer service units all over the country. What is the Government policy on locating a specialised radiotherapy unit in the north west? The people in the Donegal Action for Cancer Care group and cancer sufferers will want nothing less than services in their own region.
#LiamFitzgerald	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-party	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	84	I join Senator Terry in a call for a debate on the postal service, which is appalling. As a member of a trade union, it grieves me to admit that despite repeated efforts on my part and on the part of many people in my community, there is a totally inefficient and even absent postal service. I was told by senior members of the trade union involved to fire the relevant postmen myself. I had to collect my post at the local exchange for three years. I was stopped by a trade union official and told I would have to pay. I paid and collected my own post and my neighbours' post because it was not being delivered to our homes.The situation has gone so far out of control recently that weeks have passed without any post being delivered. It finally came to a head when neighbours had to collect other neighbours' post on the side of the road and deliver it through their letter boxes, including my own. It is about time we all faced reality. I fully support Senator Terry's comments and I call on the Leader to have a debate so that we can face down the trade unions. We must ask them to act responsibly in the interests of a postal service that soon will not exist if urgent action is not taken.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	85	Senator Brian Hayes, Leader of the Opposition, brought up the very important topic of stem cell research. Equally important was the climate in which he wished such a debate to be couched. I fully agree with him. The lead-up to a general election is fertile ground for intolerance. I remember the mid to late 1980s when such an intolerance was expressed. There was a fear that one would have to toe the line and I hope that a postcard campaign will not develop which demands that one say A or B.

There is no room in such a debate for that kind of name calling. I dread that in the next nine months, black and white stances will be taken on this debate. This is not a black and white issue.

It was very worthy of Senator Hayes to raise the matter in the way he did. He went on to say that he thought political parties would give a free vote to their members. I fear that will not be the case, but I hope the debate will not reach that point. I admire the fact that members of the same parties in Europe were able to divide on the issue without rancour. One of the good things about the system in Europe is that each speaker is limited to three minutes, which provides very little time for rancour to be displayed. I hope we are in for a period of civilised discussion and not an array of postcards with demands. It is not that kind of an issue.Senator O'Toole asked for a serious debate on co-ordination and regulation in our first week back. We will not get around to debating it next week and I have a statement to give on that matter. We hope to have such a debate on our first week back. The last time the Tánaiste came here to debate such a matter she did so as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. One might think that is an incongruous Department for such a debate, but she came in that guise because of the research possibilities of that work. Therefore, I do not know whether the Tánaiste or the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, will attend the debate. The Senator also spoke about The Irish Times opening up its archives for schools and the wonderful work which will be done. The schools are being very pro-active and that is excellent.Senator Ryan stated that targeting civilians and an oppressed people is profoundly wrong. Targeting children, knocking out power stations and blowing up water reservoirs is equally wrong. I am also glad to see that the Senator received an apology.Senator Dardis also raised the issue of stem cell research and stated that it was not a simple matter of right and wrong. He also stated that he asked the Finnish European Affairs Minister to ensure that the Finnish Presidency kept the Palestinian question high on the EU agenda.Senator Finucane spoke about the maverick train drivers who hold up a day's travelling. It is easy to say that it is a trade union matter, but the trade unions have been very spirited about it and have stated openly that they do not condone these actions. It is very difficult for a trade unionist to impose his or her will on the spot. I take the Senator's point about people being left high and dry.Senator Ó Murchú stated that a debate was necessary on stem cell research and that votes of conscience should be allowed. I wish that were the case. He spoke about the human rights situation in the Middle East. Senator Norris referred to the water supply in Palestine and asked whether Senator Marty should appear before the House. The Committee on Procedure and Privileges took a view that people we invite would be of a particular calibre. That is not to condemn Senator Marty, but I do not know how to put it in words. The committee stated that such people should be of international calibre. The proposal can be put to the CPP.

Senator Leyden spoke about Gaza and the Hamas Government. Israel stated that the people kidnapped are not bargaining chips. It is tit for tat, but one side is superior to the other and the oppressed are suffering.I was very interested in Senator Browne's comments. He warned against the commercialisation of research and talked about the debate at the health committee about assisted reproduction and the need for proper regulation of that area. I know couples who have been helped by IVF to realise their dreams. I hope there is no debate about it because it is a very good thing. The type of debate about which he speaks would be good if we could do it.I thank Senator White for raising the trafficking of women for sex. I hope to produce my own Private Members' Bill next week. It will not be taken until the autumn, but my Bill is well thought out. We were all shocked when we saw the story on "Prime Time" because it was dreadful, but then it dropped like a stone. This is because they were women and it was an easy thing to do.

I hope the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will accept my Bill.Senator Quinn spoke graciously and expressed his regrets to Senator Ryan, which were needed and well merited. I am sure Senator Ryan accepted them. He sought a debate on stem cell research. He also spoke about credit card debt and recommended that people use the proceeds of their SSIAs to clear personal debt, which would be a good idea before embarking on another credit card splurge.Senator Coghlan sensibly asked about next week's schedule. While we are likely to be sitting for five days, we are not sure yet. It depends on the outcome in the Dáil of Report and Final Stages of the Criminal Justice Bill. If we sit on Monday we will commence at 3 p.m. to allow people to come from the country. The legislation to be taken next week will be as follows: the Criminal Justice Bill; the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal (Amendment) Bill; the Institutes of Technology Bill; the Building Societies (Amendment) Bill; and the Investment Funds, Companies and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill. The Senator also asked about Committee Stage of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill, which will take place in the autumn, when he is refreshed from his stay in Kerry.

Whatever way the Senator put her words, they epitomised to me the complexity of the issue. While she expressed concerns about the moral aspects, she also expressed concern about potential benign effects for people suffering from various ills.Senator Mansergh spoke about the two Europa Nostra Awards for the curvilinear glasshouse project at the National Botanic Gardens and the work of the Irish Georgian Society, which is excellent. The Irish Georgian Society ploughed a very lonely furrow for many years, possibly because of our colonial hang-ups, which I hope have gone.

A particular report has recently been published. I accept what he said about Iarnród Éireann and the unreliability of a certain train. I am not sure whether the Senator was on the train or was told about it. Those on the train coming from Sligo needed to change at Maynooth. In a modern age with benchmarking and wonderful arrangements between everybody, it is difficult to weed out every glitch in the system.

#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	101	I know all about it.In addition to expressing anger at the train delays, Senator Terry also spoke about the postal delays, which occur everywhere. I live 100 yd from the sorting office. If I get my mail, it arrives at approximately 3 p.m., which is an amazing phenomenon. I understand An Post has a new man at the helm. Changes always take place and I hope this will continue to be the case.Senator McHugh as always spoke with great empathy about cancer services. He said that peripherality should not be used as an excuse for not making services available, which is correct. It is easy to refer to peripherality especially for those who live on islands or, as the Senator does, in a remote part of the country. He listened to the debate about the unreliability of trains and wished that he could have a train service to Donegal, regardless of whether it was reliable.I heard the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, speak about acute services as opposed to palliative services. Palliative services can always be offered regardless of how remote is the region. However, this is not true for the acute services unless they are grouped in an area. The Senator outlined a feasible grouping of acute services. It is unacceptable for patients to undergo a seven-hour journey, followed by treatment and then another seven-hour journey home, and they may face further issues on arrival home. The Senator fights the good fight and I hope he will ultimately get what he seeks, as it is strong policy.Senator Fitzgerald is very passionate about the postal service and what it has meant to him. While I could not quite follow the episode he outlined, it seems to be quite nasty and particularly unreliable. I hope that a way to rectify the issue can be found. I advise the Senator and Senator Terry that we will not be able to hold a debate next week. However, I can promise it for the week when we come back.

The primary purpose of the Bill is to provide the legislative framework for the operation in Ireland of business improvement district schemes, or BIDS as they are more commonly known. The Bill also proposes to make two technical amendments to the rating and valuation systems which will terminate an anomaly between these two codes and introduce more equity into the rating system.Some Senators will be aware of business improvement district schemes in operation in other countries such as the USA and Canada. A BID scheme can be described as an organisational and financing mechanism with legal backing through which businesses can develop and implement initiatives in defined areas to improve those areas for the betterment of the trading environment. Essentially, in a BID scheme, a group of businesses come together and decide that they want improved services, a wider range of services, or new facilities or activities in the area in which they operate and that they are willing to pay for it. A specially established BID company is charged with responsibility for implementing the provisions of the BID scheme and the local authority levies and collects the annual BID contributions from businesses on behalf of the scheme.A wide range of activities can be carried out in a business improvement district scheme, ranging from cleaning, hospitality, promotions and special events to physical improvements, such as the provision of street furniture, signage and special lighting. The extent and type of possible activities is limited only by business needs and the imagination and determination of the business community.A fundamental feature of the legislation is that the geographical boundary of a business improvement district and the range of services and improvements carried out in the district are determined and developed by the business community. Thus, the private sector — the business community — rather than central or local government is the driving force behind these schemes. It is, therefore, a self-help, bottom-up and collaborative approach by business. The BIDS concept turns the traditional relationship between businesses and local authorities on its head. Traditionally, businesses encouraged local authorities to reduce charges and rates but, with BIDS, businesses encourage local authorities to levy and collect more money.The initiative for this Bill came from the private sector. Work on the Bill followed a request from the Dublin City Business Association, DCBA. Originating in Toronto, Canada in 1971, business improvement district schemes are now in operation in many cities and towns throughout the world. It is estimated that more than 400 BID type schemes are currently in operation in Canada and the United States of America. European countries are also becoming increasingly involved in these schemes, including Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Holland and Portugal. More recently, a legislative framework has been put in place in the United Kingdom for the operation of these schemes. I do not want to overstate the potential dividends of BIDS but it strikes me that most of the countries I referred to are doing very well in the World Cup. Research on the operation of business improvement districts in the USA has indicated that they provide a vehicle for innovative and proactive management of an area and yield significant positive impacts on the economic vitality and viability of cities and towns.In developing the provisions of the Bill, extensive consultation was carried out with interested bodies, including local authorities, the DCBA and Chambers Ireland which, in general, welcome the introduction of BIDS legislation. Great enthusiasm has been expressed for this Bill in the business community and a number of well attended information seminars and conferences on BIDS have been organised in anticipation of the legislation. DCBA and Dublin City Council have already committed resources to prepare for the introduction of BIDS.No two BIDS will be exactly the same. The improvements made will depend ultimately on the needs of a particular area. The planting of trees, shrubs and other landscaping may be a priority for one business improvement district so as to improve the visual attractiveness of the area, whereas another BID may decide on the erection of suitable street lighting and the installation of CCTV for security reasons. In some cases, the promotion of the area through marketing literature, posters or special street events may be the spark needed to boost commercial activity.Litter is an issue close to my heart. As Senators will be aware, litter is a constant challenge to our environment, and the urban environment in particular. We are making progress in that respect. The recipe for success in tackling litter is to foster a public attitude that looks upon littering as unacceptable behaviour. The eradication of litter pollution will only be achieved through a partnership approach in which all sectors, including businesses, community groups, residents associations, schools and individuals, play their part. Recent examples of this partnership approach in action include the recent agreement with the chewing gum industry and the ongoing negotiations with banks and the fast food industry. BIDS have the potential to be an important added initiative in tackling the litter problem. Supplemental cleaning services can be carried out in a BID area, including additional street sweeping and cleaning, bin emptying, the removal of chewing gum from footpaths and the removal of graffiti from buildings. This has been a prominent and popular feature of schemes operating in other countries.I would like to set out for the House the main elements involved in business improvement district schemes and the principal issues in developing, running and financing a scheme. Given its link with local government, the Bill provides that the legislative framework for BIDS will be incorporated into the Local Government Act 2001. Section 4 of the Bill inserts a new Part 13A into that Act, consisting of new sections 129A to 129T. For ease of reference in discussing the Bill, I will refer to the new sections in the Local Government Act 2001 because they are set out clearly in the Bill as initiated and in the explanatory memorandum.The first step in initiating a business district scheme is a recognition by the business community that a BID scheme is appropriate to a particular location and an agreement on the types of services, works or other projects desired. Section 129C provides that people wishing to start a business improvement district may submit a proposal to the local authority for approval. The section sets out the elements that must be included in a BID proposal, such as details of the initiatives to be carried out, the boundary of the proposed BID, estimates of the BID contributions to be paid by business and the timeframe for the scheme. In practice, the development of this plan will require the BID proponents and the local authority to work together in a partnership approach.All investment made through BIDS will be additional and complementary to existing services in the area and will ensure enhanced impacts on the social and economic vitality in the chosen area. It is critical to underline that the services in a BID add to, and do not substitute for, those already provided by the local authority. The level of services provided by the local authority is benchmarked as part of the process under section 129B.A key to the ultimate success of business improvement districts will be the extent to which there is meaningful engagement with the public and business in an area. The Bill sets out a framework for such comprehensive consultation. In the first instance, a BID proposal submitted to a local authority must be made available to the public under section 129D and the rating authority must, by way of public notice, invite submissions from the public on the proposal.Section 129F provides that if the rating authority is of the opinion, based on the submissions received, that the BID proposal is inconsistent with the interests of the local community, it shall notify the BID proponents of the nature of the inconsistency and require them to consider the issue further. A local authority cannot approve a BID scheme if it believes it conflicts with the interests of the community.A BID scheme involves payment of a contribution by business to finance the works planned. It is vital, therefore, that all businesses in a proposed business improvement district have a formal say on whether a BID is to proceed. To that end, section 129G makes it mandatory that, before a scheme can proceed, a formal plebiscite will be held by ratepayers in the area, that is, among those who would ultimately be responsible for financing the scheme. The plebiscite is organised by the local authority. In the BID plebiscite, each business will have a vote of equal value irrespective of the size of the business. The corner shop's vote is as valuable as that of the major department store. This is important because a BID must have widespread and popular approval before it can proceed and cannot be organised and rammed through by a small number of big businesses. Once there is a majority vote in the plebiscite, the BID scheme can be proposed for approval to the local authority.The Bill provides for a comprehensive and necessary consultation process with appropriate approvals and checks and balances. It is important that BID proposals do not suffer paralysis by analysis. The Bill strikes the correct balance between prior consultation and progression.Having developed the proposals and secured a majority in a plebiscite to proceed, the business community does not hand over the running of the scheme to the local authority. As this is an independently organised and funded initiative, the private sector controls and manages implementation through a specially established company. Under section 129 the company must be limited by guarantee and formed and registered under the Companies Act. The board of directors of the company will be made up of businesses and their representative associations and some nominees of the local authority. At least two thirds of the directors must be ratepayers or their representatives. This company partnership will steer through the implementation of the BID plan over its possible five-year term.A key element of the Bill, which will be of particular interest to businesses, is how the annual BID contribution levy is to be calculated. The process begins with the BID company adopting a budget for the forthcoming year which will identify the income necessary to carry out the elements planned in the scheme. On the basis of this budget, the company will determine the amount of money needed to be raised by imposing BID levies on businesses in the area. When the company determines how much it will need, the local authority collects the required contribution from businesses. The amount of the levy on an individual business is determined by the rateable valuation of that business.In designing the BID legislative framework, an important consideration was that it would not require complicated new systems or structures. We were largely assisted in this regard by the existence of the tried and trusted independent valuation system and under section 129N, BID contributions will be determined on an individual basis having regard to this system.Liability for the BID levy will fall on the occupiers of commercial property in the area or the owners of commercial property where the property is vacant. We did not have to reinvent the wheel and introduce complex systems of determining liability because we are fortunate to have a rating system that operates on this basis.Following the rating law framework, contributions by businesses will be proportionate to the relative valuations of their properties. Businesses with low valuations will pay less than those with high valuations. Rateable valuation of property is determined by the independent Valuation Office. There is a right of appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation, the Valuation Tribunal and to the courts. The Valuation Office is in the process of revaluing all property in the country to ensure that the system is as equitable as possible. A national revaluation has not been undertaken since the middle of the 19th century and many changes have taken place since then. The revaluation will allow a uniform and equitable valuation base to be established and for the removal of any anomalies that may have developed.The Bill provides relief of 50% of the amount payable in cases where a property is unoccupied for the execution of alterations or repairs, if the owner of the property is unable to obtain a suitable tenant or if the premises is vacant pending a redevelopment. Refunds of BID contributions are also available where properties are demolished or destroyed.As well as providing the legal framework for the introduction of business districts, the Bill also contains two provisions that will deal with anomalous situations arising in rating and valuation law. Section 6 of the Bill provides for an amendment to the Valuation Act 2001. At the time of the drafting of the Valuation Act 2001 steps were taken to ensure that the revaluation process could not lead to disproportionate gains in rates income by local authorities in the year following a revaluation. Section 56 of that Act included a provision to limit the amount of income a local authority could raise through rates in the year following a revaluation to the amount of rates levied in the previous year, adjusted by the consumer price index for inflation.However, that section, as enacted, would have cut off rates buoyancy to local authorities that would not be in a position to gain rates income from new properties coming on stream in the year following a revaluation. This could cost local authorities approximately €30 million annually. Section 6 of the Bill deals with this and provides for the amendment of section 56 of the Valuation Act 2001 to provide that the rates payable in the year following a revaluation will include the buoyancy that would otherwise be excluded by virtue of section 56 as enacted. Other than this buoyancy element, the safeguard of the consumer price index cap will remain in place in respect of all existing ratepayers and ensure there are no disproportionate gains in rates income for local authorities. This proposal will ensure that all commercial ratepayers will pay their fair share. Chambers Ireland has indicated its support for this proposal.Section 5 of the Bill will deal with an anomaly between existing valuation law and local government rating law. Section 5 provides that newly-erected properties will be liable to pay a contribution to local authorities from the date the properties are entered on the valuation list. The anomaly is technical in nature but I will briefly set out the detail for the House. Section 28(14) of the Valuation Act 2001 provides an enabling power to allow rates to be charged on properties with effect from the date of their valuation. However, the provision cannot come into effect because of a conflict with existing rating legislation. Section 29(1) of the Local Government Act 1946, as inserted by section 45 of the Local Government Act 1994, provides that local authorities are only entitled to charge rates for the following year on those properties that are entered on the valuation list at the time of the adoption of a local authority budget.At present, when a valuation of a property is placed on a valuation list by the commissioner of valuation after the date on which a local authority has adopted its budget, a local authority cannot derive any rates income from that property until after the commencement of the subsequent year. The property gets a potential rates holiday of up to one year. This rates holiday is inequitable as the shortfall in funding that arises may have to be made up by existing ratepayers or it could have the effect of increasing other charges for services to the public.Section 5 will remove the anomaly for newly-constructed properties and thereby help both to generate much-needed funding for local authorities and to introduce equity into the rating system so that all ratepayers pay their fair share without some enjoying a shelter at the expense of others.This is an important Bill. As well as dealing with the critical valuation and rating issues I have just discussed, it provides the legislative framework to enable business improvement district schemes to operate in Ireland. While I cannot say that Ireland will do well in the next World Cup if we introduce BIDS, as seems to be the case with other countries that have them, I have no doubt that they will have a major, positive impact on our towns. The provisions in the Bill will facilitate further investment in our urban areas and will be of benefit to the business community and those who live and work in these areas. BIDS have been tested internationally for the past 25 years and are now accepted as beneficial elements in urban regeneration and revitalisation.I look forward to hearing the views of Senators on the Bill and I am sure we will engage in constructive debate over the course of its journey through the House.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	106	I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him for introducing this Bill. Fine Gael supports his efforts in principle but with some reservations. The Bill has implications for stealth taxes and reductions in local authority funding, hallmarks of this Government for the last nine years. We have concerns about the legislation and about local government in general. I hope, however, the Bill will be passed quickly.Business improvement districts are working partnerships formed between business, rate payers, property owners, tenants, residents and local authorities — hopefully everyone will come on board. The group sets up a designated fund to improve the local area and attract business. Our towns and villages should look attractive. County Longford holds the record for the tidiest villages in Europe — Ardagh, Newtowncashel, Abbeyshrule and Legan have all played their part. There is great competition within the county for the honours each year. Ardagh came third in the European Tidy Towns competition. It is a village I would encourage everyone to visit. All of Longford's towns and villages are very attractive and people should come to them when they get the opportunity. The local authority, which is Fine Gael-led, has done a huge amount of work to achieve this. I congratulate both Paddy Belton and Alan Mitchell, who will be mayors of the county and the town from Friday.It is a shame this Bill has taken so long to come before us. Make haste slowly is the Government's motto unless legislation is of benefit to it, in which case it is railroaded through with undue haste. As far back as August 2001, The Irish Times reported that legislation was being drafted by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to set up new public private partnerships to provide cleaner, greener and safer streets in designated urban areas. It reported that the idea of establishing BIDS in Ireland was inspired by the success of similar schemes in New York, notably in Times Square, where one sleazy part of the town was transformed over ten years by concerted area-based management. Senior executives of the Dublin City Centre Business Association, accompanied by the then Dublin Corporation finance officer, Michael Redmond, and representatives of the Dublin Civic Trust, visited New York to see the results and to talk to Times Square BID teams.The explanatory memorandum to the Bill states that there are more than 400 BID schemes in operation in Canada and the USA and that European countries are also becoming involved. It is not a unique idea but I am glad the Government has finally moved on it.Section 3 provides for the amendment of sections 97(3) and (4) of the principal Act. The amendment provides that BID money received by a rating authority is not paid into or out of the local funds. Section 129(e) sets out provisions on public input into a BID proposal and section 129(g) sets out the procedures to be followed leading up to a ratepayers’ plebiscite to determine the level of support for a bid proposal. While I have no problem with these three provisions, I would like the Minister of State to address them in light of the dreadful state of local government finances.Local authorities are underfunded and urgently need democratic accountability at local level. We cannot look at this Bill in isolation, it is published against the background of a lack of funding for local government. There are huge numbers of group water and sewerage schemes waiting to be approved by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. It is important those schemes get off the ground as soon as possible because they are vital infrastructure if towns and villages are to develop. Housing developments are being built with septic tanks so we need schemes to be put in place.The Minister of State may cite statistics about record levels of funding but he will omit the fact that local authorities must do much more with the money than was the case previously. It now costs more for local authorities to do things they have always done. Under the Local Government Act, extra staff were taken on. Counties with populations of 40,000 have the same tier of administration as a local authority in Dublin responsible for 250,000 people. The taxpayer must pay for these extra staff. Sometimes I wonder whether there is sufficient work in these local authorities for four or five directors. The population should dictate the numbers.We need business improvement districts because councils do not have the money to improve business districts on their own using current resources. The Chambers of Commerce of Ireland has been vocal on the need for reform. It has pointed out that local government charges cost business over €2 billion per year, with over €1 billion of this raised by commercial rates. The Chambers of Commerce of Ireland on numerous occasions met with the Local Authority Members Association — LAMA — the organisation of which I was a former secretary, to point out the high cost to business of rates, etc. The Chambers of Commerce of Ireland seemingly supports the Bill's programme.Due to inadequate funding by the Exchequer, local authorities depend on commercial rates. This compels them to promote the development of rateable properties over a healthy mix of residential and commercial development. This, in turn, is driving property prices in urban areas and pushing residential development further from the centres to poorly served and remote locations. The results of this are obvious. Schools are closing and constituents are losing Deputies due to the ageing population. In the recent reform of the constituencies, counties were divided up and one would wonder is this fair. While towns such as Leixlip, Lucan and Gorey are underserviced by schools, infrastructure and amenities, they have grim commuting patterns.As director of elections last year in the Meath constituency in the Duleek-Stamullen area, I met a considerable number of people who moved from Dublin in the previous four or five years and bought houses more cheaply than they would have in the city but who found there were no schools for their children. They had to send their children back into the city schools. Those people were frustrated and depressed that facilities were not put in place. Infrastructure such as sporting facilities, schools and churches should be included in any new major housing development to accommodate the increasing population in those areas.In the Border region companies from the North are winning local authority and Government contracts for which their Southern counterparts cannot compete due to a range of charges they are being forced to carry that do not apply in Northern Ireland. Northern semi-state bodies which are winning the contracts are, in turn, employing subcontractors from this State. This is a bit rich. People are becoming fed up with such scenarios where the parent contracting company is in Northern Ireland and people in Southern Ireland are expected to carry out the work at a greatly reduced cost while the contracting company creams off the major profits. This is a matter which needs to be looked at. In the not too distant future, I see a situation where the Government will bring forward legislation to guarantee a certain amount of jobs in the State for Irish-based citizens and that day is not too far away.It is not only businesses which are suffering. The position of those trying to buy new homes is no better. According to the Department's figures, the total collected in development levies has ballooned from €57 million in 1997 to €215 million in 2003, and it is even higher now. In Galway city, for example, the total take more than doubled over that period to almost €6 million, while in Cork city the total take, which stood at €766,000 in 1997, ballooned to a figure almost ten times that amount in 2003 — a staggering €7.5 million. This occurred despite the fact that the Department's guidelines state that the development contribution should not be set at an excessively high level and that local authorities should be mindful of the policies adopted by other authorities in their immediate area as a major divergence in the level of contribution may be difficult to defend in the future. There is equalisation for counties which have a low rate base, such as my county of Longford.My party calls for an open and rational debate in the context of considerable increases in development charges, management fees and business rates. The Government continues to hide behind the recent review of local government funding which, unsurprisingly, arrived too late to act upon prior to the next general election. Rather than doing that, I would appreciate the Minister of State taking the opportunity at the end of today's debate to give us his own views on the way forward in this area.Fine Gael is somewhat concerned that areas outside each BID, which are excluded from benefiting from this extra funding, risk exclusions under this legislation. As local authorities strive to boost central business districts with the extra funding, I seek assurances from the Minister of State that other areas will not be left behind.This leads me to the issue of plebiscites envisaged in the Bill. I should begin by saying that Fine Gael welcomes this concept. There is no better way to get people involved in local democracy than by getting them to make their own decisions. Indeed, local government should offer a perfect model for direct consultation. It is for this reason that Fine Gael voted in favour of directly elected mayors at our recent Ard-Fheis. The Government may be afraid of the people's verdict but we are not. In fact, the roll-out of business improvement districts would benefit from a strong directly elected mayor.

I very much welcome the introduction of this legislation for BIDS. Although it has been a while coming, the framework is correct and much work and study of best practice in this area has gone into it. The legislation is the best we can possibly do.The BIDS will lead to the enhancement of many areas, and of Dublin city in particular, some of which have been neglected for some time. Under successive Governments parts of the city were decrepit for many years but that has been changing drastically in recent times. Every little patch and waste piece of ground in Dublin city is either being built on or will be built on at some stage in the future.Such BIDS are partnership agreements between the local business community, residence groups, stakeholders the local authorities and have been very successful around the world since the first one was initiated in 1971 in Canada. There have been hundreds of them around the world, including in the US. The UK is now considering introducing BIDS, as the previous speaker stated.BIDS are aimed at enhancing, but not replacing, the work of local authorities — that is crucial and it is dealt with fairly clearly in the legislation — in areas such as environmental management, economic development, capital investment, and improvements in and the promotion of social inclusion.This Government and the previous Government have introduced a raft of legislation in the area of social inclusion. It has been one of the planks of policy for the past number of years. Around the city one can see the benefits of that legislation which has paid off immeasurably and will continue to pay off well into the future. Young people living in inner city areas, which have their difficulties due to drugs, crime or whatever, have been given opportunities in recent times which have not been available previously. In many cases, the lack of such opportunities led to some of the social problems in these areas.In cities and towns there are numerous environmental issues which can be enhanced using the BID system and the Minister of State referred to a few of them. They include street cleaning and maintenance of streets and removal of graffiti and chewing gum. There has been a particular problem with graffiti in Dublin in recent times. There has been an explosion in the prevalence of graffiti around the city. Whereas in cities like New York it is considered an art form, we must look to legislate for this issue at some stage in the future as it can be quite a nuisance. Some graffiti is fine and appropriate but some of it is extremely ugly and offensive. This issue needs to be examined. Steps have been taken regarding the chewing gum problem. Dublin City Council spent years debating how to tackle the problem and it invested in special machines. While they proved to be of some value, they did not solve the problem.BIDS can help in the provision of shrubs and flowers to enhance an area. In addition, the boards could invest in marketing the area and provide visitor information centres, which will benefit residents, shoppers and tourists as well as businesses. The success of Temple Bar highlights the benefit of marketing and public relations campaigns. The area is hopping nightly because of good marketing and that has been the case for many years. Tourists travel to Ireland specifically to visit Temple Bar, which is amazing, given that Fine Gael wanted to convert the area into a bus depot when it was in Government. It is crucially important to sell the new districts, particularly from a business point of view, but also to improve and enhance the district for people who live and work there.The Bill provides for the inclusion of local residents on the boards of BIDS. This is essential, as it will enable business owners to interact and get to know their neighbours and to discuss problems and how to tackle them in a co-ordinated and supportive way. I have worked with various business associations in Dublin such as the Mary Street traders and the Dublin City Business Association, DCBA. They were willing to interact with local communities but it did not always work for a variety of reasons. Communications broke down and when an issue arose, it was difficult to mediate between both sides when one was interfering with the other. The inclusion of local residents on the boards of BIDS will ensure that problem is addressed, which is welcome. It will also enhance the security of both parties in the long run and it will result in significant savings. The issue of security is crucial for both business owners and local residents, particularly in Dublin city centre.The input of local gardaí will be crucial. The RAPID programme and local authorities provide funding for closed circuit television systems at different locations, including local authority flat complexes. The systems have made a major difference. A report on the implementation of BIDS in other countries highlighted that local nuisance crime had decreased by between 30% and 40%. We are involved with local community policing forums, which are about to become local policing committees. They are extremely successful because community representatives, gardaí and local authority officials meet regularly and tackle issues when they arise. The introduction of BIDS will be effective in tackling problems.The members of the DCBA employ more that 25,000 people and they have a combined annual turnover of €1.5 billion. They play a major part in the life of the city. Dublin City Council spent €20 million upgrading O'Connell Street and it has done a fantastic job. It will enhance the city's reputation not only in Europe but around the world. The BID system could achieve a great deal if all the business associations combine with the local residents and all the other stakeholders. I congratulate Tom Coffey and Paul McElearney of the DCBA because they did significant work on this issue over the past number of years. The beauty of BIDS is they are self-financing and the moneys raised in a district are re-invested there.Dublin has suffered from a lack of corporate social responsibility. A number of individuals have tried to become more involved in local communities and their attempts have been hit and miss. However, business owners are willing to contribute and get involved in communities through summer projects or throwing parties at Christmas for old folks and children. The introduction of BIDS will provide a structure for these activities and they will harness the goodwill of business people. This will significantly benefit all concerned but it will take time for them to kick in because the boards must be established and funding agreed. Areas will benefit economically but they will also be enhanced though the provision of street furniture and shrubs and flowers. This will be positive not only for those living in the area but also for people who shop and work there. Many people are employed in Dublin city centre and they spend most of their lives there. The more we can do to enhance their experience, the better.World class standards must be achieved to compete in the global market but, at the same time, we must maintain and maximise the unique character of our towns and cities because it is a great selling point. Fáilte Ireland is doing a great job selling the country and various towns and cities. However, standards must be improved through the provision of investment and structures that will benefit all concerned. We cannot stand still and we must improve constantly. International experience has demonstrated BIDS can help us to do that in an innovative and practical way. Day-to-day quality of life will improve as a result of the legislation and the business community will benefit because their profits will improve.Senator Bannon referred to local government funding. It has increased significantly in recent years with a 7% increase last year. The issue is whether local authorities are using the money properly. In a number of cases, the money is sitting in bank accounts while the local authority announces the roll-out of programmes over five and ten years, which never materialise because the council and the officials move on.The Dublin Docklands Authority is a great example of a successful PPP. Significant improvements have been made along the north quays between the Point Depot and Butt Bridge. If the business improvement districts prove to be in any way as successful as the Dublin docklands or Temple Bar, they are to be greatly welcomed.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	116	I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I also welcome the Bill and wish it every success. I had no idea that its purpose was to win the World Cup until I heard the Minister of State's comments. I hope he will be successful in that regard.Aside from winning the World Cup, one of the reasons for my enthusiasm in respect of this Bill is that approximately three weeks ago, I visited Dayton, Ohio. My first visit to the United States took place in 1961 and was to Dayton, Ohio. At the time, I was devastated to discover that its centre or core was simply empty. There was nothing there. I could not figure out what had happened to it. As the Minister of State noted, this is precisely what is likely to happen to the core of Irish cities unless something is done about it. On my return a few weeks ago, the situation had changed. While I am unsure whether a business improvement districts policy was implemented there, it now has a thriving city centre. As the Minister of State outlined worldwide developments, I understood that this may be what took place there as well.Potentially, this Bill will be a useful addition to the range of ways to get things done at the interface between commercial business and public life. Senator Brady has alluded to this point. I hope that many businesses, and local businesses in particular, will approach the measure positively and will see it as an effective way to add to their competitiveness in the present environment.I can see one immediate use for the proposed mechanism, namely, in the ongoing struggle between town centres and shopping centres located on the periphery of traditional towns. As a retailer who has had a presence in both camps, I can claim a certain familiarity with the issues involved. Traditional town centres developed in an age which greatly differs from the present. The most important difference is that in the heyday of town centres, cars were not a dominant part of the equation. One located one's business in a town centre because it was where people went to do their shopping and to transact their other quotidian business. Consequently, space in town centres became scarce and expensive.I recall that the second shop which I opened was located in Finglas. While it did not open until 1965, I applied for planning permission in 1963 and was turned down because the site did not have enough car parking spaces. Previously, I had met the former Deputy Paddy Burke, who condemned the planning authorities in the Dáil. He stated that in Finglas, one needed pram parking spaces rather than car parking spaces. A total of 22 spaces had been allocated, which was thought to be sufficient. Although such an allocation was probably adequate in 1965, this was certainly not the case by 1975 or 1985.It seems that cars have changed the way in which one shops. The greater importance of cars in people's lives has changed the development of shopping centres. One can shop where one wishes with a car at one's disposal. From the retailers' viewpoint, the edge of traditional towns offered acres of relatively cheap space on which they could have all the space they needed to do their business, as well as providing ample parking for the customers outside. Hence, it is small wonder that the past few decades have seen mushrooming growth of out of town centres, largely at the expense of traditional town centres.I remember travelling to Waterford five years ago or more, to try to convince the then Waterford Corporation to allow Superquinn to locate a supermarket on the outskirts of town. As Waterford is understandably uptight about such matters, I was careful to use the word "city", rather than "town". I was obliged to argue because of the difference between what is called essential shopping and comparative shopping.Essential shopping encompasses items such as one's groceries. One can decide to do it all within a single supermarket and if the experience was unsatisfactory, one can go elsewhere the next time. Generally, however, after pulling up in a supermarket's car park, one does all one's shopping there. Comparative shopping is different. If one wishes to buy shoes, jewellery or fashion, one wants to be able to visit a range of shops. This is the purpose of a town centre. It was difficult to convince Waterford Corporation that it was to the benefit of the city to build supermarkets on the outskirts of the town. Understandably, it was quite concerned.Town centres have tried to fight back and have received much support from many people who do not have a direct business interest in the issue. For a great many people, the traditional town centre provides an important focus for a community. In fact, it is the centre which helps to define the community in the first place. As someone who has developed shopping centres myself, I readily admit that it is virtually impossible to recreate in a shopping centre the same experience that one gets while walking down the main street of a thriving country town.At present, there is competition between the two ways of doing business. I am pleased that although a few years ago, everyone was ready to write off traditional town centres, at present the outcome is not so clear-cut. The healthiest future approach would be for such competition to continue, rather than for one way of doing business to become the outright winner.The Minister of State has referred to other countries. I wish to discuss one country which I know quite well, namely, France. Until the passage of the loi Royer in 1974, the centres of France’s towns were being devastated. One visited lovely traditional towns which no longer had a core. The same thing has also happened in many other places.Hence, I believe in promoting competition between town centres and shopping centres on the outskirts of town. If such competition takes place, it will ensure the survival of traditional town centres. I can certainly envisage the idea of business improvement districts playing a very useful and important role. It provides an additional mechanism for businesses in a particular area to work together in their common interest and in the interest of the customers they seek to attract.Co-operation between neighbouring traders is nothing new. The Minister of State is attempting to encourage it in this Bill. There have always been ways in which businesses could get together to work on a project that benefited them all. There are many highly successful arrangements working at present which could and should continue to work in the future. However, adding to the range of ways in which businesses can co-operate together, and particularly by providing a formal way for the local authority to engage with them, will be a very useful step forward.Senator Brady discussed graffiti and litter, which is a good example. I have made a considerable number of visits to the Continent recently and have compared the problem there with that at home. The scale of the problem there offers a view of what is in store for Ireland if that graffiti culture is allowed to take root. Recently, in Howth where I live, an off-duty garda saw some young men painting some graffiti on a lovely white wall. Luckily enough, she was able to stop them. While the parent of one of the culprits evinced no great sympathy, the mother of the other young man did. She insisted that her son should clean it up with a toothbrush, to make him work all the harder. However, it was a reminder of what could happen if care is not taken. People can work together on problems such as graffiti and litter.In recent times, designated tax areas have done much good for towns which may not have prospered otherwise. Three examples with which I am familiar are Kilkenny, Carlow and Clonmel. The three town centres in question were beginning to become tired and were in danger of losing out and the designation of those areas as town centres has worked out very well. In addition, the tax incentive to install multistorey car parks has also helped a great deal. Hence, the Minister of State's proposals in this Bill are a step in the right direction.Every individual business knows what it must do to serve its own customers better from the moment the latter set foot on the premises. However, as everyone who runs a business knows only too well, many things can happen long before a customer actually gets to that point. If customers dislike an area it constitutes a significant deterrent to attracting business. On the other hand, if customers like an area and enjoy going there, it can be of immense help in drumming up business for every trader who operates there.Working together and with the local authority, individual businesses have a great deal of control over how their potential customers view the area in which they operate. This applies to factors such as whether an area is clean and has easy parking, whether the overall environment is pleasant and attractive and whether it has promotions like Christmas lights and so on. The list of things that can be done to attract customers is endless.However, I remember many years ago a number of businesses decided to put up Christmas lights in Dundalk and make the town more attractive to compete with places such as Newry. We discovered not everyone in the town got involved and put up lights. Clear resentment occurs when some get involved and others do not. This is an incentive to encourage everybody to get involved.What everybody in an area has in common is the need to work together to achieve those objectives. Usually, no individual business will be able to do the job on its own. While a local authority may get involved in promoting an urban development area, in general it will tend to shirk away from promoting one area as against another, which is understandable.That is why it is right this Bill places the main onus for the development of these schemes on the businesses themselves, rather than on the local authority. The local authority can, and I hope will, be a vital facilitator. However, it will be up to the businesses themselves to take the initiative that brings these districts into existence, and it will be up to those businesses to provide the driving force to make them a success.I commend the Minister of State for bringing forward this idea. In doing so, he has used a technique which is a favourite of my own. Instead of trying to reinvent the wheel, one first scours the world to see whether anyone else has already risen to the challenge. The idea of business improvement districts has proved itself, as the Minister stated, in Canada and the US for more than 30 years. In more recent times it has also come to Europe including efforts in Britain, although RGDATA claims approximately 40% of smaller towns in Britain do not have a general store, supermarket or grocery store in the centre of the town. I have no doubt that with the proper promotion BID schemes can also be a success here in Ireland. It will work.We have not done enough on subsidiarity, the EU principle of passing decision making closer to the citizen. Instead of making laws in Brussels they should be made locally. It is interesting to see local decisions being passed to traders throughout Europe. Often, traders came together and decided on restrictive opening hours, until those close to national frontiers with countries which do not have such legislation find they have lost business to those other countries.With this Bill, which is worthy of support, responsibility will be passed to local businesses and that is likely to succeed. I wish the Bill and the scheme every success. The Minister of State's heart is in the right place and he is going in the right direction. The Bill may need correction and we had such discussion this morning. We may find on Committee Stage changes will be made but the Minister of State will be likely to respond to any suggestions.

This Bill is positive and the Minister of State discussed the flexibility involved for people in business, which is extremely important, as is marketing an area and providing car parking. I particularly liked the comment made by Senator Quinn about Christmas lights, which are important for the image and business of a town. Each year for the past ten years a town has been in uproar because it could not get funding for lighting. It seems a simple matter but the problem occurred because people did not come together or the organisation was not there to provide it.One of the best examples of Christmas lighting is in Moate, which I often pass through.

#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	121	I am glad to receive cross-party support. The lighting in Moate makes a scheme such as this very relevant. It is a matter of traders coming together to brighten up an area and market it. The Minister of State provides flexibility and innovation in these proposals. It will give great impetus for the further development of our towns and villages. This Bill provides an opportunity to put such schemes in place. The issue of tackling the scourge of graffiti was also raised and action on that is welcome.The Minister of State referred to the fact that businesses will vote to establish the level of support for a proposed scheme. As in a referendum, a majority is required to approve the operation of a BID scheme. That is an example of local democracy in action and it provides an opportunity for those concerned to participate in the development of their local community. When the democratic process is complete and the scheme implemented, the services will then be provided.I am concerned as to whether this funding will be used to replace services provided by local authorities. Smaller towns may state they are not able to come up with a scheme in the same way as a larger town or city. I was not here when the Minister of State made his opening remarks, but I am sure he will reassure me that funding will not be taken from local authorities and replaced with BID scheme money. Extremely effective local authority schemes already exist, such as the urban renewal scheme and village enhancement schemes run in conjunction with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.The explanatory memorandum to the Bill states that the scheme began in Toronto, Canada in 1971. European countries such as Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Holland, Portugal and our neighbours in the United Kingdom also have frameworks to operate these schemes. We are now in line with those other countries, which is positive.I also welcome the fact that the Bill states that special companies will be established to implement the BID schemes. These companies can be widely representative and will include local authority membership. This is another good example of local democracy. It is also a good example of the partnership approach, which is the spirit behind BIDS. These companies will be charged with ensuring the various projects, works or services making up the BID scheme voted in and approved by the local authority is carried out over a term not exceeding five years. It is critical, as it is for all elected Members, that these schemes face the electorate at regular intervals. I am pleased the Bill provides that BID schemes must have a fresh mandate at least every five years. This election will give impetus to the schemes and will probably improve them.The research carried out on what has been done in other countries shows the extremely positive influence of BID schemes, particularly on the environment in which they operate. The Minister of State has shown great interest in the Tidy Towns competition. I congratulate all who took part this year on the great results. This scheme will further enhance the environment and tackle litter, which is still a major problem. We have seen great improvement in some towns, particularly through the scheme now in operation. However, black spots will always exist and the Department highlighted them in its approach in the past. I am sure the scheme will tackle litter.There should be a system to keep costs down. Many businesses claim they are paying a high rate on foot of the rate revaluation system and, given that they are the only real rate payers in the country, they would like a fair and equitable system pertaining to the BID contributions. I hope the Minister of State will assure us that a double rate will not be required of businesspeople.Another welcome development in the Bill is its provision of relief of 50% on the amount payable in cases where a property is unoccupied for the execution of alterations or repairs, if the owner of the property is genuinely unable to obtain a suitable tenant at a reasonable rent, or if the premises are vacant pending a redevelopment. Refunds of BID contributions are also available where properties are demolished or destroyed.I will not refer to all the sections in the Bill. I was particularly interested in section 6, which removes the impediment to local authorities gaining rate income in the years following an evaluation of property in their areas. This makes sense because it removes a provision that would otherwise curtail a local authority's ability to provide services in its area simply because a revaluation of property took place, as happens quite regularly.Section 5 contains a provision to remove a discrepancy between existing valuation law and local government rating law. This is a welcome development.I support this Bill strongly and agree with the Minister of State and the proponents of the BID schemes that they will work in Ireland. They have worked in other countries.This legislation is necessary and will lead to enhanced investment in our urban centres. This will be of considerable benefit to those who reside and carry out their daily trade and business in those areas. I support the Minister of State in what he is doing.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	122	I, too, welcome the Bill, which is a very good idea. I am not the Labour Party spokesman on local government and only found out about the idea this week. I received a very helpful statement from the Dublin City Business Association explaining the concept. It made reference to its website, www.dublinbids.com, which contains a lot of information on the matter.The schemes could benefit my community and I will therefore be calling for some in the south County Dublin area. They could be ideal for villages such as Lucan, Clondalkin, Rathcoole and Palmerstown in my area. In Lucan, the council is currently drawing up a village design statement. I proposed this idea and my father, a councillor, proposed a motion on my behalf on foot of which the idea was taken on board. The idea is that the future development of Lucan village will be based on a study that examines the character, history and heritage of the village with a view to preserving it. When the statement is ready, the businesses in Lucan, in conjunction with the council, should set up a BID scheme to do some of the work involved, taking into account the findings in the village design statement. Businesspeople in other villages in the area could engage in useful projects under this legislation.In south County Dublin, many of the shopping centres are very stark neighbourhood shopping centres built in the 1970s. This is just the way they were designed at the time. Projects could be undertaken in conjunction with local businesses to improve these shopping centres and their immediate environment.I am very interested in projects that would improve shopfronts and provide street furniture. I am not so sure about cleaning. It would obviously be useful in the context of particular projects but it is primarily the job of the local authority to clean streets. For example, certain villages have hand-cart personnel to clean the streets. However, there are fewer such personnel in some of the villages in south County Dublin today than there were years ago although the populations were smaller and there was less business.The schemes should not detract from the role of the Government to fund local authorities to do their job properly. Having said that, businesses would want to take the initiative themselves in this regard because they are a factor in the production of some of the litter. A shop, public house or chipper that enjoys good business can contribute to litter in an area and businesses should take a role in this regard. We have moved away from the time when local shopkeepers did much of the cleaning of the streets around their premises — they had a much smaller task in the past. There is definitely a need for local businesses to have a common purpose in dealing with issues such as litter and the improvement of the environment. Getting together to do the job is obviously a good idea.It is very important that, where extra funding is raised, extra people be brought in to do the work in question. Where it involves the picking up of litter, it should not be a case of paying the council to do work it should be doing in any case. The funding should be used for special projects that would not normally be carried out by local authorities.Businesses are to vote on whether to become involved in a BID scheme and a majority vote will determine whether the scheme should go ahead. Could a business that refuses to become involved in a scheme refuse to pay the levy? How would the local authority deal with this and has the Minister of State considered it?There are other good ideas in the legislation. Many businesspeople are resident in the communities in which their businesses are based and they benefit in this regard. It is very important that we regard businesspeople and traders as part of the community. It is good to have them working in partnership with residents and local authorities. This is a very good aspect of the Bill.I welcome the Bill and hope the BID schemes are promoted in local authority areas outside the Dublin city area and that the concept is sold to businesses throughout the country, including in south County Dublin.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	123	This Bill is interesting and progressive and at the same time quite homely and comforting. It is relying on an old tenet that still holds good, namely, that communities can help themselves. I am not at all surprised that the idea originated in Canada and then moved to the United States because the people in those countries are full of get-up-and-go. I understand European cities will take up the idea as well.I commend the Dublin City Business Association, particularly Mr. Tom Coffey, who is excellent at his business and has shown what can be done with O'Connell Street when there is the will and the dynamism to put much-needed improvements in place. I am intrigued by the idea of businesses getting together and that they must have a common purpose, namely, to improve their area. Residents often get together to improve their area. A past-pupils union may want to improve its school. It is an old-fashioned characteristic of people, which is to better the community in which they live or serve. That can only be for the good because if one is imbued with that old-fashioned characteristic — I notice it on school committees and so on — it can work very much to the benefit of the entire community.I have one reservation which I hope the Minister of State can address; Senator Kitt raised it in his contribution. The Bill states that funding provided will not be replacement funding for local authority funding. I understand funding provided will be additional to whatever will be provided by the local authority in an area. There are many ways to skin a cat, however, and I would not like to see any subterfuge in that arrangement. The scheme will flop if it is not clearly indicated what an area will get by way of local authority funding and under the bids scheme. Improvements, therefore, will be made under the bids scheme.A plebiscite is to be arranged. Senator Tuffy made an interesting point about that. What do we do about the few down-in-the-mouth business people who will not want to be part of this scheme? They will share in the benefits, whether it is enhancement of the area by painting, street-scaping, landscaping or whatever. All businesses will be enhanced but what about those who do not want to be part of it?
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	124	The Bill forces them to be part of it.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	125	That is welcome if it is the case but I do not know how that compulsion would work because the scheme is founded on goodwill and the wish to improve one's business, area, village or town. I know a particular part of Athlone that the scheme is well suited for and I hope the people involved will take it up with gusto but I do not know how the compulsion element comes into it. They are compelled to pay their rates; I understand that. The only people paying rates now are business people but they can be compelled to so do. This is a quasi-voluntary bids scheme and I do not know if they can be so compelled. It would be quite a difficult task.I note that the legislative framework is in place in the United Kingdom. That is particularly useful for the character of a person living there but I have an in-built belief that Irish people like other people to do the work. They are not that anxious to get involved yet there are many others who are imbued with the get up and go characteristic and would wish to be part of it.The Minister of State said this is a group of businesses coming together. That is not to say that a group of communities cannot come together within an area. Can it be a group of resident associations, a tidy towns association or a community council, all of whom are evident in rural Ireland and do very good work? Are they counted as businesses for the purposes of forming a bid or must they be full businesses? I would like an answer to that question because it is an important factor.This is a very American proposal, and there is nothing wrong with that. There are 400 of these schemes in Canada and the United States because the people there are imbued with a get-up-and-go attitude. In many cases they have to be because social services are at a minimum in the US. I was appalled to learn recently that there is no child allowance or anything like that in the US. One must get on with life, do without or make do. The scheme is redolent of that feeling. There is nothing wrong with that but I wonder if the Irish people will take to it with gusto. I can see big cities taking to it with a view to parcelling out an area in which the scheme could be applied.The scheme will require a good deal of promotion. I told a business person on the telephone this morning that I was speaking on BIDS legislation in the House today and they asked if that was something to do with auctioneers. I said it was a business improvement districts Bill, in which the business person was very interested. The Department will have to undertake a promotional drive because local radio and newspapers would be very interested in emphasising the scheme.This is a good, homely Bill which deserves to do well. I like the idea of public consultation to get people's views on it, setting up the board, liaising with the local authority and having both local authority members on the board and the business people. The scheme is like an offspring of a chamber of commerce; I understand that is what they were set up to do. They approve of this measure, which is welcome, but a chamber of commerce by its very nature is quite amorphous whereas this scheme is more detailed and district geared. We read about districts but we do not call them districts here. In other countries they call specific areas districts, and this measure is geared towards a particular district.I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House to introduce the Bill. I hope he can answer my questions. I wish the Bill well in its passage through both Houses and in its further progression within the local communities.

We should look at it in a positive way, which is the way I want to look at it.I see dangers, however, in that some people might get involved in trying to make improvements to their streets but cannot get the support of their colleagues or the other businesses in the area. I could foresee streets becoming very run down while others forge ahead. Perhaps that is the nature of competition and there is nothing we can do about it but I have to say, because I know no one else will have said it, that the fundamental question being begged is the funding and the authority of local authorities. My view on that has been consistently clear.Local authorities are underfunded and are still suffering from the abolition of rates in 1977. We must examine issues like water rates, and I want to be clear about the way I see that working. People should not be charged for water for everyday use but if I have a fleet of cars and two swimming pools, the local authority should not have to provide the water to wash those cars and fill the swimming pools. There is something obscene about the fact that if I have a fleet of six cars and two swimming pools, the local authority provides the water to fill those pools and wash the cars and everybody is paying part of it.I make that point deliberately, before people argue on the grounds of equity that everyone is entitled to water. Everybody is entitled to water, but the reality is that it is very costly on local authorities to provide it. The intention always was to provide water for all the valid reasons going back to the yellow plague in terms of dealing with issues such as dysentery, cleanliness, etc. However, that is now being interpreted by people to mean they are entitled to all the water they want. That was never the intention and I wish to emphasise that.There is no other country in Europe in which water is used in the way our citizens use it. That is not something of which I am particularly proud. One sees notices on the sides of buses to the effect that water is precious and should be conserved. We need to do more than that. People should be given all the water they need for living, washing and the basic requirements of running a house. Once it goes beyond that some form of charging should be looked at. I do not want to be quoted as saying, "He is in favour of water charges". I am in favour of them in those circumstances, where a limit is put, and once that is reached then the situation must be examined.What the Minister of State is proposing here is another form of rates. Effectively, the local council is saying that it would be great if it could introduce improvements in a particular street and do all the positive things outlined in the Minister of State's speech, with which I agree. This is what may be described as a "needs must" type of legislation. The local authorities do not have the money to do these things. Is it not the case that there has been a good deal of talk about development costs and the local development charges that have to be paid? There has to be significant understanding that they are necessary, but they are far too high.In a recent debate Senator Bannon raised the matter of high development costs. They have increased well beyond the rate of inflation because they are trying to meet another need. If 24 houses are built in an area, the local authority gets paid a development fee from the developer. From the day the developer walks away the houses are a charge on the local authority, without any income being paid to it. Nowhere else in Europe, or perhaps the world, does this happen. It does not make any sense, regardless from what viewpoint one looks at it.I do not suggest we start charging people for something they have always had. We need to have at least an understanding, however, as to how all these matters should be approached. It is creating an increasing drain on those councils in whose areas large numbers of houses are being built and no income is accruing from this to the local authority. I do not believe that can continue forever.This raises the question of how we get the business community to do something. How do we get something positive done in this area? What is good about this legislation is that it will give people a sense of pride in their space, their sense of place and their area. I recently met a group of business people in Limerick who spoke about one of the weekly markets which is owned by the local authority. They want to put a roof on it because it is popular with local people. When it is raining it is not that pleasant. This an ideal example of what the Minister of State is talking about, where people come together for this type of enterprise and put all that is needed into itI wonder, however, about the level of consultation the Minister of State might have had with local businesses about this. Those involved in the Dublin City Business Association were mentioned. However, they are not very good in terms of reflecting that view. I look at Senators Bannon and O'Rourke, for instance, and think of the town of Athlone. One might want to improve the streets in the centre of the town, given that all of the businesses have transferred to Golden Island or the new place on the other side. There are many empty shop units in Athlone that cry out for development. There are beautiful streets and lanes there. However, one wonders whether the money will be available to develop the area because in this case it is a question of whether the initiative is demand-led or supply-led.Everything the Minister of State refers to is concerned with streets where there are active and successful businesses trying to improve their space. If one wants to breathe new life into a street, however, and create a nice shopping area, shopfront or streetscape and there is nobody there before one starts, one is on a loser. The difficulty in those cases is that streets which were not being patronised will relapse. Is there an answer or is this just pie in the sky?One can see this happening in almost in every town in the country and it is something the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business considered at length when the groceries order was under review. The joint committee considered situations where businesses move to the edge of town with the centre dying on its feet. I do not have the same concerns in this regard as other people. I have seen this happen in other countries. Over a period of years the inner part of the town tends to become a place where bijoux and specialist shops are located. It is a different type of shopping in which the big businesses are no longer involved. It is boutique-type shopping, even involving boutique hotels and various similar developments. However, this is a slow process. What the Minister of State talks about would not help to increase the pace of change because the people and the successful businesses are not there.I wonder whether this can be extended towards improving streets and areas where there is nothing to make them more attractive. The answer, when the Minister of State comes to answer that question, is to ask from where will the money come. The money is not there. I recently met with members of local authorities just after the Minister had made the comment that they were flooded with money——

Perhaps we are slow on the uptake but where these local authorities are awash with money I should like to know where it is kept. If they were awash with money, which is not being spent, could it not in the meantime be used for initiatives parallel to what the Minister of State proposes?The Bill is creative, novel and worthy of all our support. I am sure there will be flaws and problems but if nothing is done mistakes will never be made. This is worth doing. We will all be keen to see how it works. Will it breathe new life into tired streets and new places?If it is managed to put things in place under a BID scheme that creates more maintenance costs for the local authority. Is that an issue or is there an overlap? What happens if things are done the local authority would have been happening in other places? Is there duplication or replication? In terms of the list of things the Minister of State has mentioned, ranging from cleansing, promotions, special events, street cleaning, the provision of street furniture and signage, these are all matters the local authority would be doing to some extent.The Minister of State has not explained in his speech and I do not see in the Bill where that replication is being dealt with. In the meantime I compliment the Minister of State and his officials for bring the legislation forward. It is novel and worth a try.

While there will be some points of detail which will engage us as the Bill progresses, and on which we may sometimes have different perspectives, I welcome the generally positive reception from all sides of the House to the concept of the business improvement districts.As well as the generally positive reaction in the House, I was heartened by the positive statements from the business community earlier this week when we published the Bill, and its wholehearted support for it. In that regard I want to join Senators Brady and O'Rourke in congratulating Mr. Tom Coffey and Mr. Paul McElearney of Dublin City Business Association for the Trojan work they have done in promoting the BID scheme concept here in Ireland.As befits this House, the debate has given much food for thought and I will give serious consideration to the various issues raised and suggestions made. Different elements have been touched on, either by way of suggestion or seeking clarification. I would hope to deal these within the time allowed.It is important to look at successful BID schemes. The results have been reflected in higher sales volumes in areas where they operate. Footfall levels have increased directly as a result of investment through BIDS. This is allied to the amount of time people stay in an area and the amount of money they spend in those areas has been dramatic.Local government funding was raised by Senator Bannon and touched on by Senator O'Toole. Local authorities require sufficient funding to ensure that they can operate effectively. One success has been the ability of local government to respond to the ever-increasing demands made in recent years for improved services. These demands arise from the dramatic changes in Ireland in the last decade, such as the burgeoning population, unprecedented economic growth, higher incomes and expectations of services at local level. Local authority current expenditure amounted to €1.8 billion in 1997, when this Government came to power. This year, current expenditure by local government will amount to more than €4.1 billion. This increase in expenditure is underpinned by the funding that the Government has secured through the local government fund. General purpose grants to local authorities from the local government fund increased over this period from €340 million in 1997 to €875 million this year. This is a massive increase of 160% in the period. The unprecedented level of growth in general purpose grants far outstrips the level of growth in total local government current expenditure. This level of support, in addition to the significant investment through capital assistance for infrastructure, shows that this Government is firmly committed to financing local government.For Senator Bannon's sake, I would like to look at Longford.

The Government is aware of the demands on the commercial sector and the need for continued and improved competitiveness to support Ireland's small open economy. Local authority charges are obviously a relevant factor in this. The level of funding made available to local authorities through the local government fund has had the effect of dampening the extent of demands on the commercial sector through rates and charges. In 1993, rates contributed 17% of total current and capital income of local authorities. The figure today is closer to 12.5%. When local authorities were adopting their budgets for 2006 at the end of last year, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government requested that in order to support competitiveness in the economy and to protect the interests of communities, local authorities should ensure that they exercise restraint in setting any increases in commercial rates and local charges for the year.The response to this request was very positive. To a large degree, local authorities exercised significant restraint in 2006 by imposing fewer increases than in previous years. In its 2006 budget, Limerick City Council adopted a reduction of 0.5% in its annual rate on valuation. This was a first in recent decades. To take the example of Longford again——

A key to the success of a BID is that the projects, works or services are fully additional to any such projects, works or services that are carried out by a local authority and that the relevant responsibilities of both parties to a BID agreement — the proponents of a BID scheme and the local authority — are clearly set out. The Bill provides that the relevant baseline services carried out by a local authority are set out in the BID proposal. The service to be given at any moment will be benchmarked. From there, the additions will be part of the BID programme and that will be made clear to the business community and the members of the local authority. I assure Senator Kitt that central funding will certainly not be cut as a result of the implementation of a BID plan.Senator Brady and Senator Quinn outlined the benefits of the business improvement districts. I thank them for that and Senator O'Toole has also been very positive on the issue. This particular scheme will provide a spur to businesses in the area and will increase the overall well-being of businesses in BID communities. We must ensure that all businesses are aware of the scheme and of its advantages. We are fortunate that the chambers of commerce and other business entities are very much in favour of the scheme. We will take on board the suggestion made that local authorities and the Department advertise this. I have no doubt that in pursuing her successful return to the Dáil, Senator O'Rourke will use her newsletter to great advantage.

There can be no room for free riders or otherwise the ethos of the proposal would be breached and the concept would founder.The Bill is fairly comprehensive and should be successful.

He will remember that I raised this matter yesterday, initially on the Order of Business. Dr. Patricia Comer, a Dublin GP, will not be allowed to treat her 500 medical card patients when she turns 70 in August this year. There is no reason for this other than her age. That Dr. Comer can continue treating private patients after August this year compares starkly with the fact that she cannot treat public patients due to nothing other than ageism.Almost all of Dr. Comer's 500 medical card patients are older people who have built up great relationships with Dr. Comer over the years. She has treated their children and grandchildren. Older people are understandably distressed at being forced to change doctors having been served so brilliantly by Dr. Comer for more than 40 years. I understand that the Irish Medical Organisation has insisted on an age limit of 70 years as a protection mechanism to ensure that younger doctors will have general medical services scheme jobs available for them. However, as insufficient newly-trained GPs are available to take up these positions, the protection policy should not continue to exist. Younger doctors are prone to cherry-pick work locations and some are only interested in working part-time when appointed.

#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	175	I thank the Senator for raising the issue which is consistent with the policy she has been pursuing. I will try to be as helpful as possible in responding to the matter which has received some coverage outside the House in recent times. The general medical services, GMS, scheme, which is more commonly known as the medical card or choice of doctor scheme, was introduced in 1971 to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services to eligible people and replaced the previous dispensary system. Today approximately 30% of the population is covered under the scheme with approximately 1,900 GPs contracted to provide services to people holding medical cards and GP visit cards.Under the GMS scheme, general practitioners hold one of two contract types — the fee per item contract, which was first introduced in 1972; or the capitation contract, which has been effective since 1989. These contracts reflect the agreed outcome of negotiations between the Department of Health and Children and the GP representative body, the Irish Medical Organisation. Both contract types contain provisions which were agreed between the parties on a range of issues including retirement age. These contract types are contracts for service rather than of employment. GPs who provide services under their GMS agreement to medical card and GP visit card holders, are also entitled to provide services to persons attending their practice in a private capacity.The terms agreed in the 1972 fee per item contract provide that the contract agreement will cease on the medical practitioner reaching the age of 70 years. The terms of the capitation contract which was agreed between the parties in 1989 provide that GPs who entered into contracts on the date of its commencement could hold the contract up to the age of 70 and that all subsequent GP contractors could hold the contract up to the age of 65. Any changes to these arrangements would require agreement between the parties involved and would need to include consideration of all relevant factors, including the pension arrangements for GMS GPs. General practitioners may, of course, and subject to continued registration with the Medical Council, continue to practise and to treat private patients following retirement from the GMS scheme.A review of the contractual arrangements for the provision of services under the GMS and other publicly-funded schemes commenced in October 2005 and is being conducted under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission. I hope this review can be concluded quickly. The Government wishes the new contractual arrangements to provide for open access to public contracts for all qualified GPs meeting particular requirements. I am also open to considering whether it would be appropriate to change the present arrangements regarding the age at which GPs must cease to hold contracts. I have therefore asked the Department, in conjunction with the Health Service Executive, to consider this matter in the context of the joint review process being conducted under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	178	I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to deal with this Adjournment matter, which concerns physiotherapy students from around the country, at least two of whom come from my area of Longford-Westmeath. Given that payments are made to trainee nurses in similar circumstances, why are physiotherapy students, who undertake valuable work, not paid while on work placements? I call on the Minister of State to make some commitment to provide extra funding to hospitals to cover such payments. While we are not talking about significant sums of money, it is important that the funds come from the Department of Health and Children rather than the hospitals taking the trainees. Each year, approximately 150 trainee physiotherapy students begin their training in this country. The students undertake 1,000 hours of work placement in their third and fourth years of study. They provide an excellent support service to hospitals, working hard to clear backlogs of patients for no monetary reward. In many cases, they or their parents have to pay additional living expenses in terms of bed and breakfast accommodation near placement hospitals. They also have to pay for meals and travel costs.A further financial burden is put on these students because, unlike their peers in other disciplines who finish college at the end of May, they are unable to take summer employment to pay for the next college year. Many have placement hours scheduled over the summer months and even those who finish before the beginning of the autumn term find that all the vacancies for summer jobs have been filled.Trainee nurses earn 80% of the first point on the basic nursing pay scale when they undertake work placements during their studies. I am aware of trainee engineers who are paid generously during their work experience. It seems the scales are harshly weighted against trainee physiotherapists and I wonder why this is so, given that a relatively small level of funding to hospitals would eliminate this anomaly. If hospitals had to pay trainee physiotherapists from their already limited funds, many would be unable to offer places. However, in light of the valuable work done by the students, any funds provided to hospitals would be amply repaid.The students' prospects on qualification are not necessarily rosy. There is a lack of job opportunities in this country for this discipline and graduates often have difficulties in finding employment. Strangely, the website of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment points to a shortage in the number of physiotherapists and offers work opportunities to qualified non-EU professionals. That is a contradictory position.I urge the Minister of State to help these dedicated students and their hard-pressed parents by providing a small sum to offset the financial difficulties they experience. I have been approached by two students from my constituency on this matter, one from Athlone and the other from Longford.

#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-29 00:00:00	Prelude	182	I am pleased to take this debate on behalf of my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney. I would like to outline to this House the position regarding the funding of physiotherapy clinical training. The model for the training of physiotherapists in Ireland, including the clinical component, is in line with best practice internationally. Students on the four physiotherapy courses are required to undergo clinical training for a period of 1,000 hours, equivalent to approximately 26 weeks. This training is delivered in approximately seven clinical sites at different periods over the four years of the degree programme.I do not accept the validity of the comparison between payments for the clinical training of nurses and physiotherapists. Physiotherapy students are supernumerary while on their clinical placements. The clinical training component of the nursing degree is 2,300 hours, equivalent to 74 weeks, and is laid down by EU directive. The clinical training for nurses is more than double the training given to physiotherapists. Student nurses are not paid when on supernumerary clinical placements. A rostered placement or internship takes place towards the end of the nursing degree programme, during which the student is a paid employee of the Health Service Executive and receives a salary based on 80% of the staff nurse salary. These students replace staff nurses according to an agreed ratio.I would like to take this opportunity to set out the range of measures which have been put in place to support the training of physiotherapists. In 2002, a significant increase in the numbers of training places in three therapy professions, namely, physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy, were announced. An increase of 25 training places in physiotherapy was necessary to meet the long-term demand for physiotherapists in Ireland. A new physiotherapy course with places for 25 students was established in the University of Limerick in 2002 in addition to the existing physiotherapy courses in UCD, TCD and the RCSI. The total number of training places now stands at 152.The provision of sufficient clinical placements in physiotherapy was essential to the successful roll-out of these additional training places. Over the past two years, the Department worked with the Health Service Executive to develop the enhanced structures necessary to ensure students have access to a sustainable and high quality clinical training model. A national implementation group co-chaired by the Department and including representatives from the higher education institutes, professional therapy bodies and professional managers has been established to address the ongoing need to source clinical placements over the longer term.A significant level of funding has been secured by the Minister for Health and Children. A total of €5.18 million, including €2.75 million announced in budget 2006, has been allocated since 2004 for the development of therapy clinical training.
