#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	0	I thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for facilitating this. I congratulate the Minister and Minister of State on their new roles.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	1	It is a very youthful team.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	2	We cannot argue with that. As both the Minister and the Minister of State are very honest, straight-talking politicians, I hope they can level with the public in regard to the level of spending on the set-up of Irish Water that was signed off on 22 October 2013 and the information that was given to the Economic Management Council on the level of consultancy fees. I hope they can inform the public, who will receive their first water bills in the next number of weeks, as to the level of knowledge the Minister's predecessor and the Economic Management Council had on 22 October 2013.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	3	In advance of the enactment of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013, the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, did not have full economic regulatory powers in regard to the water sector, but did have powers to advise the Minister. In that context, on 22 October 2013, my predecessor approved a request from the Department to seek advice from CER on new costs arising in the establishment of Irish Water. The purpose in seeking this advice was to ensure that the costs were of benefit to customers in the long term and that forecast expenditure was reasonable. In regard to the establishment costs, the request included broad headings for expenditure of €150 million plus a contingency of €31 million, but did not distinguish between in-house and external provision. The Deputy will appreciate that, for Cabinet confidentiality reasons, I cannot divulge details of discussions at the Economic Management Council, which has the status of a Cabinet committee. The establishment of Irish Water is an integral component of the Government’s water sector reform strategy and involves major organisational change. The establishment of a high-performance utility will lead to lower costs and improved services in the future, providing much better outcomes for customers and the environment. There is a need to incur up-front costs in order to secure these benefits. The CER has reviewed the establishment costs and in its proposals, published in July 2014, it has indicated that it proposes to allow Irish Water the vast bulk - some €172.8 million - of the costs proposed.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	4	It has become common knowledge that on 22 October, despite what he has said, the Minister's predecessor was fully aware of the set-up costs for Irish Water to the tune of €180 million. Does the Minister think that figure is fair? He seems to suggest it is. In County Roscommon, more than 30,000 households are on a boil-water notice and there is not the required level of investment in infrastructure to ensure that people's basic right to have running water in their homes is fulfilled. Now the Minister seems to think that expenditure in the region of €180 million is okay, and €86 million out of that €180 million is to be spent on consultancy fees.I certainly do not think this is a fair figure to be used in the setting up of Irish Water.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	5	I want to point out to the Deputy that there are legacy issues relating to the setting up of Irish Water. The Deputy's party was in government long enough to know what they are. One of these legacy issues is the fact that the people of Roscommon do not have a water service that is appropriate. It is disgraceful that this was left the length of time that it was and that there was no investment to ensure that people had the water services they deserved. The establishment costs of Irish Water have been examined by the CER, which assessed them in great detail. The CER permitted an allocation of €172.8 million and said that it felt €8 million was not required, so the vast bulk of the establishment costs were accepted. One must also look at it in comparative terms relating to the setting up of a utility of this scale and size. If one looks at it in a comparative context involving other jurisdictions, one will see that the actual establishment costs are on a par with those incurred in other jurisdictions, or in some cases better. I must come back to the decision by the CER relating to its estimate of the establishment costs. The CER has accepted that €172.8 million is the requirement, and if that is its judgment I have no reason to doubt it.

#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	7	So the Minister is saying that he agrees with the assessment? The Minister talks about legacy issues-----
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	8	The CER is an independent regulator.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	9	Why then did his predecessor feel the need to mislead a committee in November 2012 and say that the set-up costs would be €10 million? When he appeared on "Prime Time" on 14 January 2014, why did he say he was not aware of this? If the set-up costs are so reasonable or understandable, why did the Minister's predecessor feel the need to mislead the public in terms of what he knew about the setting up of Irish Water? The Minister talks about legacy issues. Can I remind him that the Government is now in its fourth year of office? The people in Roscommon to whom I have spoken over the past number of evenings have been on a boil-water notice for the past 12 months. This problem has been resurrected in particular areas in Roscommon in the past 12 months. Why does the Minister think that €180 million should be spent on a super-quango at a time when people cannot have treated water running through their taps?
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	10	The Deputy said people had been on boil-water notices for the past 12 months. In some cases, they have been on boil-water notices for up to 12 years, so to have the Deputy throwing that out, given his background, borders on the ridiculous. The reason this utility was set up was to have a framework whereby we can invest in water provision for the future and ensure that this ridiculous situation never happens again. I am concerned about a number of things. First, the Deputy made statements about the previous Minister misleading people. Those are big statements that need to be justified. The second issue is that Deputy Troy is saying he does not accept or believe the independent regulator, which has made its judgment regarding the set-up costs of this utility. Of course I accept the regulator's decision, and it would be appropriate if Deputy Troy did so as well.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	11	This question concerns An Bord Pleanála and the appointment of people who had previously had a deep involvement with the Poolbeg incinerator project. I congratulate the new Minister and Minister for State on their appointment and wish them well. I submitted a question that was similar to the previous question and I wish to put on record that I am very disappointed that the question was not allowed. The question was almost identical to the previous question but was ruled out of order. The explanation I received was not satisfactory.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	12	I thank the Deputy for his good wishes. I am sure they will always be extended. It is unclear as to which member or members of An Bord Pleanála the Deputy is referring. The process for making appointments to the board is governed by the Planning and Development Act 2000. The board operates under a code of conduct as required by section 150 of the Act. One of the purposes of the code is to ensure potential conflicts of interest relating to the statutory function of An Bord Pleanála are dealt with in an appropriate manner. The code is available for viewing on the board’s website at www.pleanala.ie. Section 13 of the code contains procedures for dealing with conflicts of interest in the context of meetings of the board where appeals and other planning cases are determined. Section 15.2 of the code also requires a board member not to deal with any case in any capacity on behalf of the board where the member had any involvement at any time in the matter, either on a personal basis or on behalf of a previous employer or as a member of any other organisation or voluntary body. Furthermore, section 15.4 of the code requires a board member not to knowingly deal with a file relating to a planning authority or a private practice where he or she was previously employed during the previous two year period or any voluntary or professional organisation of which he or she is or was a member during the previous two year period. If the Deputy has information that he needs to make me aware of, he can always write to me and I will address it accordingly.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	13	The history relates to the Poolbeg incinerator which has again been a live issue in the past few weeks, despite the clear opposition of the elected members of Dublin City Council and the introduction of local government reform, which has not shown them to be in a strong position. The county manager ignored their wishes and those of the people of Dublin and is pushing ahead with the project. As the Minister will be aware, RPS Group was the company contracted by DCC at a cost of more than €20 million and it recommended that the council ignore all other options relating to waste reduction, recycling and disposal and build the incinerator. One of the main engineers employed by RPS consultants was subsequently appointed to An Bord Pleanála by the former Minister, Mr. Dick Roche, in 2006. My information is that the individual in question voted to approve the incinerator proposal in 2007. The Minister mentioned a two-year gap. A former senior employee of the consultants who had promoted the project subsequently voted to approve it. Does the Minister not see a conflict of interest in this regard?
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	14	Section 150 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 requires An Bord Pleanála to adopt a code of conduct for members and its employees. The code is a comprehensive document and it is intended that the board will adhere to it. Specific requirements under the code prohibit membership of political parties or organisations involved in planning, provide for a declaration of interests to be completed annually, place a prohibition on engaging in any conduct that would bring the board into disrepute, provide for the reporting of improper communications, disclosure by board members of conflicts of interests at board meetings, etc. The full list is available on the board's website. The manner in which this issue was dealt with was appropriate. However, on a more general basis, I am actively examining An Bord Pleanála. It was established in 1976 and has never been reviewed or looked at in an holistic way. I will address this in the future. However, in regard to the specific case, if the Deputy has additional specific information he would like to make me aware of in a personal capacity, he can write to me. I do not have a concern.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	15	This would be an historical matter but for the fact that the person concerned was reappointed by the previous Minister and is now deputy chairperson of An Bord Pleanála. In that capacity, he further approved a series of controversial projects promoted by RPS consultants. One involves a large wind farm between Cullenagh and Timahoe, County Laois.Despite the fact that no cost benefit analysis was conducted and the new, long-awaited planning guidelines were not in place, despite the scale of the project in a scenic location and despite the report and advice of An Bord Pleanála's inspector that the project be rejected, the board went ahead and saw fit to approve it. While I welcome the Minister's commitment to examine An Bord Pleanála, because it has supreme power in planning and appeals, does he agree that there is a conflict of interest in these cases and that it is important that An Bord Pleanála be above vested interests and be seen to be so?
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	16	It is important that An Bord Pleanála be above vested interests and I have no reason to believe it is not. The Deputy's allegations are serious and I have no reason to believe them. While he has not named the individual concerned, it is clear that the person can be identified. If the Deputy has other information which he believes is necessary to be made available to prove the allegations, I suggest he write to me to do so. Otherwise, I have been examining the operation of An Bord Pleanála and my Department will review the matter. We consider it is necessary to do so, given the length of time since it was established. As part of the process we will examine everything regarding how it operates to ensure it works as effectively as it can. While independent analysis of how the planning system and An Bord Pleanála work in terms of international practice has been very favourable, we must examine it again, particularly all of the practices related to it, to ensure it is transparent.

The mortgage to rent scheme should be an important and invaluable tool in dealing with the issue of mortgage arrears. It is a very good concept which allows approved housing bodies to purchase houses and a mortgage holder to remain in the family home with the option of repurchasing should financial circumstances improve. However, because the scheme is not being promoted and is very cumbersome and long-winded, only a small number of cases are being approved. What does the Minister intend to do to improve the position and ensure there are significant increases in approvals?
#PaudieCoffey	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-party	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-dob	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	20	I thank the Deputy for his good wishes. ` My Department funds two mortgage to rent, MTR, schemes, a local authority, LA, scheme and an approved housing body, AHB, scheme. Both schemes are designed to assist families with income difficulties whose mortgages are deemed unsustainable and likely to remain so. Both schemes allow the household to remain in the home as a social housing tenant. Under the local authority scheme which applies to properties acquired with local authority mortgages, the local authority acquires ownership of the properties. In the case of the AHB scheme which applies to properties secured with private mortgages, properties are acquired by an approved housing body. The schemes were launched on foot of recommendations made in the Keane report on mortgage arrears which was published in 2011. The approved housing body scheme was launched nationally in June 2012, while the local authority scheme was launched nationally earlier this year. To date, 2,490 cases have been put forward by private lending institutions for possible inclusion in the AHB scheme. In 48 of these cases negotiations between all the parties involved, namely, the property owners, lenders, AHBs and local authorities, are completed, while 29 of the cases are fully completed with all agreements signed. A further 73 are at funding approval stage, with detailed negotiations to follow. Separately, 18 cases have been completed under the local authority scheme. The number of solutions put in place under the schemes has been low and is a factor of the complex multi-party negotiations and agreements required. The Government remains committed to helping families in mortgage difficulties to remain in their homes. In an effort to increase the numbers delivered under the AHB scheme, a new protocol between all parties involved in the process came into operation in June 2014.The protocol includes such measures as the provision of a single independent valuation for the purpose of agreeing a purchase price. The valuation and condition surveys will now be carried out earlier in the process to give more certainty to all parties, including the borrower. I expect these new arrangements to support accelerated delivery of the schemes.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	21	While I thank the Minister of State for the information, the figures he provided show that the number of approvals under the scheme is unacceptably low. Anything that could be done to improve the number would be very welcome. The level of mortgage arrears continues to be very high, and unfortunately the insolvency legislation brought forward by the Government is now known to be seriously flawed. The banks have a veto and mortgage holders cannot avail of it as they have little or no disposable income. The mortgage-to-rent scheme is an ideal one and it certainly should be used as a tool to deal with the many situations in which families have little or no disposable income and therefore cannot avail of the personal insolvency scheme. I urge the widening and promotion of the scheme.
#PaudieCoffey	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-party	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-dob	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	22	I recognise and share the concern of the Deputy, as every Member does. I reassure the Deputy that the Government is committed to ensuring as far as possible that people remain in their family homes. While I note that the Deputy is calling for an increase in the numbers using the scheme, my hope is that people's circumstances improve so that they do not end up having to make an application. After all, it is one of the last resorts. It is the scheme to which people are referred when every other avenue of negotiation or resolution has been examined. I accept the concern about the process and the number of people qualifying, but as people's circumstances and the economy improve, fewer will apply to the scheme. The main barriers to people getting full approval and sign-off have included the process. It is recognised that it was quite complex. A number of valuations, property surveys and condition surveys were required. That has been streamlined since June this year, whereby there is one independent valuation, which will speed matters up. We must also take account of the eligibility criteria of the scheme, which are onerous and a last resort for many.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	23	I agree and hope the Minister of State is right that mortgage holders in arrears can recover the situation and find employment. However, there are many thousands of mortgage holders out there in serious arrears with no prospect of being able to deal with them. This is an ideal scheme. Unfortunately, we have seen that the personal insolvency and bankruptcy processes are flawed. In many cases, bankruptcy means loss of the family home. The key to the scheme is that the mortgage holder can stay in the family home. Everything should be done to ensure that people are given that option. To date, the scheme has not been promoted properly. It is not out there and mortgage holders are often unaware of it. I ask the Minister of State to launch an awareness programme for the scheme through local authorities and the media.
#PaudieCoffey	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-party	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-dob	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	24	I accept the point the Deputy makes regarding awareness, but I am sure I am right in saying that in their negotiations with people in difficulties, lending institutions make them aware of all of the options available to them to remain in the family home. MABS does Trojan work to inform and assist people in debt difficulty. MABS informs people in difficulty of the options available to them. The scheme is one of the last resorts to which people are referred after every other resolution process has been examined.The Deputy may ask the pertinent question of why numbers are so low but many applications are ineligible for a number of reasons. These include the borrower not meeting the criteria of the scheme, the borrower declining the scheme, the lender withdrawing an offer under the scheme or the local authority not having a sufficient social housing need for priority. A number of eligibility criteria must be met. It is not simple but it is a last resort and it is an effort by the Government to assist people who are in genuine difficulty. The commitment remains for the sake of those people.

I am interested in getting an update from the Minister on what is happening, the basis for decisions made and whether the interest of all communities in Ireland are being properly represented in what is happening. 
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	26	I thank the Deputy for the question and I welcome the opportunity to address it. As outlined in the draft rural development programme 2014-20, submitted to the European Commission in July 2014, it is intended that Ireland will use a two-step process to select local development strategies for the delivery of the Leader elements of the programme. Step one of the process, which is due to commence in the coming weeks, will seek expressions of interest from interested parties who wish to be considered and selected as qualifying local action groups, LAGs. Minimum qualifying criteria are being finalised and will be made available.  It is envisaged that stage two of the process will commence before the end of 2014 and qualifying groups will be allowed a minimum of six months to develop and submit local development strategies for assessment and possible selection.  A competitive public procurement process is currently under way for the successor to my Department’s local and community development programme, LCDP. The procurement process for the new social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, is open to local development companies, other not-for-profit community groups, commercial firms and national organisations, that can provide the services to be tendered for to deliver the new programme. The closing date for receipt of expressions of interest under stage one of the process was 11 July 2014. Stage two, which is the invitation to tender stage, is due to get under way in October and will involve the successful applicants from stage one being invited to apply to one or more local community development committees to deliver the programme in their areas. Contracts for the delivery of SICAP, due to roll out in 2015, will be put in place following the outcome of that process.

#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	28	I thank the Deputy.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	29	From the Minister's comment, it seems possible that a different company will deliver the SICAP programme with a separate company delivering the Leader programme in the same geographic area. Perhaps the Minister can confirm whether it is possible under the new arrangement. Under the rural development plan sent to Brussels, despite the population of Galway and the fact that it is physically divided between east and west, it is proposed to have only one LAG in the county. Can the Minister confirm that he will stick with that decision?
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	30	Yes, it is possible to have different companies administering the two areas. Whether it is likely is a different question but it is possible. There are 28 LAGs and there are no plans to change what has been announced, which includes one in Galway. The Deputy has raised the issue through various outlets. The issue is to ensure consistency of approach. There is a specific issue in respect of Cork, given its scale, but outside of that it is about what is put forward in the plans and ensuring the requirements of a certain area are covered. Galway has specific nuances, given the Gaeltacht status of some areas. I have engaged with the process and I will ensure that every aspect is covered in order to negate any concerns of some specific area within a unit of the LAG, for example, in Galway.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	31	The Minister is saying that Cork gets three local action groups, even though the county does not have the geographical differences so clearly defined and nor has it three times the rural population of Galway. Therefore, Cork gets three and Galway gets one, despite the fact that one cannot drive from east Galway to west Galway without going through another local authority area. I ask the Minister to confirm that he also seems to be saying there will be no LAG for the islands this time and that each island will be part of the LAG for the respective county. I ask him to outline for me the arrangements to be made in the Gaeltacht counties to ensure services through the Irish language right up board level for those who live in the Gaeltacht areas.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	32	The Deputy has asked a number of questions. It is Government policy that where it can be agreed locally the local community development committees will be the lead local action groups for their respective areas. We are in constant conversation with Irish Local Development Network, ILDN, and we will be talking to them again tomorrow. I have worked with these groups over a lengthy period and we are working with them in a spirit of co-operation. Cork has specific historical issues and issues of scale. The Deputy has identified issues relating to Galway. I come from a county of similar size, if not bigger,-----

#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	34	It is of a similar size and it has specific issues of its own but it will have one LAG. In reply to the Deputy's question about the islands and the Irish language, it will be ensured that the submissions will reflect the islands' specific requirements and the need to ensure that the Irish language is covered. These matters will be dealt with as part of the submissions. If there is a need to revisit the policy because certain LAGs have not contributed sufficiently in one area or sector, then we will revisit it.

In my county of Tipperary there are 2,546 families on the local authority housing waiting list while the national figure is huge. This Government and the previous Fianna Fáil and Green Party Government have depended on privatisation and the market to deal with the issue and this policy has been an abject failure. Will the Minister commence an emergency social house building programme through the local authorities and approved housing bodies in order to build 10,000 houses per annum, as recommended by many national housing advocacy groups?
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	38	I thank the Deputy for his question which deals with a very important matter. I am well aware of the issues in Tipperary. The statutory summary of social housing assessments in 2013 showed 89,872 households on local authority waiting lists as at 7 May 2013, representing a decrease of 9% on the previous summary of 2011. It is the most up-to-date figure available on waiting list numbers which are subject to ongoing fluctuation due to households being allocated housing and new households applying for housing support in the intervening period. The results of the 2013 summary, including breakdowns by each local authority across a range of categories, are available on my Department’s website if the Deputy wishes to access that information. On the question of providing social housing for those on the waiting lists, a new social housing strategy is currently in preparation with the intention that it will be considered by the Government in the coming weeks.The strategy will contain clear, measurable actions aimed at increasing the supply of social housing and they will be based on innovative solutions that will harness new funding streams in order that we might continue to protect the most vulnerable and disadvantaged in society. In the meantime, my Department is continuing to oversee the provision of social housing - through local authorities and other providers - for people on housing waiting lists and homeless persons. Overall, I expect some 6,000 social housing units to be delivered across the range of programmes in the calendar year 2014.

Higgins, to the effect that there is a social housing crisis. The President addressed this matter on two occasions during the past fortnight and is on record as stating, "One of the most basic deprivations a human being can suffer, or fear, is that of being homeless," that "people who need housing and cannot provide from their own means should not be abandoned to the marketplace" and that "You can't leave the provision of housing to a residual feature of the marketplace. We have done that and homelessness is a consequence of that." What we need to do now - I hope the Minister will provide further figures in this regard - is to ensure local authorities and approved bodies build houses for those who cannot provide for them from their own means.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	40	I concur with what the Deputy stated in his initial contribution about previous strategies. Previous Administrations effectively stopped building social housing. That was wrong. This matter must and will be addressed. We are going to recommence building social housing and will provide a significant number of units. I have been challenged - for the remainder of the Government's term of office - with ensuring the conditions necessary to facilitate this will be created. As stated, 6,000 units are due to be delivered by the end of the year. A few months ago the Government issued a restatement of its priorities and if he consults it, the Deputy will note that housing is one of our top priorities. We will deliver on our promises in this regard. The social housing strategy will be published in the coming weeks and, as part of it, we will use every avenue possible in order to ensure the level of social housing provision will be increased. We will also use every funding mechanism at our disposal in the interests of ensuring we will have the capital necessary to allow us to provide housing units. There is an urgent issue with regard to housing in Dublin and other urban centres. The demographics for those who require social housing have changed dramatically. Over 70% of those included are single people, single people with one or two children, etc. We must address that matter in the context of the houses we build and where we build them.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	41	The most important action the Minister and the Government can take is to oversee the construction of social housing by local authorities and approved housing bodies. The President has stated there is a need for a "huge increase in public rental accommodation." The Irish Council for Social Housing is on record as stating, "The over-reliance on the private market to meet social housing demand is unsustainable and ultimately unpredictable." What we need to know now is whether the Government is going to commence, via local authorities, a social housing construction programme and whether it will commit to providing the 10,000 houses the housing advocacy bodies state are required each year in order to address the crisis.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	42	The right mix will be arrived at in the context of the provision of social housing into the future. The construction of houses will be a component in this regard. The strategy for social housing will be announced in the coming weeks. A major factor in this regard will be the contribution local authorities will make in providing houses. I have spent the past few months working with the housing departments of the various local authorities and speaking to every county manager in order to see to it that there will be no time lag in ensuring whatever land they have available will be made ready - where fit - for use in the provision of social housing.All steps are being taken in this regard. The issue of finance will be dealt with as part of the social housing programme to be announced. Obviously, there will be budgetary considerations as part of the budgetary and Estimates process subsequent to that. Social housing is a complete priority for this Government and the social housing strategy will address that.

Every Member will know of the difficulties that have arisen in respect of the process. There are situations involving families in estates that have not been taken in charge for long periods, periods of years, in fact. As a result they are not entitled to the services of the local authority. Is the Minister aware of these situations? Does he intend to make changes to the process? Will the Minister make a statement on the matter?
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	44	I thank the Deputy for what is a very good question. Section 180 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 provides, in respect of the estates which have been completed to the satisfaction of the planning authority in accordance with the planning permission, that the planning authority must, if requested to do so by the developer or by the majority of the owners of the houses involved, initiate the procedures for taking the estate in charge. In the case of estates which have not been completed to the satisfaction of the planning authority in accordance with the planning permission and where enforcement proceedings have not commenced within seven years of the expiration of the permission authorising the development, section 180 also provides that the planning authority must, if requested to do so by the majority of the owners of the houses concerned, initiate taking in charge procedures. This is a serious issue throughout the country. My Department is currently reviewing the taking in charge provisions to determine if they can be improved. The Department will include any appropriate amendments to section 180 in forthcoming planning legislation. My Department is also considering amendments to section 180 that may be required consequential on the establishment of Irish Water and issues that arise as a result.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	45	I certainly welcome the fact that the Department and the Minister are reviewing the situation. Can the Minister give us any timeline in respect of the review? Has it started? When will it finish? What outcome does the Minister anticipate from it? There are situations whereby builders have become insolvent, where they are not on-site, cannot be contacted or perhaps are not in the country. Every Member knows the difficulties that have arisen for families and communities in such estates. I urge the Minister to bring the review on quickly, to publish it and give us an indication of when that might happen.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	46	It has begun. It is in process and is being looked at. Data has been gathered in respect of local authorities. Discussions with the County and City Managers Association and the various planning departments in local authorities have taken place. A range of issues must be addressed. Certain issues in one part of the country or one local authority are not necessarily the same as those affecting other local authorities, for example, issues in respect of water and how water is dealt with, including the associated legacy issues for estates. Following the establishment of Irish Water, the interpretation of one local authority in one area and other local authorities in other areas in respect of potential taking in charge issues needs to be addressed and is being addressed as we speak. It is a priority in the Department. There are several planning Bills in gestation within my Department. Should the review be done in time we will certainly consider any amendments as part of the process.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	47	I thank the Leas Cheann-Comhairle for the opportunity to contribute. I am pleased to hear that the review has started in respect of taking in charge of estates and Irish Water. I welcome the fact that the Minister has started it. A circular was sent out from Irish Water to each county and city manager in the State some months ago. That letter, of which I have a copy, actually vetoes the taking in charge of any estate by a county or city council.According to the document, if an estate has a pumping station, as many do, then the council should not approach Irish Water about taking the estate in charge. The Minister might highlight this matter to his officials, as it is important that Irish Water's management be told to withdraw that circular.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	48	I raised this issue in the House previously. In fairness, a protocol for addressing such matters is necessary. There may be a question of language and interpretation from the local authorities' point of view. A protocol is being developed. The issue needs to be and is being addressed.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	49	This question seeks to emphasise the urgent and ever-increasing housing problem, with particular reference to various locations throughout the country, some of which are affected more than others. While I welcome the Minister's indications to date, I am anxious to see progress in the strategy to address the two strands of this problem.
#PaudieCoffey	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-party	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-dob	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	50	I thank the Deputy for his question and wish to reiterate the Minister's comments, in that the provision of housing units is a high priority for the Government. Action No. 1 of Construction 2020: A Strategy for a Renewed Construction Sector provides for a national framework for housing supply to be established on a statutory footing, with an annual national statement of projected housing supply and demand to be published every June. The Housing Agency has been asked to take the lead in implementing this action. The proper management of all State land is critical. Accordingly, lands that have been transferred to the Housing Agency and lands held by local authorities that are suitable for development will be the first sites considered in any future targeted social housing building programme. In line with the commitments under the Construction 2020 strategy, a housing supply co-ordination task force for Dublin has been established, with an immediate focus on addressing supply-related issues. On 20 May, the implementation plan for the State's response to homelessness was published. In it, the Government's approach to delivery of its objective of ending involuntary long-term homelessness by the end of 2016 was outlined. This plan sets out a range of measures to secure a ring-fenced supply of accommodation for homeless households within the next three years and to mobilise the necessary supports. The social housing strategy referred to by the Minister, to be developed under Construction 2020, will provide the basis for an enhanced approach to social housing provision. It will contain clear, measurable actions to be taken to increase the supply of social housing and, most importantly, reduce the number of people on waiting lists over the next five years. I expect that the strategy will be ready for consideration by the Government in the coming weeks.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	51	I thank the Minister of State. I congratulate him and the Minister on their appointments and wish them well for their tenures in office, which we hope will be long. The two issues arising are moveable feasts, for want of a better description. First, the numbers on the waiting list are constantly changing. One cause is that a number of people have shifted addresses repeatedly in recent years and, as a result, were not included in the updating process and were missed out in the programme. In County Kildare, there are 6,500 families registered on the housing list. That number is increasing daily. Second, 30 or so families are registered as being homeless, yet there is no homeless accommodation and no provision has been made for acquiring purpose-built houses. Would it be possible to develop a two-stage strategy to acquire urgently required emergency housing and to zone land or use currently zoned land to provide an adequate supply of houses adjacent to those areas where it is most needed?
#PaudieCoffey	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-party	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-dob	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	52	The Government recognises the challenge of providing housing units. The housing shortage exists for a reason: the policy of previous Governments was to abdicate responsibility for direct provision of local authority houses. In tandem, the problem was exacerbated when the Part V element of private developments, which was intended to address many of the housing gaps, failed to deliver the numbers sought due to the economic crash.That is why the Government is now giving this matter its full attention. As the Minister, Deputy Kelly, previously outlined, a comprehensive social housing strategy is being prepared as we speak, it will be adopted over the coming weeks and will be published at that stage. There will be a number of responses within that strategy. Direct provision of local authority houses and other funding models, perhaps like those the Deputy mentioned, will all be examined. The real estate investment trust, whereby long-term landlords invest in properties, will also be examined. That has been seen as a successful model in other countries like Canada.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	53	I remind the Minister to keep an eye on the clock. I call Deputy Durkan.
#PaudieCoffey	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-party	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-dob	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	54	A number of responses are needed to urgently respond to this problem.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	55	I thank the Minister of State for his reply. I respectfully suggest that County Kildare is a classic example of where the shortage of houses is very severe and is becoming more severe on a daily basis. If the Minister of State and his Department are willing to engage with the local authority staff in Kildare, I have no doubt they will identify the full extent of the problem and the likely development of the problem over the next few years. Will it be possible to engage with them on that basis and also with other local authority areas that are similarly affected?
#PaudieCoffey	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-party	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-dob	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	56	Yes. I recognise that Kildare has its demands and it is recognised by Government that the greater Dublin area, the commuter areas and other large urban areas in the country have a far greater demand on social housing provision. That is why there is a medium to long-term strategy, as well as a short-term one, where a national framework for housing supply is being established and will be put on a statutory footing. This is the strategy towards which the Government will be working to ensure provision is provided where demand is greatest and priorities will be listed in that format.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	57	I too would like to wish the two Ministers well. With regard to the question, the previous Minister with responsibility for housing stated in the House a few months ago that "Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 has contributed to increased ... integration and more sustainable mixed tenure communities". We know that is not true. It did not happen. Over a ten year period only 5,000 social units were delivered under the Part V mechanism. What are the Government's plans for dealing with that now?
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	58	The Part V review, carried out by the housing agency at my Department’s request, has been completed and will be submitted to Government in the coming weeks - obviously, it has to go through there first. It is anticipated that any legislative changes required on foot of the review, subject to Government approval, will be incorporated into the general scheme of a new planning Bill, to which I have referred a number of times here today and which is expected to be published shortly. As the extent of social housing gain from Part V is directly related to private housing construction, the current situation is that there is very limited Part V delivery in terms of social housing, and we all know that. I am committed to the principle of a social housing gain from private development - let me be quite clear about that - but to maximise that gain we need a properly functioning and sustainable construction sector, hence the Construction 2020 strategy. I believe that the Part V mechanism has the potential to again be a significant contributor to social housing in the context of a recovering housing market.  The Government’s Construction 2020 strategy, published in May this year, aims to build a competitive, innovative and sustainable construction sector. My intention is that the social housing strategy, which will be published in the coming weeks, required under action 8 of Construction 2020 and now in preparation, will be both challenging and innovative, and will provide the basis for an enhanced approach to social housing provision in Ireland. I expect that the strategy will be considered by Government in the coming weeks and the Part V mechanism will be considered also in the very near future and subsequent to that obviously it will be published. 
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	59	I will be interested to see what the Government comes up with. It is vital that this is done right as it was not done right previously. The Government has an opportunity to put it right. There is no doubt that it must be workable for the developer and the builder, otherwise the houses will not be built, but the Government will have to insist on a minimum of 10% in respect of social housing.It is possible to come up with a mechanism that would be workable and ensure the developer would not lose his or shirt on a project. That mechanism could be framed in such a way that it would be workable and, more than anything else, ensure the provision of more units, greater progress towards social integration and the tackling of ghettoisation. In June, the international hedge fund, Kennedy Wilson, was granted planning permission for the development of more than 160 units at the former Clancy Barracks, in respect of which the only condition in terms of social and affordable unit provision is that the developer meet the local authority on the matter, which meeting will obviously take place behind closed doors. I would like to know if the Government is interested in having an impact in the development of this site which the developer says and may well believe is unsuitable for social housing provision. The Government has an obligation to ensure the local authority will insist on a minimum of 10% of the former Clancy Barracks development being social housing.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	60	As I said, all of this must be discussed by the Government prior to publication. By and large, I do not disagree with much of what the Deputy had to say. In terms of the process and the outcome of the Government's decision, a lot has yet to happen. The Deputy is correct that a balanced approach is needed. We must ensure those building the units and houses are interested and will deliver. As I said, I am a huge supporter of the provision of social housing through this process. We must ensure this will happen and that the statistics quoted in the Deputy's first contribution are not repeated. We must ensure a real contribution to social housing provision through this process. It is my intention to ensure - this matter will soon go through the process of government - we will get the balance right, thus ensuring developers will be incentivised to build houses and that, as part of the social housing strategies, units will be delivered on a scale not matched in recent years.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	61	It will be interesting to see what develops. It is important that the Government learns from the mistakes of the previous Government. Every site over 800 sq. m was supposed to be subject to the social and affordable housing requirement. However, that did not happen. Originally, developers were not allowed to move such houses off site. If the Government is interested in tackling ghettoisation and working towards greater social integration, it must ensure this requirement is not met off site. Whether a site is located in Ballsbridge or Darndale, the 10% social housing provision must apply. Another issue is that builders were allowed to buy their way out of meeting the 10% social housing requirement. That must also be stopped. The Government must also insist on there being no difference between the materials used in the construction of private and social units. Previously, there was wholesale use of white deal in the construction of social housing units and oak in private units, many of which were located side-by-side. This was signed off on by the local authorities. The Government must insist on local authorities not signing off on units that do not meet the agreed standards.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	62	To be fair, there is little in the Deputy's contribution with which I would take issue. All of the issues he raises will be dealt with. I favour mixed developments. We need mixed developments to prevent ghettoisation, as described by the Deputy. We must ensure future developments are sustainable and mixed. To add to what the Deputy said, we must also ensure construction of units we require. The requirements for social housing in the context of the demographics of those who need it have changed. The same level of development as was previously required in particular sectors is no longer necessary. For example, owing to the social factors that have derived there is now a requirement for more houses for one person or one person plus a child. We have to adapt to this. The Deputy raised many issues, including the use of different materials in social units. I have heard many such stories and the issue will be addressed. I am also looking at a number of other areas within the planning legislation that would support having the mix right, ensuring construction would happen and that the percentage of social housing units required would be delivered.There are other planning issues coming down the road also.
#PeadarToibin	unknown-#PeadarToibin-party	unknown-#PeadarToibin-dob	unknown-#PeadarToibin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	63	Guím gach rath ar an Aire agus ar an Aire Stáit. Comhghairdeas leo ar a bpoist nua. I hope the solutions the Minister talks about are not horizon solutions and that we will see them in the future. The housing crisis is one of the biggest crises in the State. The solutions need to be timescaled to the crisis. The crisis is now and the solutions have to be implemented now. Many people believe they are living on Shutter Island. So many main streets up and down the country have their shops closed down. People believe they are back in the 1980s and young people have been depleted. This is as a result of the economic crash, bad planning and management by local authorities, and the migration of retail to the Internet. What can the local authorities do, and what can the Minister direct them to do, to ensure this stops?
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	64	I thank the Deputy for his good wishes and his question on town centres throughout the State. The downturn in economic activity associated with the recession has resulted in a significant number of shop closures and vacant units in town and city centres across the country. We all see this in every county. My county, Tipperary, and that of the Minister of State Deputy Coffey, Waterford, are not exempt. To help address this issue, a number of initiatives have been taken by my Department in recent years. Local authorities were requested, where possible, to reduce commercial rates and local charges to assist local businesses. Revised development contribution guidelines were introduced last year, which resulted, for example, in an acknowledged 26% reduction in contributions applied to developments in the four Dublin local authority areas. Also included is the publication of new guidelines on retail planning in 2012, aimed at promoting and supporting the vitality and viability of town and city centres. Further to the commitment in the Construction 2020 strategy, my Department is examining the possibility of enabling local authorities, should they wish to do so, to adopt measures to incentivise the use and development of vacant and under-utilised sites in urban areas and - dare I say - town centres across rural Ireland. My Department remains committed to providing a clear framework for addressing urban centre decline and its impact on the retail sector, and we will explore all options in order to achieve this. I have considerable interest in this issue. We have a number of planning Bills to come before the House. There are other avenues we can explore also, including working with the local authorities. Town centres, because of the various circumstances the Deputy and I have outlined, have been left bereft, with buildings empty. This needs to be addressed and all avenues will be explored in this regard.
#PeadarToibin	unknown-#PeadarToibin-party	unknown-#PeadarToibin-dob	unknown-#PeadarToibin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	65	I want to draw particular attention to the diverging two-tier society that has developed in the State. Inside the M50 there are some stirrings of activity, but the rest of the country is unaffected. This means people in the Border, midlands and west are more likely to be in poverty or unemployed, or more likely to emigrate. According to the last census, the population of these areas fell. The Minister mentioned rates. I ask him to consider seriously a progressive business rate whereby the same amount in rates would be coming into the coffers of the local authority but according to a system whereby the rate would be designed to take the pressure off businesses that are struggling. I hope we generally believe in progressive taxation, but a progressive business rate would reflect the level of profit of a business at a given time. This would be a great incentive to continue for those businesses that are barely hanging on by their fingernails at present.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	66	In answering the question, I must dismiss the Deputy’s point on economic recovery, but that is for another day. The impact is being seen in more areas around the country. The issue raised is a real one, however, and of course I accept that. The Deputy raised the issue of rates and suggested how a change to the rates system could help. We are examining various options in regard to levies, rates and that whole space to try to incentivise businesses and deal with the relevant issues.In some cases, quite large organisations or companies have buildings across the country which have been idle and unused for a long time, yet they have not been sold. They are in prime locations in town centres. That is a real issue which I believe should be dealt with as well. The other issue with regard to local authorities being progressive in respect of rates is the fact that 82 of the 88 rating authorities either reduced rates or maintained them at the same level this year as in 2013. They have been examined and there has been a good deal of flexibility. However, a combination of the matters I just mentioned is really the avenue to take to try to get more people into town centres and generate more business.
#PeadarToibin	unknown-#PeadarToibin-party	unknown-#PeadarToibin-dob	unknown-#PeadarToibin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	67	Another issue is the detachment of local authorities from the experience of workers, traders and businesses throughout the State. Typically, local authorities just see a euro sign when they look at this sector of society. In the North, local authorities do tremendous work in the provision of training programmes for businesses, traders and workers. Such training programmes must be developed by local authorities in the South. In fact, the training programmes must be directed in two ways. They must also be within the local authorities to ensure that local authorities develop their policies in sympathy with the needs of the people outside. Another big issue in this area at present is the migration of billions of euro of retail sales from towns onto the Internet. Three of every four of those euro are leaving the State and entering a foreign till. There is a massive need for local authorities to take the lead in providing online towns, whereby local traders who do not necessarily have the ICT experience to provide e-commerce to their customers are given an opportunity to migrate onto that virtual space as well. That would stem the level of leakage of these retail euro out of the country and ensure that those jobs stay at home.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	68	In my previous occupation before entering politics I was an e-business manager. There are a number of grants available for retailers in that space. It is an area that has been quite successful, but it probably could be developed even further. With regard to the Deputy's commentary on the need for local authorities to ramp up their activities rather than seeing businesses as a cash cow, I was with members of my local authority at the Limerick Institute of Technology campus in Thurles, County Tipperary, last week, where it held a showcase of all the developing businesses in the area. I encourage all local authorities to do this. Others have done it, and it is a good idea. In fairness, with the broadening of the tax base, which has been encouraged under this Government, and the establishment of the local enterprise offices, LEOs, and the local community development committees, LCDCs, which are in the process of being established, there is greater interaction between the local authorities, the business communities, traders and so forth, and there is greater connectivity. There is also more flexibility regarding rates and levies, and that will become more progressive. As a consequence, I believe there is a more nuanced relationship which facilitates business and traders to a greater extent. Can it be improved into the future? Are all local authorities the same? Probably not, to be honest. However, it is far more progressive. Over my period in office I will encourage that as much as possible, because I believe there can be real achievements as a result.

I extend my best wishes to them and their families. Earlier this year, the Department denied 26 groups critically important funding under the scheme to support national organisations, SSNO, funding programme. One of the Minister's first actions after his appointment was to reverse that position and to provide access to funding for organisations that provide important services in the community. Will the Minister make a statement today with respect to his long-term plan for supporting these organisations?
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	70	I thank the Deputy for his good wishes. I know they are sincerely felt.The funding scheme to support national organisations in the community and voluntary sector aims to provide multi-annual funding to national organisations towards core costs associated with the provision of services. Applications for a new round of funding, which commenced on 1 July 2014 , were subject to an appraisal process. My predecessor was anxious to make funding available to as many organisations as possible within the prevailing resource constraints and approved 55 applications for funding for the two-year period from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2016. While it was known that the existing scheme was ending on 30 June 2014 and applications were sought for the new scheme with no guarantee of continued funding, it is clear that organisations had become increasingly dependent on this funding. Against that background, on 18 July 2014, I announced the allocation of bridging funding of approximately €1.4 million to a number of previously funded health, disability and other organisations for a 12-month period, pending the carrying out of a review of the public funding of national organisations in the health and disability sector in particular. My Department has now commenced a process of engagement with the Department of Health in order to advance the review, which is being undertaken in agreement with my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health with special responsibility for primary care, mental health and disability, Deputy Kathleen Lynch. The review is designed to rationalise in a progressive way the funding of these organisations to ensure efficiency in the use of public money and avoidance of duplication, while providing appropriate support to organisations working in the sector. This bridging funding in 2014-15 is a once-off transitional arrangement and will enable organisations to plan for their future, whether with or without State support, such as that provided under the scheme to support national organisations. The question of the next round of funding under the scheme to support national organisations generally will be considered in good time ahead of the conclusion of the current scheme at the end of June 2016.

I am very concerned about the language used when the Minister referred to bridging funding and temporary arrangements. The Minister obviously has not learned anything from the debacle with the medical cards last year with respect to his strategic targeting of vulnerable people in society. It will be of no benefit to those organisations to hear his language here today, particularly around bridging and temporary arrangements. These are organisations that have had a commitment to deliver services to the most vulnerable people in society, those who suffer with mental health issues. They are waiting on tenterhooks around the Minister's language as to whether the funding is temporary or bridging. Where is the review? When will the Minister publish it and share the details of that review with the House?
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	72	I made the decision which I felt was necessary, having spoken to the organisations, which the Deputy knows well, having spoken about them many times himself. I felt it was necessary to ensure the funding continued and, hence, I made that decision. There was obviously a situation where many of these organisations became quite dependent on the funding that was in place. We need to ensure we have a consistency of approach but also to ensure we have scale and geographical coverage at national, regional and local level. As the Deputy is aware, there are many organisations in different areas with different plans and different profiles. The process has already started. In the coming months, officials in my Department and the Department of Health will come together to put together a plan in regard to this whole space. I intentionally gave a year in order to do that. I can assure the Deputy that, in advance of any announcement of that plan, we will communicate strongly how it is going to work. To be fair, the plan has not been finalised and it would not be appropriate to talk about where we are at present as it is still being discussed. Once it is complete, however, we will communicate directly with these organisations, which is completely necessary. Obviously, we will then have the new programme for which the timelines were outlined earlier.

I welcome the fact one of the Minister's first actions after his elevation to office was to climb down on this, although this was as a consequence of the pressure from this House and the organisations involved, some of which are protesting at the gates of Leinster House today. Does the Minister not agree that we must find another way of funding them, one that has an understanding of security with respect to how they can sustained in delivering important services within the community? It is unacceptable that this decision was made in the first place. It is representative of the crass nature of how we attack people in society, in particular those who are providing critical public services within our community.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	74	As someone who worked with these organisations and knows them quite well, I believe the Deputy's language is unacceptable. There is no targeting of these organisations. What we are trying to do is facilitate organisations, including trying to facilitate more organisations in other ways. We are also trying to ensure there is a consistency of approach, that there are clear communications channels and that we have a plan for dealing with all of these organisations into the future. I believe it is quite a progressive development that two Departments in a short space of time are sitting down and developing a plan in order to ensure this happens. That is what is going to happen in the coming months. There is no targeting of any organisation at all. We are being very progressive with these organisations, facilitating them and working with them. I am glad I made the decision I did because it has ensured the viability and future operation of many great organisations.

#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	76	With no ill respect to the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, I think it unfortunate that the senior Minister would not take this matter. It is a very serious issue for hill farmers and has a very serious effect on the rural development programme. His lack of engagement with it to date and his lack of presence here is typical of his lack of engagement on so many other issues in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. It seems to be a Department that is driving itself, a bit like the new Google cars. The Minister needs to get the finger out and take more control of his Department. It is unfair that he puts the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, out for all of these issues. This issue is extremely complex and it is causing extreme anger and dissension among hill farmers the length and breadth of this country. The notion that entry into the new environmental protection scheme, GLAS, will require a 50% agreement on commonage is absolutely bizarre, completely unworkable and shows that, within the Department, there is a lack of understanding among senior officials of what a commonage is. It is discriminatory against hill farmers because other farmers have far fewer pre-qualifying conditions. With a little cop-on and a little sense, it can be resolved but, instead, the Department has been digging in its heels and is refusing to negotiate around the 50% collective agreement, which, as the Minister of State knows, given he knows what farming is, is practically impossible to achieve. There is an irony in that hill farmers, who have for many generations been the custodians and carers of our mountains and hills - those mountains and hills we are using to bring in tourists - will be prevented from participating in a new environmental scheme because of this extreme requirement.What we are looking for is a modicum of cop-on, a modicum of interest from the senior Minister in the Department to resolve this issue without further delay and for him to say to the hill farmers of Ireland that they are part of his vision for agriculture and where he sees the farming industry going because they play a major part, but they are being excluded from every negotiation and the talk about this. There is no hill farmer representative on the commonage agreement committee established under the chairmanship of Mr. Joe Healy and no voice from the hills representing those being discussed by the committee. Again, this is an indication of a Minister who is running his Department with a remote control.  The Minister of State is practical and, unlike the Minister, gets his hands dirty on a farm every so often. I ask him to bring a degree of understanding of the seriousness of this problem to the Department. I ask him to say it to the Taoiseach who has a rolling protest outside his office to try to get him to understand the problems such that the Department will listen and be aware of the concerns of farmers. I am not someone who engages in hyperbole, but we are on the verge of going back to where we were 20 years ago when there were disputes about issues such as rod licences. The Government will see neighbour pitched against neighbour and family against family if it continues to pursue this path. What is needed is intervention. Given that the senior Minister will not take on the issue, perhaps the Minister of State might do so, get heads around the table and knock them together. If the Department and the Minister of State show an interest, hill farmers will come to the table. Otherwise, he will not succeed in implementing the rural development programme which will have far broader and more far-reaching consequences and not just for hill farmers. The Minister of State will not succeed in protecting the hills that are so important and will ensure serious dissension across rural Ireland, something we do not want. I ask him to push up his sleeves and respect the rights of the men and women concerned who for generations have looked after this land. If they are faced with this proposal, they will be driven off it.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	77	I thank the Deputy for raising this Topical Issue and giving me time to clarify some of the issues involved in what is a very complex matter for many. The Minister is away at a jobs announcement in Tullamore in the drinks industry. That is the way we do business. I want to be helpful, if at all possible. GLAS is designed around a tiered approach and the tiers are based on a consideration of priority environmental assets and actions. The tiered approach will give priority access to farmers with important environmental assets. In the case of commonage owners, priority access under tier 1 is guaranteed if at least 50% of the active shareholders sign up to a commonage plan for their commonage. This figure of 50% must be explained better. The next level of prioritisation is tier 2 which largely covers farms with watercourses classified as "vulnerable". Under tier 3, farms which do not fulfil any of the criteria for tiers 1 and 2 but who commit to a series of general environmental actions will qualify.  The proposed maximum payment is €5,000 per annum, with the scheme building up to the inclusion of some 50,000 farmers, with envisaged total expenditure of €1,450 million over the programming period. It is also proposed that, within budget limits, a GLAS+ payment would be put in place for a limited number of farmers who take on particularly challenging actions which deliver an exceptional level of environmental benefit. It is proposed that this payment will be up to €2,000 per annum in addition to the €5,000 paid under GLAS. That gives a total of €7,000.  My priority and that of the Government is to get the rural development programme as a whole approved by the European Commission in order that I can open GLAS as quickly as possible and include up to 30,000 farmers whom I want to attract in year one. Operational details can and will be looked at, but the over-riding imperative is to get GLAS up and running as soon as possible.  There was significant consultation. The Minister travelled the country to see what people wanted prior to the introduction of Pillar 2. When I entered the Department last June, it was at the end of the period of negotiations. If we take ourselves back to that time, the reality is that in Brussels during the Irish Presidency, the Minister handled the negotiations to bring them to a conclusion. I stress that consultation with the farming organisations took place at all times and that they were certainly happy with them.  Turning to look specifically at commonages, the position is as follows. Payments under GLAS can only be made in respect of actions going beyond the baseline requirements under the basic payment scheme under Pillar 1 of the CAP. In simple terms, this means that a farmer cannot be paid twice for the same commitment under both schemes. I doubt if anyone will disagree with this. Since the introduction of agri-environment schemes in the 1990s, the Pillar 1 baseline has been progressively raised for each programming period and this challenges us all in developing schemes that gain approval at EU level. There is so much that needs to be explained. That is what has given rise to all the hysteria.  Farmers are required under the basic payment scheme to maintain land in good agricultural and environmental condition, GAEC, and commonage land is no exception to this requirement. Therefore, in order to secure funding for hill farmers under GLAS, we have to design a scheme which manifestly goes beyond the baseline. We also have to ensure the commitments outlined are measurable and controllable as this is critical to securing approval. The key characteristic of commonage land is that it is farmed in common and the actions undertaken under GLAS will have to reflect this. We cannot have multiple and varying plans submitted for the commonage - we need a single plan lodged by a single adviser that sets out clearly what the objectives are over a five year period and what those participating in this plan will do individually and together to achieve these objectives. On this point, we clearly need to have sufficient people working together to achieve the best results for the commonages in the interests of both the farming community and the environment. I believe 50% participation is the minimum required to make this work and, in recognition of the additional effort involved, I have increased the rate of payment from €75 per hectare under the last programme to €120 per hectare for GLAS. I have listened very carefully to the concerns of hill farmers and recognise that they are real. That is why over the course of the consultation process on the RDP which have extended to a year and half we have adapted and rebalanced our proposals for commonages. It is particularly important to point out that the 50% requirement is based on active farmers only, that is, those actually grazing the commonage. To give an example, if there are 20 shareholders on a commonage but only ten of them are actively grazing the land, the 50% requirement to trigger priority access to GLAS is just five farmers. I do not believe a minimum participation requirement based on this model is insurmountable, but where real difficulties are being encountered, I have already said the farmers concerned can approach the commonage implementation committee to make their case. Other issues that I know have been of concern to hill farmers include clarity on the Pillar 1 baseline, having adequate time to adapt, the imposition of minimum and maximum stocking levels and the imposition of penalties. We have brought a good deal of clarity to all of these issues in public statements in recent weeks and my sense is that farmers are much more comfortable with what is being proposed. The baseline has been set at 0.1 of a livestock unit per hectare, with farmers having until December 2015 to achieve this. I have made it very clear that my Department will not be imposing minimum-maximum stocking levels for each commonage, but it will provide such figures to help guide the planning process. It is open to the shareholders themselves to propose a different regime if they believe it is better suited to the needs of the commonage. The objectives of the GLAS plan are to be achieved over time and penalties will be applied individually where it is clear that an individual is at fault - there is no question of the group being penalised for something that was clearly the responsibility of an individual. I hope and believe we have addressed many of the concerns of hill farmers in the clarification provided to date. I have also arranged for a series of public meetings at key locations nationwide in order that farmers will have an opportunity to talk to officials from my Department, ask their questions and consider the replies. We are reaching a stage where all sides can see that we have much more in common on this important matter than might have been realised to date.

That has been his trait as Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. He is the Minister for the industry, but he forgets that to have a food industry, we need farmers and a Minister for farming in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. What the Minister of State did not get to points to most of the difficulties with this issue. Even getting the agreement of 50% of active farmers on a commonage will be absolutely impossible, as one is talking about hundreds of people. The Department has not even defined what the commonage plan will look like and what the minimum requirements will be. Second, it is forcing the people concerned to use one single adviser to get agreement. The practicalities would surely instruct and guide the Minister of State that this will be impossible. He knows this because he has been operating in rural Ireland for a long time. No matter how great GLAS is - it might be the best thing since sliced bread - if they do not get agreement, they cannot join GLAS. The irony of those who have cared for the environment, the mountains and the hills for generations being excluded from a scheme that aims to care for the environment is rich.  That is the difficulty and why many decent people are out protesting and attending protest meetings. It is not hysteria. It is a genuine concern and worry that people will be excluded from incomes that will keep them on the land and in rural areas. Otherwise, they will leave and we will be left with all of the problems identified. Why is the Welsh proposal so different from the Irish one? It is a country with a similar topography, yet the Welsh proposals are completely different. Is it a case of us once again gold-plating European legislation to be the good boys while not reflecting on the consequences for Irish citizens?  We have a very small window in order to engage with this issue. I acknowledge that some changes have been made to stocking rates in the past few weeks. The figure of 50% simply will not work and because it will not, the rural development programme about which the Minister of State speaks will not attain its achievements, will not secure the buy-in the Government needs for it to attain its achievements and will not get support on the ground. This will affect the programme and our standing in Europe. No matter how good the new Commissioner will be, this will not help. I, therefore, ask the Minister of State for a small dose of sense and reason. I ask him to explain to his civil servants who are driving this issue that it will not work and that they must go back to the drawing board to stop what will happen.The Minister will pit neighbour against neighbour, brother against brother, and we do not want to go down that road again.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	79	I acknowledge that there is a great deal of concern among many people living in rural Ireland. The Minister and I and our departmental officials are committed to the rural development programme, which was fought for long and hard. It was difficult to get the matching funding, but it was achieved, and the last thing we want is for the scheme to fail. There is a great deal of hysteria about particular issues, and people are being frightened at public meetings. Public pronouncements by some individuals have been unhelpful. I refer to an example of 20 shareholders on a commonage of whom only ten are grazing the land. The 50% requirement to trigger priority access to GLAS amounts to just five farmers. That is the reality. If agreement cannot be secured between the individuals on the commonage, the commonage implementation group can sit and examine the issue.

It is unfair for people to say this is unworkable and that rural Ireland will collapse. We have committed significant money to this scheme and we want it to work fairly. There is an opportunity to make it work fairly. At departmental level we want it work, and we will talk to people and help them to get over the line if other aspects of this need to change. However, the lack of understanding is a problem. I stress that the commonage implementation group is available to resolve problems where people cannot get a plan together with their planners.

I received notification of the selection of this matter at 11.02 a.m. There was ample time to ensure the Minister was present when important matters were being addressed to him. I support the case being made by beef producers that the current return per kilo is below the break-even position and that there is a compelling case for the Minister to exert appropriate pressure on processors and on large supermarket chains to have this unsustainable situation satisfactorily addressed. Protecting the domestic and international reputation of our high-quality beef is an absolute requirement and it is the duty not only of the Minister but of all elected voices and those who can influence public opinion at home and overseas. Irish beef is high-quality beef raised on the richest grasslands in the world. We must effectively market this key Irish product globally. It is because I care passionately for the reputation of this important sector of our economy that I ask the Minister of State to explain his and his Department's failure to discipline those departmental employees - veterinary inspectors - who have failed to carry out their duties responsibly, who have put innocent farmers under severe personal stress and strain and who have admitted under oath that they allowed an animal to enter the food chain that they believed had been injected with an unknown substance, which they acknowledged could have been toxic. They also stated that they did not believe it relevant that the animal had entered the food chain. Are these people serious? Relevant to what? Is their primary role not to help ensure the best practices of husbandry are employed by beef farmers at all times, that consumers at home and abroad have the assurances of our Government that the Irish beef we purchase and consume is of the highest quality and that our systems are above reproach? The Minister will know that I am referring specifically to the case of the Cavan farmer Mr. Douglas Fannin, whose good name and good reputation were affirmed in the Cavan Circuit Court last year following years of unjustified and disgraceful pursuit by his Department's special investigations unit. It is long past time that the Minister of State and his senior colleague put the interest of the beef sector above that of their Department's employees of whatever rank. Will he ensure the Minister is fully briefed on this exchange? Will he ensure there can be no recurrence of these actions by departmental inspectors? Will he assure the House and all whom we collectively represent that there can be no recurrence of what I view to be irresponsible behaviour that puts at risk the reputation of this key sector and that could put at risk the health of innocent consumers at home or abroad?
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	83	I thank the Deputy for raising the issue. The beef sector is hugely important to the economy. We have acknowledged that, and most of our time over the past number of months has been spent trying to solve problems and deal with the issues in the sector. Last year, beef exports accounted for just under €2.1 billion, reflecting a 5% increase in output and a 4% increase in average prices. This growth resulted from concerted action by the Government, industry and producers to develop our product offering. Primary producers are under significant pressure this year as a result of reductions in price, but a significant infrastructure has been put in place to help improve on-farm profitability. The medium-term prospects for the beef market are reasonably positive, with increasing global population and demand for animal proteins. In collaboration with Bord Bia and Irish embassy personnel, my Department engages with a wide range of countries on market access issues. In this context, the Minister has led trade missions to Japan, China, the US, Algeria and the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council, GCC, in the Middle East to promote Irish food, including beef. This work has led to a number of notable successes in securing market access in Japan, Singapore, Egypt and Iran. This year we have agreed access terms with the Lebanon, the Philippines and Namibia. Furthermore, my Department is working with the meat industry to finalise the various technical requirements for trade in Irish beef with the US. We are optimistic about the opportunities this market will bring. China is another market where there is considerable potential for Irish beef. The Minister intends to lead a trade mission to China towards the end of the year and beef will be firmly on the agenda. Irish beef is listed with more than 75 high-end retail chains across EU markets. This wide portfolio of customers reflects the success of Bord Bia's differentiation and premiumisation strategy. This strategy focuses on the key attributes of Irish beef: environmentally sustainable, grass-based production systems; full traceability; quality assurance at all stages; and superior eating quality. Among Bord Bia's key initiatives this year is the continued development, promotion and marketing of its Origin Green initiative. This is designed to establish Ireland as a world leader in sustainably produced food and drink. The Government is also investing heavily in the future at production level. Earlier this year, we announced details of an investment package worth up to €40 million aimed at sustaining a critical mass in the suckler cow herd, which is at the heart of our beef industry.The package includes the beef genomic scheme, the beef data programme, the beef technology adoption programme and the suckler cow welfare scheme. The suckler cow herd is also a key component of our longer term strategic plans as set out in the €4 billion draft rural development programme. This is in addition to the €1.2 billion in annual single farm payments to Irish farmers which was negotiated as part of the revised Common Agricultural Policy. The integrity of the beef industry is of the utmost importance to the economy and Ireland's worldwide reputation as a food producing country. Every step is taken to promote the industry which is achieved by ensuring the highest standards are applied and maintained in the production of Irish food.  Because the Deputy has made a very strong case it is essential that I give him a response. When animals are presented for slaughter at meat plants, an ante-mortem examination is carried out prior to slaughter and a post-mortem examination after slaughter to determine the suitability of the meat for entry into the food chain. This level of examination fulfils the obligation of the hygiene package as laid down by the European Union. While I do not wish to discuss the specifics of the individual case to which the Deputy referred, I categorically assure the House that the required checks were carried out before the release of any carcass into the food chain. The question of disciplinary action in this matter does not arise.

I remind him of some of what was said on 8 November 2013 in Cavan Circuit Court. A question was posed by a barrister representing the defendant, addressing one of the Department veterinary inspectors, as follows, "Were you aware that there was a possibility that what was introduced into this animal actually could have been toxic?" The reply was:Yes, certainly. Anything introduced into an animal that is not sterile could be toxic.Continuing, the same respondent stated:Our focus would have been to find out if there had been interference. I think it is very difficult to identify from first basics a completely unknown substance. It could have been any one of a thousand substances. The samples were taken to see if there had been interference, to see if something had been introduced ... I don't accept whether the animal was entered into the food chain as being relevant. I refuse to accept the identification of the irritant as being relevant.There is much more; that is only one section. As a consumer and speaking on behalf of consumers and those involved in the sector, I find it highly relevant. What is the role of Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine inspectors if it is not, as I said in my opening remarks, to assure us as domestic consumers and the global market that our beef produce is of the highest standard and fit, without question, for public consumption and that our processing is beyond reproach? There are questions which the Minister of State may not be able to answer and I want the Minister to address them subsequent to this exchange. Where was the meat from this animal destined? Has the Minister sought to establish whether it was for domestic consumption or export? Apart from the Department's internal review which addressed what it saw as deficiencies in the conduct of the prosecution case rather than accept and address the judgment in the Circuit Court of Judge Reynolds and establish how its special investigation unit, SIU, personnel had conducted themselves when acting in the name of the Minister and the Government, has the Minister taken any other step to address the very worrying facts that the case exposes?

I ask the Acting Chairman to ask the Minister of State to withdraw the scurrilous accusation he has levelled at me. I have indicated very clearly and acted at all times to ensure the Department would act to assure the provenance of all of the components of the beef industry. In this instance, it has failed to do so. The review to which the Minister referred did not address the issues at the core of the problem but sought only to excuse its own behaviour.

The Department inspects it continuously, on an hourly, daily and weekly basis. The Deputy knows this and we should all acknowledge it. We demand the best quality beef and that is what we sell. We have made a name for ourselves all over the world with the top quality beef we produce. As Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, I will not resile from saying this.

#DerekNolan	unknown-#DerekNolan-party	unknown-#DerekNolan-dob	unknown-#DerekNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	95	I thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for selecting this Topical Issue. Some tens of thousands of students are returning to college after the summer break and re-entering the Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, system to access supports for education such as having their fees paid and receiving maintenance grants. While SUSI has improved since its first year in operation, there are still difficulties with the rules by which it must operate, in particular, the eligibility criteria by which students are identified as independent, meaning they are judged on their means, rather than on those of their parents, the alternative being dependent status. This is an issue particularly for students entering postgraduate courses who must fulfil one of two requirements, namely, that the applicant must be over 23 years of age when he or she enters third level education, or must have a gap of three years in his or her education path between finishing his or her undergraduate degree and proceeding to postgraduate study. This has led to some very unusual, peculiar and undesirable outcomes. For example, a student who visited me in my constituency office in Galway last week is in her second year of PhD studies.She had entered the third level education system at 19 years of age, which means that she fails the first criterion for independent status. She is now 27 years old and in the second year of a PhD programme, but because there was only a two-year gap between her masters programme and the PhD programme, she is now being deemed as dependent on her parents, notwithstanding that she has not lived at home with them for years. She is financing her way through college as much as she can through part-time work, but the requirements we have in place say this grown woman must be judged on her parents' income. It is an unfortunate aspect of the system. It tells people not to go back to college but rather to keep the gap as great as possible in order to get maintenance. It encourages people not to continue in education but to stay out of it for longer. It is an unfortunate element of the policy. We need people to upskill, and these postgraduate courses are what we mean when we refer to the knowledge economy and our ability to compete internationally in terms of education, skills and being at the forefront of research. Rather than encouraging that, the policy disincentivises it. I ask the Minister of State, who has an interest in this, to give a commitment today to discuss the matter with the Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, to see if we really want a system that is a disincentive for people to stay in education.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	96	I apologise on behalf of my line Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, who cannot be here as she is out of the country on a trade mission. For student grant purposes, students are categorised according to their circumstances as either students dependent on parents or legal guardians or independent mature students. A student may be assessed as an independent mature student if he or she has attained the age of 23 on 1 January of the year of first entry to an approved course, or re-entry following a break in study of at least three years, and was not ordinarily resident with his or her parents in the previous October. Otherwise, he or she will continue to be assessed on the basis of parental income. To be assessed as an independent mature student, an applicant must provide sufficient evidence to show he or she was living independently of his or her parents on 1 October of the year before the first point of entry to higher education. I gather that the first point of entry requirement is Deputy Nolan's main concern. I see the point he makes that where someone is 27 or 28 years old, it is a major difficulty. I have also come across cases in which a person is under 23 and lives in his or her own house with his or her own children. I accept that. There are other criteria with regard to providing proof of independence to SUSI through bills, etc. While there are difficulties in that regard as well, the Deputy will understand that the criteria are there for certain reasons. There are ways of sorting that out. While there are no plans to review the matter, the Deputy raises a very important issue. I have come across other cases myself. I will sit down with the Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, to discuss the matter and see if we can address these cases. The Deputy is right to say we want to improve people's skills and encourage them back into education. There are many people who need to be reskilled, including those with an existing college qualification. I will raise the matter with the Minister and we will get back to the Deputy in due course. While there are no set plans to do this, the Deputy raises a good example and we will see what can be done.
#DerekNolan	unknown-#DerekNolan-party	unknown-#DerekNolan-dob	unknown-#DerekNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	97	I thank the Minister of State for his reply and his commitment to review the issue, talk to the Minister and see if we can put a better set of rules in place. While we are discussing third level students, I note that there is talk of greater flexibility in future budgets and of starting to see the end of absolute pressure on budgets. If there is any opportunity in the third level budget in the forthcoming Estimates, we should freeze the student contribution charge. It is planned to increase it in the next budget, but it is getting to a prohibitive level and this is having a significant impact. If there were some flexibility to row back, we could at least freeze it. It is heading quickly towards €3,000, which is a great deal of money, especially if one has more than one child in college. If there is flexibility, it would send a great signal and provide families with the relief they need in the current circumstances.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	98	That is a separate issue altogether, but it is no harm for Deputy Nolan to take the opportunity to raise it. It is something we would all like to avoid if we could. When the contribution came in and the plan was made to increase it every year, the context was one of very tight budgetary constraints. Those have not yet gone away, and we must be very careful. Although things have improved and the recovery is on track, which means that some of the €2 billion that must be found in the budget in five or six weeks' time has been dealt with already through increases in tax receipts, every Department continues to have commitments to reduce costs over the next couple of years. If every Department comes back with an increased list, we will be right back where we started. The Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform have pointed out that they do not want to go back to a boom-and-bust scenario. It is not the case that the Departments are free to start spending endless amounts of money again. The money is still not in the system. While I accept the Deputy's point, previous Ministers explained clearly why it had to be done, and Deputy O'Sullivan has explained that she does not see how it can be reversed. I will bring the Deputy's points to her and make the case, but I do not want to give the impression that there is a pot of money in education whereby we can start changing things back. We cannot. We have to make our own case and there is a great deal of pressure on the Department, mainly as a result of demographic change. The numbers attending primary, secondary and third level education are increasing every year. We cannot predict in the third level sector where that will end. The numbers are rising at such a high rate in primary and secondary that it will keep going up. I do not think there will be space to do what the Deputy asks, and I do not think the Minister will be in a position to do it, but I will raise it with her and get back to the Deputy. There is an impression going around now that every Department can stop making the changes, but while I wish we could, that is not the case. Spending is still very tight. I will raise the matter with the Minister, who could not be here in person.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	99	Last week, the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, or GSOC, stated that its investigation into an alleged leak from its offices, which gave rise to substantial controversy earlier this year, was unsuccessful and that its report on the investigation will not be published. From the start of this affair, GSOC has sought to cover up and keep secret a disturbing level of incompetence and failure to comply with its statutory obligations. This is unacceptable. It is contrary to the public interest that the current GSOC commissioners remain in place and that these matters are left unresolved, particularly in light of new and additional GSOC powers proposed in forthcoming legislation. In October 2013, GSOC commenced what the Cooke report clearly regarded as a premature public interest investigation into alleged surveillance of its offices. Under section 103 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005, GSOC commissioners had a statutory obligation to inform me, as the then Minister for Justice and Equality, and the then Garda Commissioner of the investigation. They did neither. On 25 November 2013, the chairman of GSOC, Simon O'Brien, and the commissioner Kieran FitzGerald were briefed by their investigators that there had been no "positive result" to the investigation. The chairman is recorded in the Cooke report at page 26 as making a note in his personal log:This investigation is now closed. I need to think about reporting. This will be difficult, we have found nothing.In December, GSOC formally closed the investigation and, again, did not inform me as Minister or the then Garda Commissioner. Since the publication of the Cooke report there can be no dispute that it was under a statutory obligation to do so. On 9 February 2014, as a result of a leak of confidential GSOC information, The Sunday Times published an article relating to the investigation. The following day, I met with Simon O'Brien, who verbally briefed me on the matter. Later that day, he furnished me with a written version of the briefing, which formed the basis of my statement to the Dáil on 11 February last. Commissioner Kieran FitzGerald confirmed that night on "Prime Time" the accuracy of what I told the Dáil. However, when appearing before the relevant joint Oireachtas committee, the commissioners proved incapable of detailing what occurred in a coherent manner and their confused narrative and vague innuendo laid the foundations for accusations subsequently made that I had misled the Dáil and weeks of unnecessary controversy. Inexplicably, GSOC commissioners took no steps to clearly set out the facts and facilitated the continuation of the controversy. Even more seriously, at the time of Mr. Simon O'Brien's meeting with me, in the written report I received from GSOC and in the presentation to the joint Oireachtas committee, the representatives of GSOC covered up the fact that they knew that a device about which they expressed concern was known by November 2013 to be randomly attempting to connect to a Bitbuzz Wi-Fi system in an Insomnia coffee shop located in the ground floor of GSOC's building, and posed no risk of surveillance.On a radio broadcast subsequent to publication of the Cooke report, Mr. Simon O'Brien was asked why GSOC had failed to comply with its statutory obligation to inform me as Minister of its public interest investigation. He stated that "events overtook" them. This reference to the publication of The Sunday Times article in February as the reason for GSOC's failure is disingenuous and not credible. It is clear from Mr. Simon O'Brien's log, as detailed in the Cooke report, that he was well aware of his reporting obligations on 25 November and, I believe, from the commencement of the public interest investigation he knew of GSOC's statutory obligations. Most recently, GSOC has failed to successfully investigate the alleged leak which led to The Sunday Times report and, in refusing to publish the report of the investigation into the leak, clearly intends to conceal its content. I repeat what Judge Cooke stated in page 51 of his report, that the information revealed in The Sunday Times article is "evidence of a serious breach of security". The Cooke report has essentially confirmed that what I informed this House about these matters was true by finding that "it is clear that the evidence does not support the proposition that actual surveillance of the kind asserted in The Sunday Times article took place and much less that it was carried out by members of the Garda Síochána". It is also important to note that Judge Cooke found The Sunday Times article to be "seriously inaccurate". When it is alleged that members of An Garda Síochána fail to comply with their statutory obligations and rules and regulations, it falls to GSOC to investigate. To do so with credibility, GSOC must be above reproach. It clearly is not and I believe it is no longer acceptable that the failings of GSOC and, in particular, the GSOC commissioners be ignored.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	100	I thank Deputy Shatter for raising on Topical Issues the completion last week by GSOC of its investigation into an alleged leak of confidential information concerning the public interest investigation into the alleged surveillance of its offices and its decision not to publish its report into the matter. The House is familiar with the background to this matter, which the Deputy has outlined, and, in particular, the article published by The Sunday Times, which claimed that GSOC was under hi-tech surveillance. While it was clear, following the inquiry by Judge Cooke, that the article contained serious inaccuracies, and while Judge Cooke found that the evidence did not support the proposition that actual surveillance of the kind asserted took place, it was nevertheless clear that The Sunday Times journalist, Mr. John Mooney, had received some confidential information relating to these issues, as GSOC had indeed engaged a UK firm, Verrimus, to investigate whether it was under surveillance, and had conducted its own investigation into these concerns. GSOC engaged a senior counsel to conduct a fact-finding investigation to determine, so far as possible and on the balance of probabilities, the facts relating to this suspected disclosure of information. It is made clear in the report that the senior counsel was given access to all the information and records in the possession of GSOC and it states that he received co-operation from everyone concerned, except for the journalist, Mr. John Mooney, who declined to be interviewed. The senior counsel concluded that he is satisfied the journalist received confidential information from some person or persons associated with the Verrimus or GSOC investigations. He was not able, however, to establish when the journalist received such information, from whom he received it, or the exact nature of the information disclosed. GSOC considered, in light of the public controversy that surrounded the entire matter, that it was appropriate that I be supplied with a copy of the report. I must stress, however, that it was not supplied to me under the relevant section, section 80, of the Garda Síochána Act 2005, which provides for GSOC reports submitted to me to be laid before both Houses. It was submitted to me by GSOC for information. In fact, GSOC stressed in the covering letter to me that it did not intend to publish the report as it contained personal data, which it said was impossible to redact effectively. It was absolutely right, and indeed essential, for GSOC to inquire into a concern that confidential information relating to either the Verrimus investigation or GSOC's related investigation was leaked to a journalist. I have also made clear from the outset that I believe that as much information as possible on the outcome of the inquiry should be put in the public domain in the interests of transparency. That is why, while fully respecting GSOC's statutory independence, I have asked GSOC, in consultation with the senior counsel concerned, and with whatever level of redaction might be legally necessary, to consider now publishing the report in the public interest. I have taken legal advice on it and some legal redaction is necessary if there is personal data that it is inappropriate to release.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	101	I thank the Minister for her response. I do not believe it tenable that the current GSOC commissioners remain in office, nor is it acceptable that the matter of the leak now be abandoned on the basis of the failed investigation. The possibility of further such leaks could seriously undermine current or future investigations into alleged Garda misconduct. The leaking of information of a confidential nature from GSOC is a criminal offence under the Garda Síochána Acts. Just as it is not acceptable that the Garda Síochána investigates itself, it is not adequate that GSOC now simply washes its hands of this matter. Action is required to restore GSOC's public credibility. It is also not acceptable that the report furnished by GSOC to the Minister remain unpublished or that it be edited into incoherence before publication. I appreciate the Minister's wish that matters be as transparent as possible but that may not prove possible if it is left under the remit of GSOC and I, personally, would not have confidence in the manner in which it is approaching this matter. There should be full transparency and accountability and the report should be published in full. That is in the public interest, although I recognise that there are some who would prefer that this affair simply die a death and the controversy be not revisited. Having regard to the damage done to GSOC's credibility, the extent to which that may taint any future investigations and reports, the risk of further leaks, the inordinate amount of Cabinet, Dáil and Oireachtas committee time spent on these matters and the media frenzy spawned by them, leaving matters as they are should not be acceptable to any Member of this House. It is also not acceptable to do so in the context of the additional powers being conferred on GSOC by new legislation. What Members of the House should require is that there is full transparency with regard to the investigation conducted, that the report in as detailed a fashion as possible be published and that whatever steps are required or necessary be taken to restore public confidence in GSOC and the credibility of those in a leadership position within GSOC.

I understand the point made by the Deputy that redaction can be problematic from a practical perspective in respect of the coherence of the overall report if and when redactions are made. From a legal perspective, redactions must be made if there was an infringement on personal data or if there were defamation issues in the report. The Deputy will accept that. I appreciate the concerns raised in respect of transparency and accountability with regard to the report. There is a major public interest in ensuring that as much information as possible is made available, consistent with the legal rights of those involved. I have asked GSOC, in consultation with the senior counsel who prepared the report, who knows the full facts and how legal rights must be protected, with whatever level of redaction might be necessary, to consider publishing the report in the public interest.

I could talk about the average bill of €240 promised by the Taoiseach before the local elections, despite the fact that a family with two adult children will now be paying about €590 - a far cry from his €240. I could talk about the fact that the Taoiseach said that the cost for children would be free but we now know that children will be entitled to about one shower a week and one daily toilet flush. However, I do not intend to focus on that aspect today; instead I will focus specifically on the fact that bills will be sent out to about 36,000 people-----

There has been very great confusion and anger across the midlands this morning because of statements emanating from Fine Gael about this specific issue giving the impression that there will be a 100% exemption now. The Taoiseach will understand that the people of Roscommon are very wary of any kind of promises emanating from him or from sources close to him. Most objective observers would say that there should be a complete exemption from Irish Water bills for people who cannot drink contaminated water. The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, made a great statement when he said that people should pay for water because we have it up to Ballygowan standard. It is clear that in these 30,000 or so houses it is anything but Ballygowan standard but that rationale has gone out the window and the spin now being put on it is that-----

Will he agree that people should not be issued with a bill from Irish Water until Irish Water is in a position to provide a proper service to them?

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	116	The Government has given two directions. The regulator is to issue its definitive findings and charges in the next week or so. The Government has given two directions to the regulator, that the average meter charge should be €240 - it will be approximately €238 - and that children should be free. That is at a level of 21,000 l, based on surveys carried out by Irish Water and validated by the regulator. The question of boil-water is an issue of great concern to so many people; 18,000 people are currently on boil-water notices. As the Deputy is aware, between 40% and 50% of water leaks are under the ground. This is the situation that was allowed to continue for so many years and it will be of great consolation to the people of Roscommon when the four treatment works currently under way are completed and they will not have boil-water notices in future. The legislation prepared by Deputy Cowen to which Deputy Martin referred is not acceptable to the Government because the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government considers that existing legislation allows for greater flexibility to deal with issues of contamination of water or if water is not drinkable for whatever reason. The regulator in its indicative document indicated that there would be concessions given in respect of where boil-water notices or contaminated water or water unfit of human consumption would be involved. The regulator will issue its definitive findings next week. Therefore, we do not accept the legislation prepared by Deputy Cowen.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	119	It is beyond any logic. If water going into a household is contaminated and is not fit for human consumption, how can that family be charged for it? The original legislation should have provided for an exemption from any charge for any family with a contaminated water supply. They are paying for bottled water as it is and they have other costs associated with the fact that the water is contaminated. I find it incomprehensible and I ask the Taoiseach if he accepts the basic principle that if a person's water supply is contaminated he or she should not be obliged to pay for it. It is monstrous. The Taoiseach should listen to people who are in that situation. Whatever one's views on water charges, if the water one is being asked to pay for is dangerous, may cause one to get sick or seriously ill, is contaminated and the authorities say one will have to pay for it as well, this is adding insult to injury, it is arrogance of the highest order and is illogical and incomprehensible. Does the Taoiseach accept it is a basic principle that one should not have to pay for water that is contaminated?

Tá sé sin an-soiléir maidir leis an Roinn Sláinte. The Government's commitments in reforming the health service lie in tatters.

The Minister has torn up the Government's timetable for free GP care which the Taoiseach will recall was one of the cornerstones of the famous five-point plan. Last week the Taoiseach publicly chastised the Minister. The Taoiseach defended his predecessor, Deputy James Reilly, in every controversy and debacle in which he became involved and made it clear that he was implementing Government policy and Cabinet decisions. The Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, has ditched the Government's policy.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	160	The lads opposite appear to be a little frisky at this early stage. The Government is fully committed to the introduction of universal health insurance in the interests of ending a two-tier system that is discriminatory and inequitable and that has not worked. Even when €15 billion was being spent on that system, it did not deliver the goods. Universal health insurance will be introduced during the second term of the Government. However, a number of steps must be taken prior to that happening. These involve the strengthening of primary care services - primary care centres are being rolled out at an average of one a month - continuing the work of the special delivery unit in tackling waiting times and waiting lists, the introduction of the money-follows-the-patient model in order that people will have greater control over the services of which they wish to avail and the introduction of hospital groups which in due course will be obliged to make fundamentally important decisions on health services. When these building blocks are put in place, the introduction of universal health insurance will follow. In essence, universal health insurance will mean that every patient will become central to the system. As a result, people will be tended to, as a priority, on the basis of their medical needs as opposed to what they have in their pockets. As the Deputy is aware, not every patient can afford to go to other places for treatment.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	161	Maith thú, Taoiseach. In the first instance, I cast no aspersions on the Minister for Health. As is the case with all of his ministerial colleagues, I wish him well. The Taoiseach has stated that all of the steps to which he refers will be taken during the Government's second term. Did I hear him correctly?

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	165	Before the Government is given a second term, a very important element will enter the equation, namely, the people. They will have their say on whether the Government remains in power for a second term. The Taoiseach avoided the opportunity to set any real policy direction or to outline a programme of reform. He did not, for example, indicate how the election slogans or commitments which have, in fact, been torn up would be realised. Even as the autumn of its term of office approaches, there is an opportunity for the Government to abandon this unworkable policy and introduce a new approach based on genuine reform and equality and which prioritises the delivery of front-line health services and to end privatisation and establish a truly universal health care system with access for all on the basis of need rather than wealth. This matter relates to citizens, patients, children who face huge life challenges and some of whom have terminal illnesses and the elderly. All of us have been sick at some time or other. The people to whom I refer look to the Government to solve the problems and provide the services that they require. In a society which refers to itself as a republic, a public health service that can provide people with the comfort they need is a very basic entitlement. Instead of making general remarks-----

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	168	The Deputy has pointed out exactly what the Government intends to do in putting in place a universal health insurance system to which the needs of the patient will be central. He has echoed my words to the effect that the patient is central and that he or she will be treated on the basis of his or her medical needs as distinct from his or her income. In order to reach that point, certain foundations and building blocks must be put in place. I have already referred to them. They are: the money-follows-the-patient model; the special delivery unit's work to tackle waiting times; primary care services; and hospital groups. The money-follows-the-patient unit has been established; negotiations with GPs are under way and hospital groups have been established in a number of instances. Legislation is being processed to facilitate this. These are important steps on the way to creating a universal health insurance system. I am glad that the Deputy shares the Government's view. People and patients are central to all of this. The people gave us a mandate to fix the public finances and get the country working. All the big indicators are pointing in the right direction and people understand this. We must make the benefits filter down to every house throughout the country in order that people can understand what has been achieved. In the context of the health system, the patient is central. That is the focal point with regard to universal health insurance. In order to achieve this during the Government's second term, these essential building blocks must be put in place. I know that the Deputy shares my view of that concept.

#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	170	During the summer other Deputies and I were continually contacted by people who were increasingly concerned about Irish Water. There are three elements to their concerns: first, they are angry with being obliged to pay for water; second, they are worried about what they are signing up to and what the financial implications will be; and, third, they are troubled about supplying their personal public service, PPS, numbers to what is, in effect, a private company. They cannot understand the requirement to provide such a personal item of information, particularly when no other utility company requires them to do so. They are angry, which is very understandable. Their anger is based on the fact that the word "personal" is pre-eminent in the title "personal public service number". Irish Water expects people to supply willingly details of their bank accounts and PPS numbers. Essentially, such numbers act almost as a PIN code for all sorts of private information. Irish Water has claimed that it requires people's PPS numbers in order to decide what allowances they should be allocated. However, even a cursory glance at the data protection statements on PPS numbers on the company's website is enough to strike fear into any citizen.I say the word "citizen" deliberately because Irish Water keeps on referring to us as customers. The website goes into detail about how personal public service numbers will be used, among other things, for marketing and credit checking purposes. What credit checking purposes are we talking about now and, just as important, into the future? The Irish Water website goes on to say that the company can transfer all information to third parties and "By submitting data to Irish Water, the Customer agrees to this transfer, storing or processing".
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	171	A question, please.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	172	This is on the website. The company states that if the business is acquired by a third party the data will be transferred to the buyer. People - citizens - are a commodity or asset that can essentially be traded between corporations in future. Why would anyone willingly sign up to this? Is the Taoiseach comfortable about asking people - it is in legislation - to disclose such private information, potentially worldwide? That is actually what it says on the website. Will the Taoiseach amend the legislation to eliminate this and at least give people the comfort of having their personal information retained as personal information?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	173	Deputy Murphy mentioned three things, including payment for water.

We have 18,000 on boiled water notices, inferior pipework and treatment works that are the subject of concern from a European point of view.

Therefore, Irish Water is not in a position to gear up its full communications system with the people to explain the position in respect of first leaks and whether they will be fixed as well as the options and methods of payment that will be open to people and how they can do that.

Where children are involved there will be engagement with the Department of Social Protection in respect of information as to the numbers of children in any household where an allowance is given. Deputy Murphy will also be aware that arrangements are being made for an extra €100, as announced by the Minister for Social Protection, for those who receive the household benefit package. Particular arrangements will be made for people where there are children or adults who have particular medical conditions that might require the use of extensive amounts of water. In such cases they will be capped. All of that, I expect, can be clarified and dealt with in detail once the regulator makes the announcement in the next week to ten days.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	184	I do not think the Taoiseach fully understands the implications of handing over this personal information on almost the entire nation to a private company. Let me quote what Irish Water says on its website:Irish Water may disclose the Customer's data to third parties in the event that it sells or buys any business or assets...if Irish Water or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case Customer data held by it about its Customer will be one of the transferred assets.We all know that information is now an asset. I believe there are serious implications. Essentially, Irish Water is clearly defining people's personal information as an asset, its business asset. The Government has not thought this out. What information or guidance did the Government get before it put that into the legislation in respect of the consequences for people if the company is sold? The Taoiseach keeps telling us it is not going to be sold, but why is this on the website if that is not a possibility in future?

I agree with Deputy Murphy in the sense that people would be reluctant to sign up to blank cheques without knowing what they are getting.

I call on the Taoiseach to make a statement.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	192	As Taoiseach and as a colleague of the former Taoiseach and Fianna Fáil Deputy, Albert Reynolds, I wish to express my sincere condolences to his wife, Kathleen, his children, Miriam, Philip, Emer, Leonie, Abbie, Cathy and Andrea, and to his grandchildren and extended family. While his passing is a major personal loss his achievements and dedication to public service to his former constituency of Longford-Westmeath and the entire island of Ireland are outstanding. The wide range of ministerial portfolios assigned to him throughout his early political career prepared him well for his role as Taoiseach in the early 1990s. When he came to office he was not fazed by the complex challenges that confronted his Government and he proved an able negotiator at home and in Europe in getting the best outcome for our people. Albert Reynolds's role in the peace process was significant indeed. From the outset he was passionate about peace. A difficult often frustrating road lay ahead but he stayed the course and, through agreement and consent with his counterparts, he found an alternative route to bring an end to the bloodshed and violence that marred community life in Northern Ireland for a generation. He was well known for finding ways to bring people together, whether in the dance halls of rural Ireland, through music or even by connecting them with new telephone networks. Connecting people, bringing people together was his way of doing things. He showed just how vital this was in the peace process as he brought the diverse strands of political opinions together in a way that had never been done before. While he built on the work of his predecessors, he was singular in attaining what had eluded so many before him. Reflecting today on his legacy, we can truly say that his vision, dogged determination, negotiation skills and courage were pivotal in laying the foundations of lasting peace and the Good Friday Agreement. Before entering politics Albert Reynolds was a businessman of dedication and drive, the very qualities that had helped foster the social and economic climate for our country. Throughout his life, he demonstrated a great love for life, people, his wife and family, his home place of Rooskey, Longford-Westmeath and Dublin as well as for enterprise, fairness and peace. His primary focus was always his wife and family. This is what made Albert Reynolds the public servant that he was. Some days after he passed away we marked the 20th anniversary of the IRA ceasefire. While he was not there to witness it, in their grief and sorrow Kathleen and the Reynolds family can take comfort and tremendous pride in what he achieved with their support. He was indeed a man of peace. History in due course will recognise the part he played in the development of our State. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dilís.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	196	On behalf of the Labour Party, I want to express my sincere sympathies to the family of the late Albert Reynolds. I was privileged to serve in the coalition Government that Albert Reynolds and Dick Spring led together, a Fianna Fáil-Labour Government that achieved a tremendous amount in a short period. I was a new Deputy. Deputy Howlin, Deputy Stagg - no, perhaps not that one - and I served in that Government. I always found Albert to be an extremely encouraging and dynamic can-do type of person with whom to work. He set himself two objectives as Taoiseach - to make economic progress and for Ireland to be at peace. Although his time as Taoiseach was relatively brief for reasons that do not require rehashing today, it is fair to say that he made hugely significant progress on both fronts. On the economic front, that Government helped to lay the foundation for a period of sustained growth and raised living standards. Of course, it is for his contribution to the peace process that Albert will be best and rightly remembered. He was a public servant and public representative who brought an unusual amount of private sector deal-making experience to the job. That helped enormously in the peace process. As has been well documented, he was prepared to take risks to further the process when others in the same position may well have balked. The risks paid off, culminating in the signing of the Downing Street Declaration in 1993, an agreement that paved the way for multi-party talks involving all sides of the divide in the North. As one of the many women first elected to the Dáil in 1992, I have to say that it was not a particularly woman-friendly place at the time. This institution did not even have a picture of a woman gracing its halls. Albert stood out as a man who was not shy about acknowledging his devotion and commitment to his family - his wife and children, including his many daughters. This was at a time when men, particularly in the Oireachtas, did not wear their hearts on their sleeves where family and children were concerned. Those tended to be left behind at the door of Leinster House. Albert really stood out. His family - his beloved wife Kathleen and his children - came first. He was very proud of them, their achievements, their education, their careers and their glamour. He made no secret of that. I found it extremely refreshing and positive that one could be quite open about family and family commitments while the earlier generations of men serving in the Dáil then were much more discreet about their families. It was refreshing and admirable, particularly in the context of the many women who were first elected at that stage. Albert was a character. He had all of the cunning and deviousness occasionally required of politicians, but he was a very good person to work with and he was an honourable man. I regretted when, in later years, I used to meet him in the library and his memory and faculties had grown frailer and dimmer. He was not the acute person he had been when I first met him. However, I consider it an honour to have known him and a distinction and a pleasure to have worked with him. I want to express again my sincere condolences to Kathleen, the girls and his two sons.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	197	Gan amhras, is ócáid an-bhrónach í bás Albert Mac Raghnaill. I dtús báire, ba mhaith liom mo chomhbhrón a dhéanamh lena bhean, Kathleen, agus lena chlann go léir. Is léir do chách gur ceannaire agus polaiteoir den scoth a bhí ann. Bhí tionchar faoi leith aige ar chúrsaí polaitíochta na tíre seo agus, go háirithe, saol polaitíochta an oileáin ar fad. Go pearsanta, bhí sé cairdiúil, cneasta agus grámhar. Bhí muintir na tíre báúil leis. Chomh maith leis sin, bhí sé foigneach le an-chuid daoine nuair a bhuail sé leo. The sad passing of Albert Reynolds brought an end to a remarkable journey that ranged from the sweltering dance halls of Longford to the corridors of power in Leinster House and, indeed, Downing Street. His legacy across business and politics rivals that of any Irish politician of the modern era. He was a man with a mission determined to make his mark. A practical patriot, he would not allow himself to be encumbered by the hefty baggage of ideology or history in delivering real results. The determination that marked his political career was evident in his entrepreneurial life, which also flourished. He started in the inauspicious surroundings of a tuck shop emporium in Summerhill College, through to the rental market of turf plots into the world of a newspaper proprietor, a bacon producer in the Liberties and on to huge international success with C & D Pet Foods. All the while, the dance halls in rural Ireland swelled with people drawn by the talent he attracted. His hunger to get the deal done was forged in the cut and thrust of the business world. When he moved into politics in his 40s, that hunger drove him on. In the midst of the turbulent political world of the 1980s, Albert Reynolds marked himself out as a focused, result-driven Minister. He attacked his portfolios with verve and firmly stood up for the resources they needed to get the job done. His quick elevation to the rank of Minister for Posts and Telegraphs transformed an archaic telecommunications system into one of the best in Europe. It is hard for people today to comprehend how difficult it was simply to get a telephone throughout the 1980s. I recall him at his first Ard-Fheis making all sorts of commitments in that regard, which many people did not find credible at the time. He proved them wrong ultimately and delivered. In transport, he drove on the creation of the DART line, which continues to serve Dublin today. In finance, he reduced income tax, underpinned the International Financial Services Centre, IFSC, and oversaw the fledgling start of the Irish economic revival. When he was elected Taoiseach in 1992, his capacity for driving home a deal came to the fore. Amidst scathing media criticism, he emerged from the pivotal Edinburgh EU summit with £8 billion in funding, having reached agreement with his European peers. These funds would prove crucial in building up the modern national infrastructure and strengthening the long-term capacity and potential of the economy. He delicately balanced the intricate demands of the divide in Northern Ireland and built a very strong relationship with Prime Minister John Major. That relationship was the anvil upon which the historic Downing Street Declaration was hammered out. The presence of a former British Prime Minister and staunch Conservative Party MP at his funeral bears testament to the touching loyalty and friendship Albert inspired and what they achieved together in 1993. The declaration was only a means to an end in securing a peace that would enable a permanent agreement. He successfully grappled with President Clinton over securing visas to bring the IRA over the line and into a viable peace framework. The IRA ceasefire in August 1994 was a decisive moment along the road to peace on this often troubled island. The make-or-break, all-in attitude of Albert Reynolds was essential in taking the gun out of Irish politics. Ultimately, it represented the triumph of constitutional republicanism. He was a risk taker, and taking those risks certainly left a mark and made the island a better place to live. His wife Kathleen and his seven children will sorely miss a loving husband and father. His commitment to them was unwavering and the strength of his family sustained him during the darker moments of the office. In the throes of the hurly burly of high office, he remained a strong family man and I hope and I know that they will draw comfort in the knowledge of a life well lived. Hopefully, the memories will sustain them in the months and years ahead. Albert came a long way from a wet Tuesday night in Rooskey to go toe-to-toe across the negotiating table with some of the giants of modern politics. However, he always took great pride in his roots and remained deeply motivated to serving his people. His personal warmth, humility and immense generosity of spirit belied his major lasting achievements. He never forgot where he came from and his legacy means that we will never forget him. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	198	Is ceart agus is cóir go bhfuil an Dáil ag tabhairt ómóis don iar-Thaoiseach Albert Reynolds, fear a bhí lárnach sa tsíocháin ar an oileán beag seo. Tá mé ag smaoineamh fosta faoi fhear eile, Ian Paisley, a fuair bás an tseachtain seo caite. Táimid ag smaoineamh faoina theaghlach fosta. It is poignant that Albert Reynolds's funeral took place just days before the 20th anniversary of the ground-breaking IRA cessation. That decision by the IRA leadership resulted in enormous changes and had profound effects on politics in Ireland and the relationship between Ireland and Britain, but much of the work done to bring about that opportunity was carried out away from the public eye and is often now forgotten. People remember the political highs of the past two decades. We had the Good Friday Agreement, the St. Andrews Agreement, the Hillsborough agreements and the decision by the late Ian Paisley to share power with republicans and his term of office with Mr. Martin McGuinness, but none of these changes would have been brought about and the peace process would not have been advanced in the way it was without the risk-laden work undertaken by Albert Reynolds, Fr. Alex Reid and Fr. Des Wilson, Mr. John Hume, Dr. Martin Mansergh, the Sinn Féin leadership and others before the 1994 cessation, including brave citizens in civic unionism, the Protestant churches and the community sector.  The Ireland of the early 1990s was a different place. Successive Irish Governments, including the so-called constitutional republicans, worked with successive British Governments in pursuing an entirely negative agenda which merely fed the cycle of discrimination, censorship, repression, resistance and conflict. Albert brought a different approach. He was persuaded by the potential of my dialogue with Mr. John Hume and supported it when others sought to undermine it. He struck up a dialogue of his own with the then British Prime Minister, Mr. John Major, and, despite significant opposition both inside and outside the British Parliament, the Downing Street Declaration was secured. Bhí cairdeas an-mhaith idir mé féin agus Albert. Bhí sé oscailte mar dhuine. Chuir sé agus a bhean chéile, Kathleen, fearadh na fáilte romham ina dteach. Bhí siad an-fhlaithiúil agus díreach liom. Albert was a doer. He was not satisfied with dialogue without an aim, without objectives, without concrete outcomes. Is cinnte dearfach go raibh deacrachtaí eadrainn, ach bhí sé an-dáiríre faoi shíocháin a bhunú. He also knew the North much better than he was given credit for. Some of this went back to his showband days and the work he did across the Six Counties with people from both the Unionist and broadly Nationalist communities who had one thing in common, they liked dances and the showbands. Under Fr. Reid's guidance, Albert also opened up dialogue with loyalist paramilitaries and their representatives - a very significant initiative - in order that they could come to have a sense of ownership and belonging in dealing with the Taoiseach as opposed to British Ministers. It is a testament to his ability to get things done that, though one of the shortest serving Taoisigh, he achieved so much in such a short space of time. A lot of this was possible because he was an outsider. He was not part of the Fianna Fáil establishment or the Irish establishment; in fact, many of them looked down their noses at him and the same establishment was very partitionist - some policy makers remain so to this day. Albert was removed from office well before Mr. Tony Blair's election in 1997 and the inclusive all-party negotiations which he recognised were necessary but which the Major Government failed to deliver. After his retirement he remained a firm supporter of the peace process. He was of particular assistance in advising us quietly on the side on how to deal with the Irish Government of the day, including the Fianna Fáil Government. He also developed a very warm personal relationship with Mr. Martin McGuinness. He acted on the North when it was needed and, as the political process faces into more difficulties, the Taoiseach - I say this fraternally and respectfully - could do well to emulate him. The current difficulty is not, as some would put it, that the problem parties need to have their heads knocked together by the Governments. I want less British Government involvement in Irish affairs, but both Governments have responsibilities - that is what Albert Reynolds recognised. His big job was to get Mr. John Major to start thinking about Ireland in a positive way. The Irish Government has a clear responsibility to ensure the British Government lives up to these responsibilities. Ba mhaith liom comhbhrón ó chroí, ar mo shon agus ar son Shinn Féin, a dhéanamh le bean chéile Albert, Kathleen, lena leanaí agus le mórtheaghlach Reynolds. Kathleen was hugely supportive of Albert. At times Fr. Alex Reid must have driven her to distraction, but she was and remains a very sound, solid and strong woman.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	199	I offer my deepest sympathy to the late Albert Reynolds's wife, Kathleen, and all of his family. It is important that we are remembering a father, a husband and a grandfather. One could clearly see on the day of the removal and the day of the burial the warmth and love for Albert the person. The first priority must be respect and extending our warmth and sympathy to Kathleen and the family. On Albert Reynolds the politician, we live in an era in which many Ministers serve for long terms and we are told that things take time and that we have to be patient. Albert Reynolds never served for longer than three years in any role, yet he made a major impact in every ministry. He did not wait; he did not accept delays and he did not kick things down the road; he was a man of action and deeds. As Minister, he was responsible for the biggest overhaul of Ireland's telecommunications network, laying the groundwork for decades to come. He saw the introduction of bus lanes in Dublin, despite many of the authorities delaying over arguments on responsibility. He oversaw work on the Cork to Dublin gasline with his customary urgency and determination. As Taoiseach, he will always be remembered for his tough negotiating style, whether it was in the European Union, internationally or at home.  The Downing Street Declaration and the ceasefires of 1994 will remain as his outstanding achievements and greatest gift to the country. While he was a man who had strong views, he knew the people and the value of talking to people and laying aside baggage. He was not afraid to take a risk. It is easy to play it safe and look out for one's own career, but he did not do so. He took the risk and did what so many others had failed to do - he brought people to the negotiating table and earned the trust of many who were deeply suspicious of democratic politics.  Albert, as we all know, was not perfect and he never claimed to be. Whether in politics or business, he accepted that others disagreed with him. What he demanded was respect and acceptance that voters on any side were pure and he had the ability to look at all sides of an argument. Anyone who watched his funeral mass - I was present at it - could have been left in no doubt that his primary focus was his family. They were his priority. He was a father and a husband before anything else. He brought with him a sense of reality to politics. His business experience served him well and ensured he would not fall into the bubble that politics could create. There was always a life and interests outside politics for him. Perhaps his greatest legacy is that to win the respect of the people, one does not have to be eternally popular, one does not have to hold office for decades, rather one needs to be decisive and have the courage of one's own convictions. Whether one agreed or disagreed with Albert - I had a few political disagreements with him - there is no doubt that when he faced decisions, he took them and dealt with the consequences. To his wife, Kathleen, and his children, Miriam, Philip, Emer, Leonie, Abbie, Cathy and Andrea, and all of his grandchildren, I offer my sincere sympathy on behalf of the Technical Group.

I oppose the proposal that the Dáil shall rise tonight following Private Members' Business. I believe the House should sit later to discuss the horrific ordeal of the suicidal migrant rape victim who was denied an early abortion in this country over the course of the summer, which has drawn international opprobrium and has horrified ordinary people throughout this country. Amazingly, no time has been provided by the Government to discuss this case or to allow Deputies to question two Ministers who had knowledge of these events when being questioned by the United Nations during the summer. Clearly, this anti-woman law which was voted through the Dáil has failed. We need to table time to discuss when a referendum can be held to repeal the Eighth Amendment of our Constitution, which is a medieval amendment inserted into our Constitution 31 years ago.  I propose that the Dáil not rise until this matter has been discussed and until such time as the Tánaiste, in particular, who made her reputation on women's rights-----

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	209	Is the proposal for dealing with Nos. 15 and 16 agreed? Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with divisions in the House this week agreed? Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with the sitting and business of the Dáil on Friday, 3 October 2014 agreed? Agreed.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	210	It would appear from the schedule of legislation published today that the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, has won the day. The Government promised in January last to introduce the health reform Bill, whose stated aim was "to put in place the new structures for the health service as set out in Future Care and the disestablishment of the HSE". According to the new schedule, however, the Government intends to introduce only the health (general practitioner service) (No. 2) Bill and the health insurance (amendment) Bill. Where stands the health reform Bill and when can we expect it to be published? In addition, the programme for Government promises the introduction of at least nine pieces of legislation in the area of health to underpin the introduction of universal health insurance. This legislation was meant to be introduced during the lifetime of this Government. Perhaps the Taoiseach would indicate when the universal primary care Bill will be published. On universal health insurance, the programme for Government states that the legislative basis for universal health insurance will be established by the universal health insurance legislation. When can we expect that legislation to be published?  When can we expect the patient safety authority legislation to come before the House? The Taoiseach might also indicate when the legislation to give public hospitals autonomy from the HSE will be brought before the House. When will the legislation to give the HSE function of purchasing power for uninsured patients to a hospital care purchase agency and the establishment of that agency be brought before the House? A treatment purchase fund to purchase care for the uninsured over the transition period is to be established. When will the relevant legislation come before the House? According to the programme for Government, an integrated care agency is to be established. Perhaps the Taoiseach will indicate when the necessary legislation in that regard will be introduced. It is three and a half years or more since this Government was formed. All of the aforementioned legislation was promised in the programme for Government. I have asked the Taoiseach about it on previous occasions. I would appreciate if he could give me a precise answer now in regard to whether we can expect publication of this legislation during this session or beyond that, as promised by the Government. In addition, when can we expect the establishment of the commission of inquiry following the publication of the Guerin report? It is four months since the Taoiseach committed in the House to such a commission to deal with the serious allegations made in that report, which also recommended the establishment of a commission of inquiry to specifically deal with those allegations. The Taoiseach committed in the House to doing that. For some reason unknown to most people, that has not happened. I would appreciate some clarity in that regard.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	211	On the latter matter, the Minister for Justice and Equality, when ready, will bring proposals to Cabinet in respect of the terms of reference for the commission of investigation arising out of the Guerin report. A number of difficult cases were brought to my attention, some of them by the Deputy in this House, as well as others that were sent directly to GSOC and others by the Justice for All group. These have been assessed in respect of the work that may have been carried out on them and the difficulties associated with them. That work is ongoing. The Minister is anxious that there be an analysis of those cases before the making of a decision on the terms of reference for the commission of investigation. The Government has no intention of holding that up unduly. It is important to get it right, because it is a sensitive matter. The Deputy will also be aware that there is a High Court case pending in respect of a number of the findings of the Guerin report. The Deputy also asked about ten questions regarding the health area.The A list is the indicative list of Bills we expect to be published this session. In 2015 there will be two legislative sessions which will deal with a raft of other legislation.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	212	What about the health reform Bill?

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	216	What about the health reform Bill?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	217	I will respond to the Deputy on each point made and get it right. As indicated by the Minister of State, Deputy Paul Kehoe, in the three and a half years since the Government – the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government – was appointed, it has published 191 Bills.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	218	Answer the question, for God's sake.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	219	It has enacted 170.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	221	Hold on one minute; we will get to it.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	222	In the three and a half years the Fianna Fáil Government had after 2007, it published fewer than 150 Bills and passed just over 120.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	224	There has been a raft of difficult and complex legislation. The Minister for Health has set out a number of Bills to be dealt with and published in this session.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	225	Two.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	226	The Deputy should note that there are a number of other areas in which a great deal of work has occurred on Bills that are not on the A list, some of which may come through also. For now, however, the A list represents a clear statement by the Government of the Bills to be published this session, before the end of the year.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	227	This is very serious because it concerns the programme for Government. Should it not be scrapped? It is fantasy. The Government is treating the public and the Dáil with contempt. None of this is going to happen. The Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, has said it is not going to happen.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	228	Will the Deputy, please, resume his seat?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	229	The Department of Health officials said it was not going to happen. I have spent 12 months asking the Taoiseach about each of these Bills, but he keeps on talking nonsense and avoiding answering the questions. It is fantasy.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	230	I ask the Deputy to, please, resume his seat.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	231	A more honest approach would be to withdraw the part of the programme for Government on health, as there is no substance to it.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	232	The Deputy has had his say.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	233	The Taoiseach should be honest with the people. It is a fantasy. In January he said he would deal with the health reform Bill. It is now September.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	234	I ask the Deputy to, please, respect the chair.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	235	In July we published a revised statement for the remaining period of the Government.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	236	It is a joke. That is why the Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, said what he said.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	237	There are 94 issues therein that have now been-----
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	238	We will deal with all of that later.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	239	Maidir le Riar na hOibre, ba mhaith liom dhá rud a ardú - an Garda Síochána (Amendment) Bill agus an Water Services (Exempt Charges) Bill. Tá an Rialtas seo tiomanta do reachtaíocht a thabhairt isteach chun Údarás Garda Síochána neamhspleách a bhunú. Regarding the Garda Síochána (Amendment) Bill, the Garda Inspectorate, in its 2014 report, recommended that all petitions for the cancellation of penalty points be handled centrally by the fixed charge processing office in Thurles. That was the only point of authority in regard to penalty points. The latest revelations suggest the recommendation has not been implemented. Therefore, will the Government now move to ensure the recommendations of the Garda Inspectorate are fully implemented? On the Water Services (Exempt Charges) Bill, Sinn Féin is against water charges, as the Taoiseach knows, but I will not deal with that issue today. However, there is a basic unfairness in charging people for water they cannot drink. Therefore, will the Taoiseach consider providing for an exemption in the Bill for affected citizens?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	240	We cannot discuss the content of the legislation, just its publication.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	241	The Water Services (Exempt Charges) Bill, a Private Members' Bill, is listed for discussion this evening. I have already answered the question on the flexibility that currently is available. I have indicated to the Deputy that the regulator has already made comments in the draft statement where boil water notices or undrinkable or contaminated water is concerned. Did the Deputy mention the Garda authority?
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	242	Yes, the Taoiseach was talking to the Tánaiste at the time.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	243	Obviously, a great deal of work has been done on this issue. The legislation is not on the A list, but I expect that it will come in before the end of the year.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	244	The question was on the recommendations of the Garda Inspectorate that do not appear to have been acted on. Will the Government ensure they will be acted on?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	245	I expect the Minister will respond to that question. I gave detail on the implementation of the recommendations in the inspector's report.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	246	I want to raise an issue concerning Standing Orders. There appears to be a change to Standing Order 120. It means that the Technical Group will be expanded. I acknowledge the point the Ceann Comhairle makes on the importance of respecting the mandate of everybody elected-----
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	247	Let me interrupt the Deputy. There is to be no change to Standing Order 120. I wrote to the Deputy this afternoon. I hope she received the letter before she came into the House.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	248	I did.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	249	It explains the exact position. The Chair has no role in the matter.
#JohnHalligan	unknown-#JohnHalligan-party	unknown-#JohnHalligan-dob	unknown-#JohnHalligan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	250	That is the direct opposite of what the Ceann Comhairle told us last year.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	251	I did not tell the Deputy anything of the sort.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	252	I have it here.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	253	We have a recording.
#JohnHalligan	unknown-#JohnHalligan-party	unknown-#JohnHalligan-dob	unknown-#JohnHalligan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	254	We have a recording of it.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	255	This is not the place in which to raise the issue.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	256	This has to be the place in which to raise it.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	257	If the Deputy comes to my office afterwards, I will be only too pleased to speak to her. It will be no problem.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	258	This has to be the place in which to raise it.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	259	The Committee on Procedure and Privileges is the place in which to raise it, not here.
#JohnHalligan	unknown-#JohnHalligan-party	unknown-#JohnHalligan-dob	unknown-#JohnHalligan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	260	The Chair did not have the courtesy to tell us that in the first place.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	261	If Deputy Catherine Murphy wishes to come to my office, I will deal with it. However, as far as I am concerned, what appeared in the newspapers today was totally and utterly incorrect. First, I had no hand, act or part in two new Members applying for membership of the Technical Group; that is not my role. The Standing Order sets out how a technical group can or cannot be formed. Any change is a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges; it is then a matter for the Dáil to decide on.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	262	Therefore, there has been no change.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	263	There has been no change.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	264	I will take up the invitation to go to the Ceann Comhairle's office afterwards.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	265	Certainly.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	267	What legislation is the Deputy talking about?
#MichaelHealyRae	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-party	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-dob	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	268	The local government (miscellaneous provisions) Bill.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	269	When is the local government (miscellaneous provisions) Bill being dealt with?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	270	There is no legislation in that regard, but this is a question of realigning services to deliver a better service. Obviously, the Minister of State with direct responsibility for rural development has been appointed. I am quite sure the Minister of State, Deputy Ann Phelan, and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government will have a particular focus on this issue.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	271	On promised legislation, is it intended to bring the sale of loan books to unregulated third parties Bill which it has been promised will have priority before the House at the earliest possible opportunity in view of the necessity to ensure sales to unregulated third parties will take cognisance of the need to recognise the rights of the individuals affected?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	272	That is down for this session. It is an important matter.
#DerekKeating	unknown-#DerekKeating-party	unknown-#DerekKeating-dob	unknown-#DerekKeating-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	273	What is the current status of the spent convictions legislation, an issue I have raised before? It sets out to deal with what are often very minor misdemeanours in which people might have engaged a very long time ago but which can have consequences today when travelling, etc.?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	274	I will revert to the Deputy on that issue. The Bill is awaiting Report Stage and there were a number of amendments being considered during the course of the summer. I will advise the Deputy on the current state of play.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	275	Before the former Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Mr. Phil Hogan, left office, he indicated that legislation might be needed under the planning and development code to change how events licensing was handled. The recent Garth Brooks concerts fiasco has shown that the system in place is not fit for purpose. Will the Taoiseach outline if legislation is being considered? Has it even been considered or discussed by the Cabinet? Has the new Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, picked up on it?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	276	The Garth Brooks non-concert is an issue the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government is examining; he has already commented publicly on it. I will update the Deputy on the work that is under way.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	277	Is there legislation being considered?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	278	There will have to be, yes.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	279	I have a number of issues to raise with the Taoiseach. The legislative programme lists the redress for women who were in certain institutions Bill.That refers to the Magdalen women, of course. Can the Taoiseach give a date for the introduction of that legislation? Will he also say when we will see the terms of reference for the commission of inquiry into mother and baby homes? As he is aware, we were due to see them before the recess, but they did not materialise, and there has now been a change of Minister. Everybody concerned, including the victims, survivors and their advocacy groups, has urged that the terms of reference be inclusive and that the Government get them right. When will the terms of reference be available? Will the Taoiseach give an assurance that he has listened to all of the concerned voices? Finally, I have raised on a number of occasions the overdue Government responses to, and the Dáil debates on, Constitutional Convention reports. The Taoiseach made much of the establishment of the convention. Tom Arnold stewarded the process with great effort and citizens partook in the debates and took decisions. Why is the Taoiseach dragging his heels on these matters? The Constitutional Convention's fourth report on Dáil electoral reform, for example-----
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	280	The Deputy cannot go into detail.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	281	I am just citing this example.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	282	Many other Deputies wish to speak and there are only nine minutes left.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	283	That report was due last December. The Taoiseach is dragging his heels on the outstanding six reports and six debates. It is an insult to the people who took part and does no justice to the issues raised when the Taoiseach drags his heels in this way. When will we receive the reports and have the debates? When will there be referendums on the issues concerned, not least in respect of votes for the many thousands of citizens who are emigrants living overseas?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	284	The Deputy met some of them recently.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	285	I did. They were asking for the Taoiseach.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	286	They seem to have paid for the Deputy's trip as well.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	287	We paid for it.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	288	Two of the reports are ready to go, and the Whip will update the Deputy after a meeting he is due to have this evening on when the debates can be held in the House. It is for the Government to decide on what referendums will be held. A number of referendums are to be held next year. Obviously, the reports of the Constitutional Convention are important. They are the citizens' views and they deserve discussion in the House. A number of the reports were delayed because of clarifications and discussions relative to Departments arising from the recommendations made by the Constitutional Convention. It is not a case of deliberately wishing to drag heels in this regard. The Whip will report to the Deputy later. In respect of redress for women in certain institutions, the Department of Social Protection has already commenced payment in many of these areas. The interdepartmental committee on this produced a very detailed report for the Minister. The details of that interdepartmental report are being worked on currently.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	289	What about the mother and baby home inquiry?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	290	That is the interdepartmental report.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	291	I am seeking the terms of reference for the commission of inquiry into mother and baby homes.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	292	The Deputy cannot have them because they are not ready yet. There is a very detailed report on what is known about all of this. That must be assessed.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	293	We were led to understand that work had-----
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	294	That must be assessed properly before one can define terms of reference. The Deputy is aware of that.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	295	I call Deputy Sean Fleming.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	296	Dragging heels again.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	297	Over a year ago, the Taoiseach personally promised what he called a game-changer approach in terms of legislation for the retrospective recapitalisation of Irish banks. Will he introduce legislation to deal with the retrospective recapitalisation? Some legislation is promised on this, but will it deal with the public commitment the Taoiseach gave and which he called a game changer? Second, the Government has agreed to introduce legislation regarding the sale of loan books and family home mortgages by regulated financial institutions to unregulated financial institutions. Will the Taoiseach wait until all the loan books have been sold before the legislation is put in place, or will the legislation be passed as a matter of urgency, even though it is too late for some of them?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	298	A number of loan books have been sold and those who have bought them are voluntarily complying with the Central Bank's code of conduct. In respect of recapitalisation, the decision was made by the European Council in 2012. A number of discussions and detailed negotiations have taken place to put all the pieces of the jigsaw together. The option is open to the Government to consider this towards the end of this year. The supervisory mechanism and the other elements of that have now been put in place, principally driven by Ireland as the country that was mainly the focus in this regard. That work proceeded during the early part of this year and is now practically complete. The Government will consider towards the end of the year whether it wishes to pursue its claim in that regard. It is an option that remains on the table. I would have thought the Deputy would have welcomed the decision arrived at by ECOFIN and the Eurogroup in respect of approval for Ireland to buy out IMF loans that were borrowed at much higher interest rates than we can currently secure on borrowings. The process is that the individual parliaments give their approval, and we hope that will be forthcoming following the agreement of ECOFIN and the Eurogroup. It is very much in the interest of our country.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	299	I call Deputy O'Dea.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	300	So what the Taoiseach described as a game changer regarding retrospective recapitalisation has now been relegated by the Government to an option for consideration?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	301	Sorry, Deputy; we are not having a debate on this.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	302	It was a game changer two years ago and now it is only an option for consideration.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	303	The Taoiseach should not reply. We are not having a debate on this issue. I call Deputy O'Dea.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	304	I think the Taoiseach was trying to explain to the House-----
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	305	With the greatest respect to the Taoiseach and you, Deputy, this is the Order of Business and it is my duty to continue. We only have four minutes left and four other Deputies wish to contribute.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	306	The Fine Gael and Labour Party programme for Government states that a system of universal health insurance will be introduced by 2016. It could not be more definitive. The health reform Bill was an essential part of the process to put that system in place. That Bill was on the A list of the legislative programme in the last session, but it has now been removed from that list. When does the Taoiseach expect the health reform Bill to be published?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	307	I will not indicate a date for it. As I have already said, the necessary foundations of the hospital groups, the money follows the patient principle, primary care and other such areas are of absolute priority for the Minister-----

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	310	The Taoiseach is engaged in unreconstructed waffle.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	311	That is the situation.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	313	I should point out to Deputy Fleming that we invested €4 billion in Bank of Ireland and we have taken back €6 billion. We still own 15% of it.

#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	316	Before the recess, many Members on this side of the House appealed to the Government to take urgent action to deal with the housing and homelessness crisis. Indeed, some of us protested about the summer recess taking place before this issue was addressed. The Taoiseach promised that the Government would come forward with measures to deal with it. Over the summer the situation has deteriorated substantially.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	317	To what legislation is the Deputy referring? There are two minutes left and four Deputies wish to contribute.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	323	We are not dealing with social housing; we are dealing with legislation.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	324	When will the strategy document be published? Will we get ample time to discuss it properly in the House? Is legislation planned on foot of that, particularly to deal with what appear to be the Government's plans for long-term leasing arrangements with the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, and big property developers?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	325	The Minister has responded in some detail already-----

That takes a certain amount of time. The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has clarified this.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	328	He has not said when.

#PeterFitzpatrick	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-party	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-dob	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	333	It is very important that every child receives a school place. When can we expect the publication of the education (admission to school) Bill which is to make the admission process more inclusive and equitable? The framework also proposes a mechanism to ensure that every child receives a place.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	338	I respectfully suggest to the Deputy that she could usefully put in a Topical Issue on that. It is a matter of concern to the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance. While it is obviously difficult to make regulations that cover what goes on, it is a source of concern and interest.
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	339	Will the Taoiseach consider making a statement on the international humanitarian crisis in Iraq - the ISIS crisis?

The second is in connection with what was in the discussions in the last few weeks regarding the re-financing of IMF loans, which are part of the troika bailout loans. The counterbalance to that-----

#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	349	It means that any interest on the re-financing of IMF loans will be severely reduced.

#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	355	I had a few simple questions on one page but it took seven weeks and the reply only came to me yesterday. That is not good enough.
#JohnHalligan	unknown-#JohnHalligan-party	unknown-#JohnHalligan-dob	unknown-#JohnHalligan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	356	A number of commitments have been made by both Fine Gael and Labour in regard to the excessive alcohol abuse in this country. A number of analyses by various groups in Ireland have come to the fore in recent months indicating that we are apparently at critical levels compared to Europe.

Does the Taoiseach accept we need a constructive debate in this House on what has been happening to Irish youth, the effect this is having on the economy and the effect on the health of the nation?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	359	What is the position of the Bill?

Obviously, the Governor of the Central Bank is well able to speak for himself.

They will both now play a real and important role in terms of the representation of our country in the European Parliament over the coming five-year period and also in terms of the future direction of Europe in a broader sense throughout that time. I wish them both every success as they continue their important work in Brussels. The House will be aware that this Government reformed the Electoral Act 2011 by providing that a by-election must take place within six months of a vacancy arising. Accordingly, we have now decided to move the writs so the people of these two constituencies can be fully represented in the Dáil once again, and we propose a polling date of Friday, 10 October. The Fine Gael Party is proud to put forward two excellent female candidates, Senator Cáit Keane in Dublin South-West and Councillor Maura Hopkins in Roscommon-South Leitrim. I know that both candidates are ably qualified to represent the needs and interests of each constituency, if elected to do so by the people. It is inevitable that, throughout the course of these by-elections, debate will once again centre on the state of the country and the role being played by the Government in terms of the future direction of our country. I am glad to report that the extensive plan we have been implementing for economic recovery is working and our country is now moving in the right direction. There are increasing signs of revival in the economy and it is our priority now to make sure that those who have not yet felt the benefits of recovery can begin to do so. Thanks to the Government's plan, our economy is now one of the fastest growing in Europe and we remain absolutely focused on securing this recovery by continuing to prioritise job creation and investment. The Central Statistics Office has reported that 70,000 additional jobs have been created since we launched our Action Plan for Jobs. Long-term unemployment and youth unemployment are starting to fall. Consequently, the overriding objective of the upcoming budget will be to secure this recovery by introducing measures to incentivise new jobs, more work and more investment, while keeping a firm hand on the national finances to avoid any reversal of recent hard-won progress. The Government will, therefore, ensure that the progress we have made to date will not be jeopardised and that the people can trust the Government to make the necessary decisions to continue to build a strong economy that will provide quality jobs for our people, which is, after all, our ultimate aim.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	368	The two by-elections in Roscommon-South Leitrim and Dublin South-West are taking place as a result of the departure of two Members of the Dáil to the European Parliament following the elections of 23 May. This Government reformed the Electoral Act 2011 to provide that a by-election must take place within six months of a vacancy arising. Therefore, it is appropriate that, on our first day back in Dáil Éireann following the summer recess, we move as quickly as possible to fill the two vacancies. The people in both constituencies deserve the opportunity to return to their full quota of representatives in Dáil Éireann as soon as they can. I welcome the fact that these elections will be held on Friday, 10 October, and I look forward to both campaigns. The two by-elections will take place at a time of cautious optimism about the country's future. As a result of the work undertaken by the Government, and the willingness of the people to stay the course through an immensely difficult process, we now have strong economic and employment growth. Retail sales are up, tax revenues are ahead of target and there are 75,000 more people at work since the depths of the crisis in 2012. We are on a long journey out of the dark times that befell the country and we are coming to a better future, but we are not there yet. The Government still has work to do and the upcoming budget will be an important part of cementing the recovery. These by-elections will take place a matter of days before that budget. I have said repeatedly over recent days that while we hope this budget will be start of a process of gradually restoring prosperity, that can only be achieved over a series of budgets and not in one fell swoop.Nonetheless, I believe people can see we are firmly on the right track and can see the signs of recovery slowly but surely spreading to their communities. While Dublin South-West and Roscommon-South Leitrim are contrasting urban and rural constituencies, many of the issues that concern the families living there are the same - getting and holding onto a good job, sending children to good schools and seeing their communities flourish. On each of these, the Labour Party is delivering.Our number one priority is job creation, getting people off the live register and boosting employment through capital investments. To make sure that standards are maintained, we are establishing a low pay commission to recommend on the appropriate level of the minimum wage. We are driving capital investment in schools to ensure children have the facilities in which to thrive, succeed and reach their potential and we are investing in the provision of homes to rebuild communities in urban and rural Ireland. Our two candidates in these by-elections - Councillor Pamela Kearns in Dublin South-West and Senator John Kelly in Roscommon-South Leitrim - are both excellent and hardworking public representatives. They are both deeply committed to their communities and have a track record of working on issues to improve people's lives. They will each make outstanding representatives for their constituencies in Dáil Éireann, and contribute to the continuing recovery of our country.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	369	I welcome the calling of these by-elections. I have no doubt that they will mark another wake-up call for a Government which is more and more out of touch with the reality faced everyday by families throughout this country. From its first moments in office, this has been a Government obsessed with putting spin ahead of substance. Fundamental election promises were abandoned overnight and it began a permanent public relations campaign. It is almost three years since the Taoiseach went on the airwaves to declare that his Government had saved us all. It is even longer since the Labour Party started making speeches about how it was delivering fairness in everything. In the gap between the rhetoric and the reality, what has emerged is a two-tiered recovery – where some are doing well because of the improved international situation but many are being left behind. The only decisive shift in policy which came in with Fine Gael and Labour in 2011 was a shift to more regressive policies. They are policies which have hit struggling families and communities the hardest, policies which have piled up charge upon charge with no consideration for the ability to pay and policies which have undermined services and brought chaos to too many vital sectors. Every single independent study, national or international, has confirmed that the more difficulty a person has in paying their bills, the harder this Government has hit them.  Yesterday, we had what may be the 50th front-page headline of the year proclaiming that relief is on the way for hard-pressed families. This was greeted with weary derision throughout the country. With the property tax, water charges and other bills landing in their homes, hard-pressed families know that this is nothing but an exercise in trying to take them for fools. In Roscommon-South Leitrim and Dublin South-West, we have communities which have felt the impact of Government policies even more than others. In 2011, these constituencies believed Fine Gael and Labour's promises and gave them seven out of a possible nine seats. Instead of getting the democratic revolution or the long list of actions they were promised, they got a record of neglect locally combined with national policies which have hit them disproportionately. In these by-elections, Fianna Fáil is fielding two first-class candidates - Councillor Ivan Connaughton and Councillor John Lahart - who will offer a different approach. Rooted in their communities, they share a commitment to standing against deeply unfair Government policies, standing up for essential local services and being strong advocates for their communities and regions. In the past few weeks, I have been able to visit many parts of both constituencies. I am very grateful for the warm welcome which I have received and the time which people have been willing to spend with me talking about the issues which concern them. I hope the Taoiseach and his Ministers will find the time to do more than a few photo opportunities during these elections because if they do, they will find that their complacent picture of the economy and of the impact of their policies is detached from reality. In Roscommon-South Leitrim, people are already being bombarded with Government material claiming to have delivered all sorts of progress. The facts show a part of the country that has been particularly badly hit by a combination of neglect and damaging policies. I have been on the doorsteps with Ivan Connaughton across Leitrim and Roscommon. People feel neglected. They feel this Government has left them behind. That is the genuine view on the ground in these areas - whether it is the paucity of IDA visits, the lack of broadband capability or the lack of an overall vision for rural Ireland in those counties. That is their sense of it.

I am being interrupted. The Taoiseach, who is developing a record for his lack of candour on health, first denied that there had been any promise. This fell apart when a journalist produced a tape of him making the promise. From the day he made the promise to the day he broke it, the fiscal situation of the country had not changed – a fact confirmed by his own Ministers. The Taoiseach himself said closing the accident and emergency services was not intended to save any money. This cynical breach of faith with the people of Roscommon is still a raw issue but it is increasingly one among many. There are thousands of families whose homes are piped with water they cannot drink yet now they are being asked to pay for that water. When they hear from a senior Fine Gael Minister that they are being "supplied with Ballygowan standard water", they are rightly angry. Families with young children are still being told that their children will be covered by a free allowance but the final figures show that a child will only have free water if they have one shower a week and go to the toilet once a day.

It is also important to note that it is thank to the court case taken by Deputy Pearse Doherty that Governments can no longer drag out or delay indefinitely the holding of by-elections. When he took the case, the Fianna Fáil-led Government had dragged its feet for 18 months and denied the people of Donegal South-West their opportunity to be fully represented. That can no longer happen. Go raibh míle maith ag an Teachta. We welcome the opportunity to meet people during the forthcoming by-election campaigns but we meet them all the time and not just during campaigns. Voters in Dublin South-West and Roscommon-South Leitrim will face an important choice between the failed policies and politics of austerity of the past implemented by Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Labour Party and their cosy consensus for cuts and the alternative offered by Sinn Féin, the only all-Ireland party with core republican values in these by-elections. It is a choice between the politics of those who see ordinary working people as an easy target and a party that stands with citizens dependent on public services who are trying to improve their standard of living. It is also a choice between those who will stand for peace in Ireland and globally and the shameful stance of the Government in its refusal to support peace in the Middle East and to stand with the people of Gaza over the summer when they came under a huge onslaught by the Israeli Defence Forces. Tá rogha ann sna fothoghcháin seo idir chothrom na Féinne agus an éagóir. Voters in Dublin South-West and Roscommon-South Leitrim have been let down by the Government and most see little or no sign of the recovery that Fine Gael and the Labour Party have been boasting about. They are trying to cope with crumbling health services. The issue of Roscommon hospital is one that people there rightly feel strongly about.

The water is not even fit to drink in Roscommon. They are trying to cope with unacceptably high levels of unemployment and the scandal of mass emigration. The Government should think about the deep damage that is being done to communities and families and our sense of ourselves. Almost 500,000 people have left the State over the past eight years. Only Sinn Féin candidates, if elected, will be part of a strong and growing party in the House and in the North voting against unfair cuts and austerity budgets, committed to the abolition of the property tax, opposing water charges, defending our public services and building peace and the political processes on this island. I will ask voters in Dublin South-West and Roscommon-South Leitrim to vote to make the change and to vote for Cathal King and Martin Kenny. They are both long-standing councillors who are deeply rooted in their communities. They are republican activists of great quality who are totally committed to what our party is trying to do across the island. We will seek a mandate for budget resources to be targeted at job creation, stimulating economic growth across all the regions and ending the scourge of mass emigration. We will also seek a mandate for the adoption of a housing policy, which delivers the necessary social housing stock to meet the needs of those languishing on waiting lists. We will continue our opposition to further cuts in the health budget. I was in Roscommon, a beautiful part of the country, in the past two weeks and we will defend rural communities and rural dwellers. We will seek a mandate for radical political and institutional reform which addresses the lack of accountability and transparency within the Oireachtas, Departments and in the policing and justice system. We will argue for increased funding for mental health provision and the resolution of the Government's continuing medical card debacle. We will also - and this is acutely important - seek the strengthening of the peace process and a united Ireland. Sinn Féin's platform is for a clear, workable and fair alternative to the way the Government is doing business and for a fair recovery, which benefits all citizens. We will also fight these campaigns to win and to bring another two Sinn Féin Deputies to join our Oireachtas team if that is the wish of the electorate in these constituencies.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	399	On behalf of the People Before Profit Alliance, the by-elections offer a welcome opportunity to puncture the bubble of self-congratulation and the stream of bogus claims of success by the Government over recent weeks. They also offer an important opportunity to get away from a nauseating media obsession with personality spats and internal factional disputes and manoeuvrings in the main parties. These personality and ego-based disputes are going on in Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Fianna Fáil and they are totally devoid of any talk of policy or substance. The by-elections will give voters an opportunity to remind Members and the media what are the issues that matter and that are affecting them and to cut through the nonsense about supposed economic recovery because the truth in Roscommon, Tallaght and Templeogue is people are suffering continuing, and soon to worsen, financial hardship as a result of water charges, the full year effect of property tax, the universal social charge, cuts to public services, which are destroying the health service and a housing crisis of unprecedented proportions about which the Government is showing no urgency to address. I am proud that we have a candidate, Nicky Coules, who was recently elected a councillor in Tallaght. He has been a plumber all his life and he has lived for 32 years in Jobstown, one of the areas most blighted by unemployment and poverty and the impact of cuts by this and the previous Government. As a plumber, he knows well that we need to fix the pipes rather than charge people for the trickle of water that comes out of them and the impact of the disastrous policies of austerity on working class communities. He knows that we should put people like him back to work building social housing, primary care centres that were promised but not delivered, schools, other vital infrastructure, fixing the water pipes that could aid economic rather than engaging in spin and false promises. I look very much forward to the by-elections. We will also give a preference to another campaigner and fighter in Dublin South-West, Paul Murphy of the Socialist Party.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	400	The people of Dublin South-West and Roscommon-South Leitrim have a unique opportunity in the by-elections on 10 October to take a massive political cudgel to the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government. Now that these parties seem to have forgotten already the trenchant lesson the people delivered to them in the local and European elections on 23 May, the voters in these by-elections should use that cudgel to clobber them back into an awareness of the harsh reality of life experienced by ordinary men, women, households and families as a result of the savage ongoing austerity implemented by them. The people of Dublin South-West and Roscommon-South Leitrim have the opportunity especially to expose and deconstruct the massive hypocrisy of the Labour Party whose leader, the Tánaiste, had the sheer neck to declare last week that the budget in October would bring austerity to a close and was afforded by The Irish Times yet another soft headline in which she promoted herself as a chief denier of austerity by the Government. She has the audacity to declare that austerity will end the very week one of the newest and most vicious austerity attacks - water charges - kicks in. Irish Water says it will cost a family of four €500 a year.However, Irish Water has significantly underestimated people's normal water usage, and I am not talking about waste. Households of five, four and six will face bills approaching €1,000. This is the reality of the new austerity attack. Paul Murphy is the Anti-Austerity Alliance candidate in the Dublin South-West by-election. He is a member of the Socialist Party, which will enthusiastically work alongside Anti-Austerity Alliance activists to enable him to win the seat, as did Deputy Coppinger in the Dublin West by-election, thanks to the people there. Paul Murphy and the Anti-Austerity Alliance stand for a mass campaign to boycott the water charge, an unjust and unfair bankers' and bondholders' tax to continue the bailout. A mass boycott and mass campaign by the ordinary people, not just in Dublin West but the country generally, against this new and unjust imposition can and will force the Government to abolish it. In 1996, a mass campaign of people power and a by-election in Dublin West built on a boycott brought home to the Government of the day, also Fine Gael and the Labour Party, how hated the tax was and forced the Government to abolish it. Other critical issues, such as the housing misery of so many people must be raised.

In these by-elections the people can deliver to the Government a serious lesson that will force it to realise what people endure.

#MichaelMcNamara	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-party	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	402	Before we finished last time, I welcomed the Minister of State's considerable efforts in bringing the Bill before the House. While the Bill has many positive attributes, I expressed concern on Committee Stage about the compensation requirements. When we were originally on Committee Stage, I questioned whether a compensation clause was required for forest owners who were refused a felling licence. There is a compensation regime in all jurisdictions of the UK. There is one in the English Forestry Act and a simple compensation regime was introduced in Northern Ireland when its forestry Act was introduced in 2010. It was not brought in because the Northern Ireland Executive particularly wanted to compensate forestry owners, but because it felt there was a legal requirement to do so, arising from the UK Human Rights Act, which incorporated the European Convention on Human Rights, ECHR, and the property rights guaranteed in it into UK law. We have a similar incorporation measure here, the European Convention on Human Rights Act. Therefore, I was initially perplexed on Committee Stage about how something could be a requirement to comply with the ECHR in Northern Ireland but not here. The Minister of State said the legal advice he received had changed, and this is of concern to me. The law did not change, nor did the ECHR or the Irish Constitution, and there were no Supreme Court cases interpreting this aspect of the Constitution. While I accept that the legal advice changed, I do not know how it could have. If it was wrong the first time, is it right now? If it was right then, is it wrong now? If it was wrong then, is it still wrong now? The legal advice was that compensation was required, and I commend the Minister of State on introducing it. I commend him on going to the trouble of following up on what I asked him to do, and finding out that a compensation provision was required. However, I am concerned that the compensation provision is a compensation provision in name only because there are so many exclusions in that no Deputy could have any illusions that anybody will ever be compensated under it. If a compensation provision is required, surely a compensation provision which can and will never result in compensation being paid could not possibly meet the requirement. For all those reasons, I have personal doubts as to whether this Bill is constitutional. I accept that the Minister of State's legal advice is that it is, and I accept the separation of powers, which was in the news earlier this week. It is not for this House to decide what is and is not constitutional. Only the Supreme Court can do so. However, the House should be cognisant of previous decisions by the Supreme Court when it outlined the contours of private property protections. Pursuant to Article 26 of the Constitution, the Supreme Court has found that Bills which came from this House, namely the Employment Equality Bill 1996 and the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Bill 1981, were unconstitutional because they transferred a benefit which would accrue to one group in society to another.In the case of the Employment Equality Bill, it was the cost of providing places of employment which were accessible to persons with disabilities and in the case of the Private Rent Restrictions Bill the issue was restricted rents. I fear the Forestry Bill does something similar. We all agree that the environment and water quality must be protected and that these are issues of the common good. However, if a decision is made for certain reasons, a person will not be compensated. While we all accept that the reasons set out are valid ones for restricting people, the issue is why the costs of that should be borne exclusively and entirely by the private forestry owner, particularly where that private property owner has obtained permission from the State to plant the forest in the first place. I have reservations about the Bill and its compliance with the protections for private property in the Constitution. It is for the Supreme Court not for me to decide that. The President may or may not see fit to refer the Bill. It is his prerogative which he exercises on the advice of the Council of State free of any interference from anybody in this House. My concern regarding the constitutionality of the Bill does not relate to the above-mentioned provision only, although it is the primary issue. Section 14 empowers the Minister to remove or destroy vegetation on land which is unoccupied or where the owner fails to comply with a notice to remove it and the Minister is satisfied that the vegetation poses a fire risk to a forest in the vicinity. Again, there is no compensation requirement for the owner of the adjacent lands. There was a case in the 1980s - ESB v. Gormley - in which the Supreme Court found that parts of the Electricity (Supply) Act 1927 providing for a way leave for the ESB to enter across lands to erect structures were unconstitutional. While the court indicated specifically that the right to enter onto lands and lop trees or cut vegetation was not an unreasonable restriction and was constitutional, the Act included a right to compensation. Owners of lands the ESB enters to cut trees or remove vegetation can apply for compensation. Section 14 includes no right to apply for compensation where the Minister empowers somebody to enter onto lands to cut vegetation. I cannot put the matter any further except to say, going back to the idea of the separation of powers, that if the Bill were referred to the Supreme Court, it would exercise curial deference. It would consider that the Oireachtas knows best and that the Members have debated the matter. Within certain limits, there is a deference to the Oireachtas. The court will say that the Oireachtas considers the Bill will promote forestry. However, we have not discussed how it promotes forestry to introduce a provision whereby a person who applies for a permit to plant lands can be told 50, 60 or 100 years later, the Minister having carried out whatever tests he or she wants, that we have changed our minds, the trees cannot be harvested and we are not providing compensation. It could be 200 years in the case of an oak forest. While I can see how that might benefit the environment and water quality, I cannot see how it will encourage private persons, corporations, companies and trust funds to engage in forestry. I cannot see how it is for the good of forestry that someone who is granted a permit to plant a crop on his or her land does not have the certainty of compensation in the event of being refused a felling licence. They have that certainty in Northern Ireland because the legislature there felt it was legally necessary to comply with the European Convention on Human Rights, or ECHR. They have it in the UK, where it was introduced in 1967. There was no issue of doing it to comply with the ECHR in that case but they may be particularly attached to private property rights in the House of Commons. The Bill before the House does not contain such a provision and for that reason I have concerns about its constitutionality.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	403	Deputy McNamara spoke at length about his concerns that the restriction on the payment of compensation within the Bill will severely limit the instances where payments of compensation will be made. While it is true that the instances will be limited, the provision must be viewed in the context of ensuring the common good is served at all times. The circumstances in which compensation will not be payable will broadly include circumstances where the grant of a licence would negatively impact on the environment, good forest practice, public health or safety, protection from flooding or preservation of water quality or where the application was either inadequate or incomplete. Any application for compensation as a consequence of the refusal of a licence will be considered having regard to the individual circumstances of the case and whether one or more of the above-mentioned criteria is applicable. Greater detail will be included in the regulation that follows the Bill. In essence, a licence will not be refused without good reason. My Department will endeavour to work with landowners to explore all possible options before considering outright refusal which will always be a last resort. As Deputy McNamara is questioning the constitutionality of the provision, I reiterate that it follows consideration of legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General arising from questions raised by the Deputy. I obtained the advice on Committee Stage and followed it through.

I hope the Minister of State will take the amendment on board. We argued it on Committee Stage.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	413	I will discuss amendments Nos. 42, 48 to 50, inclusive, 50a, 51, 52, 52a, 52b and 53 together.The issue of timelines and the issuing of felling licences was raised on Committee Stage and in my discussions with representatives of the industry and growers. I have made a significant change to the Bill by placing an objective timeline of four months for the issuing of felling licences. In some cases, licences will be issued within a shorter timeframe. I propose further amendments to this provision, which I will outline shortly. The Deputies' amendments seek a range of timelines. Given the detailed processes and consultation involved in the processing of a felling licence, this is unrealistic and the amendments cannot be accepted. In assessing applications for felling licences, my Department must take cognisance of the fact that forest harvesting operations and associated activities have the potential to impact significantly on protected habitats, archaeological monuments, water quality and important landscapes. Consequently, before a felling licence can be granted, my Department must consult with a range of agencies, including the National Parks and Wildlife Service, local authorities, National Monuments Service, and the Inland Fisheries Ireland in order to assess the potential impacts that may arise from the harvesting activity. It should also be borne in mind that a single felling licence application can cover a very large land area, incorporating several rivers, lakes and designated nature conservation sites such as SACs, SPAs and NHAs. It takes time to assess the possible impact of forest harvesting operations over such large areas. It must be acknowledged that I have made a significant change to the existing Bill by aiming to have felling licence decisions within four months. I assure the Deputy that progress against this target will be monitored and it will be clear to all how many licences are being issued. I also propose to further refine the section by introducing further deadlines within which certain specific actions must be taken. The purpose of amendments Nos. 52a and 52b is to ensure the applicant is given some degree of certainty as to when the application will be processed and to ensure the applicant is kept informed about issues that may affect the completion of the processing of the application. I also include a new provision, in amendment No. 50a, which provides for the publication of decisions made in respect of licence applications. This practice is already in place for approvals of applications for forests and for forest roadworks, where decisions are published on the Department's website. The purpose of the provision is to further improve access for the public to forestry information.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	414	I was fascinated by the answer of the Minister of State. If I apply for planning permission tomorrow, statutory timelines apply and they must deal with everything mentioned by the Minister of State, including SACs, SPAs, the IFI and the National Parks and Wildlife Service. There is a tendency in this country when someone gets a file in an agency to throw it down and leave it if there is no timeline required. It is left until someone goes crazy and insists on getting an answer. Every Deputy knows that our offices are clogged with cases of people coming to us to say they cannot get an answer. There is no reason to believe the decision the Minister of State will make is any more complex, or half as complex, as many planning decisions. We are talking about a simpler operation. If an application is made, it is easy to insert in the Bill that it is presumed the Forest Service or the IFI has no questions if it does not reply within a fortnight. This will mean that agencies are not allowed to drag their feet while we wait for the slowest player. When I was a Minister, I started a process that insisted on every section returning replies to representations made to the ministerial offices within a fortnight. If the section did not return the answer, the Minister's office would write the answer. When they thought that the Minister's office might write the answer, they came back like a shot. The usual pile of correspondence in a Minister's office disappeared and the sections started doing their jobs before it got as far as someone having to appeal to the Minister to get an answer. With An Bord Pleanála, there is a statutory objective of four months but we know that for a single house or for a small planning matter it is more observed in the breach. There is no proportionality and no system that means a massive decision will take longer. The small decisions also get into the same queue that leads to never-never land. When we know this happens and write it into legislation, it is "open Sesame" for people to say they are so busy that they cannot get the job done in time. When statutory dates are included, people suddenly find a way of getting the job done on time. When has the Minister of State heard of a planning authority not being able to get a decision made within the statutory time? Unless the Minister of State is willing to accept statutory time limits, I will oppose the section and I will oppose the amendments one by one. We are getting fluff that is meaningless in law instead of clear timelines that people must adhere to and the delivery of services that people are crying out for. In my time in politics, I have come across no evidence that the delay is giving us any better decisions. It is not that we are getting more decisions, we are getting more paperwork. I tabled a very simple amendment. Normally, in these processes, when observations are returned, a Member writes to the client one last time to allow the client to respond. The suggestion I make is that the time from when the client was asked the last question to the final decision date should be a maximum of eight weeks. The planning system has a whole series of timelines, which I prefer. After lodging applications and consulting, the authority must come back within eight weeks if it has questions of the applicant. Once the applicant answers the questions, the authority must make a decision. I cannot understand why the Minister of State did not lift the process from the planning law, which is time-limited. I think the Minister of State knows about it because he was once a councillor. The system operates well because it forces decisions within fixed time limits.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	415	I understand what the Deputy is saying. During our discussions on the Bill, I looked at the council planning permission model. We discussed it at length with the stakeholders and the best we could do is bring it to where it is now. To allow the forestry service to deal with this and to give it time to carry out consultation, it needs a considerable period of time. We included a provision that means the licence applies for ten years. In response, the charter of rights is being redrawn. We could have a felling licence issue included in the farmer's charter of rights and this will be dealt with over the next months. I give a commitment that I will include it in the charter of rights if that would be helpful. I understand the Deputy's point. However, in my view, taking everything into consideration, the time period stipulated was as good as what we could achieve.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	416	I can hear the "Yes Minister" debate happening in the Department in which it is argued, "Minister, dear, this would be absolutely outrageous; imagine tying us to a time limit and we would have to deal with so many issues and it would be so impossible to do this." The fact is that in dealing with much more complex planning issues, it actually operates, as for example, permission to build a nuclear power plant would come with fixed time limits. I think the Minister of State has been badly advised and he is falling sway to all the arguments we have all heard thousands of times. If the Minister of State was on this side of the House he would say, "Hang on a second, this is just an out." Unfortunately, as he knows, the charter of rights is not a statutory obligation, is not judicial; it can be ignored and there is no sanction if people ignore it and they will give the excuse that they are very busy. I thank the Minister of State for taking the opportunity to come down to the timber mill. I was involved in timber milling. In a timber mill everything is streamlined and nothing falls on the ground. It is a case of organising it to allow for the minimum amount of work and lifting and everything shot down the line in sequence. Many offices have papers and files here, there and everywhere and there seems to be no flow system. If factories were run that way, they would never produce any goods. It is time the public service offices operated on the same principle as factories, that the work is pushed through in a simple, effective manner and that we stop the files falling on the floor and the whole system being disorganised. I am not asking people to work harder; I am actually asking them to work less hard but more systematically. If they do that they would provide these decisions on time and they would not need to give excuses that they are fierce busy because they cannot remember where they put the files. I am always saying that most office administrators would be appalled if the same standards were applied to them in terms of the business flow in a systematic way that is standard in any industrial regime anywhere in the world.

#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	421	With regard to amendments Nos. 44 and 47, forest management objectives of owners are catered for in the felling licence application process. I must stress that it will be the forest owner in the first instance who will specify the type of tree felling that will be proposed. It is he or she who will propose the replanting species in the first instance. If a forest is being felled it is the owner who will specify the species and number of trees for felling. For example, if a forest owner found that a crop of Douglas fir had grown particularly well, he or she might want to plant the felled crop with the same species. In this case, he or she would state the species for replanting as Douglas fir on the felling licence application form. In this situation, if there are no particular environmental considerations, the reforestation proposals will be licensed. Although this section of the Bill allows the Minister to place conditions on a licence it will only occur where the applicant has omitted to take into consideration good forest practice. Examples where the Minister might attach conditions would include amending the application to exclude planting rights up to the banks of a sensitive river or improving the tree species mix and the set-back distance adjoining a public road or a house. Again, these conditions will be reasonable and will take into account consideration of the information submitted by the forest owner on the felling licence. With regard to amendments Nos. 44 and 47, it is explicit in the Bill that felling licences and conditions issued will generally be in accordance with good forest practice. However, there may be limited circumstances where licences may be issued which do not fall into the category strictly described as "good forest practice". For example, there may be valid reasons where tree felling is for social or conservation reasons which may not necessarily be described as good forest practice. Examples might include a forest owner proposing to remove a small area of forest for the creation of a hurling pitch for a local village or the felling of trees to prioritise the conservation of a protected species. Although the power to attach conditions is provided for in this Bill the felling licence application process allows for the owner's objectives to be included in the licensing process. For all the reasons stated I do not intend to accept these amendments.

We are looking at the condition in the Bill where replanting is required. I refer to section 17(4)(b) of the Bill which requires the replanting of trees. The worry is that as this is written, in the case of a person who is growing commercial forestry the Department could decide which species of trees was to be used in replanting, for example, it could be oak the next time. The forest management objectives of the forest owner would not be taken into account. Our amendments propose that when replanting is required, the replanting should comply with good forest practice and I cannot foresee any situation where it would be required if it were not good forest practice. The objectives of the forest owner must be taken into account and it should be a statutory obligation to take them into account when making the order or when laying down the condition of replanting. That is the objective of our amendments.

#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	431	I move amendment No. 54a:In page 18, line 18, after “road” to insert the following:“and, in the opinion of the owner, is dangerous to persons using the public road on account of its age or condition”.On amendment No. 54, the purpose of exempting trees within 10 m of a public road is for reasons of public safety. This is particularly important when trees become dangerous due to their age or condition or as a result of ground suitability. Deputies will recall that during the storms earlier this year, trees fell on public roads throughout the country because the ground was waterlogged and could not support their weight. The provision in the Bill, as it stands, will allow landowners to manage trees adjoining public roads without the requirement to obtain felling licences. While I do not believe that what is proposed will lead to the widespread felling of all roadside trees, amendment No. 54a seeks to address concerns to the effect that the exemption from the felling licence regime in respect of all trees outside forests which are located within 10 m of public roads is too broad and could lead to the widescale removal of such trees. As the principal reason for exempting such trees relates to the safety of road users, I now propose to impose an additional requirement on landowners in order to ensure that only trees they reasonably consider to pose a threat to public safety can, on the grounds of age or condition, be removed without a licence. On amendment No. 55, applying a size threshold in respect of the hawthorn and blackberry species would prove impractical and would place an unnecessary administrative burden on landowners and the Department, particularly during the period each year when hedge cutting traditionally takes place. As part of good agricultural practice and hedgerow management, farmers, without the need for regulation, leave individual trees, including the hawthorn and blackthorn species, alone. I cannot accept amendment No. 56, which requires landowners to apply for felling licences in order to remove from hedgerows trees with trunks greater than 4 inches in diameter. Farmers have been cutting hedgerows for decades as part of normal agricultural practice. The provision in section 19 allows for the felling of trees for the purpose of trimming hedges but it does not provide for the removal of hedgerows. The purpose of the 20 cm threshold is to allow all trees with trunks of a smaller diameter to be felled, lopped or trimmed as part of good hedgerow management and to provide landowners with the flexibility to manage hedgerows without being required to obtain felling licences in respect of every tree. The removal of hedgerows is regulated by other legislative instruments such as the Wildlife Act and the regulations introduced by the European Union in 2011. On amendments Nos. 57 and 58, the protection of hedgerows of historical, ecological or landscape significance was raised during consultations with environmental stakeholders. On Committee Stage, I introduced an amendment which was designed to address some of the concerns that were expressed in so far as was practical and appropriate in the context of the Bill before the House. The amendment to which I refer is reflected in section 192. I am introducing another amendment to the section in order to extend further the protection relating to certain classes of trees. I will comment further on that matter when we reach the amendment. I reiterate that the Bill does not relate to regulating the alteration or removal of hedgerows in general. The Wildlife Act and the Environmental Impact Assessment (Agriculture) Regulations 2011 deal with this issue. There is no national register of hedgerows which are deemed to be of historical, ecological or landscape significance. In the absence of such a register, it would be the responsibility of a landowner to decide if a tree is located in a hedgerow of historical, ecological or landscape significance in order to determine if a felling licence is required to cut or remove a tree. While environmental stakeholders have suggested a set of criteria to assist landowners in identifying such hedgerows, the criteria are relatively complex and highly subjective and would place an unwanted administrative burden on both landowners and my Department. Furthermore, it would be impossible to prosecute any person alleged to have removed such a hedgerow after the event because, in light of the absence of a register, there would be no means of determining whether said hedgerow was of historical, ecological or landscape significance. Consequently, I cannot accept amendments Nos. 57 and 58. On amendment No. 59, I recognise the importance of scrub woodlands as a reservoir for certain species and as areas of biodiversity. I also recognise that there are many benefits to encouraging the development of scrub woodlands. However, farmers must be allowed to leave fields in agricultural production if that is their choice. While I am keen to increase the level of forest cover, I must also acknowledge the importance of agricultural food production in this country. If an area of scrub woodland falls within the definition of what constitutes a forest as outlined in section 2 of the Bill, then a felling licence will be required in respect of the cutting or removal of any tree within that woodland. It would not be appropriate to categorise or define scrub as "agroforestry" within the terms of the Bill because this would imply that all scrub would be managed in association with agricultural activities. While some landowners may wish to pursue this model, others may wish, as is their right, to prevent scrub development in order to retain fields solely for agricultural production. There may also be individuals who may wish to retain scrub solely for conservation purposes. As I indicated on Committee Stage, concerns were raised during consultations with stakeholders with regard to the need to ensure that larger, established trees in hedgerows and individual old or veteran trees will be protected under the felling licence regime. Amendment No. 60 seeks to extend the protection for trees within the environs of national monuments, archaeological sites, protected areas and designated European sites and for those which are more than 150 years old. The amendment goes as far as is practically possible to address the concerns raised by Deputies Boyd Barrett and McNamara on Committee Stage, when I expressed an intention to provide an appropriate and workable balance. As stated previously, I do not want to include farmers and other landowners from felling, for example, trees that are in a dangerous condition or from continuing to manage appropriately and maintain hedgerows in accordance with good agricultural practice. The provision requires that landowners may apply for felling licences if they wish to remove trees in designated or protected areas and, more generally, in the case of trees that are more than 150 years old. I do not believe that this will unduly restrict landowners in their activities. I am of the view, however, that the added protection in respect of veteran trees located in areas designated on the basis of their landscape, architectural or environmental value is important and I am pleased to make provision in respect of it within the legislation. The purpose of amendment No. 60a is to ensure there is no ambiguity between the provisions of section 19 and any other legislative requirements governing the removal of trees. In other words, if restrictions are placed on the removal of trees by other legislation, the provisions of section 19 will not apply. Amendment No. 66b is a technical amendment inserted by the Office of the Attorney General and involves the rewording of the text to make the intention of the subsection clearer. It does not alter the intention of the original text.

The rationale for having such an exemption for trees within urban areas, which is primarily based on public safety concerns, remains valid despite the abolition of these areas. For this reason it is proposed to allow the Minister to use the former description of an urban area to describe areas that will be exempt from the felling licence requirement. This does not involve any change of policy and merely facilitates the continued exemption of trees in urban areas from the felling licence regime.

“Compensation for refusal of felling licence, etc
32. (1) The Minister shall, as soon as practicable after the commencement of this section, make regulations providing for the payment by the Minister of compensation to a person in a case where an application by the person for a licence—(a) to fell or otherwise remove trees,(b) to undertake forest road works, or(c) to undertake afforestation,is refused, but only if that refusal has been the subject of appeal and that refusal has been upheld on the appeal, or appeals, being finally disposed of.(2) Regulations under this section shall not be made otherwise than with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.(3) Without prejudice to the subsequent provisions of this section, a payment of compensation under regulations under this section shall not be made otherwise than on foot of an application in that behalf made to the Minister, being an application that is—(a) in the form directed by the Minister to be used for the time being for this purpose, and(b) made—(i) not earlier than before such time or the happening of such event as is specified in the regulations, nor(ii) later than such time or the happening of such event as is so specified,and, as respects such an application, the regulations may provide that at the time of the making of it or at any subsequent time (and before the determination of the application) the applicant shall furnish to the Minister such documents or information, or such further documents or information, as the Minister may require.(4) Without prejudice to subsections (9) to (11) and (14), regulations under this section may contain a provision that no compensation shall be payable under the regulations where the reason for the refusal to grant the licence concerned falls within any description of reason specified in that provision for the purpose.(5) No description of reason shall be specified in such a provision for that purpose unless the description of reason either has, as its basis, a basis set out in subsection (6) or complies with the requirement of subsection (8) (or both has the foregoing basis and complies with that requirement).(6) The basis referred to in subsection (5) is one that is reasonably related to any of the following:(a) the protection of the environment;(b) the ensuring of good forestry practice;(c) the preservation of amenities;(d) public health or safety;(e) protection from flooding;(f) preservation of water quality.(7) In subsection (6)(b) “good forestry practice” means forestry practice that respects the principle that the diverse activities constituting forestry (including afforestation) must be planned and implemented in a manner that prevents, limits, abates or reduces significant adverse impacts or risks thereof on—(a) the environment (and, in particular, on significant ecosystems and important habitats for flora or fauna), and(b) the character of the landscape.(8) The requirement referred to in subsection (5) is that the description of reason concerned is expressed in terms that are identical or analogous to the terms in which a reason appearing in any paragraph of the Fourth Schedule to the Planning and Development Act 2000 is expressed in that Schedule.(9) Regulations under this section shall contain a provision that no compensation shall be payable under the regulations where the reason for the refusal to grant the licence concerned was that—(a) the application for the licence was incomplete in any material particular, or(b) any environmental impact statement, natura impact statement or other information submitted for the purposes of the application for the licence was, in the opinion of the Minister, inadequate.(10) Subject to any reasonable qualification or modification of the following provisions of this subsection that the Minister considers should be provided for in the regulations to meet particular classes of case (and without prejudice to the provisions of the regulations referred to in subsections (11) and (12)), regulations under this section shall contain the following provisions with respect to determining the amount of compensation payable under the regulations—(a) in the case of a refusal to grant a licence to fell or otherwise remove trees or to undertake forest road works, compensation shall be calculated on the basis of the depreciation in the value of the trees that is attributable to the deterioration in the quality of the timber as a consequence of the refusal,(b) in the case of a refusal to grant a licence to undertake afforestation, compensation shall be calculated on the basis of the reduction in value between the antecedent and subsequent values of the land, where—(i) the antecedent value of the land is the amount which the land, if sold in the open market by a willing seller immediately prior to the relevant decision (assuming that the relevant application had not been made), might have been expected to realise, and(ii) the subsequent value of the land is the amount which the land, if sold in the open market by a willing seller immediately after that decision, might be expected to realise.(11) Regulations under this section shall contain a provision—(a) in relation to a case referred to in subsection (10)(a), that no compensation shall be payable in respect of any deterioration in the quality of the timber that—(i) took place more than 10 years before the date of the application for compensation, or(ii) is due to any unforeseen event of a kind specified in the regulations, or neglect of the trees, occurring subsequent to the refusal of the application for the licence concerned,(b) that not more than one application for compensation under the regulations may be made in respect of the same parcel of land (irrespective of the type of licence under this Act applied for) in any period of 40 years.(12) Regulations under this section shall contain such provisions, by way of enabling abatement of sums or otherwise, as appear to the Minister to be necessary or expedient to prevent the result specified in subsection (13) where, under any scheme or administrative arrangement, the payment of public moneys to the applicant is provided in respect of an activity to which this Act relates.(13) The result mentioned in subsection (12) is that in consequence of—(a) the applicant’s being refused the grant of the licence concerned, and(b) the regulations’ operation (if the regulations did not contain the foregoing provisions and the applicant were to be paid compensation under the regulations in respect of that refusal),the applicant would be in receipt of an amount of public moneys that is greater than the amount of such moneys that the applicant would be in receipt of if his or her application for the licence concerned had been granted.(14) Regulations under this section—(a) may provide that if the amount of compensation claimed by the applicant, or the amount of compensation determined under the regulations on foot of his or her application, (in each case after the abatement (if any) required to be made pursuant to the provision of the regulations referred to in subsection (12)), is less than such minimum amount as is specified in the regulations for the purpose, no payment of compensation in respect of that application shall be made,(b) may contain such incidental, consequential or supplemental provisions as the Minister considers necessary or expedient (including provision for the referral to arbitration of the determination of the amount of any compensation payable or alleged to be payable).”.

As the Minister of State is aware, I have had major reservations going back a long time. This time, whoever gave the Minister of State the advice gave him good advice, although he probably did not get advice on this one. I imagine he did this one himself.

He promised at the beginning that he would listen and take on board arguments that were put forward. Whereas he might not have given us everything we wanted - certainly, he probably got advice not to give us everything we wanted - I believe he genuinely interacted and took on board the suggestions put forward by members of the Opposition. That is important because at the end of the day we are all elected equally and it is a great sign of democracy when whoever is in government listens to cogent argument put forward and takes on board good suggestions.

#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	476	This is a Bill entitled an Act to make provision whereby an owner of a dwelling shall not be charged for water provided to him or her by Irish Water in circumstances where the water being provided is either subject to a boil-water notice or is contaminated by a negative condition, and such owner shall remain exempt from having to pay water charges for the period such notice remains or such contamination exists. This is the thrust of the Bill, which follows the long, sorry saga of the Government's attempts to charge for water, which have culminated in the establishment of Irish Water. It is not that we wish to oppose that process, this element thereof or anything contained within the Water Services Act just for the sake of opposition. It is not a major secret that we agree with the concept of water charges, but we do so only where there is a system that is fit for purpose. We believe the Government has rushed its efforts to charge for water and to put in place the gold-plated, bonus-driven super-quango that is Irish Water.

#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	478	The record will show that we did not agree with the establishment of Irish Water, its configuration, its top-heavy tiers of management, its bonus culture or its pay rates. The costs associated with its establishment are now well known, having been initially exposed by members of the media as being €180 million. Some €85 million of that was spent on outside expertise or, as many of us term such expertise, consultants. The funding for its establishment and everything it entailed was drawn from the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF, and was agreed by the Cabinet's Economic Management Council, EMC, which was confined to the Taoiseach, the two Ministers with responsibility for finance - Deputies Noonan and Howlin - and the then Tánaiste, Deputy Gilmore, as well as the then Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, who made the proposal. When the costs, including those for consultants, were exposed, I stated that many members of the Cabinet appeared to feign surprise upon learning of their extent. However, it now appears that those members were genuinely surprised, as the information on the costs and what they entailed was withheld from them. On the "This Week" radio programme in recent weeks, we learned that much of the information in question was available to the then Minister. I wonder what information he conveyed to the council and how the latter did its job of acting in the best interests of those who gave its members the privilege of being in a position to make that decision. We have seen the slow pace of the metering project, its exorbitant costs and the first year's income from the property tax given to Irish Water. We question the need for metering if the Government is genuine about having a system that promotes conservation. In an effort today to put down Deputy Martin's genuine question, the Taoiseach stated that the previous Governments of recent times had under-invested in the water network. Should the Taoiseach not be aware that Irish Water's capital spend for the next three years, which was announced this year, will be less than what was spent by conventional means in the previous three years? This rubbishes his claim out of hand. When questioned during the past two years, the Taoiseach stated that children would not be charged for water. He revised this to state that children would receive an allowance of 38,000 litres per year. He will have to revise his statement again, given the fact that the policy paper from the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, on the pricing structure means that children will only receive an allowance of 21,000 litres. The Taoiseach and the Government have form on these matters, form that cannot be trusted. I could not make my next remark in the House six weeks ago when the CER's report was published, but it was undoubtedly not a coincidence that the report was issued on an August bank holiday weekend or that the ensuing period of public consultation was held during the month of August when the House was not sitting and many people were not available to make proper submissions or undertake proper scrutiny of what the report contained. It was also no coincidence that the Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht was not afforded an opportunity to discuss the contents of Irish Water's initial submission to the CER or that my request to reconvene the committee to hold such a discussion was not allowed. I have no doubt that the Fine Gael candidate's statement last night was in the fine tradition of the type made previously by the likes of the Taoiseach in the town of Roscommon. I do not know what it is about Fine Gael when it comes to elections, by-elections, promises and false promises in the town of Roscommon. It is déjà vu. The lorry that the Taoiseach stood on will obviously be doing the rounds in Roscommon over the next three weeks. Water charges will be calculated on 1 October, with bills due to arrive next January. The draft water charges plan is due to be finalised by the CER later this month. That plan proposes a 50% rate for homes that have been under boil-water notices for up to three months and a 100% reduction thereafter. However, households will also have to pay for their water out regardless of the dire quality of their supply.People honestly do not care what Irish Water defines as water in or water out. They are still being charged for a supply that does not deliver.  We have also put in a detailed submission to the CER's consultation process and we have combined it with this Bill, and I am sure it is available for all to see. We believe it should be simply and squarely very easy to understand that it should be illegal for Irish Water to charge for a contaminated water supply at any level, regardless of any draft or proposed plan that may or will exist on the part of the CER, which has a responsibility to the people, is a representative of the people and is supposed to act in the great and best interest of people. The Minister present is a member of the Labour Party and I appreciate the intervention by his colleague, Senator John Kelly, last night when he disassociated himself with the comments of the Fine Gael candidate. If nothing else, they appear to have learned from the mistakes, as Deputy Pat Rabbitte said, about doing those things during the course of elections, and they have learned obviously from the Tesco ad fiasco and so forth. I want to acknowledge that and say that the party has made progress in that regard under its new leadership. However, Fine Gael is claiming that the people of Roscommon affected by boil water notices will not have to pay water charges but, as I said, that is simply untrue. Under the draft plan, residents will have to pay for water out, while those on a boil water notice of fewer than three months such as the people from Newtowncashel in Roscommon will have to pay a 50% rate for water they cannot use. What is more, the CER has denied any confirmation of the Fine Gael's claims resulting, and this has resulted in a fiasco with claim and counter-claim about water in and water out. Let us be straight, honest and clear about this. This Bill can put the issue to bed once and for all. It ensures quite simply and plainly that all residents affected by contaminated supplies do not have to pay for the water. It is a simple way to solve the issue based on the principle of nothing only fairness. Assurance will not be provided by any amount of idle talk or confirmation that the CER, having had a period of consultation, will take note and cognisance of the debate that is taking place, despite the fact that there has not been proper and adequate scrutiny of that report in the absence of the Dáil sitting or of a committee and that is something that the Minister with responsibility in this area has to grasp. The regulator promised a committee of these Houses that it would allow members of an all-party committee on the environment to discuss and scrutinise the contents of Irish Water's submission to the CER's office prior to the CER producing a report based on its research and allow the public have their period of consultation. I do not believe that process was adhered to in the fashion in which it was designed to do so and that being the case, somebody has questions to answer. The Minister with responsibility in this area is the one to ask those questions, seek and demand those answers and have them available for Members of House. It is near time that sense of clarity and effective leadership came to the fore on this issue. Application forms are being delivered to houses throughout the country this week. A question on the form asks people do they think they have a medical need that may determine the amount of water they use or do not use. Where is that leading? Was it not a specific point allowed or catered for in the legislation that those with a medical need would not be charged inappropriately for the amount of water they needed because of their medical condition? It is another example of the line of form that has ensued since this issue was first brought to the House. To think that people were told that the expertise was within Bord Gáis in the first instance and thereafter was contained in the outside expertise at the cost of €85 million, which was kept from everybody at the time but that we had to accept: as the previous Minister said, "You can't make an omelette without breaking eggs." He is breaking a fair few eggs with the cost of this unfortunately. It is near time that the Minister present showed the sort of leadership that is required on this issue now and that he would agree to accept this Bill which brings absolute clarity based on fairness to one issue which is affecting 36,000 people nationwide, 21,000 in the county of Roscommon and which may affect many more in the intervening period. I hope that Government party members of both persuasions would agree with the sentiments I have expressed, if for nothing else but to begin a new chapter in allowing this sorry process gain some redemption. As I said, we at no time agreed with the concept of putting in place a new tier of management, a new tier on top of systems that were already in place and adequately positioned if funding was made available in the right manner to address the deficiencies that exist in the system. The Minister counterclaims by saying this is a way and a means by which that can be addressed. I have said to him already that the next three years capital spend will be less than the previous three years by the conventional methods that were available to the Department at that time. That is a fact. A total of €1.67 billion was announced over three years through great fanfare as if it was a huge departure from what had gone before and it was anything but that to be plain and honest about it.

If he compares the costs and the price that was expected then when that was in place, he replaced it with a greater price; he had gone totally and absolutely volumetric now. Heading down the road of full cost recovery, there will be no alternative and the only way this train will have to come to a halt is by privatisation. That will be another Damascus moment for the Labour Party to go with everything else that went before. As I said to the Minister, he seems to have addressed the rot in regard to the promises that he will be making, considering that he has learned his lesson in regard to the Tesco ads. However, Fine Gael has not and we are back to the old tricks that we heard previously in regard to Roscommon. Here is an opportunity for the Minister, his colleagues and his party members to address an issue that is causing great distress. It can be addressed very simply, fairly and adequately with this Bill.

#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	499	I join my colleague, Deputy Cowen, in wishing the two Ministers present well on their elevation. I thank Deputy Cowen for bringing forward the Water Services (Exempt Charges) Bill and I speak in support of it. If a customer went into any shop and bought a product and on bringing it home found it to be in some way deficient or not to be in good working order, they would be entitled to their money back. The same standards should apply in regard to water.If water is not of drinking standard then charges should not apply. It is plain and simple, that should be the end of the matter. Thankfully, in my constituency boil notices are very rare. However, incidents of poor water quality are not so rare. Apart from the proposal to charge 50% of the water charges for the first three months when a boil water notice exists and for 100% of the water going out no account is being taken of incidents of poor water quality where a boil water notice has not been issued. I will give an example. I received an email from a constituent last week saying that she had experienced three water outages last Christmas and that when the water supply was finally reconnected gallons of thick brown water had to be run-off, which process can take up to an hour at a time. Apparently this is a regular occurrence for her, her family and some of her neighbours. Who will pay for all of the water run-off in the kitchen, bathroom, toilet, etc.? The constituent further states that on occasion even after an hour of running off water she still has to boil it and that any clothing mid-wash has to be rewashed as the clothes are dirty brown. The question posed by that constituent is: "How can the Government charge for facilities we do not have on a constant basis? It is unfair to ask me, a pensioner, to pay for all the gallons of water that have to be run-off." That is a valid question. There is no boil water notice in that instance. Similarly, there is no boil water notice in many other areas around the country where the water quality is poor. This will have to be taken into account by the CER when the final charges are published. I take the opportunity presented by this Bill to highlight the situation facing families with grown up children living at home. We all want young people to be well educated. The manner in which it is proposed to structure these charges means there will be no water allowance for a young person on reaching the age of 18 years. This means most students studying for the leaving certificate and third level students will not have any free water allowance. The assessed charge for a family of two parents and two grown up children living at home is €482 per annum. The assessed charge for a family of two parents and three grown up children living at home, which is not unusual or uncommon, is €584 per annum. That household would need to earn more than €1,200 gross in order to pay that water bill. That is staggering. If the CER has under-estimated the amount of water that people use bills will be considerably higher. The reality is that water charges of €600 and €700 per annum will not be uncommon for families in that situation. This is not what people are expecting. The average charge of €240 per annum, which the Government is putting forward, is bogus. The CER says it can honour that charge by including all of the vacant properties in the country and properties with a single occupant. That is dragging down the average. The assessed charge for two adults in a household will be €278 per annum. The CER saw fit to dramatically reduce the water allowance for children by 45% from 38,000 litres to 21,000 litres without publishing any evidence to back that up.  A lot of people are in for a shock when water charges bills arrive in the post next January. I believe people have been misled. I believe that the Government's claims about the average charge are bogus. The goal posts have been moved by way of a reduction in the allowance per household and a substantial reduction in the allowance for each child. It is a bit like saying that the cost of a bag of apples has not changed when instead of there being ten apples in the bag there will be six. That is the three-card trick that this Government is trying to pull in relation to water charges. The truth will hit home when the water bills arrive through the letter boxes next January. There is much talk about income tax cuts in the forthcoming budget. The Government will say that water charges are not a budgetary matter. The reality is that whatever amount of money is given back to people by way of income tax cuts will be more than taken back from them by way of the water charges that will come into force from 1 October.

The Seanad class of 2007 has done well. The Ministers, in particular the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, have been left by their Kilkenny colleague with the hurling equivalent of a hospital pass. He will not need to consult Hawkeye in relation to this issue, which is the biggest hospital pass of them all.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	501	The Minister, Deputy Kelly, has been left with delivering that particular demon child to the public. I wish him good luck with that. He will need all of his supposed hurling skills to do so. We have been told the water we will receive will be of Ballygowan quality. The Minister, Deputy Bruton, pronounced from on high that Ballygowan water is what we are going to get, which is a little ironic, in particular for the 23,000 people in Roscommon who are forced to buy bottled water every week - not Ballygowan water because they cannot afford it - in order to ensure they and their families have access to drinking water.  We have had a very successful tourism season. The Minister, Deputy Kelly, is a former executive of Fáilte Ireland. One can only imagine what tourists will think when they arrive into wonderful establishments here only to be met with notices on A4 sheets saying that water and ice at that establishment comes from elsewhere and that customers can be assured the water being provided is clean. One can only imagine what people will think when they visit facilities at which they receive a wonderful welcome but are faced with such notices. Also, one can only imagine what that will add to the cost base of the business, for which it will not be compensated.  Boil water notices aside, people with medical conditions require additional water. While I am aware there is to be a cap in this respect we have not yet had any specifics in that regard. People with kidney, heart and other conditions need certainty in respect of their water requirements and a definition of "cap". Preferably, they should be given an exemption. I encourage the Minister and Minister of State to encourage the highly paid executives in Irish Water to become familiar with the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act 1980, which legislation governs consumer protection in this country. It is the legislation which sets out what a contract is, namely, a formal agreement between two or more people, enforceable by law. A contract relates to the purchase of goods of services. As such when people fill out the forms from the pack provided by Irish Water and send them back they will then be bound by contract. Under the Act, the purchaser, namely, the consumer, has a number of rights. The goods must be of merchantable quality and fit for purpose. The type of black-brown water about which Deputy Michael McGrath spoke, which we have all seen and know about, which destroys machinery and equipment, could not be described as being of merchantable quality or fit for purpose. Therefore, as the goods are not fit for purpose and do not meet the standard of the contact, the consumer has a range of rights, including the right to compensation and to have their money returned. The Small Claims Court will be very busy next year as people hold Irish Water to account under the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act 1980 for bad service or the supply of goods not fit for purpose as they do not do what they are reasonably expected to do.  Rather than dismiss Deputy Cowen's legislation, the Minister might consider the introduction of a new regime in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government through which that Department could work with him in avoiding a situation whereby next year people will be going to the Small Claims Court enforcing their legal rights under the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act 1980. It is typical of government - I do not mean Government in the sense of the current Government - Departments working in silos, which I have railed about for many years, that this Department will be funding a National Consumer Agency providing information to people about their rights, while another Department has under its aegis a body which is infringing those rights on a daily basis.  Businesses have been paying water charges to local authorities for some years. An issue on which I would like the Minister to engage is the passing by local authority executives of complaints or queries in relation to water to officials of Irish Water. Local authority executives want to to wash their hands of all water complaints. When one raises the issue with Irish Water one is told that there are queries outstanding from the local authorities.Is it possible for the Department to have a dedicated telephone line, as in the Passport Office, so these kinds of questions can be clarified? In fairness to Irish Water, it provides an excellent service to elected representatives and it reverts to us very efficiently. Generally and often, however, the fault lies at local authority level. There are so many issues to be raised under the Consumer Protection Act. This is another Act with which the staff of Irish Water will need to become familiar. Under it, it is an offence for any retailer or professional to make a false and misleading claim about goods, services and prices. Therefore, it is an offence for Irish Water to tell 23,000 people that they have the best water in the world. It is an offence for the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, to tell 23,000 people that they will have Ballygowan water. I am sure Ballygowan would not be too impressed to have its water compared to the kind of water that the people of Roscommon are currently forced to drink. Claims about the weight, ingredients, or performance of goods must be stated truthfully or else one is opening oneself up to all sorts of complaints. The Act also covers claims about pricing, funnily enough. The former Deputy Phil Hogan might like to read the provisions of the relevant section of the consumer protection legislation. He told us the average bill will be approximately €230 but we know it will be around €500. Therefore, the former Deputy Hogan could brief himself before he departs regarding his responsibility under the Consumer Protection Act 2007. The Minister needs to provide information regarding the issue of health. Even in the packs with which we have been provided, claims about health and support for those with various conditions are quite vague. Those with the conditions in question do not need the worry of a lack of knowledge on top of everything else with which they must deal. If Irish Water made a very clear statement to address this very urgently, it would be of assistance. Establishment costs have never been dealt with in this House. That €180 million was spent meeting start-up costs of Irish Water before expenditure of a cent on equipment or on meeting capital costs is extraordinary. This is the kind of occurrence that the Government, when in opposition, would have railed against. Surely the Minister's Department, as the parent body, owes us an explanation on where the money has gone and why it had to be spent. Surely, given the amount of expenditure separate from capital expenditure, we must ask whether the money had to be spent. We were assured that by placing Irish Water on the structure that was Bord Gáis, it would not need the kind of money that was expended. However, what we have seen is what Deputy Cowen referred to, that is, a runaway train that still has not been slowed down. Nobody has yet applied the brakes to it. That is the kind of waste of money to which people on boil water notices refer. They say the money is going on salaries and expenses and not being spent in their counties to provide capital assistance or to resolve their problems. This is why there is so much frustration throughout the country over the way in which Irish Water has been established and is doing its business. Both the Minister and Minister of State are on different sides of an argument that is currently being waged in Roscommon. The candidate of the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, proclaimed last night that water charges would be abolished for those on boil water notices. The candidate of the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, said this morning that this had not been decided yet and criticised, without naming the individual, the Minister of State's candidate. There was something on Twitter today about deleting tweets. The Minister of State might want to direct his candidate's attention to it in Roscommon. This is the kind of thing that candidates throughout the country, from both Government parties, will try to start doing. The Labour Party candidates will start blaming the Fine Gael candidates for Irish Water because it was Deputy Hogan's creation. The Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, is now in charge and must take responsibility and ownership of the issue. He must deliver to the 23,000 people who are on boil water notices some sort of assurance that they will not have to pay the same bills those of us with a good water supply will be forced to pay. As Deputy Michael McGrath has stated, the Government should give some indication to families, particularly those with adult children living at home, that they will not be absolutely carpeted by charges to them. I refer also to families with teenagers involved in sport and a range of other activities that require the use of showers. A very good case study was presented during the summer of a lady in north Dublin who was involved in the local GAA club. She does all the washing for the club but intends to stop doing so because she has estimated that, by providing the service to her community, it will cost a fortune. These are all the models and day-to-day matters that arise and to which the former Minister, Deputy Hogan, certainly never paid attention. He never worried too much about them because he has known that by the time the bills come through the doors in January 2015, he will be looking down on us all from his cushy number in Brussels. The Minister has got the hospital pass. He has got a ball and has got to come on and run with it. He is now the face of Irish Water. Ministers of State can always hide, except when there is good news. The Minister, Deputy Kelly, is the face of Irish Water and he is the person whom we will hold responsible on behalf of those who cannot get water services and those who are getting sick of water services. I direct the Minister again to brief himself of his responsibilities as main shareholder in Irish Water in light of the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act 1980 and the Consumer Protection Act 2007. Responsibilities of Irish Water in that regard are quite a mess.

No doubt we will be harrying them continually from this side of the House in the coming period. I am happy to support the legislation Deputy Barry Cowen has introduced today. It is a clear-cut Bill attempting to deal quite effectively with a problem that the three previous speakers have clearly outlined to the Minister. The problem is real. There are 36,000 families throughout the country with a problem. There is a particular set of circumstances in County Roscommon that can be identified and quantified. In the previous existence of the Minister and Minister of State, both would have been able to recognise the problem and accept that a solution had to be found. Earlier today, when the leader of Fianna Fáil raised this with the Taoiseach during Leaders' Questions, I was particularly taken by the point made. Deputy Martin put it to the Taoiseach that there was a point of principle, and that it concerned the question of whether the Taoiseach stood over a situation in which an entity established by the Government would charge people for a service that could not effectively be used. No matter what anybody says, it is a point of principle. Sadly, the Taoiseach did not address that in his response. I hope the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government will do so. It is a clear-cut, straightforward, obvious set of circumstances that exists. Nobody expects the Minister, Irish Water or the Commission for Energy Regulation to create an environment in which everybody with a periodic problem with his or her water can claim an exemption from charges, but when a clear, widespread systemic problem exists that can be identified, it behoves the system, Irish Water and the Minister to do something about it. I want to raise a couple of other points in the very limited time available to me. The first concerns the likely impact of this development on the rental market, particularly the social rental market. We know that in the greater Dublin area, for example, the rate of homelessness is increasing arising from the cap that has been placed on the rent subsidy. Could the Minister indicate in his response the extent to which his Department has evaluated the impact the charge for water will have, particularly on the social rental sector? Will the charge have to be paid by the landlord? Alternatively, will it be paid by the tenant? If the tenant departs the property without having paid, how will the outstanding moneys be recovered, or can they be recovered? The second point was alluded to earlier in the day by Deputy Catherine Murphy.It is the issue of Irish Water demanding the personal public service, PPS, numbers for individuals who have received communications from Irish Water. No other public utility requires the personal public service number to be provided to it. I have been astonished by the number of people who have contacted my office about this and by the number who bitterly resent the idea that a semi-State body should demand their PPS number from them. They are even more infuriated when they consider the possibility or, indeed, the prospect that this utility company could be sold at some time in the future and that their private details could, as a result, find their way into the public arena. Deputy Cowen referred to the issue of capital investment. None of us takes any great pride in the fact that, notwithstanding the huge investment over the last decade in public water infrastructure, there is still much more to do. I have been a public representative for long enough to know that for at least 20 years, during which each of our parties has been in government, there have been reports of up to 40% of water being lost. I was listening to that in County Kildare in the 1980s, 1990s and the 2000s. It does not appear that the very substantial investment that took place in the public infrastructure was done in such a manner as to ensure that the leakages were dealt with. We got new schemes and established schemes where no schemes had existed previously, but we certainly did not achieve the type of repair or upgrade of existing schemes that is clearly necessary. The point made very effectively by my colleague, Deputy Cowen, is that there is nothing in the budgetary proposals for Irish Water to suggest that anything will change in that respect in the next three years. That is a problem and perhaps the Minister would refer to it. As I travel around my constituency I meet many people who live in finished or unfinished estates who raise the issue of taking estates in charge and the absence, unless it has been rectified over the summer, of a protocol addressing the responsibilities of the local authorities vis-à-vis Irish Water for the taking in charge of estates. That does not appear to have been addressed yet. In so far as a protocol is now necessary, it clearly indicates that there was a serious flaw in the initial stage of the legislation. Does the Minister accept that there is a problem in that area? Certainly, my local authority says there is. What priority will he give to it and when will the protocol be brought forward to address this issue?
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	503	I thank my colleagues for what I presume are their sincere good wishes. There is a very youthful look on the team on this side of the House. I thank Deputy Cowen for giving me the opportunity to address the issues associated with the Bill. Many issues were also raised by the four speakers. They might check the Official Report for today as some of those issues were addressed during parliamentary questions. Deputy Cowen could not attend and I do not know the circumstances for that, but a number of questions were addressed, including some of the issues raised by the last speaker. The provision of safe and wholesome drinking water is of critical importance to the health and well-being of our citizens. Modernising and improving water services delivery in Ireland is a key policy objective in the programme for Government and it is one on which the Government is delivering. Significant reform of water services has already begun and has been delivered through the following measures: the establishment of Irish Water as a State-owned company within the Bord Gáis group, which is now named Ervia; the introduction of a new, sustainable funding model to support much-needed investment in water infrastructure, including the introduction of water meters in households to facilitate equitable water charges based on usage; and the establishment of an independent economic regulator for water services, with a key focus on consumer protection, through the conferral of statutory powers on the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER. The establishment of Irish Water has been one of the most significant elements among a wide range of public sector reform measures achieved by this Government. The move towards the utility model will deliver major benefits to our people and our economy in a number of ways, notably through providing a more structured and co-ordinated approach to the delivery of water services on a national basis; achieving economies of scale in service delivery and more efficient procurement of materials and services; reducing unacceptable levels of waste from the drinking water distribution system, with an estimated 40% of treated drinking water being unaccounted for prior to the establishment of Irish Water; and reducing the overall costs of delivering water services. The establishment of Irish Water within Bord Gáis Éireann was an important step in assisting the utility to leverage the existing core expertise available to Bord Gáis as a modern and efficiently-run utility. Bord Gáis employed its internal expertise to establish functions in Irish Water in areas such as asset management, information technology, customer operations, financial management, risk management and corporate governance. Ervia and Irish Water estimate that establishing Irish Water within the BGE group has saved potentially tens of millions of euro. In the longer term, they estimate that it will lead to a saving of over €1 billion over the period to 2021. It is important to note that the reform of water services is not only important in delivering better value for money for our citizens, but is also critical to support economic development and growth. Worldwide, demand for natural water resources is rising, yet supplies are becoming more vulnerable. Ireland has a potential competitive advantage in having high quality supplies of fresh water available for use. We must make the most of this opportunity and create a world class system of water services delivery. By doing this, Ireland can both support indigenous industry and attract overseas investment in water-intensive industries such as ICT and pharmachemicals. Already, the metering programme undertaken by Irish Water is delivering an economic dividend through the creation of over 1,200 jobs. This is an incredibly ambitious programme of capital works, with Irish Water planning to install over 1 million meters within a three year period. Since the commencement of the installation programme in August 2013, over 400,000 meters have been installed. Irish Water has committed to completing the installation programme by mid-2016. The metering programme is unparalleled in its scale and ambition. It is a considerable achievement. The introduction of charges based on usage is a cornerstone of the Government's pricing policy. That is the reason the accelerated metering programme is of primary importance to the funding model being put in place. Water meters facilitate a fair form of charges for users of water services and facilitate the provision of a free allowance to households and families. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, has previously stated that metered charges are the fairest form of charging. The OECD has also noted that failure to install water meters would give households zero incentive to save water or to minimise waste in the form of leaking pipes, running taps and other wasteful usage such as unnecessary use of garden hoses. The OECD also advised that the failure to measure water use further perpetuates the public's low awareness of consumption levels and the real cost of water services. A better understanding of costs could, in itself, promote some reduction in consumption. The OECD went on to observe that water metering will also remove the inequities between households. A household with large gardens or even a swimming pool will pay significantly more than a smaller household with average consumption. When households understand that they can manage their water bills through reducing consumption they are provided with an important incentive to manage their water use responsibly. In Denmark, for example, a reduction of 12.6% in household consumption was achieved in the period 1996 to 2007, following the introduction of water meters along with the promotion of water saving devices.The Walker report, prepared by the UK Government and published in 2009, estimates that water metering in the UK has the potential to achieve a reduction of approximately 16% of average household demand through reduced personal consumption and reduced customer side leakage. A research project carried out in the greater Dublin area estimated that customer side leakage may be as high as 65 litres per property per day, but more recent studies in Dublin suggest that customer side leakage could in some locations be significantly higher. The installation of water meters will ensure that these leaks can be identified and fixed. Metering will, therefore, achieve significant reductions in the volume of water that is required to be treated every day and will lead to savings in the operational costs of delivering water services and in deferred capital expenditure as well. Moreover, it will lead to other environmental benefits such as reduced abstractions from rivers and lakes and reduced carbon emissions from lower energy consumption. There is also evidence from closer to home - from the group water sector. The National Federation of Group Water Schemes has long advocated the introduction of water meters in group schemes throughout the country, and members of these schemes have been accustomed to paying for water based on usage in recent years. The evidence from the group schemes sector provides further proof that very significant savings can be achieved through the introduction of metered charges. Two comprehensive pieces of legislation approved by the Oireachtas during 2013, the Water Services Act 2013 and the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013, provided the legislative basis for the programme of reforms. The two Acts addressed a wide range of issues to provide for the establishment of Irish Water and the subsequent transfer of water services from the city and county councils to Irish Water. However, with regard to the topic of the Bill before us, I would like to outline the measures that are set out in the existing legislation regarding the levying of charges by Irish Water and the measures the legislation contains to safeguard the interests of the customers of Irish Water. The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides Irish Water with the statutory power to charge customers for the water services provided. Specifically, section 21 of the Act sets out that Irish Water shall charge each customer for the provision by it of water services. Such charges are to be calculated by Irish Water in its water charges plan, which is subject to the approval of the CER. The water charges plan to be prepared by Irish Water is required to specify the manner and method by which charges are to be calculated and the costs likely to be incurred by Irish Water in the performance of its functions under the legislation during the period to which the water charges plan relates. The water charges plan is also required to set out the requirement to charge for both water supply services and wastewater services. While the majority of Irish Water's customers will receive both water supply services and wastewater services, a proportion may receive only a water supply or a wastewater service. Where a customer receives both water and waste services, the legislation provides that the amount of wastewater discharge from a household or other premises is deemed equal to the amount of water supplied to the premises. This is often referred to as "water in, water out," and is a broadly adopted method for charging for water services internationally. This will apply whether the volume of water supplied was measured by a water meter or assessed based on criteria to be approved by the CER. In preparing the water charge plan, Irish Water is required to take account of the public utility nature of its functions but also the need to perform its functions in a manner that maintains Irish Water as a commercially viable utility. The CER, in evaluating the plan, may approve the water charges plan submitted by Irish Water with or without modifications, or it may refuse to approve the water charges plan. In addition to approving the water charges plan, the CER has a wider role in overseeing the level of service provided by Irish Water to its customers. In particular, section 32 of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water must prepare and submit to the CER a code or codes of practice to address a wide range of customer protection issues. These include: standards in regard to the performance by Irish Water of its functions; billing by Irish Water of persons in respect of water services provided; methods of payment of water charges; the provision of information to customers of Irish Water for the purpose of enabling customers to communicate with Irish Water; the making of complaints to Irish Water by customers in regard to the provision of water services; the standards of such services; the contesting of the charge; and, importantly, any other matter the commission considers necessary and appropriate to secure the interests of customers of Irish Water. Section 39 of the Act sets out the requirement of the CER in the performance of its functions and, in this regard, the CER is obliged to perform its functions in a manner that best serves the interests of customers of Irish Water. It is worth noting that the CER is required to perform its functions having regard to the need to ensure that the customers of Irish Water are provided with the quality of services provided for in the aforementioned code of practice; that water services are provided by Irish Water in an economic and efficient manner; that Irish Water operates in a commercially viable manner; that there is continuity, safety, security and sustainability of water services; and that due regard is paid to the recovery of costs of water services in accordance with Article 9 of the EU water framework directive, which requires member states to take account of the principle of recovery of the costs of water services. Section 42 of the Act provides an important role for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government by providing that the Minister may issue a general policy directive direction to the CER. In this regard, my predecessor as Minister, Mr. Phil Hogan, issued such a direction to the CER on 2 July 2014. The policy direction, which took account of decisions made by the Government, addresses a range of matters relating to the water charges plan to be submitted to the CER by Irish Water and relates to the interim regulatory cycle which will cover the period from October 2014 to the end of 2016. In particular, the direction provided for the following: the provision of a free allowance for domestic customers of Irish Water for usage in their primary residence, amounting to 30,000 litres per household on an annual basis; an allowance to cover the normal consumption of both water supplied and wastewater treated per child in primary residence in the State, with the level of this allowance to be verified through consumption data from metering; the requirement for assessed charges applied by Irish Water to be primarily based on occupancy, allowing for provision for other factors to be considered, such as comparison with metered usage; provision for special arrangements for customers with specific medical conditions which require increased water consumption, involving the capping of such charges at the relevant assessed charge; and provision that no standing charge should apply to domestic customers other than provision for the CER to consider a minimum charge for non-primary residences. Of particular relevance given the subject matter of the Bill tabled by Deputy Cowen, the direction also provides that the commission should make provision for circumstances in which the quality of water services provided by Irish Water to customers is impaired or services are reduced or restricted - for example, where there is a boil-water notice in place. I believe it would be useful to outline the existing legislative provisions dealing with drinking water quality. To ensure the safety of our drinking water supply, the quality of drinking water in Ireland is regulated by the European Union (Drinking Water) Regulations 2014. These regulations specify 48 microbiological, chemical and indicator parameters or standards that water suppliers, including Irish Water and group schemes, are required to monitor to ensure compliance with those standards. Irish Water is now responsible for public water supplies. The EPA is the statutory body responsible for the provision of drinking water supplies and has been provided with extensive powers by the regulations to ensure that drinking water supplies comply with the parameters contained in the regulations. These include the power to issue a direction to a water supplier to ensure compliance. The regulations provide that it is an offence for a water supplier to fail to comply with such a direction. As part of the statutory monitoring responsibilities, where Irish Water, in consultation with the Health Service Executive, considers that a water supply is a potential risk to human health, it is required to ensure that the supply of such water is prohibited or the use of such water is restricted, and that consumers are informed promptly and given the necessary advice. This notification and, in particular, the advice provided for consumers will vary depending on the cause of the risk. The main parameters for which restrictions are currently in place are E. coli, cryptosporidium and lead. Boil-water notices are issued in regard to E. coli or cryptosporidium, while water restrictions are issued for lead. The EPA produces annual reports on the quality of drinking water supplies in Ireland which set out the compliance of drinking water supplies with the mandatory standards set out for the drinking water regulations. The most recent report covers compliance in 2012 and shows that 98.7% of public water supplies were compliant. This shows a high level of compliance, although clearly we want to improve on this and ensure that all supplies meet the necessary standards. Significant progress has been made in improving the quality of drinking water supplies in recent years. Of course, of particular note is the 92% reduction in the detection of E. coli in public water supplies since 2005. At present, there are 978 public water supplies for which Irish Water is now responsible, serving approximately 82% of the population of the State. The remainder of households receive their supply from either private wells or private group schemes. The EPA has recently reported to my Department that there are currently 31 restrictions in place on public water supplies, including 20 boil-water notices. The restrictions in place affect approximately 26,000 people. Of the schemes affected by the boil-water notices, one is in each of the counties of Cork, Kerry, Leitrim, Longford, Mayo, Sligo, Waterford and Wexford, four are in County Tipperary and eight are in County Roscommon.A number of restrictions issued under the drinking water regulations relate to exceedances of the limits for lead. These exceedances arise from the solubility of lead in drinking water. In recent years the WHO has been advising on reduction of exposure to lead on the basis that prolonged exposure to lead can result in harmful health effects, particularly in infants and unborn children. This has resulted in reduced limits being set by the European Union in the drinking water directive which has been transposed into Irish legislation by the drinking water regulations. In 2003 the allowable limits for lead in drinking water were reduced from 50 to 25 micrograms per litre. At the end of 2013 the limit was further reduced to 10 micrograms per litre or ten parts per billion. At this lower concentration, there is the risk of exceeding the limit wherever there is lead piping, particularly where the water has been sitting in the pipe overnight. It is possible to treat the water using particular chemicals, but this can only reduce rather than remove the risk. For this reason, the WHO recommends the removal of lead from drinking water systems as the necessary objective to reduce health concerns. There is a negligible amount of lead pipes in the water distribution mains, but Irish Water estimates that approximately 100,000 homes may be connected to lead service pipes. This is the pipe that connects the water main to the household stopcock or water meter. Irish Water has developed a ten-year timeframe to eliminate these service pipes and lead backyard services, which it estimates could involve an additional 30,000 to 40,000 homes. The estimated cost of the work is between €200 million and €300 million. The Water Services Act 2007 provides that the owner of a premises is responsible for the maintenance and renewal of the internal water distribution system and shall ensure it is kept in good order. Responsibility for replacing lead pipes from the main stopcock to the house and within the house rests with the homeowner. Irish Water is also evaluating the problem of lead piping within households. In this regard, it is examining methods of water treatment to reduce and prevent lead being absorbed into household water supplies.  The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 requires the EPA and Irish Water to co-operate in a manner that best promotes the interests of consumers and the efficient provision of water services. Irish Water is taking action in this regard by making drinking water quality its top priority. In its interim investment plan which will operate up to 2016 the main focus will be urgent provision of treatment plants to address schemes with boil water notices, eight of which are in County Roscommon; an action plan to address water supply schemes not considered sufficiently robust to ensure the water supply will comply with drinking water standards; and a specific programme of work to address the long-term problem of lead piping in the public supply system. The investment plan will provide for capital spending on new drinking water plants of €133 million, with a further €140 million focusing on drinking water availability and improving quality. A number of schemes are being fast-tracked where there are currently restrictions on supply - six new treatments which are under construction in County Roscommon will be completed between November 2014 and June 2015 and serve over 20,000 people, while a new scheme is to be completed in Tipperary to address boil water notices that have been in place for almost six years. It is clear that a dynamic effort is being made by Irish Water to address as a priority drinking water schemes with impaired supplies.  Water charges for households will commence on 1 October 2014, with the first bills to be issued by Irish Water to households in January 2015. In advance of this and in accordance with the provisions of the legislation, Irish Water has submitted its proposed water charges plan to the CER. In July 2014 the CER published a public consultation document on the proposed water charges plan which has been concluded. In its consultation document the CER set out its initial proposals relating to water charges and, in particular, how the requirements of the policy direction could be achieved. This included the following proposals. Where a water supply is declared unfit for human consumption for a period of less than three months, a 50% discount on the water supply charge should apply. Where the supply is unfit for human consumption for a period of more than three months, a 100% discount on the water supply charge should apply. The CER's proposals are more favourable to the consumer than those submitted by Irish Water which had suggested a 100% discount should only apply where the period involved was over six months rather than three I understand that, following the public consultation process, the CER is considering the approach to compensating households where the water supply is not fit for human consumption. It is important to highlight that all of the households in 18 of the 20 public water supply schemes, including all eight in County Roscommon, affected by a boil water notice that were notified to my Department by the EPA will be eligible to receive a 100% discount on the water supply element of their bill from Irish Water - in other words, as indicated in the documents published by the CER. If confirmed when the water charges plan is published shortly, as such, customers who have been on a boil water or drinking water notice for three months prior to the commencement of water charges on 1 October 2014 will not pay for their water supply. The legislative framework that the Government has put in place to establish Irish Water and the CER as the economic regulator for Irish Water means that there is a robust process for the protection of customer interests and clearly demonstrates that the customer is at the centre of the Government's thinking when framing this legislation.  Moving to specific elements of the Bill tabled by Deputy Barry Cowen, the Bill aims to amend the provisions of section 21 of the Water Services (No. 2) Act to provide that Irish Water should not charge a customer for the provision of water services to his or her dwelling in circumstances where the water being provided to that dwelling is either subject to a boil water notice, contaminated by a negative water condition or both. From the detailed measures I have outlined, it is clear that the legislative and administrative process is already in place to provide the basis for the compensation of customers affected by a water supply and does not comply with the statutory standards. For this reason, the Government cannot support the Bill supported by the Deputy. As I have outlined, the existing legislation provides the basis for addressing this matter with the necessary flexibility, an issue which is not addressed in the Bill. This flexibility is important to ensure equity and proportionality for all customers of Irish Water. The CER is considering the water charges plan, specifically how to deal with those with an impaired water supply. It is proposing to address the level of time for which the supply has been impaired and the issue relating to the water supply element of the charge.  This is an area where the Bill is flawed. An exemption from all water charges is proposed in the Bill, thus ignoring the fact that the provision of a wastewater service by Irish Water is not affected by any issue relating to the water supply. In its own analysis published as part of the public consultation document on the water charges plan, the CER estimates that only 15% to 20% of the water supply to households is typically consumed directly by household occupants or used in food preparation and is, therefore, affected by water that is unfit for human consumption. While a final determination on this matter has not yet been made by the CER, it is proposing discounts that go way beyond this 15% to 20% level. However, to exempt a household from wastewater charges, as well as water supply charges, would be disproportionate. As stated, Irish Water is obliged to charge for the services provided by it and to operate in a commercially viable manner. Compliance with the EU wastewater directive has required extensive capital investment in new treatment plants - investment that will be continued by Irish Water in the coming years.  The CER is due to announce the approved water charges plan for Irish Water towards the end of this month. The approved water charges plan must fully reflect Government policy as outlined in the policy direction issued by the CER in July 2014. The measures I have outlined are a key aspect of creating a sustainable funding model for water services delivery in Ireland. The introduction of regulated water charges creates a fair and equitable funding model for a new approach to water services delivery. The establishment of a new and sustainable funding model will help Irish Water to secure the level of investment required to upgrade public water and wastewater infrastructure and ensure the public receive a high quality drinking water supply and that wastewater is treated to high standards to avoid the pollution of watercourses and the coastline. This is the service citizens expect and deserve and it is what the Government is delivering.  I appreciate the good intentions of Deputy Barry Cowen in bringing forward the Bill, but, as I have outlined, the current policy is robust, there is a robust legislative framework behind it and we have fully addressed the objectives of the Bill in a far more comprehensive manner. Therefore, the Government will be opposing the Bill.
#MichelleMulherin	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-party	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-dob	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	504	I welcome the senior Minister and the two Ministers of State. I was listening to the contributions of Fianna Fáil Members in opening the debate on this Private Members' Bill. I was taken by the praise for it and the idea that there was a great principle behind it, that it was very succinct, that it was clear what it was about and that it could be encapsulated in a few words. One must suspend reality to take seriously the arguments made by Fianna Fáil Members on this issue. It is a red herring.There is no acknowledgement of the fact that in the way water charges are currently levied on commercial premises the concept of water in, water out is applied. That is what people who avail of both a water supply and wastewater treatment facility pay for. They are separated because in some instances people have a septic tank rather than a wastewater treatment facility. In all the time I served on a local authority, I never heard of a direction coming from Fianna Fáil-led Governments in cases of boil water or other notices that people should not be charged for water whether they were commercial or domestic users. People throughout the country are used to various notices about their water but in all the time I served on a council, there was never a direction or legislation not to charge people because the water was substandard. It was a case of carrying on. This issue will be addressed. The energy regulator is making provision for allowances where the water supply is not up to standard to ensure people receive a concession on their charges. Fianna Fáil's argument is a red herring. The kernel of the issue is Fianna Fáil presided over a water services capital investment plan that ground to a halt. I had a great deal of experience in this regard as a member of Mayo County Council. The polluter pays principle was implemented as part of the interpretation of an EU directive. It was implemented in unique style by Fianna Fáil, which meant that a local authority had to come up with a share of the funding. That was levied and fell foursquare on commercial users. The problem in Mayo was that when we ran out of planning levies to make up our portion of the polluter pays contribution, we had no hope of delivering water and sewerage schemes. Raw sewage to this day is pumped into the bay in Belmullet but the bay was designated as a protected area under the shellfish directive. This meant that not only could the council be sued by Europe if the quality water diminished by allowing raw sewage to be pumped into the bay, a case could be taken by the EPA. The position was similar in Foxford and Charlestown. There are leaks all over the system. Ballina, which is where I am from, is the largest town in the county and there are leaks all over the town's water network. Businesses, including hotels, are unable to operate. Such was the condition of the pipes that once a section a pipe was repaired, it burst further along the road. It was like an old tyre. When one repairs a puncture, the pressure increases in the next weakest part. It was an absolute disaster and Fianna Fáil had no plan to resolve this. We have a plan and that is Irish Water. According to the two year capital programme the Government published, €41 million will be invested in my county, of which €21 million will be used to implement water schemes with the balance spent on long overdue wastewater treatment plans in areas where SACs are polluted. Nothing would have been done under Fianna Fáil's plan. That is the point of principle. This is the problem we were faced with and had to resolve because the party did nothing about it. Counties such as mine with a low rates base and less development were never in the running. That is why large urban centres had wastewater and sewage treatment plants and we did not. The test for Irish Water is whether the schemes that have been on a list forever and a day will come to fruition. That will happen. That was a point of principle Fianna Fáil never cared to address when it was in government. This is a populist Bill, which is true to form for the party. The debate should be about affordability. People should be asked to pay something towards their water supply and it should be framed in a way that encourages them to conserve water and prevent water wastage. I made a submission to the Minister when he issued his draft water charges policy. The CER has been given a framework and Irish Water must take on surplus staff from local authority water services departments. I contended in my submission that it may cost €2 billion up to 2023 to take the additional staff on. While they may have to be taken on, that cost should be included in the calculation of water charges. The household allowance is 30,000 litres. In a rural area of my county, the domestic allowance for a group water scheme is 225,000 litres but this will be reduced to 30,000 litres. We have to be realistic about household allowances and they need to be increased. At the end of the day, we are asking everyone to pay for water, which is right, but let us not crucify them. The CER will come up with a formula based on the parameters it has been given but it is down to the Government to consider affordability. More problems will be visited on the doorsteps of Government Members if affordability is not tackled. We have to be realistic about charges. Building the capital infrastructure is a massive challenge but we cannot heap on all the charges now. There is a strong case for spreading the cost of the investment in badly needed infrastructure and I have only given one example in County Mayo. It is also an opportune time to examine the issue of water fluoridation. Since the inception of the policy, there have been many advances in science, understanding and so on. Considering the many concerns validly raised by citizens about adding something to water, it would be opportune for Irish Water, whether in conjunction with the Department of Health or one of our universities, to investigate the pros and cons of this policy. We can examine the addition of fluoride to water with fresh eyes while taking into account public health concerns. I support the Government's position on the legislation. This a case of Fianna Fáil Members once again coming forward with passion and bleeding hearts. To take them seriously at all, one has to suspend reality, go into the daze and enjoy the performance. There is no truth or depth to it whatsoever. God help the people if they ever get into power again.

I understand the sentiment behind the Bill. It is important that contaminated water is not charged for but I am opposed to domestic water charges in their totality. Deputy Mulherin referred to the Government having a plan and Fianna Fáil having none. The Government has Fianna Fáil's plan because Fianna Fáil, despite its position now, agreed as part of the disastrous bailout that there would be charges for water-----

The Government, therefore, is implementing that party's plan.It is there in black and white in the memorandum of understanding and the four-year programme, on page 26, where it is set out clearly that the Irish Government would both transfer responsibility for water services to a new public utility and introduce water charges. It is disingenuous of Fianna Fáil to say it now opposes water charges.

#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	510	Fianna Fáil may claim it would make exceptions such as those in the Bill, and we would certainly support it. Where water is contaminated, it is common sense. Nobody should have to pay for any poor-quality service. Fianna Fáil may say it would be more generous than the current Administration in ensuring that less of the burden would fall on those with lower incomes; however, I question whether it would do things any differently if it were on the other side of the House. Fianna Fáil agreed arrangements with the EU and the IMF. Fianna Fáil projected that it would bring in exactly the same amount of money as Fine Gael and the Labour Party are projecting. The only difference is that Fianna Fáil was going to do it one year earlier. Fianna Fáil and the two parties in government are well aware that the average charge currently quoted will rise as the full impact of charges takes effect and Irish Water ensures that all the costs of maintaining water services are recouped from water charges. We know the high cost of establishing Irish Water on top of the local authorities which continue to provide the service. The cost will be recouped when the short-term allowances currently proposed are removed and the full costs are passed on to householders. I have said before, as have many other commentators, that it will eventually entail a charge of more than double the €278 currently quoted for a household of two adults. Even as things stand, many households, depending on their composition, will face water bills well above €278. Before the Minister of State went on his summer holidays, he maintained that the average charge would be €240 per household. During the summer break, when the House was not sitting, the real figures were released and we know that a household with two adult children, even if they have no income, will pay between €480 and €490. This is a huge charge that will hit low-income and middle-income families, on top of the property tax, with no account taken of ability to pay. There are people who cannot put bread on the table. I do not know if the Minister of State realises this. I am sure he met some of them over the summer. They are in dire straits. They are people in negative equity, who cannot pay their mortgages and whose mortgage payments nearly equal their total household incomes. I plead with the Minister to do something about it. It is a serious issue. Deputy Mulherin referred to affordability. I welcome the fact that she, as a Government Deputy, did that.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	511	Hear, hear.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	512	She is pleading with the Minister to deal with this issue because she has heard about it. A section of the population cannot survive even now. Water charges are a serious imposition on top of the property tax and other taxes that will come in. They will further squeeze those households, which are in the difficult position of trying to make ends meet. That is why we are totally opposed to water charges. People are receiving information packs in the post from Irish Water, which include a form requesting personal public service, PPS, numbers, which is to do with claiming the allowances for children aged under 18. Our position on these forms is clear. We are not recommending that people do not return the form, because that is a matter for adults to make up their own minds on. While some are telling people not to return the forms, we are clearly advising people that if they do not return the forms they may lose out on allowances due to them. Some advocate that householders return the packs to Irish Water with a message referring to the fact that they have not signed the contract and are, therefore, not consenting to being charged. Some even suggest that there is no legal basis for the charge and that people who do not fill out the form will not be billed. This is nonsense and Sinn Féin will not be party to deluding people. Those advocating such an approach have provided no legal evidence to back up their position. The only way water charges can be overturned is through legislation in the House. While I support this small Bill, we need to work for the total abolition of water charges on householders.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	513	Ordinary citizens and families across the State are being forced to pay yet another regressive tax to repay the banking debt that was not theirs in the first place. Those responsible for creating the economic crisis, the collapse of our public finances, forced emigration and mass unemployment remain unaccountable for their actions. This Bill is a typical Fianna Fáil stunt. Its members come in here and shake their fists, but cannot accept that this is part of their great master plan. Fianna Fáil supports water charges and this sort of sideshow will fool nobody. Sinn Féin believes the political choices a government makes are defined by its view of society, its ambition, its ideological anchor and the interests it seeks to represent. The Fine Gael and Labour Party Government continues to make choices that are not in the interests of the vast majority of citizens and that are in contravention of the mandate it was given by the people in 2011. Despite its pledge to do things differently, Fine Gael and the Labour Party have recycled the failed politics and the old way of doing business, which was the cause of the economic and political crisis in the first place. The water charge was conceived by the previous Fianna Fáil and Green Party Government, which agreed the unfair policy with the troika as part of its financial bailout in December 2010. At the time, the Government said it had got the best deal. Sinn Féin strongly disagreed. When the Dáil voted on a motion on Wednesday 15 December 2010 to support the terms of the financial bailout, Sinn Féin voted to reject the deal, as did the Labour Party, whose members are absent tonight. Its then leader, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, said:Labour is opposing the motion because what is on offer is a bad deal for Ireland. In the coming election we will seek a mandate to renegotiate the programme.As we know, the Labour leadership did no such thing. It did a U-turn in government and is implementing the very policy against which it rallied. Before coming here I checked the Labour Party's website and looked at a statement it issued just after the announcement by the Fianna Fáil and Green Party Government that it would introduce water charges, as follows:The Labour Party believes that water is a basic and fundamental need and should not be treated like a market commodity ... Charging for domestic water, in the light of our current taxation system, will only add to inequality, since such charges don’t take account of people’s ability to pay.The Labour Party was right, but it is wrong now to do a U-turn on that position. Providing reliable, high-quality water and sewerage services which are economically sustainable is a major challenge for any government. Sinn Féin has first-hand experience and a strong record of delivering exactly this in the North. In May 2007, when the power-sharing institutions at Stormont were restored, Sinn Féin decided to reverse the plans by British direct rule Ministers to introduce household water charges. Sinn Féin also ruled out any future privatisation of these critical public services by ensuring that the Executive, under the Northern Ireland Department for Regional Development, remained the sole shareholder of the newly established utility company Northern Ireland Water. Today, according to the Utility Regulator in the North, households save an average of €490 annually as a result of the decision Sinn Féin took. We did not leave it there. We did not just reverse the British decision to introduce water charges. Between 2007 and 2011, we injected €1 billion in investment in major upgrades in the North's water and sewerage infrastructure, benefitting almost 1 million households and businesses. It has improved drinking water quality, protected the environment and supported the local economy. Fine Gael and the Labour Party know exactly what was achieved in the North because since January 2012, the Government has been in contact with the Department for Regional Development and Northern Ireland Water exploring all these matters.Despite seeing how best practice and putting citizen's needs first delivers an efficient water and sewerage service, Fine Gael chose to impose the unfair household water charge on families as promised by the previous Fianna Fáil Government. Households will receive their first bills in January 2015 and it is up to every person to decide how to deal with them. We will not lead them down the path of telling them there are no consequences for not paying and then abandoning them when the consequences of their choice become apparent. Sinn Féin believes households already pay for these services through their income tax and that citizens should not be forced to pay twice through a new separate bill for water and sewerage services. Sinn Féin is vigorously opposed to the introduction of these charges. The Fine Gael Bill supports the introduction of charges as it was Fine Gael's proposal which is now being delivered by that party and Labour. Sinn Féin believes the best way to provide reliefs for households is to abandon regressive charges altogether. We will in the next number of weeks show in our alternative budget how we can reduce the deficit, balance the books and, at the same time, abandon the nonsensical idea of introducing a regressive water charge for people the length and breadth of the State. I ask the Government and those who were in the previous Government to see the light and come around to the view that water charges should not be imposed on families already crippled by seven austerity budgets.
#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	514	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate this evening. I oppose totally the introduction of the water tax on the citizens of this country because we already pay for water. Now, the Government will make us pay on the double for the same water supply. The purpose of the Bill tonight is to exempt those who have received a product from Irish Water which is not fit for purpose. It shows the fallacy of the Irish Water project the Government has pursued. Why should we even have to look at introducing legislation to protect consumers and citizens in this way? That is the overall problem. There is no doubt that the Government and Irish Water have set out to treat citizens as customers and as people operating in a free market to buy a product. This product is not fit for purpose for many households. Approximately 36,000 households do not have a drinkable water supply yet the Government proposes to charge them for it. It is not acceptable to engage in the gymnastics of saying there is water in and water out and that if one is in an area with a public sewer supply one will still have to pay as one can still use the water to flush one's toilets. Any company that produces a product consumers cannot use must refund the costs. That would happen with any other product in the so-called "market place" the Government wants to see us all in. In his contribution earlier, the Minister spoke about Denmark and how it achieved a 12% reduction of water usage on the introduction of metering. He did not say it was on the introduction of charges. It was on the introduction of metering and technology to conserve water. The project the Government has embarked on is not about conserving water supplies, it is about generating revenue. That is the sole purpose. Irish Water has the right if it does not achieve the revenue intended from charging to revert to CER to have the tariff revised to ensure its targets are reached. That makes a mockery of the whole system that is being introduced. Citizens are being forced to pay on the double for a service that everybody should have as of right.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-09-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	515	I am opposed to the introduction of this water tax. While the motion is straightforward and makes sense, it is a bit cynical of Fianna Fáil to move it as it would introduce the water tax if it was in power. At the same time, the proposal before the House is a straightforward recognition that people who have water that is contaminated or needs to be boiled should not pay for the product. The Government is making it a product by establishing Irish Water. It is a fact that €1.2 billion was collected through VAT and motor tax to pay for water services over the last number of years. Where has that money gone? Why did it not go to conservation of water and the fixing of leaky pipes? This tax, which the Government will introduce by whatever means, will take more money out of the pockets of those who spend in our local economies. The idea of saying there will be allowances on which CER has not been able to make up its mind for children, those with medical needs and even those who have to boil their water makes no difference. Irish Water wants to raise €500 million out of this. If allowances are made in some areas, other households will have to pay for that to make up the €500 million. I concur with Deputy Pringle that Irish Water will be able to go to the energy regulator and say it cannot raise the money it needs and require a change. This is about another austerity tax, not conservation of our water. It is not about supplying water to the people of this country. The 1.7 million households which will pay consist of people who have children and medical needs and everything else associated with water. Water is a human right. That is a message the Government has forgotten. It is a human right and it should not be paid for this way. It should be paid for through progressive taxation or a 1% wealth tax generating €500 million. The Taoiseach said today that not introducing Irish Water would mean bringing in more taxes. Bring in more taxes on wealth. That is what should be done in a progressive taxation system. While water metering is taking place, over the last 15 days not one water meter was installed in Crumlin. The people in the community came out and said to GMS "No, we do not want them". Peaceful protesting has meant that in 15 days not one water meter has gone in. GMS moved out of the area this morning as it could not put the water meters in. These people know that even if they do not have a water meter, they will still get bills in January. People hate and resent this tax. They will have to make up their own minds as to what they want to do as part of a campaign and decide if they are willing to take on the Government. The Government will have a great deal to answer for. Many people were congratulating the new Ministers. If the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, keeps going the way he is, he will be thought of in the same way as Deputy Phil Hogan has been thought of.

In the interest of probity, the HSE is obliged to ensure that a person’s eligibility is correctly recorded in line with the eligibility legislation and the national guidelines. The HSE aims to ensure that every person who is entitled to a medical card or a GP visit card is given the opportunity to avail of his or her entitlement. All medical card and GP visit card holders are subject to a periodic review of eligibility to determine continuing eligibility. As part of the review process, where a person who holds a medical card under the EU Regulations, there is only a requirement to demonstrate to the HSE that they continue to qualify under the EU Regulations and there is no requirement to submit income details and details of savings.  If a person is considered subject to Irish social security legislation, the person will not qualify for a Medical Card under EU legislation, but may qualify for a means-tested Medical Card under national legislation. (A person is considered subject to Irish social security legislation if s/he is in receipt of a contributory Irish social welfare payment or engaged in work in Ireland and subject to PRSI.) In carrying out reviews of eligibility under EU Regulations the HSE has responsibility to establish if an applicant is subject to Irish social security legislation.  Any person who has been issued with a medical card under EU Regulations and has had it withdrawn should contact the HSE to confirm that their circumstance has not changed.

Medical card holders are required to pay prescription charges. Prescription charges are not payable in respect of items supplied under the Long Term Illness Scheme.  In the case of persons who have both the medical card and an LTI book, it was Health Service Executive (HSE) policy that they should use their medical card to access medicines. The main reason for this was that when a retail mark-up of 20% was payable to pharmacists for items supplied under the LTI Scheme it cost the HSE considerably more to supply medicines under the LTI Scheme than under the GMS Scheme.  Following a review of the rates of fees payable to health professionals (under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act, 2009) the elimination of the retail mark-up was announced on the 2nd of July 2013. As a result, the HSE revised its policy on this matter and persons who have both a medical card and LTI can now access medication for their qualifying long term illness condition(s) under the LTI Scheme.  The HSE is actively in the process of identifying any person who had eligibility under the Long Term Illness (LTI) Scheme and who, while having concurrent eligibility under the Medical Card Scheme, paid prescription charges prior to the 1st December 2013 for drugs, medicines, medical and surgical appliances related to their qualifying long term illness(es) dispensed under the GMS Scheme, by a registered pharmacist. The HSE is collating the details regarding the numbers of people affected and how much they will be refunded. It is anticipated that the HSE will be in a position to make refunds to the relevant individuals in the coming months.

The move towards individualised budgeting also mirrors the wider changes in the health sector described in Future Health: A Strategic Framework for Reform of the Health Service 2012 – 2015. The move towards an individualised budgeting framework raises legal and practical issues, and will require careful consideration and planning. Future Health explains that central to the introduction of individualised budgeting will be suitable financial systems; transparent and comprehensive governance arrangements; a National Standard Needs Assessment framework; underpinning legislation and the introduction of a regulatory system for providers to ensure quality and safety for the recipients of social services. Demonstration projects are already underway to examine the practical aspects of introducing this major change in the disability sector and to establish the costs and benefits. An analysis of the projects will be necessary to determine their wider applicability, clarify the issues which must be resolved before the projects can be scaled up, and identify the best way forward. The completion of this analysis is a primary recommendation in the VFM Review and is required for all significant public service expenditure proposals.

I have been advised by the Department of Education and Skills that board members do not receive payment for their work as members of Boards of Management. I understand that details of currently serving Boards of Management can be obtained directly from individual schools. The provision of health related therapy supports to children attending the school in question is a service matter for the Health Service Executive. Accordingly, I have arranged for this part of the question to be referred to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy.
