They have come all the way from New Hampshire to be with us. They missed out on our 100th anniversary celebration by one day. They are more than welcome. I have received notice from the following Senators that they propose to raise the following matters: Senator Eugene Murphy - The need for the Minister for Social Protection to make a statement on the continued provision of the hot school meals programme. Senator Lisa Chambers - The need for the Minister for Transport to make a statement on the exclusion of the western rail corridor in the updated EU trans-European transport network map and the timeline for the publishing of the all-island strategic rail review. Senator Maria Byrne - The need for the Minister for Health to make a statement on the waiting lists for child mental health appointments in Limerick. Senator Tim Lombard - The need for the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science to provide an update on the proposal for a second school of veterinary medicine. Senator Mark Wall - The need for the Minister for Education to make a statement on the provision of additional secondary school places in the Newbridge and Kildare town areas of south Kildare for the school year beginning September 2023. Senator Marie Sherlock - The need for the Minister for Education to provide an update on the review of the after-hours use of school buildings. Senator John Cummins - The need for the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to increase the maximum market value of properties which can be purchased with the assistance of the local authority home loan mortgage. Senator Martin Conway - The need for the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science to make a statement on the payment of employer grants under the apprentice grant system when administrative errors have occurred.

I welcome the Minister of State. I thank him for the good work he is doing in the Department as part of the Government's programme. We appreciate it. The free school meals programme is outstanding. I compliment the Government, which has constantly acknowledged this. More schools will be in the programme from this year and there will be a significant increase in funding. In 2017, the figure was €47 million. In the most recent budget, €68.1 million was put aside for the free school meals programme. It is a vital programme. It ensures that children who may not get a hot meal at home, whatever the circumstances are, will have a meal in school. The vast majority of the general public think it is a very good scheme. There are difficulties with the programme and I am sure the Minister of State is aware of them. I have spoken to a few of the suppliers. They are warning they will not be able to continue to provide the service in the coming months due to rising costs. We see the cost of fuel increasing because of the war. We see the cost of food increasing. One of the biggest costs the suppliers have is packaging. Those preparing meals and food must have the proper packaging and hygiene standards. It is very important. The education and training boards in Ireland have expressed serious concern about the situation. I do not believe the rates of payment have changed in ten years. It is €2.90 per student for a hot meal, €1.40 for a lunch and 60 cent for a breakfast. These rates have not changed in almost a decade. I am sure the Minister of State and the House will agree that this is not sustainable. It is important to state that the Government is committed to the scheme. I compliment the Department of Social Protection, the Minister, the Minister of State and the officials on the work they are doing in respect of it. I acknowledge that the scheme is being evaluated at present but I warn on the time span for this. We cannot afford to hang around too long on this matter. More and more suppliers will drop out. This would be a tragedy. It is one of the best schemes we could have. It is focused on young people who may not be getting a meal at home. From speaking to them, people genuinely believe that the scheme is fantastic. The Government is aware of this. The Minister of State is very aware of it, as is the Minister, Deputy Humphreys. I am worried about the time span for the review. When will the evaluation come to an end? I do not know whether the Minister of State will have news for me on this today. If he does not, I urge that we carry out the evaluation as quickly as possible so we do not allow a situation to arise in any school in the scheme whereby a child would go without this very valuable meal.I will not take up any more time on it. I have made my case to the Minister of State and he understands where I am coming from. I appreciate the Government understands there is a problem there but we need to address it as quickly as possible.

As Chair of the food poverty working group, which includes representatives of government Departments and civil society, I am a strong supporter of the school meals programme and its recent expansion. The school meals programme provides funding towards the provision of food services to some 1,600 schools and organisations benefitting 260,000 children. The objective of the programme is to provide regular, nutritious food to children to position them to take full advantage of the education provided to them. The programme is an important component of policies to encourage school attendance and extra educational achievement. Budget 2022 provided €68.1 million for the programme with an additional €9 million provided to allow access to all new DEIS schools from September 2022. Additional funding for the programme has been provided for 2023 bringing the total to €91.6 million. This represents a 49% funding increase in the period since 2020. In March 2022, the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, announced an extension of the DEIS status to an additional 320 schools from September. In July, the Minister of State, Deputy Humphreys, announced that access to the hot school meal option would be extended to the 282 newly designated DEIS primary schools and that the cold lunch option would be extended to the 38 newly designated DEIS secondary schools from September, benefitting some 60,000 children. Funding under the school meals programme can be provided for breakfast, snack, cold lunch, dinner, hot school meals and after-school clubs and is based on a maximum rate per child per day, depending on the type of meal being provided. The current school meals programme was set up in 2003. The funding rates for the various meal options were set at that time. However, the hot school meal option was introduced in 2019, to facilitate the provision of hot meals prepared off-site to pupils attending primary schools which did not have cooking facilities on-site. The hot school meal rate of €2.90 per meal per day was set in 2019.  The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and I are committed to continuing to expand the school meals programme and building further on the significant extension of the programme in recent years. In this regard, an evaluation of the school meals programme to review all elements of the programme, including the funding rates currently being provided for the various meal options, has been commissioned. The final report is due to be completed by the end of the year and will help to inform future decisions around this important programme. Issues regarding the funding rates will be considered in the context of this evaluation. I thank the Senator for raising this matter as it is a key and crucial to our work in the Department.

I am particularly glad he points out that this evaluation should be finished by the end of the year and that the cost factor in terms of the meals will be looked at because that is what is needed now. Again, I complement him on the work he does in that area. The funding is even more significant than I thought which is great news. As I have said, I spoke to one supplier last night and one or two others last week, and a few schools had contacted me as well. The cost of packaging and other things are massive at the moment and we all understand that cost-of-living issue is there and I am sure the Government accepts that as well. I will not detain the Minister of State any longer on this. I welcome his response and thank him for coming the House this morning to give us time on this matter.

To give a little more information on the evaluation commissioned earlier this year, it involved close consultation with all the stakeholders and workshops and interviews have been conducted with teachers, principles, children as well as suppliers. Key issues to be explored as part of the evaluation include: whether the schools meals programme meets its aims; what the practicalities are for schools moving to a hot school meals option; what works well and what is not working well; how the programme can be better delivered; the extent to which the school meals programme has improved school attendance and education attainment; how the scheme compares with other programmes in other countries; what might be the implications of extending the scheme; what are the implications of the EU child guarantee for the school meals programme; and indeed the cost issue the Senator has raised as well. As I said, the final report is due to be completed at the end of the year; we are hoping it will be done in the next two weeks.

#LisaChambers	unknown-#LisaChambers-party	unknown-#LisaChambers-dob	unknown-#LisaChambers-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-13 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	9	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, to the Chamber. I understand the Minister for Transport, Deputy Ryan, is at Cabinet this morning so I appreciate her taking this matter. My question is in relation to the western rail corridor which I have raised on numerous occasions in this Chamber. Last week, quite disappointingly, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Ryan, and the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Naughton, both attended an EU meeting where they welcomed the inclusion of Galway Port and the Navan rail line onto the EU Ten-T core network map - which is basically every member state identifying what their core transport network is in the country - and they did not see fit to mention the western rail corridor or to take the opportunity to include it on the Ten-T map. The western rail corridor used to be on that map. It was removed by the former Minister for Transport, an Tánaiste, Deputy Varadkar, and we have been campaigned to have it on the map ever since. My question relates to what the Minister of State proposes to do to get the western rail corridor onto the Ten-T map and to the all-island rail review in which the western rail corridor is currently languishing waiting to get the green light from Government for money to get this project off the ground. My questions then are on the western rail corridor, Ten-T network map and the all-island rail review. 
#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-13 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	10	On behalf of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Ryan, I thank Senator Chambers for the opportunity to address this issue in the House today. While I am not all over the detail of it, I have a prepared answer from the Minister who, as the Senator quite rightly said, is currently in Cabinet. I am aware the Senator has raised this issue on many occasions. As a colleague of hers for many years, I know she has continued to raise this issue and I am hoping there is something in the reply that might satisfy her. As the Senator is aware, two reports were published in relation to the proposed reopening of the western rail corridor phases two and three and the Minister for Transport brought the conclusions of both these reports to Government in December 2020. The first is known as the EY report which was commissioned by Iarnród Éireann in line with the decision of the previous Government. This report consisted of a financial and economic appraisal of the potential reopening of the western rail corridor in phases two and three. There was criticism of some aspects of that report, particularly by those who advocated for a reopening of the corridor. However, as it has been said, two reports were published and the second is known as the Joint Assistance to Support Projects in European Regions, JASPERS, review. JASPERS is an agency established by the European Commission and the European Investment Bank to assist member states in making investments in European regions such as the west of Ireland. In October 2020, the JASPERS review concluded that the findings of the EY report were not unreasonable. On the projected cost and demand, areas of the EY report, which were subject to some public criticism, were found by the JASPERS review to be within reasonable ranges although perhaps based on a design solution and operational plan which might be considered overly optimistic. However, in its four key observations of the JASPERS review, that in my mind should be particularly focused upon, the agency notes the proposed reopening of the western rail corridor did not address any identified social or transport constraint; did not sit within any broader strategic framework for the development of rail in Ireland; did not contribute towards our climate action objectives; and would not attract EU funding in its present form. As any of those observations would be important to a proposed investment of hundreds of millions of taxpayers' money, to have all four observed about a proposal is clearly a concern. Noting the conclusion in the JASPERS review, that there was a lack of strategic context for planning investment in the heavy rail network, the Minister for Transport, in partnership with the Minister for Infrastructure in Northern Ireland, announced in 2021 his intention to undertake an all-Ireland strategic rail review. This review considers how the rail network on the island of Ireland can improve in order to promote sustainability, connectivity, enhanced regional accessibility between the major cities, and support balanced regional development. The review examines how the railways are used, how they could be used in future, and how the network can evolve to serve the people of the island of Ireland while achieving policy goals. I refer to rail networks and the trans-European transport network, TEN-T, map. The Department of Transport indicated to the European Commission that its position on TEN-T rail network would be informed by the results of the ongoing all-Ireland strategic rail review and that it was hoped the outcome of the review would be reflected in the map. The strategic rail review is being undertaken in co-operation with the Department for Infrastructure in Northern Ireland and it will inform the development of the railway sector on the island of Ireland in the coming decades. The review will consider the potential scope for improved rail services along various existing or future corridors of the network. That scope includes the western rail corridor and connectivity with Northern Ireland. Work on the review is at an advanced stage and a key consideration of the analysis is how the rail network can support regional and rural connectivity. The Minister for Transport is looking forward to the draft report of the review being made available shortly and it will be published once it receives appropriate ministerial approval on both sides of the Border.

Three reports have been published on the western rail corridor in recent times. The Minister of State rightly referred to the EY report, which has been completely discredited. As to the response it received, to say there was criticisms of some aspects of the report is being very kind. I will not delve into it further on this occasion. I often wonder how the JASPERS review might have viewed Knock Airport when it was in its infancy. The airport would not have been built if the same approach had been taken in analysing the prospective success of such projects in a region such as the west. What is missing from the Minister of State's reply is the Bradley report on the western rail corridor that was commissioned by West=On=Track. It provided Professor John Bradley's appraisal of the economic and social benefits of the western rail corridor and showed that not only would it be financially viable, but it would bring social and economic benefit to the region. It would do exactly what the Government says it wants to do, that is, to connect the region and bring balanced regional development. We have been told for quite some time that the draft report can be expected imminently. It would be welcome to have an approximate date as to when we can expect to see the report. I have grave concerns about ministerial approval, North and South, being required to publish the report. There is no a functioning Executive in Northern Ireland and we do not know when we will get one. We cannot allow this to constrain us from progressing an important project for an entire region.

She mentioned Professor John Bradley's report, which I will certainly raise with the Department of Transport. She is correct in that it is an approximate date for the publishing of the draft report. The Minister expects to receive a draft report of the review shortly. The intention is to publish it as soon as possible thereafter in co-operation with the Department for Infrastructure in Northern Ireland, whose Minister would also need to approve the report. With the current situation in Northern Ireland, this could be problematic and delay the whole process. I will also raise this with the Department of Transport. I thank the Senator for raising this matter.

When looking at the rail network map for the country, an entire region - the west and north west - does not feature. County Donegal has no rail link, County Monaghan has no rail link and the service to County Mayo is fairly limited, yet we have emissions reduction targets in transport of 75%. That will not be achievable if we do not connect one third of the country by rail link. As to the requirement of ministerial approval from Northern Ireland, the message needs to get back to the Minister for Transport that he needs to go back to the drawing board on this matter. It is unacceptable that we in the Republic would be constrained because of the lack of an Execute in Northern Ireland. That will not wash with the people of the west and north west.

More than 100 children and young adults have been waiting for more than a year for mental health appointments in Limerick and the mid-west, and this is not good enough. I am aware there are many problems recruiting consultant child psychiatrists. While some have been recruited in recent times, there are six teams and they are in the process of developing a seventh but it has not happened to date. It was reported in the Limerick Post that 371 children and young adults were awaiting an assessment during the period of June to September 2022, 103 of whom were waiting more than one year. This stark figure is high in a short timespan. The figure represents 9.7% of the overall national waiting list for child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, which stands at approximately 3,800. According to available national figures, this places services in the mid-west as the fifth lowest in terms of waiting numbers. It is more concerning that the region is in fifth place. Do more programmes need to be brought into schools? How do we begin to address this? It is frightening to find that many children and young adults are on the waiting list while availing of services. I am concerned there are probably more children and young adults not on a waiting list who have not come forward and are experiencing issues. We need to have a wider conversation on this issue. What plans has the Department to introduce programmes into schools and to deal with these people, especially the 100 individuals who are waiting more than one year?
#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-13 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	15	I thank the Senator for raising this matter. I am delighted to be in the Seanad to discuss the issue of CAMHS waiting lists in the Senator's community healthcare organisation, CHO, and nationally because it is something on which I have put a huge focus. The Government and I remain committed to the development of all aspects of mental health services. As the Senator will be aware, the mental health budget for 2023 is in excess of €1.2 billion, which is another record budget for mental health services, and a continued focus will be on reducing waiting lists for CAMHS and primary care psychology services. The CAMHS waiting list nationally was 2,755 in December 2020. It increased to 3,556 in December 2021 and, unfortunately, as of October this year, the provisional figure was 4,043, of which 398, or approximately 10% of the national waiting list, were in CHO 3, which covers the Limerick area. This figure is a slight increase on the same period last year, which was 355. In the past year, we have seen an unprecedented number of referrals presenting to CAMHS all over the country. There were 25% more referrals last year than any previous year. We saw a huge spike in the number of young people presenting with eating disorders, with 504 entering the clinical programmes last year. When this programme was devised in 2016-17, they expected approximately 60 children would be referred. Many children get referred to CAMHS but they do not all meet the criteria. Only 2% of children who are referred need CAMHS supports, with others, for example, needing supports provided by primary care psychology services, community teams and the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS. It is important to note that the CAMHS waiting list can relate to capacities in other parts of the system where young people may not receive early intervention and their needs may escalate requiring referral to CAMHS. Access to the CAMHS system is based on a clinical assessment, with urgent cases being prioritised. Data made available to the Department of Health indicates that the mid-west CHO, encompassing Limerick city and county, has the fifth lowest waiting list for CAMHS services, as the Senator said. The CAMHS service in the mid-west CHO is currently provided by six consultant child psychiatrist-led multidisciplinary teams. There is a seventh team, as the Senator said, in development that will facilitate additional capacity for service provision and a welcome, more timely response to referrals. Over recent months, significant progress has been made in recruiting for the filling of existing vacancies and new development posts. However, there are ongoing issues with recruitment in particular disciplines, especially consultant child psychiatrists, which is an issue reflected nationally. Several other disciplines are also affected, including nursing and psychology. My priority is to improve access to CAMHS and reduce waiting lists. As the Senator said, what else can we do? It will include measures such as better links with primary care or disability services and greater use of e-mental health responses.One of the CAMHS e-mental health sites nationally is identified for CHO 3 and the Limerick area. This will be very welcome. Referrals to CAMHS inpatient beds may not be appropriate in some instances where other options, such as CAMHS community teams, may be more suitable and effective. Each referral to an inpatient bed is triaged and assessed for overall need through a weekly teams conference of all four inpatient units. Regarding the waiting lists, I have placed great focus on this aspect and secured funding to try to reduce it. Working through the HSE, we have contacted the various CHOs to see what they can do. We did this in primary care psychology. We targeted the waiting lists of over 12 months first, because these are the children needing these services the most. Unfortunately, when a priority case comes in, children who may have milder needs get bumped down the list, and this is not what we want to see.

I apologise because I meant to acknowledge the work she and her team have done to date. The situation has improved a great deal, but we also have a long way to go. I welcome that Limerick is going to be used for a pilot scheme, as the Minister of State highlighted. When I see the figures in this regard, they are stark. I refer to the number of young people needing support and care. Good work is going on in the primary care centres and with different teams. The major issue, though, is how to recruit replacement staff when vacancies occur and how to get these posts and services back up and running as quickly as possible. This is the kernel of the issue here. There are so many organisations, like the Children's Grief Centre and others, that support care. Many of these organisations do this voluntarily. Are we seeking to expand the programme, include organisations that have the expertise and experience in this area and bring them in to work alongside the HSE team? This is just a suggestion, but anything we can do to address the waiting lists will certainly be most welcome. I look forward to a further response later regarding how we are going to reduce the waiting lists and bring down the numbers in this regard.

One has been identified for CHO 3 and the Limerick area. I have seen this model work well in the Roscommon area. It is one of the key recommendations of the Maskey report, which resulted from the situation that occurred in south Kerry. As the Senator will be aware, an audit and a review are under way now. The audit concerns the HSE. We are auditing all 73 CAMHS teams in respect of access to them, whether they are meeting their standard operating procedures, whether the full teams are staffed and where the gaps and deficiencies are. We are also examining, for example, the issue regarding prescribing practices. In parallel to this undertaking, the Mental Health Commission is running a similar review. I hope I will have all these data available to me in the first quarter of 2023. This will give me, the Department and the HSE data we never had previously. If we have to make best practice changes, we will. A huge amount of work is being done in CHO 3. I know the lead consultant psychiatrist there, Dr. Foley, who is doing phenomenal work. I refer again to the number of complex cases being referred in. I spoke recently about a situation where one young person was just released from CAMHS care after four years. She had 96 interventions and saw the team on 96 occasions. There are, therefore, many complex cases that need much work and support. It takes a lot of time, but my complete focus is on trying to reduce this waiting list. I thank the Senator for her suggestions. We can talk about them later.

It is great to have him here. My Commencement matter this morning concerns the potential and capacity in the veterinary sector. We have one veterinary school in the State. It has been in place for more than 100 years and University College Dublin, UCD, has done a phenomenal job during that time. What I wish to debate today, though, is building capacity in this sector. We have a veterinary industry which has served society competently over the last 100 years, but we must change our approach concerning how many veterinarians we have in our State. This aspect must be examined. Our agricultural industry has changed completely. It is a global performer when it comes to veterinary husbandry and how this sector operates. We also have a major small practice element now, which was not traditionally present. Unfortunately, as well, our vets are getting older. The age demographic of our population of vets has changed significantly in the last two decades. We must change our approach in many ways in this area, therefore, and try to get more vets into the system. As the Minister of State is probably aware, 82 places were allocated to study veterinary medicine last year. Under the Central Applications Office, CAO, applications process, ultimately 601 points were required to get a place on the course. That is a significant threshold. The course was chosen by 581 people as their first choice. This shows the interest that exists. We had 500 disappointed applicants. There is significant interest, particularly among younger people, in studying veterinary medicine. The capacity for the number of places required does not exist now. Unfortunately, because of this lack of capacity, as the Minister of State is very much aware, 70 students are now doing first-year veterinary medicine in Poland, while another 30 students are undertaking such studies in Hungary. We do not have the figures for England and Scotland. Overall, however, we have hundreds of students studying this course abroad. This alone shows the need for a second veterinary school here. We must explore thoroughly how we can accommodate this potential in the sector.  As an active farmer and a member of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, vets tell me about the deficiency in the numbers in their profession every time they come into the yard, as well as the need for change and more vets to go through training. Ireland offering only 82 places to study veterinary medicine is a significant barrier to the development of the industry. It will also impact how small practices are going to develop. Our major worry is that the large animal practices will really suffer. This will be the significant driver in this area. More people will be attracted to the small animal practices than to the larger ones, and this will have a significant knock-on effect on our credibility as the premier food-producing nation in the world.  This is, therefore, a major problem and for this reason we must move to act fast. There is potential in the system to have a second veterinary school. I mention Munster in particular in this regard because there are many bovine, pig and horse units in the province. We have so much potential down there. A second veterinary school there would be a counterbalance to what we have in the UCD model. We must have movement on this new college. University College Cork, UCC, has great potential in this regard and should be considered as the location. I realise that University of Limerick, UL, is also interested. Looking at County Cork alone, the figures in this context are frighteningly large. There are nearly 13,500 farmers in the county. Of these, 4,500 are in dairy farming, while there are also pig and poultry units. Equally, the cluster of veterinary practices in the county could cater for the practical work required in training vets. Places like Riverview Veterinary Group and Abbeyville Veterinary Hospital, for example, have the potential to be a part of this endeavour when it comes to veterinary practices. We need movement on this issue. The sector needs this to happen. Without a flow of new vets being trained here, we will not reach our capabilities and this will be a significant drawback for our society.

I am taking this Commencement matter on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Harris, who is attending a Cabinet meeting. The Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science does not place a quota on the number of places on veterinary medicine courses offered by higher education institutions. As such, the number of places provided each year is determined by the institutions themselves in line with their capacity. However, in light of Funding the Future, the funding and reform policy framework for higher education, which specifically identifies skills needs as a priority when expanding provision of higher education, the Higher Education Authority, HEA, recently sought expressions of interest from higher education institutions interested in building capacity in dentistry, pharmacy, medicine, nursing and veterinary from the academic year 2024-25 or 2025-26. This process was designed to respond swiftly to national skills needs, as outlined by the Senator, and expressions of interest were sought from institutions with the capability to expand existing courses or offer new programmes in these areas. Expression of interest is the first stage of a two-part selection process. On receipt of the expressions of interest, the HEA, with the support of the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, will shortlist expressions that show evidence that an institution has the potential to build capacity in the identified discipline in the specified timeframe. The HEA has informed the Department that 39 expressions of interest have been received across the five disciplines. Of these, 20 have proposed the delivery of new courses and 19 are proposing to expand on existing courses in the selected disciplines. Overall, responses represent a rapid, nationwide engagement with the call, with expressions of interest in developing new courses in the areas of pharmacy and veterinary from all four provinces. The HEA is currently reviewing applications with a view to moving to the second stage of the assessment process, which will involve a review by an expert panel. Panels may be comprised of representatives from professional or regulatory bodies, international experts, and representatives from the HEA, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, the Department of Health and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, as appropriate. Applications are due by Monday, 16 January 2023. I understand the HEA has been in contact with the relevant institutions to advise them of the next steps.

At the moment, UCD, in the middle of Dublin city, provides the veterinary courses for Ireland. If you look at the actual demographics, particularly for the bovine population, the majority are in Munster. We need a geographical spread of placements when it comes to veterinary colleges. I would be concerned if the Department was looking just to expand. We need to look to the future and future-proof this model. We need a new campus with a new university, just to give a little diversity when it comes to the capabilities of these courses. We have small animal and large animal practices. We now need a real focus on where the food industry is going to be and how that is going to develop. I would be of the view that an expansion of the campus is not the key here. We need a new campus and that new campus needs to incorporate large animals as the key focus. If we can do that, we will future-proof our industry going forward. This is a multi-billion euro industry we are talking about here, which will not survive unless we have this line of vets going forward. The new campus scenario has to be top of the agenda. I would be very disappointed if we came back with an expansion.

As the Senator will understand, this also relates to workforce planning requirements. There are significant practical elements and placement requirements as part of veterinary medicine programme provision, including appropriate laboratory facilities to ensure these courses meet the necessary standards of the Veterinary Council of Ireland. Workforce planning requirements for the veterinary medicine sector require advice from and consultation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. That consultation is under way. The Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, and the Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins, are committed to this and have made clear that planning for current and future public sector skill needs, including in veterinary medicine, is a priority for their Department. The HEA process that is under way will inform further developments in respect of provision in this key skills area. I will ask the Minister and the Minister of State to keep the Senator informed about this process.
#MarkWall	unknown-#MarkWall-party	unknown-#MarkWall-dob	unknown-#MarkWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-13 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	23	I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him for taking the time to be with us. The Minister for Education will be very aware of this issue as I have raised it with her on a number of occasions. Indeed, it is almost one year to the day since she met with Members of the Oireachtas from south Kildare to discuss this issue, following a meeting arranged by the Ceann Comhairle. In fairness, in the following weeks places were found for children, with the addition of extra classes and schools working across applications to ensure nobody was left without a school place or left behind. Unfortunately, we are here again in another December. For the past two months or so, I and other Oireachtas colleagues in south Kildare have received growing calls from parents who are worried sick that their children will not have a secondary school place this coming September. It is an issue we discussed at a Kildare County Council Oireachtas meeting last week and it is one I have brought up every year for the three years I have been in the Seanad. Parents ask me time and again why, when all these houses were granted planning permission, did nobody think the families coming to live in them would need a secondary school. Did nobody think these families would need facilities? Of course, there is good news on the horizon, and I acknowledge that, but the new Curragh post-primary school promised and planned for the former Magee Barracks in Kildare town is still at design and planning stage and will not be ready before September 2023. I am hearing that additional prefabricated classrooms will be provided at the Curragh post-primary school. I ask the Minister of State to confirm that in his reply. Many people in Newbridge ask me how their children are expected to access a new school located in Kildare town. Many in the Curragh and its surrounds are asking why it was not the chosen location for their secondary school. I am sure the Minister for Education is still getting questions, both through her Department and directly, about whether she is planning a new further secondary school for the town of Newbridge itself. Of course, this is all about the children, who see their friends getting places and who are being told they are multiple numbers away from a similar school place. It is about parents who are sick with worry that those same children are upset, are not talking or are asking them why this is. As always, I will bring to the Minister of State the examples of a small number of those parents, who represent so many others who are still worried and still waiting. The first writes:For continuity on this issue and visibility for all, I wanted to share the latest update regarding the lack of a school place for our 12 year old son in Kildare Town Community School. 12 Places were offered to Pupils in the Town today. Unfortunately, our son was not one of these. My wife called the school earlier who confirmed he is now number 14 on the list. She thought it's better than being number 30 as he was previously, and asked when round 3 was being sent out, to which the school representative said there may not be any 3rd round and to try and get a place elsewhere!That goes back to the earlier point about the foresight from the Government to nip this stressful situation in the bud. Another parent in Newbridge writes:In the Patrician Secondary School he was initially 60 on the list and the last time we rang we were told he’s 42 on the list. That is quite high [we are told] for that school ...In St Conleths Community College he initially was 72 on the list and we have not been updated as to where he is now on the list as [we were told] the school [is not in a position to tell us what the current position is]. As I previously said we are extremely anxious, upset and worried about this. My son has lived in Newbridge since he was born. He was baptised in Newbridge, received his first holy communion in Newbridge and will make his confirmation in Newbridge. He went to Playschool / Montessori in Newbridge, is in Primary School in Newbridge and all he and we want is for him to attend Secondary school in Newbridge.It goes on and on. This is a crisis time for so many parents. I hope the Minister of State has some answers today.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-13 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	24	I thank the Senator for raising this matter. I am taking it on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education, who is currently at a Cabinet meeting and unavailable. The Senator has raised this previously and our colleague Senator O'Loughlin has also raised a number of issues in this regard. For school planning purposes, the Department of Education divides the country into 314 school planning areas and utilises a geographical information system to anticipate school place demand. Information from a range of sources, including child benefit data, school enrolment data and information on residential development activity is used for this purpose. Additionally, Project Ireland 2040 population and housing targets inform the Department's projections of school place requirements.Projections of post-primary school place requirements are informed by multiple factors, including primary school enrolments in the area and primary to post-primary transfer patterns. The Department's projections of post-primary school place requirements in Newbridge are showing an increase in the short term with a subsequent gradual decline and the Kildare school planning is showing an increase in the short to medium term. While the Department is aware of increasing pressures and demand for additional school places in Newbridge and Kildare, it is important to note that where enrolment pressures arise, it may not be as a result of lack of accommodation but may be driven by other factors, including duplication of applications where pupils have applied for a place to a number of schools in the area or school of choice where pupils cannot get a place in their preferred school while there are places in other schools in the town or area. Some towns or areas have single-sex schools and while places are available in the school they are not available to all pupils. Another factor is external draw, that is, pupils coming from outside the local area. The Department is working to establish the true extent of any capacity issues across school planning areas through ongoing discussions with the relevant school patrons and authorities. This close engagement will allow the Department to identify at an early stage particular capacity requirements for the forthcoming years which may necessitate further action to that already in train including, where required, the provision of modular accommodation solutions. As the Senator has acknowledged, the Department is progressing a number of building projects in Newbridge and Kildare under the national development plan, NDP. The most significant project in terms of planned additional capacity is a new 1,000 pupil school building for Curragh Community College which will also provide four classrooms for pupils with special educational needs. Agreement in principle has been reached on the permanent site for this school which will be located on the former Magee Barracks site in Kildare town. In relation to immediate needs and additional capacity, the Department is in discussions with the Department of Defence and Kildare Wicklow Education and Training Board, KWETB, with regard to the refurbishment of an existing building known as block A which is adjacent to the existing school. It is intended this building, once refurbished, will provide for the extra accommodation required to meet the school's needs for September 2023. This provision of a new replacement school and relocation to the Kildare school planning area will provide significant additional capacity in the area. There are also additional projects approved or under assessment at the following schools in Newbridge. A major project for Patrician Secondary School Newbridge to expand the school to 1,000 pupils is currently at stage 2b of architectural planning, detailed design, the St. Conleth's Community College additional school accommodation application is currently being assessed in the Department, and the Holy Family Secondary School Newbridge additional school accommodation application is being finalised in the Department. In addition, there is also a major project approved for Cross and Passion College Kilcullen, which is to expand the school to cater for 1,000 pupils, and this project is currently at stage 2b, detailed design. Accordingly, I wish to advise the Senator that the Department of Education is aware of increasing pressures and demand for additional post-primary school places in a number of school planning areas across Kildare. I assure the Senator that the Department of Education will continue to engage with the relevant patrons in respect of the post-primary school enrolment position in the area, as well as with local representatives, and that the Department is focused on ensuring that the start of the 2023-24 school year operates as smoothly as possible for all schools and their students.

Unfortunately, the first page is cut and pasted from a reply given last year. This is the problem I have in respect of school places in Kildare South. I have been highlighting this for a number of years, as have colleagues in the Oireachtas and on Kildare County Council. Thankfully, we see the results of that on the second page of the reply. There are four schools being either extended or newly built. The problem of course is where pupils will go for 2023 and 2024. For the person who wrote to me this morning, who is in 60th or 72nd place on the list for a school in Newbridge, that is a serious worry when we hear there may be a prefab located in the Curragh post-primary school to accommodate additional needs. What these parents need is certainty. I ask the Minister of State to go back to the Minister for Education and ask her to provide that certainty. Last year, the Ceann Comhairle organised a meeting with Oireachtas Members which gave a lot of certainty to the parents that something would happen. I raise this matter on a continuous basis, as do other Oireachtas Members. All we need is to assure those people who need a place for 2023 that they will have one. If it is in temporary accommodation, that would be welcome but we need that assurance now. We cannot have parents with their children locked in rooms, which is what is happening at the moment, when their friends have been assured places yet their children are not getting places. That is what this is all about. I ask the Minister of State to take this back to the Minister. Maybe we will get an Oireachtas meeting up and running again and maybe then we will get the assurance those parents want for 2023. I welcome that there is building taking place but it is going to take two to three years. We do not want to be back here again next December.

The Department is progressing additional solutions for Newbridge and Kildare, including the relocation of Curragh Community College to Kildare town, which will provide significant additional capacity. The Department is aware of enrolment pressures for 2023-24 and will continue to liaise with patrons and local representatives in this regard. I will pass on the Senator's concerns to the Ministers. As I said, there can be multiple reasons for enrolment pressures but the Department is working to establish whether there is a requirement for additional provision in the area. It will ensure that any required accommodation solution is put in place as well as continuing to advance the major and additional school accommodation projects that I previously outlined. The priority for the Department is to ensure that there are places available for every student in the next school year. It will continue to engage in this regard.
#MarieSherlock	unknown-#MarieSherlock-party	unknown-#MarieSherlock-dob	unknown-#MarieSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-13 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	27	I thank the Minister of State for taking this matter. I understand the Minister for Education is at the Cabinet. The issue I raise relates to the review of the after-hours use of school buildings. We understand the review is under way and this is most welcome. My questions are about the process of consultation on this review. Who will be consulted? Will the communities where these schools are located be given a say? When will the review be completed? When can we hope to have a stronger and more comprehensive set of guidelines in place from the Department to schools? We are all aware of great examples where schools have taken the decision to open up their buildings in the afternoons and evenings, at weekends and during holiday periods to local communities for sports, clubs, youth work, adult education and indeed preschool and after-school care. We are also aware of far too many cases where, for whatever reason, school boards have decided they do not need, want or have to open. What is the Department going to do to ensure we better utilise what is in many instances publicly funded infrastructure? Across the vast majority of schools in Ireland we have a network of private patronage that is effectively publicly funded for day-to-day expenses. We will not get into the shortfall for schools' day-to-day expenses. In the main these schools are publicly funded. When the State has invested in a school building, is it acceptable that the Department and the State take a hands-off approach with regard to its out-of-hours use? In the 2017 Department guidelines on out-of-hours use, it is very evident that there is a hands-off approach by the Department. Of course these issues are sensitive but we should not shy away from them. This is not about balancing priorities between schools and communities. The priorities are exactly the same. The number one priority is the education of the pupils, the teachers and the school community.When a school empties out those same families, teachers and communities should still be able to use the building in some way. I have a particular local interest in this. A number of weeks ago the Minister, Deputy Foley, met a number of us with regard to a parish hall located in Drumcondra. It is the Corpus Christi parish hall on the Home Farm Road in Drumcondra. For decades, the girls' school there used this parish hall for assembly and other activities alongside general community use of the hall. The hall has been closed for almost three years, depriving the girls of indoor PE activities and assembly use. We have had the wonderful news that the Archdiocese of Dublin is planning to vest the parish hall in the school. I do not want to comment on the particulars of the negotiation on the precise use of the hall. However, I do want to reflect that there is a clear desire and demand on the part of the local community that when the needs of the school are met with regard to the hall it is also important to consider the needs of the community. The community has used the hall for many decades. We have a clear set of guidelines from the Department on out-of-hours community use of schools. We need a clear message sent out that schools should be doing more for their local communities and that they can play an even more fruitful role in their communities in terms of the use of school buildings.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-13 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	28	I thank Senator Sherlock for raising this matter because it provides me with an opportunity to outline the position on the proposed review of the guidelines on the use of school buildings outside of school hours and the Government's firm commitment on allowing school buildings to be used where possible for community, educational and recreational use outside of school hours. The Department of Education published the guidelines on the use of school buildings outside of school hours in October 2017. The purpose of these guidelines is to provide guidance to schools on their current arrangements for the use of school buildings outside of school hours. The guidelines outline the various scenarios and inform where consent of the Department of Education is required. The publication of the guidelines followed a programme for Government commitment on the utilisation of primary school buildings for after-school care provision for school-age children to offer more options and flexibility to parents where there is demand for such a service, in partnership with community groups or private providers. In section 10 of the programme for Government, there is another commitment that school buildings must be utilised outside of school hours if they are to remain at the centre of their communities and this usage should include after-school care, homework clubs and other community activities where demand exists. From various consultations undertaken as part of this process, it was evident that school property owners, school authorities and other stakeholders are, in general, favourably disposed to the use of their school buildings outside of school hours where this is appropriate, and many have considerable experience in doing so. The purpose of the guidelines is to provide guidance to schools on their current arrangements for the use of school buildings outside of school hours or to schools considering putting such arrangements in place. The guidelines also aim to address some of the issues raised by education partners as part of the consultation process and to make schools aware of the types of issues that should be considered when a school wishes to make its facilities available outside of school hours. It is not intended that these guidelines are exhaustive or prescriptive and it is recognised that the management of school premises at local level is a matter for the relevant school authorities. The Department fully appreciates that decisions to make school premises available ultimately lie with the relevant trustees or property owners following a recommendation from the school authorities, and that the needs of the school, teachers and pupils must be prioritised. However, it is also the case that schools are often at the centre of sustainable communities and there are mutual benefits in building links with the local community, particularly in areas where schools have been newly established and where school facilities lend themselves to community use. The Minister and her Department are committed to a review of the guidelines. This review will include consultation with relevant stakeholders, including representatives of schools and other Departments which engage with the community and voluntary sectors. The Department has already commenced a series of engagements with other Departments and plans further consultation in the near future. Furthermore, the Department plans to conduct a survey of a sample of schools regarding their experience in engaging with community and recreational groups seeking to use school property. This survey will commence in the first quarter of 2023.

This is not in doubt. Earlier this year, in response to a parliamentary question, the Minister said the review was to commence in the third quarter of this year. We now hear about a survey in the first quarter of 2023 but we do not hear when we will see completion of the review. We do not hear anything about public consultation on this. Surely the public and local communities will be given an opportunity to have a say. Notwithstanding the commitment to try to address some of the insurance and security concerns of boards of management, and many of them are genuine and legitimate, there is a failure by the Department to recognise it has a role in maximising the use of its public investment in school buildings. This is what we are speaking about. The State invests a great deal into school buildings but we see only a limited or partial return because the school buildings are closed for so many hours of the day and during the summer.

As already stated, a review is under way with other Departments. The Department intends further consultation in the near future. The intention of the Department is that the review will ensure the guidelines on the use of school buildings outside of school hours are as effective and efficient as possible. It is the intention that the review will assist this process. The feedback received from discussions with the relevant stakeholders and the results of the survey that will commence in the first quarter of 2023 will be used to inform the review of the guidelines. Following the review, and in consultation with school authorities, the guidelines will be updated as necessary and all schools will be notified and encouraged to take on board the changes.

They and all the students are most welcome. I hope they enjoy their time in Leinster House. I will break with tradition here and call Senator Norris, the Father of the House, first. He was given a big round of applause for his long service to the House yesterday during the sitting to mark our centenary. I thank him in person for his long service to the Seanad and to the State.

I greatly appreciate his kind words. I was not at yesterday's proceedings because I am in five vulnerable categories with regard to Covid-19, so I am afraid of crowds. The first issue, of two, which I want to raise is that of Qatar. It is in the news now because of the football being played there, a tournament which the country secured by bribery. There is no question or doubt about this. The whole process was corrupt. Qatar has an appalling record on human rights. The stadiums were built by migrant workers, hundreds of whom died without any acknowledgement by the Qataris. Those workers were kept in conditions of slavery. I refer as well to the complete abolition of any rights whatsoever for gay people in Qatar. It is a disgrace that FIFA went along with having this tournament in Qatar. We have now learned as well of Qataris being involved in the bribery of members of the European Parliament. When is this going to stop? I am not sure if we have a Qatari ambassador here, but if we do, he should be called in and given a real reprimand. My second issue is that of bins. I am old enough to remember when we actually had nice big bins of firm quality in Dublin. For some unknown reason, Dublin City Council, decided to privatise the collection of bins. I well remember, as I am sure many other Members of the House do, when rival tenderers for this job routinely burnt out each other's collection vans. It was like something we would read about concerning the Mafia in New York city. The public are forced to buy flimsy plastic bags that are of no earthly use whatsoever. The seagulls have a field day ripping them apart with their beaks and spreading the rubbish all over the pavements and the streets. This is appalling. This type of situation is recognised as a serious problem in cities such as Amsterdam and the authorities there are attempting to address the problem. I request that the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, come into the House. I also ask that he contact the people involved with the bins and attempt to reach some kind of decent resolution. I raise this issue because, to be quite honest with the House, I used to be proud of being a Dubliner, but now I am ashamed because of the condition of the streets. We now have the James Joyce Centre, which draws many tourists to North Great George's Street. It is a sad state of affairs when we see them looking at its terrible condition, with rubbish all over the place. Shame, shame, shame on Dublin City Council.

It was a tremendous success. There was a good representation of former Members and they certainly enjoyed the occasion. I compliment the Cathaoirleach on the initiative, all those involved in the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Seanad team here.  I note that Deputy Clarke asked the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, in the Dáil on 2 June whether he was satisfied with staff appointments in Inland Fisheries Ireland, IFI, and the methods of interview used. The Deputy got the usual response from the Minister's officials, in that the matter had nothing to do with them and was for IFI. It is this type of evasion and obfuscation that forces us to speak under privilege in the Chamber on issues of concern. I have a document - many others, particularly in Galway and Mayo, also have it - that was sent to officials in the Department. It shows that the Minister and the board of IFI should not and could not be satisfied with the way in which at least one senior appointment was made, although I believe there were others. I know that the Department has had this document for some time. It contains a number of text messages as well as emails to and from private email addresses relating to this senior appointment. There is documented evidence of skullduggery and manipulation of the highest order. It is inconceivable that the person involved could still be allowed to preside over further appointments. Staff members of IFI would have a legitimate expectation that, if they worked hard, did their work and involved themselves in professional development, training, etc., they would get promotions up the ladder if they sought them. I am afraid, however, that any employee who reads this document could not have any trust or confidence in the current appointment process. I am not saying it was always thus, but it is certainly the case at the moment. The Bradley report expressed confidence in the board of IFI. I am putting the board members on notice that they will be required to step up to the plate, show that the confidence placed in them by the report is merited, and discharge their responsibilities relating to this and other serious matters outlined in this and other documents. I have made several contributions in the Seanad calling for an inquiry into the workings of the IFI organisation. I am still calling for such an inquiry. There is further compelling evidence in this document to support my call. However, the matter of the appointment to jobs is for the board alone, as it relates to the actions of the chief executive officer, who is answerable to the board. Will the Deputy Leader contact the board and chair of IFI and ask them to do their job and investigate the issues that are in their hands?
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-13 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	36	I join Senator Kyne in complimenting the Cathaoirleach and all those who worked on yesterday's wonderful occasion. It was fascinating and fantastic. It was great to see so many former Senators back in Leinster House for the occasion. That was a nice touch. This is a significant week in terms of planning and development, as the Government is going to approve the planning and development Bill today. I hope it will move quickly into law. This should probably have been done years ago. The Bill is not being approved to suit developers or speculators. Rather, it is to suit the ordinary people I have been meeting for many years who have been refused planning permission on their land to build a house. It is to suit the development of houses that are needed in the middle of a crisis. We have to do this. There has been a great deal of false and misleading material on the matter of judicial reviews, but I understand that they will not be removed. Instead, there will be strict time limits on them. This is right. As the Taoiseach has stated, these changes are comprehensive and must come about. We have to make them, particularly if we are to develop housing. Too many housing projects are being held up. Consider the delays in offshore wind energy. We need wind energy, particularly in the current crisis. Thankfully, we have not had an amber alert yet, but it could easily happen if this weather continues, even though the outlook provided by those with responsibility for this area seems fairly positive. We have to move quickly with offshore wind projects, but planning issues are holding them up for too long. An Bord Pleanála has not been fit for purpose for a number of years. It must be changed. We must gear up, get our planning system working perfectly and respect people who want to object to planning applications. I am not saying that people do not have that right, and the Minister has made it clear that people will have the right to object to planning applications. Regardless of who is in power, though, if we want to reach our housing targets, make progress in planning and allow people to have confidence in the planning system, these changes must take place. I accept the right of the Opposition or anyone else to express reservations about the Bill, but it is the right thing to do in the long run. I hope that we move swiftly, that we have a better planning system and that our local authorities have more of a say.

In recent days, we have once again seen fairly chaotic scenes at Dublin Airport. It seems that we are discussing more regularly situations at the airport that are having an adverse impact on staff and travellers. We are an island nation and we rely heavily on our airports and aviation infrastructure daily. At this time of the year, many journeys are made in and out of the country, particularly as people return home for Christmas. No one is suggesting that we cannot be met with unique or adverse weather events, but I have not heard a word from the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, about what he did with the airport in the lead up to and following these adverse weather conditions. One would have expected a Green Party Minister to be conscious of the impacts of adverse climate conditions on our society. We need to hear from the Minister about what action he has taken and intends to take regarding the airport to ensure that people are able to travel as freely as possible. No one is expecting or calling for miracles, but we have all travelled around the world enough to know that, in places like Canada, the temperature can drop to below -20 oC but people can still get flights. One would have expected that the airport, under the leadership of the Minister, would have been able to ensure the same by now. There is a danger of people being left to flounder. That would be unfair and unjust at any time of the year, but as we approach Christmas, its unfairness would be particularly felt by those impacted. I appreciate that now is a difficult time to try to have statements on this issue, but the situation warrants it. It cannot go on like this. We all know Einstein's definition of madness, that being, doing the same thing time and again and expecting different results. We cannot just keep coming into this Chamber, nor can colleagues in the other Chamber, and saying that there is another situation impacting travellers through the airport. Something needs to be done quickly. We know when winter comes. We also know that, given the impact of the climate emergency, there will be other adverse weather events. We need to plan for those appropriately and ensure that people have the most streamlined and best way possible to fly into and out of this island. As difficult and tight as it might be, it is important that we try to have statements with the Minister before we break for Christmas and hear what action he intends to take.
#MarkWall	unknown-#MarkWall-party	unknown-#MarkWall-dob	unknown-#MarkWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-13 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	43	I wish to be associated with the comments of various Senators about Seanad 100 yesterday. For many of us, it was a special occasion. I thank the Cathaoirleach and all the staff involved for arranging it. I wish to raise two issues with the Deputy Leader, the first of which is the shortage of medication throughout the State. In several recent conversations I had with my local pharmacist, he told me that his concerns about this issue had increased in the past number of months. Finding it impossible to source prescribed medication, he finds himself more and more on the phone with GPs in my town of Athy asking whether he can substitute it with another. In recent days, a growing number of pharmacists have called on the Government to put in place a serious shortage protocol, which I am told would allow pharmacists to dispense alternative medications to patients, given the supply difficulties that many are experiencing with more commonly used prescription drugs.It appears from reading and listening to statements by several pharmacists in recent days that many drugs for front-line treatments are currently not available. Suppliers report to pharmacists that it could be mid-February or even March before such drugs are available again. It has been reported in the last couple of days that 187 different medications are currently out of stock, including drugs used to treat cancer, blood pressure and infections. I would appreciate if time was given to debate this important matter with the Minister for Health as a matter of urgency. Secondly, I welcome the signing by the Minister of State with responsibility for local government and planning at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Peter Burke, of new regulations that will require a changing places toilet to be included in certain buildings. The Leader will know, as will other Members, that I have raised this matter a number of times in this House after being contacted by a number of families who are being forced to change their loved ones in the backs of cars or on cold floors of unsuitable toilet facilities. In his statement, the Minister of State reports that up to 80 extra changing places toilets could be provided nationwide each year in buildings such as schools, healthcare facilities, shopping centres and hotels. It is currently estimated that there are only 19 changing places facilities in Ireland, so an additional 80 per year would be a great improvement for many families.

This would be a huge and important step forward. It has been welcomed by Changing Places Ireland and by many families to whom I have spoken. I thank the Minister of State for taking this step. It will make such a difference to so many families.

I draw the Cathaoirleach's attention to how we can often take positions as being set. Over the past two and a half years, the Cathaoirleach has shown what it is like to be active in a role, to do other things and to take other initiatives. Yesterday was one part of that but, for the last two and a half years, we have seen many different occasions and events. There are paintings on the wall outside regarding the higher female representation. Having sat on the committee with the Cathaoirleach, I can see how much he participates in the role beyond what people think it is. I am setting this up for the next person who speaks. I thank the Cathaoirleach for setting the standard on how to be fully active in a role and not just to sit back and say that the job description is that he sits in the chair, does Commencement matters and is here for votes. It can be so much more than that. It can be such a big role and can be what we make it. I acknowledge that. This Thursday, many of us will go into Mountjoy to play a GAA match.

I thank politicians for their participation all year when I have reached out to them to do community events with me, whether in the prison or in the community. It helps to break down barriers. Sometimes, we think of other groups without really knowing about them because we have never really spent any time around them. In the last few years, we have played against teams with players who have struggled with addiction or mental health issues throughout their lives. We have played in Tallaght and Mountjoy. We played in an inner city youth centre once. This week, we will play in Mountjoy again. We were beaten terribly in the last soccer match. I hope all those rural people who had greater access to the GAA than most Dublin folk might win us back some sort of title this week. On the topic of prison, and men within the prison system, I ask the Leader for statements on prison reform early in the new year. Many politicians who play this week will have an opportunity to engage with the men and to hear about their lives, hopes, aspirations, what they want for the future, and how difficult that transition can be from prison back into life, as well as the isolation, institutionalisation and hardship that can go with that. Maybe in the new year, we can mark our engagement with them this year with some statements on prison reform.

It was a great day. It was important to celebrate 100 years of this great House and its work, with over 300 Members over the last century doing their best, coming in here every day to try to have an impact on legislation and to make themselves heard. I want to raise the serious issue of the emergency department in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda. There is a huge population in the north east and the hospital is not fit for purpose. It was not fit for purpose ten years ago and it is certainly not okay now. There is a crisis in the north east at the minute when it comes to Navan emergency department and Drogheda emergency department. We need far more resources and a bigger emergency department. I spent seven hours in there with my son a couple of weeks ago. One should not be afraid to go to an emergency department or be in the full of one's health to be able to survive it, which is the current situation in Drogheda. We are at a crisis point. We need far more resources and a significant action plan. On a positive note, I congratulate Louth County Council for a fabulous, important initiative to celebrate a great Irish woman and north Louth woman, St. Brigid. She was an environmentalist, a goddess and a saint. She was one for everybody. 2023 will see us celebrate the very first public holiday in her honour and 2024 will mark 1,500 years since her passing. It is important that this north Louth woman is remembered by the Brigid 1500 programme. It is an important initiative and a fantastic two years of celebration. There will be live concerts featuring local musicians and choirs. The library and county museum will run workshops. There will be a fantastic opportunity for local artists or art groups to have community residency, for which a call will be put out in January. There will be a great opportunity to come to north Louth for the beautiful art and the walking tours. As an Erin Brigid, I was proud to see the Brigid 1500 programme be launched by Louth County Council yesterday. It was an important day. I congratulate them.

We have asked for the Minister to come into the House and for the Bradley report to be discussed here. We have not succeeded with any of it. If we do not have some action in the early part of the next session, we will have no choice but to bring forward a Private Members' motion about Inland Fisheries Ireland. I am certainly not happy about what is happening there. Our institutions are important to us, including the Dáil, Seanad and European Parliament. I congratulate the Belgian police for outing some of the issues that seem to have taken place in the European Parliament. As we all know, Brussels is the second biggest lobbying city in the world. I would hate to think that the integrity of the European Parliament is being damaged and undermined by some people accepting large sums of money. I think that at the earliest opportunity, we should have a discussion on the European Parliament in this House. We passed laws in this Chamber to give extra powers to the European Parliament, as did Dáil Éireann. It would be a retrograde step if what is perceived by the media to be happening is taking place and if Members of the European Parliament are taking large sums of money, for whatever reason. We do not fully know why. Early in the next session, we should have a debate on the powers that we have given to the European Parliament and what it is doing.

Senators, including me as recently as last week, have raised the issue of the drug, Kaftrio. I ask that the Minister for Health come to the House and present an update to us. That would be opportune because there is still an issue with access to treatment for young people with cystic fibrosis. I will not read it to the House but I have an email from a family in Cork concerned about their daughter and the issue of the HSE and Vertex still not reaching an agreement. It is important that progress is made on that. I ask that the Minister come to the House as a matter of urgency on that. I also raise the issue of catering on Irish Rail's Cork-Dublin intercity service and at Kent Station. I welcome that Cork Airport will have a new café, called Lemon Pepper, with locally produced foods. It is long overdue. That gives me the segue into the fact that AMT Coffee in Cork's Kent Station has gone into administration. This means the travelling public cannot go to a café or coffee shop in the train station to buy coffee, tea or whatever they wish to buy to take on board a train. I heard Barry Kenny of Irish Rail on Newstalk yesterday. It is inexcusable that Irish Rail still does not have an on-board catering service for passengers on intercity trains when we consider, as reported in an investigative piece by Ken Foxe in the Irish Examiner, that Irish Rail acquired €390,000 clamping 4,300 cars at €120 each. The company has money that it can use to franchise or subsidise. If the Minister for Transport could come to the House to present an update on that important matter, it would be opportune.

He brings such colour to the place. It is always lovely to see him. It was lovely yesterday that people mentioned him warmly and frequently during the commemorative sitting of Seanad 100 yesterday. It was also lovely to see the retired Members of this House yesterday. We should never forget those men and women who came in here before us and the contribution they have made to the State. I also congratulate the Cathaoirleach, Senator Daly, and everybody else involved in yesterday’s commemorative event. It was a wonderful event. I was delighted to be a part of it. I move that No. 129(4) on the Order Paper be taken before No. 1, without debate. The motion tabled by our group last month reads: "That Seanad Éireann calls on the Minister for Health to name the new National Children’s Hospital after Dr. Kathleen Lynn, noting her contribution as Chief Medical Officer in the Irish Citizen Army, and her role in establishing St. Ultan’s Hospital, one of the most important centres for paediatric healthcare in the early years of the Irish State." This would be a fitting tribute as we look back over the decade of centenaries and look forward to a new era in children's healthcare in Ireland. With Senator Fitzpatrick’s briefing in the audiovisual room tomorrow, we will have an opportunity to learn more about Dr. Lynn. A newly installed artwork by artist Mary Kelly featuring Dr. Lynn was unveiled in Leinster House this week. It seems therefore that political support is now building for the initiative. I ask, therefore, that Seanad Éireann pass this motion today to name our national children’s hospital after Dr. Kathleen Lynn. I understand my colleague, Senator Victor Boyhan, will second this motion.

It was certainly a dignified event that captured what is different and diverse about Seanad Éireann. Well done to everybody involved. I find myself speaking again today on Shannon Heritage. Last Friday, Clare County Council announced it was withdrawing from the process of acquiring Shannon Heritage sites in County Clare because of inactivity at Government level and the failure by the Government to make available the €15 million needed to ensure the long-term viability of the facilities. I do not know what is going on in the Government. One Minister does not seen to be talking to the other. It is totally unacceptable. Heading into Christmas, the staff and management of Shannon Heritage do not know whether they are coming or going or what the plan is for the future of these extremely important tourist attractions in County Clare. I also raise the issue of the Owenacurra Centre in Midleton simply because what is happening in Cork is wrong. The performance of the head of the Mental Health Commission at the Joint Committee on Disability Matters last Thursday was diabolical. The condescending approach taken when answering questions from Deputies Hourigan and Cairns was totally unacceptable. I do not know what more we can do in regard to Owenacurra but I believe there needs to be an investigation into the circumstances of the centre's closure. That needs to be headed up by a retired High Court judge because what has happened is unacceptable. We cannot stand by without asking the questions that need to be answered.

I will not be liked for saying this but it is important to speak truth to power. It was a little embarrassing that no minority voices were heard yesterday. That is coming from someone from an ethnic minority group. I flagged this a few times but as my mother would say, "You can bring a horse to water but you cannot make him drink it". To be clear it was not about me as a person but if we are marking minority voices and major change, it was a pity. The House needs to consider that if we are going to be talking about minorities and have people from minority groups in the Seanad, we need to give them the opportunity. What I would have said yesterday, standing on the shoulders of great individuals such as Mary Robinson and Senator Norris, was what this House can do and achieve for people from ethnic minority groups. I thank the Cathaoirleach for his support over the past two and a half years. He made my time with the Civil Engagement Group in this House much easier and he is proactive. I thank him for all his support but I also need to say that. As I will not speak again on the Order of Business this week, I wish to thank the Taoiseach for being part of major change in Irish society, breaking down the barriers for people from minority groups and giving this opportunity for people like me, which was the title of Senator Ruane's book, to be here. I thank him for that, and all my colleagues for their support over the years. I know I was critical of yesterday but it needs to be said in order that we can do better going forward.

Dáithí was born on 5 August 2022 but he lost a kidney soon after birth. His second kidney is also under threat. Fewer than 1% of babies are born with such a complex range of medical conditions and Dáithí has not been able to come home yet. A GoFundMe page with a target of €12,000 has raised €23,000 to help the family with accommodation costs in Dublin, medical costs and so on. The reason I bring this matter up today is that the maternity leave of Dáithí's mother, Bronagh, has now expired. We should have a debate on maternity leave in the new year, specifically on what can be done in cases where it runs out and a mother of a severely sick child has no other options available to her.There should be situations where maternity leave can be extended. That would provide a degree of financial help for somebody like Bronagh. We are doing so much now, such as introducing maternity leave for councillors and so on. Therefore, in instances where a child has severe medical issues, we should consider a more rounded approach such as an extension of maternity leave. Finally, I would appreciate if a debate on the matter could be arranged for the new year.

It was very appropriate and lovely to see so many former Members in attendance. I congratulate all involved in such a lovely occasion and we are all honoured to be a part of it. Yesterday the people of the mid-west got good news with the announcment that there will be a new route between Shannon Airport and Liverpool, which will commence in March of next year. I wish to compliment the team in Shannon Airport on the hard work they have put into developing the airport and recovering from Covid times. Yesterday, the Tánaiste set out the vision for the region in the form of the Shannon estuary economic task force. I compliment Mr. Barry O'Sullivan, chairman of the task force, and all who were involved in finalising the interim report. The report sets out how the region can play a leading role in the switch to renewable energy and more climate friendly ways of living and doing business. The estuary could become a hub for sustainable transport technologies and a western digital gateway to Europe. The interim report proposes significant investment in the ports at Foynes and Moneypoint, which would be welcome, a new auction for floating wind generation in 2024, and identifying industrial sites for clean energy industries like hydrogen. The interim report also sets out the task force’s ambition to begin supplying Atlantic offshore wind energy through the estuary by 2030 with the intention of significantly accelerating it up to 2050. The interim report looked at the tourism sector in the area. Certainly this report will lead to huge economic transformation and job creation. The Government needs to move forward with the report. I do not want the interim report left lying on a shelf; I want to see it implemented.

I wish to briefly comment on Shannon heritage sites, which are key for our tourism product across the mid-west. We know the Government has dropped the ball and that these sites should have been transferred to Clare County Council. What is completely inexplicable is the fact that absolutely nothing has been done since the budget and now the workers, whom I know and I know their union, SIPTU, very well, are now faced with being put on short time from the new year. It is shameful that the Government has dropped the ball not once but twice and do not seem to know what to do about it. The inaction is, frankly, inexcusable and hugely damaging to the mid-west tourism offering.  I want to raise the issue of migrants attempting to reach Europe. One of the key themes of the Christmas story is there being no room at the inn. The Border Violence Monitoring Network has published a shocking report which documents more than 1,635 testimonies of human rights violations that have affected almost 25,000 people over the past six years who tried to make their way to Europe. In fact, the network reports that migrants attempting to reach the EU are now almost always subjected to some form of violence at the hands of the authorities. They recount being beaten, kicked, humiliated through forced undressing, threatened with a firearm, arbitrarily detained and subjected to inhuman treatment inside a police station before being illegally pushed back both at the EU's external borders and from deep within the territory of the bloc's member states. These events took place in Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Spain, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Romania and Slovenia. These events are not exceptions. This report tells us this is an EU policy of fortress Europe to lock out people, keep them out and subject them to violence. These are the detailed reports of this latest NGO report and the findings are shocking. I ask for a debate on this matter to be arranged for the new year because there is a marked contrast between what we show we can do, and quite rightly in terms of supporting the people of Ukraine, and what we refuse to do for other migrants who are basically being pushed back, and subjected to horrific violence and abuse on a daily basis. We hear about EU values but these are EU policies on a daily basis.

Congratulations on such a positive event. The strongest take away for me was the enormous positive feedback from the former members of Seanad Éireann. I would like to think that in the new year we might explore how we can continue to build on that relationship with former members of this House and the knowledge transfer they have, and their vast experience. Former Senators were truly thrilled to be here and we must tap into their expertise more. We should constructively look at doing so across these Houses. I formally second the proposal by my colleague, Senator Keogan's, who proposed an amendment to the Order of Business concerning Dr. Kathleen Lynn. The movement around Dr. Lynn is enormous and speaks for itself. The issue has been covered extensively in the media and on the poles around Leinster House in the past week. I support this very obvious issue and I know we will have other opportunities to speak on the matter.  I want to talk about the proposed planning legislation. It is important that we do not feed into misinformation. There is a lot of misinformation but one thing is clear is that right across the media there is a suggestion that community groups would be barred from taking judicial reviews. We must wait and see what that is but I would like to think we would strongly resist any attempt by community groups, community initiatives or city and county councils that are intrinsically involved in these community groups being hampered in terms of their ability to robustly participate in the planning process.  Interestingly, some days ago I took the time to look at the website of An Bord Pleanála and searched for the names of a number of Deputies, Senators and Government Ministers who made very positive and constructive objections, and engaged with many communities about judicial reviews. I hope they will remember that when they are on the other side of the fence and outside this House when this legislation comes before us.

It was wonderful to celebrate the fact that more than 800 Senators have served in Seanad Éireann of which nearly 120 were women. I very much appreciate the new portraits that have been added to the House to celebrate the women who have served here in Seanad Éireann. I wish to pay tribute to the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Heather Humphreys, for the funding for community centres that was received last week. A lot of groups in counties Galway and Roscommon jumped for joy last week when they heard about the funding. I wish to highlight that the funding is for the renovation and retrofitting of buildings, community centres and parish halls. Funding amounting to €0.25 million has been allocated to the Town Hall Theatre in Ballinasloe, County Galway. The theatre is being used right now, and was used last week, for productions of the Ballinasloe panto, which has brought back the Christmas spirit to the town and for children who did not have the opportunity to see a panto for the past two or three years. I thank the volunteers who submitted the applications. The social services in Ballinasloe have received funding of more than €80,000 to make the building more energy efficient by erecting solar panels, and improving lighting and flooring. The Drum Community Centre and Elfin Community Centre in County Roscommon received funding too. It is crucial these community centres are funded. Volunteers run these activities in local areas and the funding will make the building sustainable for the future and future generations. The funding will keep towns and villages alive. I thank the volunteers, the Department of Rural and Community Development and the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys.

I was also delighted to see music incorporated into it. I hope we hear music more regularly in these halls. I have some concerns about unintended consequences of the proposed new regulations on short-term letting. Nobody wants to see people gaming the system to try to avoid the planning regulations. I am worried about the impact the new regulations may have on holiday homes, particularly during the summer months. I request that we have statements on this matter in the new year to get clarity on how the regulations will work. While this is being seen as a solution to some of the housing challenges, I am worried that it may have a knock-on impact on tourism and may not produce any additional properties for long-term letting. I request that we have statements on the matter in the new year. I acknowledge that this is the season for the spirit of Christmas. While much of the focus is on the commercial side, we need to remember what the true Christmas message is about. It is about the story of the holy family and the fact that they were refugees who sought refuge. I am sure that during their time, they met with the "#Bethlehemisfull" types, but there were people who were still generous and able to provide them with shelter. Those of us who describe ourselves as Christian, like those of any other faith or indeed of none, have very important values which we all want to uphold. In this season of Christmas, it is really important - and our language matters - that we understand the crucial Christmas message of welcoming and protecting those who are less fortunate. We need to welcome them, and in particular those who have come to these shores fleeing war, trouble and persecution, as part of our Christmas greetings.

The inscription on it read: "Honouring the unwavering support of the families of personnel of A Company 35 Infantry Battalion ONUC". Rarely have I seen anything that offended people to such a degree. Half of the families were not invited although I got an invitation. The Quinlans did not get an invitation until two days after the RSVP closed. The sole living officer from Jadotville got an invitation by phone call the day before the event. Company Sergeant Michael Tighe died in March of this year and an invitation was sent to his house with his name and that of his partner on it. What the hell were the organisers thinking? This Jadotville thing has rattled on since 1961 with incremental move after incremental move insulting and hurting families more and more each time. I believe the Minister for Defence, Deputy Coveney, owes the families a deep apology at this stage. I have rarely in my life come across people who are so hurt and so injured. One woman wrote to the Minister and spoke for ten families when she said they wanted nothing to do with this event. They had not been consulted or asked. It was a box-ticking exercise for somebody, but not for the families it was supposed to represent. It is a bad day's work for the Oireachtas, for the Minister and for the Department when something like that happens. Before I finish, I will speak about yesterday, which was a wonderful day in Leinster House and a wonderful day for the Seanad. I compliment the Cathaoirleach on the great job he did and each of those who were chosen to speak. The speeches yesterday were fantastic. They were really good. For once I felt the Seanad shone a very bright light for what goes on in this House. I look forward to the reform that is coming in the near future.
#GarretAhearn	unknown-#GarretAhearn-party	unknown-#GarretAhearn-dob	unknown-#GarretAhearn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-13 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	66	I also compliment the Cathaoirleach and all the team here, including Martin Groves and Bridget Doody and everyone who put the event yesterday together. It was a very memorable day and there were fantastic contributions by all, especially by all the current Senators. Hyperemesis gravidarum is a very debilitating condition for women during pregnancy. It is essentially, for want of a better description, a much more severe form of morning sickness. It affects approximately 2% of women going through pregnancy. Kate Middleton is a very famous person who had it during her first pregnancy. The Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, has followed through on a commitment he made when he was in Opposition to give the drug Cariban to women who suffer from this condition. This has been welcomed by people who have suffered from this condition and those who might do so in the future. There is one issue with the drug on which we need clarity from the Minister. As it is set out at the moment, the Minister has said that the prescription needs to be signed by a consultant rather than a GP. The obvious problem here is that the first time people who go through pregnancy meet a consultant is 12 weeks in, and after that it is at the 20-week scan. As this condition happens very early in pregnancy, this policy needs to be reviewed to see if a GP can give the prescription rather than a consultant. For many people who get this condition very early in their pregnancy, it is very debilitating. By the time they get to the 12-week scan, they are not able to work or have any sort of an active way of life. It is important that they do not have to wait for 12 weeks to be able to get a prescription for Cariban to make things more manageable during their pregnancy. I know the Minister is open to looking at this, but it would be appreciated if a decision could be made as quickly as possible to make sure GPs can sign off on these prescriptions.
#LisaChambers	unknown-#LisaChambers-party	unknown-#LisaChambers-dob	unknown-#LisaChambers-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-13 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	67	Senator Norris was the first Senator to contribute this morning. He rightly raised concerns around the FIFA World Cup in Qatar and the appalling track record of human rights abuses. Many migrant workers lost their lives while building the many stadiums which now host the games. Many other members of this House have raised similar issues over recent weeks and months and would concur with the Senator's remarks. Senator Norris also raised a particular issue around bins in Dublin city. He was quite critical of Dublin City Council's handing of that particular issue. He called for a debate with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, which we will request but will take place in the new term. Senator Kyne has raised the issue of Inland Fisheries Ireland on a number of occasions in this House. He spoke on it again this morning and was supported by Senator Burke. I understand there are particular sensitivities around the issue. I concur with the Senator's remarks around the need at times for Senators to use the privilege in this House to raise matters of public concern that they may otherwise not be in a position to raise outside of these walls. That is an important function of public representatives. Both Senators called on the board of Inland Fisheries Ireland to investigate certain issues surrounding a senior appointment in the organisation. Senator Martin, like pretty much every Senator, spoke about yesterday's sitting, how fantastic it was and the work that was done. Senator Murphy spoke about the planning and development Bill and the memo to Cabinet this morning from the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien. I welcome the long-awaited reforms of the planning system that will need to be worked through. We will obviously have debates in this House but these reforms have been sought for many years. There are clear problems with the planning process in this country. Projects get held up for many years through the judicial review process. I understand one of the main things to be dealt with is the need to have proper timelines in place for the new coimisiún pleanála and the judicial review process. That will be welcomed by all. We will, of course, tease out the other complexities and details surrounding that new proposal. Senator Ó Donnghaile highlighted the chaos at the airports. I take on board his point that we are an island nation and we need to be connected. That request for a debate this week has gone to the Minister's office. I do not know if we will get him this week, being honest, but we will of course ask. It might be worth the Senator's while to table a Commencement matter because it might be the earliest opportunity to get a direct reply from the Minister's office on that issue. We would all be in agreement with the comments the Senator has made. Senator Wall raised the issue of medicine shortages. I am aware of that issue. There are particular challenges around certain antibiotics that would be the ones most often prescribed, particularly to children. Given all that we are dealing with in terms of the strep condition and RSV, there are many bugs flying around this winter and we are seeing increased numbers of cases. There are challenges with shortages of some prescription medicines, which have been raised with many Members. The Minister for Health is very much aware of the challenges with the shortage of supply and is working to resolve that matter with the pharmacies. He also welcomed the new regulations signed by the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, around changing place toilets to see an increase of approximately 80 per year, which would be welcome for so many families. Senator Ruane commended the role that the Cathaoirleach played the past two and half years and how he utilised the position in a way that perhaps was not done previously to the benefit of all Senators, which is welcome. I concur with her remarks. He made the role his own and put his stamp on it. We have all welcomed the different initiatives, whether it was the special sitting yesterday, the engagement with MEPs or the public consultation committee. He used the office and pushed the Standing Orders to their limits in a good way, which is necessary to shake things up every now and again. He has certainly set the bar and it has been a very good two and a half years for the Cathaoirleach is his role. I thank him for his work in that regard. The Senator also mentioned the GAA match that is happening in Mountjoy Prison on Thursday. I will hopefully participate in that as well. I have not soloed a ball in 15 years. I must get the ball out and give it a go. I commend her on her work in engaging with the prison community, all of her advocacy and facilitating Members of both Houses to engage with people from different communities and backgrounds and showing us first-hand the challenged faced. Listening to her contributions has opened my eyes in the past couple of years, but going out and meeting different community groups has as well. It has changed my views and perspective on certain issues. It is always good to keep an open mind on these issues. She has also asked for statements on prison reform in the new term, which, of course, we will organise at the earliest opportunity Senator McGreehan raised capacity issues in the emergency department in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda. She also congratulated Lough County Council on its St. Brigid initiative, the Brigid1500 programme, that will take place next year and in 2024 as well. Senator Paddy Burke spoke about IFI and has a requested a debate on the European Parliament and the powers conferred upon it by member states. We will request that debate in the new term. Senator Buttimer raised a particular cystic fibrosis issue and requested a debate with the Minister for Health. He also raised issues around catering on Irish Rail. I concur with his remarks. We are long past the restrictive Covid measures that we had last year. Rail services have been back up and running for a full year and it is disappointing there are still no catering services on all of our Intercity rail links. I would ask Irish Rail to do everything it can to get catering services there for people. These are long journeys without being able to access even a bottle water if people do not bring anything with them. We can do better in terms of our service to people. Senator Keogan proposed an amendment to the Order of Business, which was seconded by Senator Boyhan. I am happy to accept the amendment. She also spoke about yesterday’s event. It was great to hear from Senator David Norris and also former Members. Senator Flynn spoke about the fact that no minority voices were heard yesterday. There were particular challenges around speaking. The sitting was curtailed in terms of time and every grouping just got one slot. However, I do not know the full ins and outs of perhaps discussions that happened beyond that. I acknowledge the well made point and I take on board what she said in that regard. Senator McGahon spoke about young Dáithí McCann and the fact that he is a very sick baby. His mam is passing her maternity leave and is now heading into a space where she does not have any of those financial supports or leave. The Senator’s suggestion that we would look at extending maternity leave in cases of very sick children is certainly a debate to be had and a worthwhile request.  Senator Maria Byrne mentioned the Shannon to Liverpool route that has been added to Shannon Airport and the Shannon Estuary economic task force that has been set up as well. She commended the work of those involved. Senator Gavan spoke about the human rights violations against migrants trying to access the EU. I concur with his remarks in that there is a lot of appalling treatment of migrants trying to access the European Union. It is very disappointing. We are lucky to be in the top 5% in the world simply because we were just born here. We were lucky to be born in a wealthy country where we take for food, shelter, education and health services for granted. Even though we give out about certain issues, we are very fortunate to have all of those things that many people do not have in their home country and are fleeing for different reasons. I feel deeply uncomfortable at pulling the ladder up and preventing people from accessing the opportunity to have a better life, which is all people are looking for. We can do much better on that front. Despite all of the challenges we have had with the numbers of people coming from Ukraine, for example, as a country, we have done quite well. We have managed to fend off some of those minor challenges from a small number of people who are not happy with people coming in to seek shelter. For the most part, as a country, we have done quite well in that regard. However, we can be a stronger voice at the EU table in having a better policy in place. It is unfortunate that some member states do not support that domestically. That is proving challenging when the EU is based on consensus and requires all or no countries to support something. There are moves afoot at EU level to find a way to a qualified majority and perhaps a super-qualified majority for certain decisions to prevent one or two member states vetoing action where everybody else wants to move on something. Perhaps that is an area, although I am not sure migration is in the space just yet. It will be the biggest challenge for us as a Union in the coming decade, so we will have to deal with it. It is an important debate to have.  Senator Boyhan seconded Senator Keogan's amendment. He also raised particular concerns around the planning legislation and the new amendments being proposed regarding community groups. I take on board his points. We will have that debate around the ins and outs of the new proposals in the new term. Senator Dolan welcomed the community centre funding that was provided by the Government in Ballinasloe. Senator Malcolm Byrne spoke about short-term letting and the new regulations. I agree with him. I think of my own county of Mayo, where there are no hotels in and very few bed and breakfasts in parts of it. Airbnbs provide a valuable source of accommodation for tourists that perhaps might not otherwise come into an area and in areas where that is one of our key employers as well. There is a delicate balancing act to be found where we do not prevent long-term homes to people but we also do not cut off a supply of holiday accommodation to a region that does not have an alternative. We need to find the right balance. He spoke about the Christmas spirit as well and being welcoming to those who are fleeing difficult situations in whatever country they are coming from. It is an important message to remember that Christmas is more than just presents, gifts and mulled wine; it is about making sure that we are welcoming and show love those to who are coming from those challenging areas.  Senator Craughwell spoke about the new monument – I am not sure exactly how he termed it – but he has raised the Jadotville issue on many occasions in this Chamber and the unfortunate situation that happened where many were upset and offended by how a particular ceremony was dealt with. The Senator eloquently put his remarks on the record of the House. Senator Ahearn spoke about hyperemesis, the morning sickness issue, and the prescription of Cariban. I take on board the Senator’s comments in relation to GPs not being allowed to prescribe. I am not sure how doctors would view that and whether that is a request GPs themselves or whether there is a particular reason consultants are required to come in and give the consent. It is worth perhaps tabling a Commencement matter on that issue because we require further detail on how that might be worked out. It was a big welcome at least to see Cariban being made available for the first time when it is such an expensive drug and can cost up to €3,000 during a pregnancy. That concludes the Order of Business. Just in case I do not get the opportunity for the rest of the week, I want to put on the record of this House my thanks to all of the Senators for their work over the past year in dealing with me as Deputy Leader of the House and the Fianna Fáil group as well. I also thank, of course, Mr. Martin Groves and the staff, without whom we would not be able to operate and things would not move efficiently and smoothly. Significant work goes on behind the scenes, particularly at pinch points when there is pressure to get legislation through. We have staff who work in the Seanad Office and put in over and above what would be required to get the business moving. It is appreciated.  A lot of work went into planning yesterday’s sitting as well, from the inception of the idea to making a reality. That was in no small part due to the work of Mr. Groves, Mr. Peter Finnegan and all of the team in the Oireachtas as well. To make yesterday run smoothly and go so well is a huge credit to the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Seanad Office. I think we were all very proud yesterday to be Members of this House. It was lovely to see other former Members there as well and hear Dr. John Bowman, An Taoiseach and all of those who contributed yesterday.The musical interlude towards the end was beautiful. It was a lovely and historic day and it was a huge privilege to be a part of it and to have a seat in the Chamber. I thank everyone and wish them a happy Christmas.

“Report on wealth tax
25. The Minister shall, within six months of the passing of this Act, lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the potential revenue raised from, and distributional impact of, a wealth tax of 1 per cent on all households with assets of over 15 million euro.”

In light of that, I will not reiterate all of the arguments made previously. The concern I have is that we continue to look away from what is very much a pooling of wealth towards the top end of society. We know that Ireland has one of the highest levels of income inequality but also that when it comes to wealth inequality, the bottom 10% of the population has €600 or less in wealth. They have far less than one month's rent as a cushion. We also know that lone-parent families are the most likely to have no wealth or safety net, while there are others who have much higher amounts. In fact, those in the top 10% have wealth and assets of about €770,000. There would have been an argument for setting the bar at €1 million but with this recommendation I am reaching for the very top level. Ireland has a very large number of multimillionaires and billionaires and anybody who is in that position can contribute more to society. That is why I have set the bar extraordinarily high. We should be teasing out this issue and looking at lower levels, however. Given the economic pressures being experienced at the moment, we should consider a specific wealth tax that is separate from property tax, capital gains tax and the other measures that we have in respect of inheritance. I appreciate that those are forms of wealth tax but we are looking at a situation whereby some people have very large amounts of wealth and are in a position to contribute more to society. This is the kind of time when they could be very reasonably asked to do so, especially as the wealth gap has grown during the Covid-19 period. Most small businesses and families really suffered during the pandemic whereas a lot of the very wealthy became even wealthier during that period. I ask the Minister to consider looking at the potential revenue and distributional impact of a wealth tax on households with assets over €15 million. Having information on the potential revenue to be raised and the distributional impact would really allow us to assess the potential value of such a tax. I certainly believe we should make sure to gather that information. The measures of wealth that we have from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, and others capture a very broad spectrum but do not capture these pockets of super-wealth or the contribution they could be making.

The Minister will be aware that Sinn Féin has been on record as supporting a wealth tax for many years. We know that we will face particular challenges in the years ahead and it would be really helpful for all of us to understand the potential of a wealth tax. The report provided for in this recommendation is simply about having a look at that potential and it would be extremely sensible for the Government to do just that. I can understand an ideological objection to a wealth tax, and no doubt there will be one on behalf of Fine Gael, but what I cannot understand is a refusal to investigate what the value of such a tax might be.
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-13 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	79	I thank the Senators for raising this issue through recommendation No. 1. I am not in a position to accept the recommendation because there are many other ways in which the potential for a wealth tax to raise additional revenue for the State can be evaluated over the course of the year. I do not believe it is appropriate, in the context of a Finance Bill, to incorporate a commitment to prepare a report because a Finance Bill is all about how we bring stability and certainty to the tax code in the time ahead. Indicating within legislation that gives effect to a budget that we are considering further changes or looking to obtain information in respect of a potential change is not appropriate. There are better ways in which that can be signalled rather than through legislative change and a commitment to a report in the Finance Bill. My objection to the principle of a wealth tax is practical more than ideological. I do not believe a wealth tax as proposed here would have the effect that the Senators are contending because we have many other wealth taxes within our economy that provide alternative and effective ways of generating tax from transactions that are associated with the holding of wealth and the different manifestations of wealth within our economy. Indeed, some of these have already been touched on by Senator Higgins in her contribution, whether that be capital gains tax, local property tax or the new taxes the Government is committed to introducing in the time ahead such as a zoned land tax or the measure the Government committed to today regarding a tax that would gain for the State a share of the higher value of a piece of land where the value is conferred on it by rezoning that land. We have many other ways in which we tax wealth within our economy and society and they are effective. In some cases, they are set at a level that is very high relative to other economies that we would compare ourselves against. For example, the level of capital gains tax within our economy is 33%. That is a high level of tax on the gains that can be made in relation to particular transactions. We have many other effective, tried and tested ways to tax wealth within our economy. I contend that they are a more effective way of taxing those who have a high level of wealth within our economy, as opposed to the measure that is being suggested here this afternoon. In addition to all of this, we have an income tax structure that is exceptionally progressive. The more income a person has, the more tax he or she pays. We already have many different and effective ways in which wealth is taxed and that is why I believe that there is no need for another new tax on wealth beyond those the Government has already committed to introducing. I have the same objection to all of the other recommendations that we will consider this afternoon. I know there are better ways in which information can be ascertained or a debate can be had on important policy matters apart from a report on foot of the Finance Bill.

Therefore, when we make these recommendations, in many ways we are seeking to influence next year's budget. The budgetary process in Ireland tends to focus on the reveal of budget day and the pressures in advance but very strong ideas could be offered, not just from the Opposition benches but from across the House, in terms of areas that merit examination and scrutiny and areas which could be improved. The Minister should view the recommendations made by this House and the amendments proposed in the Lower House as an opportunity to inform and shape the budgetary process, to gather information with a focus not only on changes that might be made during the year but also on problems that might be identified, in order to ensure that the budget next year is responsive and properly informed. These are very constructive proposals and they should be taken as such. This is an important opportunity for those who cannot amend to offer input to this process which is so important, especially as budgets nowadays do not simply have a book-balancing function but also have a number of other obligations they seek to meet, including functions in respect of public duty, equality and human rights, equality budgeting and carbon budgeting, to which I will refer again later. In terms of the wealth tax, the Minister has spoken about taxes that are already effective.This could be another tax that would be also effective. It would target a very specific and very small cohort that has very substantial wealth. Regarding the progressivity of our income tax system, the Minister will be aware that in past years I have put forward proposals for a higher level tax. There is a situation where those who are on €60,000 or €50,000 and those on €250,000 or €300,000 are paying the same rate. It is reasonable to have a higher level of income tax at that level, especially when, for example, the cap on bankers' earnings is being removed so they can potentially move beyond €500,000. It is very reasonable that we follow through on the progressivity and look at the prospect of those with the very highest incomes contributing more. That can be done through income tax but another way that it can be picked up is through something like this wealth tax. That is why I am proposing these measures. I am concerned. Ireland is an outlier. For all the progressivity of our tax system, we are moving towards very high wages at that top level while at the bottom level there is stagnation and a pooling of incomes.

It costs €2.9 billion a year when a universal pension would cost €3 billion. We had that discussion. While I may not agree with him, the Minister responded on a lot of the other aspects of the private pension tax relief. However, the crucial part remains unaddressed, which is an analysis of the gender impacts. Such research as we have shows that 70% of the benefits went to the top cohort, to higher earners who are predominantly men. When we look at pension policy in the round, one of the acknowledged challenges faced across Europe and in Ireland is the gender pension gap. It is much wider than the gender wage gap. The gender pension gap is substantial. Surely anything we are doing on pension policy should have addressing the gender pension gap and improving it, rather than widening it, as a priority. It would be very timely and appropriate for us to have a specific gender analysis in respect of the private pension tax relief system. I would suggest then using a comparator to see the impact of that in terms of gender and the other potential ways we might spend our Exchequer's moneys, either through revisions of the private pension tax relief scheme, by focusing more on things like auto-enrolment, which also needs to be gender-proofed and has not been, or through our social protection system and things like the universal pension. There are many ways for us to use our money effectively for the presumed social goal, which is to have as much of the population as possible living with financial independence and security into later life and to narrow that gap, which is historic. We must bear in mind that on this particular issue, we are talking about a historic injustice to women and their pensions in this State, lingering with the effects of the marriage bar and systemic inequality over many years. The gender pension gap is a practical priority and I would say it is a principled priority. Can we analyse our private pension tax relief and try to see what it is doing in that regard and how it could be improved? We know it is mainly going to men.

In our last debate on this general issue, I covered some of the broader matters she has raised so I am going to confine my comments to the very important points she made regarding gender equality with regard to private pension tax relief and access to pensions. I acknowledge that there are very specific gender-related issues around pensions that cover a wide range of very important matters. These include access to a State pension and the size of private pension savings and retirement income. That is why many of the recent reports that have focused on pension policy have also considered those issues from the perspective of gender. I will give two examples. The first is the interdepartmental pensions reform and taxation group, which was tasked with a number of actions relating to pensions. This included simplifying and harmonising the supplementary pension landscape and an assessment of the cost of State support for pension savings. This report was published in November 2020 and considered the issue of gender. Indeed, it touched on a number of the issues raised by the Senator. The report noted that the key driver of pension coverage and adequacy for women relates to, among other factors, labour market issues. The combination of reduced working hours and breaks in employment due to caring duties has significant implications for the duration of the working life of women and therefore their lifetime earnings. This in turn limits the capacity to maximise the size of the final pension fund for women who contribute to a supplementary pension. The second example is the report of the Commission on Pensions. While the policy issues covered in that report are a matter for the Minister for Social Protection, I note that the report of the commission set out gender and equality considerations very clearly in its recommendations. I assure Senator Higgins that the issues she is referring to cut to the very heart of the adequacy of pension provision within our economy and our society. I assure her that the issues she has discussed will continue to be considered carefully by the Departments of Finance and Social Protection and I have no doubt that they will be the subject of further action in the future. I do not want to go through the rationale I offered earlier about reports, just as I am sure the Senator does not want to go through the rationale of why she can only table a recommendation, but from a process point of view it is the same reason I cannot accept a report. However, I assure her that the policy issues she raised this afternoon will be central to the work of the Government in the time ahead.

It will need more examination. With regard to the two reports the Minister mentioned, one of my concerns about the Commission on Pensions, which, sadly, undermined the effectiveness of the proposals, is that its remit explicitly excluded examining the private pension tax relief. That was particularly unfortunate because one of the tasks of the Commission on Pensions was modelling how to pay for things. Some of its decisions include recommendations that I personally believe are very problematic and will have huge gender implications. For example, it suggested moving to a 40-year contributory requirement versus the expected 30 or 20 years. That was recommended almost solely on the basis of affordability and the cost, yet €2.9 billion of public expenditure on pension policy was not on the table to be discussed as to how that might be changed or shifted. That was not subject to that scrutiny. It was a kind of isolated discussion about half of pension policy, with decisions that have potential rights implications made on the basis of cost, while a huge area of Exchequer expenditure was not on the table and not discussed. That is my concern about that. On the other issues and the knock-on effects, we have income inequality and a gender pay gap and of course that contributes to the gender pension gap. The question for us as a State is not what unfortunate things happen to be there but how to legislate, first to improve the working world, wage equality and those issues, and then when we are spending vast amounts of money, how to target it most effectively.As well as looking at the drivers relating to the fact that more women are on lower incomes and more men are on higher incomes, we also need to ask if we need a tax relief - that €2.9 billion is public money that everyone contributes to - that is mainly targeted at higher earners. That question stands regardless of what other important work we might need to do. Of the drivers of the inequality, the question is how we ameliorate and respond to it. There is much work still to be done in this area. I thank the Minister. He indicated that he is interested in engaging in that work. We have that obligation in terms of equality budgeting. I hope this is an area, perhaps in the context of next year's Bill, that we will look at in more detail because policies such as this are the tests of equality budgeting.

I am merely raising it again. It is the issue of deferred tax assets. The Minister will be aware that Irish banks, for example, in 2017, one of the years for which I have figures, shaved €400 million from their tax bills by offsetting their losses from the financial crisis period against taxable profits. The shocking aspect of this is that these losses can be carried forward indefinitely in order to shield banks' current profits from tax. Effectively, we are looking at lengthy periods in which banks, which have been very profitable at certain points during those periods, are still not paying tax. I made suggestions on this matter in the past. I was not specific in that regard, but there are a number of ways in which it could be addressed. There was a proposal in the past to the effect that only 50% of the profits that are made would be capable of being written off against past losses. There is also the idea of a time constriction. The Minister could cap this in terms of time, as in there is a certain period during which one can continue to offset one's profits against one's past losses. I am specifically looking at banking because there is a particular context in terms of banking in light of the significant public contribution made in that area. There is also the potential of capping it in terms of the percentage of profits that this scheme would apply to. These are two practical ways to proceed. The Minister could exempt banks entirely from the scheme or he could curtail or cap it in terms of time or percentage. I am wondering what is being looked at in this regard. On recommendation No. 4, if you have a bank which says that it has moved on from the crisis, that it is ready to start paying its bankers over €500,000 and that it no longer wants to apply the restriction in terms of pay, this is a signal that said bank is ready to start paying tax again. If banks are willing to be moving to pay more than €500,000 senior staff, that bank cannot be also saying that it is still suffering terrible losses and that it continues to struggle because of the losses it had a decade ago. It is reasonable that any bank which chooses to no longer apply the restriction and the pay cap should no longer be able to avail of the deferred tax assets scheme and should be able, since it can pay these large salaries, to pay its contribution to the State in terms of taxation.

It is important to know the banks we are referring to and the role that they play within our economy. I am as conscious as everybody else in this House of the cost and the considerable harm that was done to our economy and our country some years ago as a result of the behaviour of our banks. However, we need those same banks to provide new lending and investment to Irish small and medium-sized enterprises. This will allow the latter to employ people and to contribute to growth within our economy that will, in turn, pay the taxes that we need for our public services. At a time when we are so aware of the need to build more homes, in addition to the vital role that the State has to play in funding the delivery of those homes, we also need a banking system that is capable of providing new lending and investing in companies that are capable of building homes. The reason I am against the proposal for the report proposed by Senator Higgins is that what she suggesting that we tax our banks separately and in a different way from how we tax other firms within the economy. These banks employ 20,000 people and hold more than €220 billion in deposits, much of which is deposits from Irish people. Where I differ from the Senator is that while I am conscious of the considerable harm that the collapse of the banking sector did to our economy 15 years ago, the harm that is still there and the impact it had on people's lives, what kind of signal would it send out if we said that three banks that are registered in Ireland, that have nearly all of their employment located in Ireland, that most of the deposits in which are being managed on behalf of Irish households and businesses, and on which we are nearly entirely reliant for the lending that we will need to build more homes through our private sector, will be taxed differently from any other employer or business? I certainly believe that is not a signal we should send out. I am also confident that were we to send out such a signal, it would materially affect the value of the State shareholding in AIB and Permanent TSB. That, in turn, would cost us. At a time when I want Irish banks to be stronger - we have already seen the consequences of what happens if banks become weaker in our economy and decide to close branches and even to leave - I believe that kind of weakening of the value of the remaining banks that we have would be injurious to their value, to their ability to grow in the future, and even to their ability to employ and invest in the future. On the point relating to the change in bank pay that the Government accepted two weeks ago, I make the case again to the Seanad regarding where we stand at present. Let us say you have somebody who is superb at cybersecurity or excellent at meeting the regulatory requirements that the Central Bank places on a bank. Such individuals can earn salaries that are way in excess of the salaries that anybody in this House earns. Those salary levels are determined by the market. They are not determined by the regulator. They are certainly not determined by the Government. We have many large employers within our economy, including many large international banks and financial service providers that are not subject to that pay policy.If somebody has a particular skill and can do an important role within a bank, would that person not want that bank, which, by and large, holds Irish deposits and is a very big employer within our economy, to be able to offer terms comparable with those offered by the vast majority of banks that are in our economy that are not subjected to a pay cap and which employ far fewer people? Bearing in mind that even if the Senator agrees with my general point, which she probably will not, I have only made that change for a bank in which the State no longer has a single share. The question then becomes whether we believe it is appropriate that the Government sets salaries in a bank in which we no longer have a single share and from which we have regained €2 billion more than we had to invest in it at the time of the global financial crisis. I believe we should not do so. While that was a difficult decision and I appreciate the sensitivity and debate around it, I still believe it was the right one to make.

It is good the Minister has clarified that is not the case. There are people who are able to fulfil these functions. The competitive market that was mentioned, involving other banks that do not employ many people in the State but are somehow based here, may relate to a different discussion we need to have in terms of the regulation of the financial sector in Ireland. The core point is the suggestion that we are asking in these recommendations that banks pay tax in a different way. We are not asking for that. We have many different targeted tax relief and tax expenditure schemes with lots of different conditions around eligibility. They do not all apply to everybody in all circumstances. I am proposing that there be a constraint in respect of the deferred tax assets scheme. To be clear, the proposal is not for a special rate of tax for banks. It is about eligibility for the deferred tax asset scheme and the application of that scheme. It is a scheme that needs overhauling in general but there is a specific concern in this regard. Many of the arguments the Minister gave about banks giving loans, employing people and all of that are arguments against the banks ever paying tax because, as the Minister says, they do such important work. The fact is banks will always give loans, take deposits and have employees. If we start using that logic as a reason not to pay tax, we are on a slippery slope. In fact, the intention in regard to many of the banks is that they will not pay tax. Permanent TSB estimates it will not pay tax until 2038. AIB predicts it will not do so until 2037. We are looking at a period when they will not pay tax. With absolute respect to the Minister, given many banks have left the market and others have closed branches, there is a concern as to the question of loyalty. If we had been gathering revenue for the State in the recent period, there would have been other opportunities for the State to invest, to employ and, indeed, to look at other parts of our banking system, including things like Postbank and the credit unions, which might merit more support. There is a blind spot regarding deferred assets. We have talked about signals. Sending a signal to the public that the banks do not pay tax is a very concerning one for us to continue to send.

First, the effect of what the Senator is proposing would mean having a different taxation regime for banks from what applies in the rest of the economy. That would be the effect. Second, I did not say the banks that are not subject to a pay cap do not employ people within our economy. I said they employ fewer people than Bank of Ireland, AIB and Permanent TSB. Third, I would never suggest that the fact our banks have to lend within our economy and we rely upon them to invest in funding new infrastructure, business expansion and the delivery of homes is an argument they should not pay tax. Some of the banks the Senator referred to do not pay tax from a corporation tax point of view. The reason for that is they are taxed in the same way other employers and firms in our economy are taxed. That is appropriate and to change it and bring in a different taxation regime for the banking sector from that applying to the rest of the economy would be bad for the economy. Certainly, for banks in which we still have a share, it would decrease their value and the value of the State shareholding in them. Over time, those are consequences that would not be good for investment and employment within our economy.

The allocation has been growing substantially. I focus in this recommendation on one aspect of fossil fuel subsidies, namely, the excise duty exemption for jet kerosene used in both domestic and international commercial aviation. The revenue forgone from that measure was €634 million in 2019. It dwarves some of the moneys being spent on things like promoting active travel. We are subsidising the use of a fossil fuel, kerosene, for one industry. I welcome the recent comments by the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, that we need to look at aircraft leasing and the use of private jets. There is a very large aircraft leasing business in Ireland and private jets play a specific role in the impact on climate and greenhouse gas emissions. As I said, the jet kerosene element of our fossil fuel subsidies amounted to €634 million in 2019, which is the most recent year for which I have the data. The figure may be higher or lower this year. Is that excise duty exemption being examined and is it something we might see being rolled back, perhaps next year? It is a real concern, involving huge expenditure on something that is taking us in the wrong direction in respect of our carbon reduction targets.

The Commission has proposed a new energy taxation directive and, as part of that, a discussion is under way on whether the tax exemptions for aviation and maritime fuel should be removed. As a participant in this debate, as a representative of the Government of a country with an economy that relies heavily on air and maritime access, I have significant concerns about the impact on access to our island economy if we were to change significantly how fuel for aviation, in particular, is taxed across the EU. That debate is under way and it is a decision for another day. To the Senator's question as to whether the issue is being discussed at the moment, the answer is "Yes".

There are strong arguments for additional taxation on kerosene fuel, moving in the opposite direction. It will be important that we do not end up arguing against progress in this area as it is so internationally crucial. Perhaps there will be opportunities through the finance or climate committees - I am lucky to sit on both - to further scrutinise and engage on the position Ireland is taking in those important discussions.

Almost everybody in the House welcomes the introduction of TBESS. It will play an important role in assisting businesses and households with the energy crisis this winter. We might quibble about the lack of conditionality associated with the scheme, particularly for businesses, and I have concerns about changes to the payment of wages and to terms and conditions within workplaces, but nonetheless I support it. However, I have a particular concern about the exclusion of certain organisations from the scheme. I acknowledge what the Minister said about objecting to all the recommendations being brought forward here today but this recommendation relates to the operation of the scheme, which is very necessary this winter. I would like clarity as to why certain organisations are being excluded.  It is important to acknowledge that eligibility for the scheme is carefully set out in the Bill with regard to residential householders, the Schedule B case I businesses and those businesses that are exempt from Schedule D cases I and II, which relates to charities and sporting organisations. In setting out those criteria and then excluding certain financial institutions, credit unions are also excluded. We have just had a discussion about financial institutions. Are we really treating regulated funds and banks in the same vein as credit unions when it comes to exclusion from the scheme? Credit unions are member-led, not-for-profit organisations working within communities. They have operating costs. Why is the State excluding credit unions from the scheme? The second issue concerns organisations that are not for profit but do not fit into the category of a charity, sporting organisation or residential household. They have to pay significant energy bills. One example is the case of owners' management companies, OMCs. The Minister has received correspondence in his office from an apartment block close to where he and I are located. They are quite distressed that their energy bill has increased from €4,000 to €8,000 over the past 12 months. It is a very necessary energy cost and they cannot curtail or reduce it in any way because it relates to powering security cameras and indoor and outdoor lighting for common areas. This is not relating to use within the apartments themselves but the common areas. The role of director of an OMC is a thankless job. Many apartment blocks have enormous challenges as it stands, particularly in dealing with construction and fire defects. They now feel left out in the cold, so to speak, because they have been excluded from this scheme, notwithstanding that they have significant energy bills to contend with. Why have they been excluded? Is there any possibility of being able to include those organisations that I mentioned? As Senator Higgins indicated, we have no mechanism other than to table recommendations seeking a report. That is why we have drafted these recommendations in the way we have done. We are seeking a report six months after the passing of the Act that includes information about the classes of business that are and are not eligible. We have no other way of bringing this issue to the Bill. I look forward to the Minister's response.
#AliceMaryHiggins	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-party	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-dob	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-13 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	109	I second Senator Sherlock's recommendation and also have a number of recommendations of my own in this group. When a new scheme is brought in, it is important that it is targeted as effectively as possible. Any new scheme comes with significant cost. Being responsible means that we target it as effectively as possible. I am concerned by those who are included and those who are excluded in respect of this new scheme. When we table these recommendations, it is because this is a new scheme being rolled out right now. The earlier we identify concerns and the earlier the Government responds to them the better. In recommendation No. 7, I point out my concerns regarding the eligibility of data centres for support under the energy support scheme. The energy consumption of data centres is one of the key concerns we have to address in this State. It is estimated that data centres are using 14% of all energy today. There are projections of them using up to one third of electricity in the years ahead. The energy consumption of data centres and the pressure they are putting on the grid are significant. There is a danger that as well as putting pressure on the grid, they themselves are expressing lack of confidence because they know the grid will be under pressure, largely due to the fact that there has been a 285% increase in the energy demand from data centres. That is in respect of electricity. In Europe, the average for electricity has been a 0% increase. Ireland has had a 9% increase overall in electricity demand. Data centres have contributed to a 285% leap. The idea of us subsidising them under the energy support scheme just seems anomalous and poorly targeted. When they are not putting pressure on the grid, they are talking about stand-alone energy systems such as gas-fired or diesel generators which will affect us meeting our sectoral targets in our carbon budget. When the State is having a discussion with data centres on energy usage, the idea that we are also supplementing such demand with public moneys through an energy support scheme seems anomalous. If the concern is around targeting a particular kind of business, my second recommendation addresses that. It will capture many of the same actors. It simply provides that the TBESS should not be targeted at companies that have an annual turnover of more than €20 million. This would address many of the same issues. Massive international companies have data centres. If the Government does not want to screen by type, it could screen for those who do not need this State support. Large companies with turnovers of €20 million per annum do not need this targeted State support to the same degree. I am sure there is a case they can make but they do not need it in the same was as our small and medium-sized businesses do. Rather than focus resources on those who are extraordinarily profitable, the Government should redirect towards the kinds of businesses that have been mentioned such as the credit unions.I strongly support the points made by Senator Sherlock in respect of both our credit unions and the community and voluntary sector, which is the subject of my amendment No. 9. The sector is a safety net for society and it engages with real people who are in danger of health consequences, for example, from energy poverty. It is a concern if the community services and the very often vulnerable persons who use them are unable to access adequate heating. The energy subsidy is very much needed in those areas. One example is the drugs and alcohol task forces, which are only now seeing their funding restored to the level it was at back in 2006 but face considerable additional costs that never existed at that time. Widening access to the scheme is needed at the bottom of society for the organisations that do considerable work in reaching individuals and provide places for the community at a time when households are under pressure. A re-examination is also needed of money being wasted by the State at the very top level for those very large companies that, frankly, do not need it.

The data centres are associated with large companies, as Senators said, which are also large employers in Ireland. The retention of data centres within our country is a very important ingredient of how we can keep jobs within our country, especially in the context of changes happening in corporate taxation in the time ahead, when it will be even more important to have other sources of attraction for large employers to associate large amounts of investment within our economy. I am always struck when we get into this debate by how I always hear reference to large profitable companies but never to the fact they are very large employers as well. That is critical in the assessment of data centres. I will not start naming companies associated with data centres, but the vast majority are significant employers as well. Large employment and the location of data centres are not coincidences. They are part of what our economy can offer, which will be even more important in the years ahead. That being said, Senator Higgins raised an important point about large energy users participating in an energy support scheme running the risk of being disproportionate beneficiaries. This is the very reason we have a monthly cap of €10,000 in place. It will ensure, as more businesses move on to the scheme, we preserve the scheme in such a way that the resources will be available to allow us to maintain it for small- and medium-sized businesses. The exact possibility of large energy users being the largest users of this scheme is the reason a cap of €10,000 is in place per month per trade. Can a data centre be on this scheme? The answer is "Yes". However, the most a data centre will access from it is €10,000 per month which means it is far more likely they will look to access other schemes available throughout the State to support large energy users that, in turn, tend to be large employers as well. With regard to the point that was raised about credit unions by Senator Sherlock, they are excluded from the TBESS. The reason for that is credit and financial institutions are excluded under the EU temporary crisis framework. Credit unions in Ireland fall under that definition just as other financial institutions in other jurisdictions do. That is the reason credit unions are not included in the scheme. The Senator made another point about common spaces and lighting within apartment blocks in the context of management companies. Regrettably, they are excluded from the scheme with the rationale being that this is a temporary business energy support scheme. The scheme's criteria are laid out as being case 1 and case 2 categories within our tax code, one of which is trading businesses and the other, professions. They should be tax compliant and there should be a significant increase in their natural gas and electricity schemes. I expect, over time, this will be a broadly used scheme but whenever a scheme such as this is put together, as I know the Senator will appreciate, there are always entities and businesses that will be outside its scope. The purpose of this scheme is to support businesses to support employment and to try to avoid a very large price shock turning in to an employment shock. With regard to the other thrust of the group of amendments put forward, especially amendment No. 8 from Senator Higgins regarding the need for more information on the operation of the scheme, it has now become a custom that with these large interventions within our economy, other examples of which being the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance will publish information regarding use every month. I am confident the information the House seeks this afternoon will be available an awful lot sooner than in six months. We will aim to publish data on the use and cost of the scheme on a monthly basis through the Revenue Commissioners just as we did with the EWSS and other similar schemes. With regard to the final point put to me by Senator Higgins on charity and community voluntary organisations that will be excluded from this, if one has a tradeable and taxable income such as a charity shop, one is included in the scheme. If one does not meet the definition, one will be excluded, which means some community and voluntary organisations will be excluded. However, my other colleagues in government have brought forward other schemes that aim to support some community and sporting organisations that are not businesses with the higher cost of energy. As always, even in a scheme this broad and potentially this big, it is regrettable there are entities outside its definition but it is also unavoidable and that is why other Departments are bringing forward schemes looking to provide other forms of help.

The national delivery of our public services is crucial. I refer in this recommendation to transferring certain functions to local government, but there is also scope for additional taxation and expenditure competencies to be taken up by local authorities. Taxes are a central source of revenue for local authorities. In many countries, local government bodies have the power to set their own tax rates, raise additional taxes and develop targeted taxation systems. That power is usually limited by legislation and, of course, the national government has overarching power to set the permissible parameters of the rates of tax that can be imposed by local government and the areas of appropriate expenditure. Under many such systems, local authorities have the power to procure loans to buy and sell property and engage in business activities, as provided for in legislation. Many even have the power to establish companies, co-operatives and foundations. A large number of countries have national constitutions that include provisions relating to the power and autonomy of local authorities. In Germany, for example, there is municipal financial sovereignty. In Ireland, local authorities have lost considerable power over the recent period and they face significant challenges. There are very few targeted schemes, the property tax being one of the only examples, that allow local authorities to apply targeted taxation measures and to follow through with targeted expenditure. As we know, there is a wealth of wisdom, understanding and local knowledge within local government in respect of such measures. We also know that some parts of the economy have very particular impacts in specific geographic areas. In San Francisco, to give an example of how things are done internationally, a small levy is charged on hotel night stays, the revenue from which goes to a fund that is directed towards the arts, creative activity and community activity in the city, which are, in themselves, some of the major factors that attract tourists to that location. The city authority was able to introduce a targeted measure that is appropriate to the context of its locality both in terms of the taxation itself and how the expenditure of the revenue raised is ring-fenced. There are certain local authorities in the State that are very aware of areas of opportunity for taxation that may not be appropriate to apply in the same way in every part of the country but that are, for instance, suitable to an urban area or a local county council area. These are areas in which local authorities might identify potential for a small levy or additional taxation, which could serve as a resource for those authorities. As we know, many local authorities have struggled to reflect their ambition and the ideas they have to meet the needs of those who live in their area.In Spain, for example, some local authorities have ring fenced a very small amount of their budget for participatory budgeting. They have all of the normal budgeting that would be done, including national and local budgeting but a very small revenue or tax is gathered and its expenditure is decided on the basis of participative budgeting. We are talking about a ring-fenced amount which, at a few million euro, is small in the grander scheme of things but it empowers local communities and local areas to have a say in how they can effectively address the ideas and needs of their local areas. It gives a strong sense of engagement in democracy and decision making at a local level. This is quite a wide issue but is one we need to start examining. Ireland is somewhat unusual in how little power its local authorities have in this regard. If we strengthened this provision or even started piloting models under which it could be done, we might be surprised by the beneficial outcomes that could arise. I urge the Minister to accept the recommendation. I have given a year for the report looking into those possibilities to be published.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-13 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	123	To some extent provision already exists for budgeting at local authority level via the local property tax, LPT, which facilitates a responsiveness of taxation policy to a geographically specific context, that is, each local authority area. LPT is an essential source of funding for local authorities, accounting for approximately 8% of current income this year. The annual LPT allocation supplements local authority income from commercial rates from the provision of goods and services and Government grants. LPT provides appropriate levels of financial support to individual local authorities, allowing them to sustain their continued efforts to achieve balanced budgets and helps to fund important local services such as parks, libraries, leisure amenities, fire and emergency services, the maintenance and cleaning of streets, and street lighting, all of which benefit citizens directly. Since 2015 local authorities have had the power to vary the rates of LPT in their areas by up to 15%. If an authority decides to vary the LPT basic rate upwards by up to 15%, it retains 100% of the additional income collected in the area. If the rate is reduced, the authority forgoes the full amount of the reduced LPT income collected. This is in line with the commitment in the programme for Government, Our Shared Future.  The LPT allocation mechanism for 2023 will be changed to allow for 100% of the estimated yield to be retained locally within the local authority area where it is collected. This was done on the basis that those counties with a lower LPT base are adjusted via an annual national equalisation fund paid from the Exchequer. Twenty two local authorities voted to increase LPT above the basic rate for 2021. These authorities benefit from just over €20 million in additional LPT income for their own use this year as result of their decisions to vary the rates upwards. Four authorities have a reduced rate, with a corresponding reduction in income foregone. As LPT helps to fund local services, local authorities are encouraged each year to communicate to the public regarding how funds are spent.  I accept the validity of the Senator's argument that additional taxation should be raised by local authorities. It is not often that I hear such a request being made and I am surprised to hear it here. While I accept it is her point of view, I would not be encouraging local authorities to raise more taxes. While local authorities set the LPT rate, the tax is collected by the Revenue Commissioners. LPT is paid to the Revenue Commissioners and it then goes to the relevant local authorities. It is so successful, in terms of the very high rate of compliance and collection of LPT, at more than 90%, precisely because of the involvement of the Revenue Commissioners in its collection. The collection rate by the Revenue Commissioners is outstanding. It is one of the most efficient organisations in this State which is why the collection rate for the LPT funds is so high. It is very important, therefore, that the Revenue Commissioners would continue to play that strong role as the collection authority. One could almost say it acts as an agent for the local authorities in collecting these taxes. If one compares the LPT collection rate with the local authorities' own collection rates for housing arrears and other arrears of funds that are due to them, one sees they have not been very efficient at collecting same. In that context, I would not like to see local authorities given sanction to collect extra taxes because their collection record is not as good as that of the Revenue Commissioners.  A lot of motor taxation is paid online now but some of it is still collected by the local authorities. They collect it as an agent of the Exchequer and the funds go to the local authorities by way of grants from the Department of Transport to fund their roads and transport infrastructure. Another major source of funds for local authorities are commercial rates and, again, I would suggest that they have a very strong mandate in terms of setting the rate and collecting the money owed. They also have the power to set and collect parking charges in their areas and to set the development levies attached to planning permission granted in their areas.  There are already strong mechanisms in place to enable local authorities to raise and collect a significant amount of funding. The equalisation fund helps to balance funding to local authorities. Some counties cover a large geographic area and have considerable roads infrastructure, for example, but have a relatively small population from whom LPT is collected or a small commercial rates base which is why we need an overall umbrella approach to the funding for local authorities.  Senator Higgins made reference to a large US city but that does not equate to a typical local authority area in Ireland that might have 100,000 or 150,000 people in it. One cannot directly compare a large US city with an Irish local authority area. The city to which she refers would be of a scale way beyond any local authority area in Ireland. For the various reasons just outlined, particularly the fact that the LPT already exists, I cannot accept this recommendation from Senators Higgins and Ruane.

He was a great friend of all of us in this House and of all of the staff and Members of the Oireachtas. We had many great conversations with him. We really enjoyed the by-election campaign in Kilkenny when we were fighting for the seat he won back. We always enjoyed the hospitality we received in Kilkenny from his family. He is being remembered in Dáil Éireann today and we join in that remembrance in Seanad Éireann as well.

In relation to this recommendation, the direct comparator is Dublin and our capital city certainly makes a point of going around comparing itself to San Francisco when it is seeking investment from many of the same kinds of companies that have a home in that US city. Many of us will have had the experience, which does not just apply to San Francisco, of visiting a city and paying a city tax when we stay in a hotel there. That is a standard charge that is applied in lots of cities of various sizes across Europe and elsewhere. It is an important source of funding.  Unlike many others, I support the LPT because while it is not always very well targeted, it is important to look to wealth and to taxation on wealth as well as on income in this State. Taxation can also be at its most effective when it is targeted in relation to particular activities. As the Minister himself said, there are particular parts of the country that may not have large revenues coming through from property tax or from commercial rates. They may have a particular context, specific powers and forms of activity that take place within their areas which might be appropriate for a smaller, targeted tax measure. I say that because I am a little concerned. I know we are moving towards retention, at every level, of the local property tax but there will be a concern when it comes to equalisation because there are local authority areas which are really strapped with regard to their incomes.  The collection issue is not really the main concern in that regard. There is very good reason arrears may not always be collected. The last thing we want is for local authorities to start to move towards evicting or putting pressure on local authority tenants at these very difficult times in housing. However, one of the concerns about the vacant site tax has been about the tax not going back to the local area where it was collected. That was one of the problems. Local authorities were remiss in applying and collecting the vacant site tax but if the moneys from that tax had been ring-fenced for urban or rural development, it might have incentivised and encouraged greater take-up and application of the tax function. I am looking to the future in some of the areas where we need most action, such as climate change. I am thinking of transition communities such as those in Phibsboro and Donegal. There are local authority areas which have had a greater level of ambition than the national level. I am also looking to the idea that they might be able to come up with targeted, appropriate taxation measures and expenditure plans which might turn out to be leading measures when it comes to addressing the climate crisis. We have seen communities and cities throughout Europe and the wider world which have led, often ahead of their states, in this regard. I am trying to ensure local authorities have the tools to do that.

This is a broader issue than the Finance Bill because much of what has been discussed here is about the role of local authorities. Such a matter would have to be dealt with as part of a whole-of-government approach with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, which has a key role in this area. This suggestion could not be taken on by the Department of Finance without having a full consultation with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage on the matters we are discussing. I am not in a position to take the recommendation on board as a result. That is a key factor and it needs to be said. I will raise an awkward situation from a few years ago, when we brought in the water rates. They were to be collected by local authorities as well. This created its own difficulties when people felt they had paid their taxes in the first place for the provision of public services. I would always be very careful about introducing an extra tax at local authority level to pay for projects when people may feel they have already paid their taxes to provide these services. It would require a long and detailed discussion in wider society and not just a debate such as this on the Finance Bill. This type of debate is far larger than the specifics of the Finance Bill and for that reason, I cannot under any circumstances take on the recommendation.

#AliceMaryHiggins	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-party	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-dob	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-13 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	131	Recommendations Nos. 11 and 12 relate to the concern about the required threshold of only 30 days of annual occupancy in order for a property to be considered exempt from the proposed vacant property tax. This threshold is extremely low with regard to international norms. Dr. Gerard Turley, an economist at the University of Galway, noted that in other countries and cities throughout the world that have introduced vacant property taxes, the usual cut-off period is six months. In Ireland's case, it is one month, which is a very low bar to meet. The idea of a vacant property tax has been long called for. It was very much welcomed. Many people, when they saw the 30-day requirement, came to me believing it meant the property would be considered a vacant property if it were vacant for 30 days when, of course, the opposite is the case. The scheme says that if the property is occupied for just 30 days per year, it is not considered a vacant property. That is not an adequate measure because we are not talking about derelict properties, we are talking about vacant properties. With regard to dereliction, the test of whether one can occupy the property at all may be relevant. However, the problem with vacancy is that properties are being left empty for much of the entire year. We know there are considerable volumes of vacant properties throughout this State that could and should be used to address the housing crisis. The legislation creates an obligation on owners to provide proof of occupancy in the home in the form of an electricity bill or other documenting proof but, with a low threshold of just 30 days, it is very hard to prove somebody is not there for 30 days if he or she claims to be. The bar becomes quite difficult. Some other states and places have gone for 90 days. If the property is empty or vacant for three quarters or half of the year, it should be considered vacant. With regard to bringing homes back into use, this very small occupancy period incentivises people to keep the properties not just as holiday homes but as holiday homes for a very tiny period of the year. We have been looking to and calling on people to try to make their properties available even for shorter periods of time. However, a one-month threshold means many of the properties will be holiday homes. It also gives cover to those who sit on properties. I know this. I live in an apartment building in the city centre and I see apartments around me which sit empty because their value and theoretical rent is going up and they can be traded as commodities. There is an argument that 30 days of occupation in a year is not enough, even for holiday homes, but even if the Minister wished to exempt holiday homes, we have a separate second home tax. It would be possible to refine the measure to treat owners of holiday homes slightly differently from owners of multiple apartments in large apartment blocks which are left vacant other than during a 30-day let to a corporate tenant or, indeed, just 30 days a year of having anybody move in. It allows them to keep the asset empty and continue trading it an asset rather than treating it as a potential home. If holiday homes are the reason we are having a 30-day requirement versus the standard 90-day or 180-day requirement which is usual everywhere else in the world that has applied a vacant property tax, and if he wishes for such a tax to be effective, the Minister should find a targeted measure to address the holiday home issue. However, he should not provide cover for speculators who trade in vacant houses and properties or make it incredibly easy for them to evade a vacant property tax. Recommendation No. 13 seeks to deal with the fact that the vacant home tax leaves out derelict properties entirely. The former Civil Engagement Group Senator, Grace O'Sullivan, of the Green Party, first introduced legislation on this issue in the last Oireachtas. We have been calling for measures to tackle vacant properties since 2017 and we are only now seeing some action on that. When Senator Grace O'Sullivan introduced her Derelict and Vacant Sites Bill 2017, she referred to the need to address both vacant and derelict sites as connected parts of the same problem. Decoupling the issues is short-sighted. The derelict sites levy is administered by the councils, as we have discussed. If that levy were going back into local authorities, we might see a better application of it. However, as administered, it has been an absolute failure. The local authorities have failed in their collection of the tax. In 2021, only €1.1 million out of the €4.5 million that was owed in derelict site levies was collected by city and county councils, which is a collection rate of 23%. A total of 18 councils failed to collect any levy at all. The derelict site levies, as they currently operate, are not working and are not being applied. We may need to take a carrot-and-stick approach to address this. Pressure must be put on local authorities to apply the levy properly and there should be an incentive whereby the moneys collected from it can be spent on addressing dereliction and building local community amenities and shared public spaces. Alternatively, we may need to introduce national levies that explicitly address derelict sites. We cannot continue with an inadequate measure that is being inadequately applied. In France, the vacant property tax in operation there has had a very useful impact. It is interesting to note that in that jurisdiction, vacant homes and derelicts buildings are addressed through the same legislation. Recommendation No. 14 relates to the disappointingly low rate of vacant homes tax that has, finally, been proposed. It is to be set at just three times the local property tax rate, which means the tax will amount to only 0.3% of the property value. I am conscious that it may not continue to be the case but property values have massively increased in recent years. In many cases, the increases has been far more than 0.3%. If we want to discourage the actions of speculators who have no interest in delivering housing or renting it out and are, rather, interested in having a portfolio of assets they can trade, we need to ensure the penalties for not putting a property into use are higher than the profits to be gained from simply choosing to leave that property vacant. Property prices increased by 14% between June 2021 and June 2022. A potential fine of 0.3% of the property value, with a requirement that one need only have a tenant in the property for 30 days, versus a 14% hike in the value of the property is a significant imbalance. Recommendation No. 15 likewise relates to the need to deter property hoarding. It calls for a report on another option for the functioning of the vacant homes tax, which seeks potentially to link the tax to property price inflation. Again, I am conscious that prices can move in both directions and the proposal is one to consider carefully. It is about trying to keep pace with the dynamic whereby price inflation is such that it nullifies the impact of the tax. The recommendation proposes a linking of the two but it would have to be done in a careful way, using a backstop to ensure that if there is a sudden drop in property prices, there would not be a fall in the vacant homes tax. Recommendation No. 16 calls for a report on the introduction of a stricter definition of "market rent" in the legislation. The current wording allows owners to seek exemptions from the vacant homes tax if they have attempted to rent their property out without success, with the caveat that the property should be offered at market rent. As we know from the operation of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, the definition of "market rent" currently in use can be quite meaningless. It is defined as whatever a willing tenant and landlord can agree. In an environment in which landlords have all the bargaining power, it is not a meaningful restriction. We could easily see a large number of people claiming false exemptions from the tax on the basis of this weak definition. There is no link to the affordability of the rent or its being in any way index-linked to inflation. This recommendation asks the Minister to look at using a definition that is stronger and is linked to the data we have from the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, rather than the vague concept of what a tenant is willing to pay. If a landlord can find anybody who will pay €3,000 a month, he or she can say that is what a willing tenant has paid in the particular locality and, therefore, all the properties he or she has to rent out can be advertised at €3,000 a month. The landlord can then choose not to rent out the properties and not pay the vacant homes tax. I have seen properties in the city centre advertised for a year at intentionally outrageous rents that no one will pay. Perhaps the owners have one example of somebody who paid that price. The rents being asked for certainly are not reflective of the real averages and figures. Rather than having a vague definition of "market rent", let us look to the data from the RTB to see what it is charting as being an appropriate rent for an area. If landlords claim they have advertised a property and tried to rent it out, that claim should be tested against what the RTB regards as an appropriate rent for the area. That would be a better test.

I spoke to Helena outside and explained that I am in the Seanad for this debate and will not be in the Dáil Chamber for the expressions of sympathy. I turn now to recommendations Nos. 11 to 16, inclusive, which are being discussed together. Addressing vacancy and maximising the use of existing housing stock is a priority for the Government. In its Housing for All strategy, the Government set out a suite of incentives to encourage the reuse of properties and increase the supply of housing. In addition, the Government is committed to exploring options around sanctions for non-use of residential property and ensuring there is some penalty for leaving a home vacant for a prolonged period without genuine cause. To that end, the Minister announced the introduction of a vacant homes tax in budget 2023. Senators Higgins and Ruane have made a number of recommendations for reports on various aspects of the new tax, including the duration of vacancy, the rate at which it is charged, options to include derelict properties and a definition of "market rent". As with all new tax measures introduced, the Department will monitor the vacant homes tax and if it is not considered to be effective in bringing more properties into use, the Minister will have no hesitation in reviewing how it operates. It is a new tax being introduced, with arrangements being put in place for it to be paid in the coming year and the years to come. We will have to see how it works. If it needs improvement, if the rates at which the tax can be levied or if the definitions or method of collection need to change, that all can be considered, but we need some information as a base for drawing any conclusion. That can only happen after the legislation takes effect and we see how it works for a period. The Bill certainly can be revisited at that stage. Regarding the duration of vacancy, a minimum threshold of residential occupancy aims to strike the appropriate balance between incentivising owners of vacant homes to bring their properties back into use without penalising homeowners for normal, temporary vacancy. The Finance Bill sets out a threshold of 30 days. Senator Higgins proposes that my Department compile a report on setting the minimum occupancy threshold at either 90 or 180 days, based on the recommendations submitted. The latter would mean any property that is not occupied for more than half the year would be liable for the vacant homes tax. In that scenario, many instances of infrequent occupancy of a property would be subject to the tax. This would unfairly penalise property owners who have understandable reasons for not occupying their homes on a full-time basis. These include situations such as where people are working away from their homes.We all know people who may have to take the first flight out on a Monday morning because they are working in London or elsewhere in the UK and come back on a Friday evening. Their properties would fall under that definition. We all know sales reps who are on the road and leave on a Monday and get back on a Thursday night or Friday. Their properties would also fall within that situation. Some people have caring responsibilities for an individual who is not well and during the course of a year they may stay a number of nights in the other person's house. Their home may not be occupied in that situation. Therefore, it would be wrong to introduce a tax on people when they stay with an elderly relative, neighbour or a person for whom they have a caring duty. In addition to penalising vacancy with understandable reasons, taxing vacancy at this level would not support the tax policy rationale of increasing housing supply. Such properties are not the intended target of the new tax as they are not likely to be made available for sale or rent. The purpose of the tax is not to raise revenue or penalise owning additional properties but to incentivise bringing such properties that are genuinely unoccupied back into use. By contrast, where a property is in use as a dwelling for less than 30 days in a 12-month period, consideration should be given to whether the property could be put to greater use. It is appropriate to apply a tax on vacancy as a means to encourage owners to bring such properties into residential use. Regarding derelict properties, the vacant homes tax seeks to target properties that are habitable and ready to be occupied quickly. Accordingly, VHT would be applied to properties that are residential properties for the purposes of local property tax, that is properties that are suitable for use as a dwelling. In this way, the tax targets properties that could be put to greater use with immediate effect as well as allowing for simpler administration and for the tax to be implemented quickly by Revenue. A site may be deemed not liable for local property tax due to being unsuitable for use as a dwelling, or uninhabitable as the case may be. Revenue has a clear definition of what it deems "habitable" to be. In developing a new tax, an important consideration is simplicity. It is important to ensure the tax is easy to understand and administer. This is why the Minister chose to set the rate of the vacant homes tax at a multiple of a property’s base local property tax charge, as the LPT system is well understood at this stage. Everybody understands it and they know, in relation to this particular tax, they can multiple the charge by three. While Senators Higgins and Ruane recommend the Department considers a variable rate of vacant homes tax, price growth and rent increases do not take place evenly nationwide. We could have variations from county to county, between regions within counties, or urban areas versus rural areas within counties. That would make the whole situation difficult to manage and would not achieve the effect of collecting the tax as an incentive to encourage people to make sure their house is not left vacant when it could otherwise be made habitable. With regard to the definition of "market rent" for the purposes of this tax, section 96 of the Bill refers to the definition provided in section 24 of the Residential Tenancies Act. In short, "market rent" in this context means the rent that a new, willing tenant would give and that which a willing landlord would accept for the occupation of a vacant dwelling. The Senator has referred to this specifically. The decision to use the definition of "market rent" in the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 for VHT purposes was deliberate. A clear and consistent understanding of the term avoids confusion. It would not be right to have one definition in the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 and to have a different definition in the Finance Bill. That is one of the reasons we want to ensure the tax is easily understood so people can, on a self-assessment basis, work out what is due without having to get professional advice. For the variety of reasons I have mentioned, I do not intend to accept the recommendation proposed by the Senators.

It is not about those who are commuting or are out of the house for two or three days per week because the standard to be set is that there would be electricity to the house and a person literally dwelling there. It does not state that a person must physically sit in the house all day long. It is a matter of saying that it needs to be an occupied property and not a vacant property. The Minister of State's examples are not pertinent in this regard. However, what is pertinent is the many examples of empty, corporate properties that are theoretical corporate lets that may or may not be rented. I appreciate the Minister of State plans to review this. I expect and hope this can be done before the next budget because I am concerned this tax as designed will not be effective as it should be and there are far too many loopholes and exemptions.

As noted in the previous debate here, the provisions of this legislation are targeted at core issues. Hopefully they will allow the credit union sector to provide a wider set of products to all members, as well as aiding greater investment, confidence and collaboration while supporting volunteer directors in a practical way. The role played by credit unions in supporting local communities remains crucial, particularly given the impending withdrawal of Ulster Bank and KBC and the closure of many bank branches. The objective of this Bill is to establish a robust and modern regulatory framework for credit unions which will enable them to fully realise their potential. The legislation will move to the Dáil following its passage here today and if there are any positive proposals for amendments to the Bill to improve it, the Government will take them into consideration. Any amendments made to the Bill in Dáil Éireann will have to be approved by Seanad Éireann.

“Report on returned carers’ PRSI credit
5. The Minister shall, within six months of the passing of this Act, lay a report before both Houses of the Oireachtas on options to ensure that those who have returned from overseas who care for a family member are not excluded from qualification for Carer’s Allowance or PRSI credit due to the fact that they do not have PRSI contributions in their previous 2 years.”.I might not press this amendment because I am not sure it is correctly worded. I was trying to address an issue that arises in respect of qualification for carer's benefit or carer's allowance. A certain contributory element is required for carer's benefit but there is not the same contributory requirement for carer's allowance. I do not think the amendment is perfectly worded. I am trying to get at the anomalous situation with regard to people who might be living abroad before returning home to care for an elderly parent. They will have not been in the system because carer's allowance has an attached habitual residency condition of two years and they will not have the contributory credits for the carer's benefit. They find that they are almost invisible to the system because they have not had a visible presence with contributions in the previous two years. People might come home in that way and may well end up staying at home for five or ten years but not get carer's allowance during that time or, crucially, acquire stamps towards their eventual pension in that time. I worry that come in to perform the carer role, which the carer's benefit and carer's allowance are designed to support, but somehow slip out of the social protection system and do not have access. That is the issue I am trying to address. I do not believe the amendment is perfectly worded but I would be interested in the Minister's thoughts about how we can address that small cohort of people who face significant consequences of not accessing our safety nets and social supports.

People coming from abroad are not excluded from applying for carer's allowance if they meet the habitual residency condition. It applies across the board. It is a requirement for eligibility for means-tested social assistance payments and child benefits. It is aimed at restricting access to such payments by people who have little or no established connection with Ireland. The habitual residency clause is provided for in Irish social welfare legislation and is in accordance with EU legislation and European Court of Justice jurisprudence. The habitual residency clause applies regardless of nationality or ethnicity. When determining whether a person is habitually resident in the State for social protection purposes, all circumstances of the case are considered, including whether the person has the right to reside here and five factors, which are the length and continuity of the person's residence in the State or any other country, the length and purpose of any absence by the person from the State, the nature and pattern of the person's employment, the person's main centre of interest, and the future intentions of the person as they appear from all the circumstances. Each case is dealt with on an individual basis. The legislative provisions with respect to habitual residency apply to child benefit and to the range of means-tested social assistance schemes operated by the Department. It is in place in accordance with EU legislation and the European Court of Justice's jurisprudence.

The Minister listed the kind of criteria used to establish habitual residency, such as length of living somewhere else and length of living in Ireland. The criteria even include future intentions. Often, when people come home, they might think they are only coming home for six months, but it can become permanent. I hope the Minister will look to address certain situations. If people are in a situation where they are caring for a relative and come home to do so, how might they fit with regard to the habitual residency condition? Crucially, is there an opportunity in two years' time for people? If they come home and do not initially qualify for the allowance because they do not meet the habitual residency condition, could we ensure that they are encouraged to apply again if they find themselves still in that situation in two years? Even though that period would not be in the PRSI system, could those two years be recognised? Some people come, look for support once, do not get it, and then stay outside of the system until they often find themselves in old age and poverty. There may be scope for looking at how that process applies in this particular circumstance and ensuring that those who might not qualify initially are given an appointment or encouragement to come back to be reassessed for the period of care they have done, even though it would not be recognised by carer's allowance or carer's benefit, and recognised as part of their substantial connection to the State.

	“Report on care credits
5. The Minister shall, within six months of the passing of this Act, lay a report before both Houses of the Oireachtas on options to introduce care credits which ensure that periods of time spent caring are recognised not only in terms of pensions, but also when assessing other social protection entitlements or voluntary access to INTREO, Back to Education and other relevant schemes.”.My amendment relates to carers in the wider sense and their access to social protection entitlements, not carers in terms of those who might qualify for the carer's benefit or allowance. My amendment relates to those who contribute care in other ways that may be recognisable, for example, in respect of qualifying for a pension but are not recognised in engagement with the social protection system. We will discuss the pensions system later. There is provision within that system whereby a certain period spent, for example, caring for a family or children can be recognised as contributions when it comes to calculating somebody's pension eligibility. I am concerned by some of the limits and how such work is recognised but that is a separate discussion. I want to discuss the individuality issue. If somebody has spent five or ten years caring for a family, he or she is prior to pension point invisible in the social protection system because most social protection payments or schemes consider a person's contributions for the previous the two years. If a person has been effectively out of the system for five or ten years caring for others or for family members, he or she is treated like a brand new applicant and any previous working contribution he or she has made is not considered valid and has expired in terms of relevance so only the most recent few years are considered. The reason that I am interested in care credits is so that people not just have the period of care assessed when it comes to pension but have the period of care recognised throughout. For example, if someone takes five years to deliver care then he or she should continue to be registered in the system and continue to be given PRSA stops for that period. I mean that it would not just be reflected in his or her pension but it would also mean that he or she has a relationship with the social welfare system whereby he or she could, for example, access back to education schemes, Intreo schemes or any schemes, particularly on a voluntary basis. All this would encourage people who have been at a distance from the system to engage and voluntarily access schemes or projects when, for example, a child enters secondary school and things might become more possible for a person. Historically, many people who were in the system and maybe paying PRSI stamps and who took a period out to provide care end up never going back into the social protection system except as a qualified adult or an adult dependant. That person becomes a financial contribution attached to his or her spouse's payment if the spouse is getting a social welfare payment but the person does not have an individual relationship with the social protection system that allows him or her to access schemes and projects. Again, for many people in making that decision to have that connection, the voluntary nature of engagement, and the fact that one may wish to, for example, start considering part-time employment and so on, are the options that should be there for people. This is worth considering. Seeing as the care period is going to be recognised anyway when it comes to pensions, why not start recognising it earlier so that it can function as a connection between the individuals, who are mainly women, and the social protection system on an ongoing basis? That would mean we would get multiple benefits from something that is going to get recognised when it comes to pensions.

The carer's allowance is a qualifying payment for access to both the back to education allowance and the back to work enterprise allowance. The back to education allowance is a second-chance educational opportunity scheme. It supports certain social welfare recipients to continue to receive a payment while pursuing an approved full-time education course that leads to a higher qualification than that already held. Participants must continue to maintain eligibility to an underlying social welfare payment for the duration of the allowance. The person being cared for must transfer to a different carer for the period of the back to education allowance claim as the premise of carer’s allowance is providing full-time care and attention. If a carer wishes to become self-employed, he or she may be eligible for the back to work enterprise allowance. The back to work enterprise allowance scheme is designed to provide a monetary incentive for people in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment to develop a business while allowing them to retain a reducing proportion of their payment over two years with no restriction on the number of hours worked. A person retains 100% of their payment in year 1 and 75% in year 2. Furthermore, Intreo employment services are available to any person looking for employment support or advice on a voluntary walk-in basis. Of course, carers can work or study 18.5 hours per week and still retain the carer’s allowance.

For example, that is caring for children or family so care as recognised within the pensions system. I understand what the Minister said but many people do not receive the carer's allowance or benefit but deliver care to children in their family. My amendment concerns the disconnect that happens between many women and the social protection system where they stop being individually visible within the system and move towards the adult dependants phase. Again, I am looking at something a little different and understand that there has been confusion in that regard. I am talking about the kinds of credits used for the pension system. I respect that there is voluntary access to Intreo but I am thinking of the back to work enterprise scheme or the back to education scheme. I want to ensure that women as they come to the end of a period of, say, caring for a child get access to these schemes on a voluntary basis. I want them to have individual recognition in the system rather than be solely attached to a partner's payment. I recall that in the previous Seanad, departmental officials came in, and while anybody can access Intreo, there have been times where we were told that resources get prioritised and those who work are on a voluntary basis are often not prioritised in access to schemes. Anybody who reaches out on a voluntary basis is exactly who should be prioritised because these are people who are looking to start a connection with the workplace. I am talking about something brand new but it would be constructive and in the spirit of recognising care work in the pensions system.

“Report on extension of eligibility for Fuel Allowance
11. The Minister shall, within six months of the passing of this Act, lay a report before both Houses of the Oireachtas on the potential extension of eligibility for the Fuel Allowance to those in receipt of the Working Family Payment, including an analysis of the impact of such a measure on poverty rates, particularly of lone parent households.”.My amendment seeks a report on the potential extension of eligibility for the fuel allowance to those in receipt of the working family payment and an analysis of the potential impact of such a measure on poverty rates, including those who are in lone parent households but receive the working family payment. Households that are struggling at this current time.There are certain targeted measures from the State in respect of them, but they are largely blanket measures. This would enable one of our targeted measures - fuel allowance - to reach families that are known to be under pressure to the point where they are qualifying for the working family payment. Has this possibility been examined? Could it be looked at? There is a big difference between families on low incomes and those on higher incomes. This would allow us to add to the general provisions in legislation a layer of provision that is more targeted to the households that need it most.

Fuel allowance is paid to social welfare recipients such as pensioners, people with disabilities, lone parents and long-term unemployed people in recognition of their long-term financial dependence on their social welfare payment for all or most of their income. People on long-term payments are unlikely to have additional resources of their own and are more vulnerable to poverty, including energy poverty. It is for this reason the Department allocates additional payments, supports and resources such as fuel allowance to this group of people. The working family payment is a weekly, tax-free payment available to employees with children. It gives extra financial support to families with children, with rates depending on their incomes and family size. It is not considered a long-term social protection payment. Recipients are in employment and are more likely to have additional resources. A person in receipt of the working family payment can continue to receive the payment for 52 weeks even if their income increases. The payment is set and continues at that rate. While, in general, a household in receipt of working family payment is not eligible for the fuel allowance payment, this is not the case when a person is in receipt of the one-parent family payment and the working family payment together. A lone parent who is in receipt of both of those payments can qualify for and receive the fuel allowance payment. As part of the overall social welfare budget 2023 package of €2.2 billion, I was pleased to announce a few measures with regard to the working family payment. In November 2022, people receiving the working family payment received a lump sum payment of €500. In January 2023, the working family payment income limits will increase by €40 across all family sizes. Research from the Economic and Social Research Institute has shown that this is the single most important social protection measure the Government can take to alleviate poverty. I think the House will agree that the Government has clearly focused on the working family payment in this budget. That said, a report on this is timely and I will arrange to do that.

It would be useful. We will come to lone parents on the one-parent family payment in a later amendment. I still have concerns about the cut-off age of 14 when lone-parent families who have children are no longer recognised as lone parents within the system and no longer qualify for the transitional jobseeker's payment or the one-parent family payment. Those cohorts are especially vulnerable because the research tells us that, in fact, it gets more expensive when a parent has a teenager. Those parents have heightened expenses because the children will become more expensive at that point but they no longer qualify for the transitional jobseeker's payment or the one-parent family payment. That cohort is especially vulnerable when on the working family payment. It is a small cohort but it is significant. I very much appreciate the Minister will look at this in the report. I ask that she looks to ensure the small cohort of one-parent families who, as we know, are especially vulnerable to poverty but are not under the one-parent family scheme are configured in the examination of the working family payment.

I had proposed amendments to this section but they have been ruled out of order. I will speak to them with regard to the general point. I have a very significant concern about the manner in which they have been ruled out of order. That is not a concern for the Minister but I have raised it at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, CPP, and I will raise it again. We have been told that amendments which are explicitly around the question of rates of social welfare, which is the subject of the Bill, have been ruled out of order as not being relevant to the purpose of the Bill. The Social Welfare Bill is the annual review of our social welfare rates. Provisions that relate to those rates are relevant to the purpose of the Bill. If we start having narrow interpretations of amendments, it means that it is against the purpose of the Bill to discuss any aspect of social welfare other than the proposals made by the Government. That would be completely contrary to previous practice. We would move into an area in which there would never be any scrutiny of the social welfare code or any opportunity to amend the founding legislation. Such an interpretation would be a very dangerous trend. I will challenge this at the CPP. We might look at how we might revise the Standing Orders of the House to clarify this matter. I apologise to the Minister because I know this is not her decision. However, it is a really significant issue. We are in danger of not having proper scrutiny of our legislation if we start to have such prohibitive interpretations. Section 13 looks at new social insurance benefits. One of my amendments had asked for a report on the potential introduction of a bench-marking link to minimum essential standards of living. One of the best things the Department has ever done has been its work in supporting the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice. I understand the Society of St. Vincent de Paul has now taken up that work in respect of the assessment of the minimum essential standards of living. The minimum essential standards of living are expressed by an independent expert group of academics and others and, crucially, by families. It examines 2,000 items on which households rely. These are the needs - not the wants - of households in Ireland. It gathers very important information from that in respect of what is adequate for different kinds of households to live on. The Minister will be aware I tabled specific amendments about to the €12 increase in adult personal social welfare because it falls somewhat short of the recommended €20 increase. However, we could look to a stronger link between the minimum essential standards of living and our social protection payments. The other amendment I proposed to this section related to pensions and the need to examine a universal pension. I know many pension proposals have been discussed. I have a significant concern, which I expressed to the Minister of Finance earlier today, that the Commission on Pensions in its financial calculations did not look to the €2.9 billion spent every year on private pension tax relief when it assessed what the revenues for the Exchequer might be with regard to addressing our pensions system. It is very notable that the approximately €3 billion which is estimated as the cost of a universal pension almost matches perfectly with what gets spent on private pension tax relief. Research has shown 70% of the benefits of this relief go to top earners - those on higher incomes, who are predominantly men - whereas a universal pension would largely address the issue of women and the inequality in our pension system that women have experienced for a very long period of time.  I had looked for a comparative report on these different points. I have very serious concerns in respect of the potential increase in contributory requirements. I was working with older people's organisations and, indeed, subsequently with the Women's Council during the period when we saw the impact of the 2012 change from ten years to 20 years. While the theoretical rate of the pension remained the same, we saw considerable numbers of women fall to a reduced-rate pension. I know that was under the averaging scheme and this is the total contributory scheme. However, I have a very significant concern that if we go not just from a 20- to 30-year contributory requirement, which had been widely and anticipated, but to a 40-year contributory requirement, there is no doubt it will have significant impacts on equity and distribution and large numbers of people will be on a reduced rate pension. I am very concerned that we will see a widening of the pension gap and more women falling below the threshold if we move to a 40-year contributory pension. The core of amendment is that we need to have much stronger gender analysis of the difference between a 30-year contributory requirement and a 40-year contributory requirement and gender analysis of the auto-enrolment system. All of these need to be considered alongside a gender analysis of the private pension tax relief. Any new policy decision we make in respect of pensions must narrow the gender pension gap and increase equality rather than potentially take us further into the inequality that women in Ireland have suffered with respect to pensions for decades.

"Report on adequacy of State Pension
14. The Minister shall, within three months of the passing of this Act, lay a report before both Houses of the Oireachtas on the income adequacy, as determined by the Minimum Essential Standard of Living (MESL) methodology, of the Contributory and Non-Contributory State Pensions for an urban older person living alone.This returns us to the question of the minimum essential standard of living, MESL. The amendment asks for a report on income adequacy. This overlaps with what I was just discussing regarding contributory and non-contributory pensions for the cohort of urban older persons living alone. One of the reasons MESL is very interesting is that it looks at the differences between rural and urban contexts. It looks at the very many real situations in which people find themselves. It suggests there might be a few case study examinations of how adequate the contributory and non-contributory State pensions are in respect of older people living alone in an urban context. In a rural context there are specific extra costs and in urban contacts there are specific extra costs. The estimates are that the shortfall is approximately €17 per week according to MESL analysis. Perhaps it is something that could be looked at. Amendment No. 6 is related to amendment No. 5 in that it is the same issue with regard to the non-contributory pension in this case. An urban person living alone in respect of the non-contributory pension is forecast under MESL analysis to have an income shortage of €17 per week. I have picked two case studies as examples of how the MESL could be more usefully applied. Amendment No. 12 is very important. It is one of the issues regarding gender equality in our pension system that is fundamental. The amendment asks that there be a report on options for how applicants for the non-contributory State pension might be assessed on individual means rather than the means of their partners or other household members. This not only addresses the crucial issue of protecting older women in Ireland against poverty but also ensuring they have financial independence. Due to historical inequities, many women in Ireland will not qualify for a full contributory pension and many will qualify for a significantly reduced pension. The contributory pension reduced rate they might qualify for could be less than €100, if they qualify for any contributory pension at all. Many women will not qualify for the non-contributory pension. In the case of the non-contributory pension the fact their partners or husbands might have an income will stand against them. Many people have adult children living at home who are working. Their income will also be counted against them in the assessment of household means. Many older women in Ireland only feature either as a qualified adult dependent increase on their husband's non-contributory pension or do not have any money at all. When it comes to domestic violence, vulnerabilities or financial abuse, which we know is a huge issue, a lot of women in Ireland do not have access to independent income. This is why assessing these women for the non-contributory pension based entirely on their own means and making sure they would individually be able to qualify for the non-contributory pension in their own right and have income in their own right would go some way towards reflecting and addressing the issues of income inequality and the lack of financial independence for women. The individualisation of means assessment in this particular way was a specific recommendation of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality. There is a lot of repair work to be done on the pension system but this is a comparatively simple measure that would certainly start us in the right direction.

The Department partly funds the excellent, detailed work of the Vincentian MESL Research Centre and has used this research as a key input into consideration of budget options in recent years. I value the insights this research provides. The Vincentian MESL Research Centre at the Society of St. Vincent de Paul publishes an annual update which already examines the issues raised by the Senator, namely, income adequacy for various household types, including those receiving a contributory or non-contributory State pension, in urban and rural areas. It should be noted that, based on the most recent MESL annual update, older people living alone in an urban area have an income above the cost of MESL. The House will be aware that the Department uses this research, alongside other research from, for example, the CSO and the ESRI, to inform policymaking in a few areas. Indeed, on foot of this research, we have significantly increased the living alone allowance in recent years. In addition, the Government has responded to the report of the Commission on Pensions on a benchmarking and indexation approach to the rate of payment for State pensions. The introduction of the smoothed earnings approach, as recommended by the commission, as a key input to the budgetary process will begin next year. On this basis, I will not accept amendment No. 5. I also do not propose to accept amendment No. 6 as the rate change in the non-contributory State pension is a matter for consideration in the overall context of the budget. In budget 2023, the largest social welfare package in the history of the State, I announced that all primary social welfare rates would increase by €12, including the non-contributory State pension. Consequently, the maximum weekly rate from January 2023 will be €254. Many of those in receipt of the non-contributory State pension will have received the double weekly payments in October and December. In addition, many will have received the three fuel allowance lump sums this year and the living alone lump sum paid in November. With regard to amendment No. 12, the review will cover the treatment of income and disregards across schemes generally and will, therefore, include examination of thresholds and their impact for the non-contributory State pension. Victims of domestic violence automatically get rent supplement. I introduced this measure last year to ensure anybody in this awful position will get the support of rent supplement to enable him or her to acquire other accommodation.

It enables us not only to look at the general increase but to have targeted measures. That is what I was looking to illustrate. With regard to individualisation, even though I recognise what has been done on rent, if people have no income getting rent allowance in itself is an issue. Many people will stay in a home but it makes a huge difference for them to have financial independence.The individualisation aspect is important. I will not dwell on it further because I will come back to it in respect of carer's and disability allowances, which are other areas in which it is important that individuals are able to have access to incomes in their own right and in their own names. It is an issue to examine. I imagine we will be considering the matter in the course of the coming year because it is so central to the recommendations of the citizens' assembly. I will not press amendments Nos. 5 and 6, but I will press amendment No. 12 when the time comes.

The Minister shall, within six months of the passing of this Act, lay a report before both Houses of the Oireachtas on options for assessing applicants to Carer’s Allowance on individual means, rather than the means of their partner or other household members.”. This amendment addresses the same issue to which I previously referred, namely, the potential assessment of applicants for the carer's allowance on the basis of their individual means rather than the means of their partner or other household members. Research from the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice shows that even before the cost-of-living crisis, income supports for family carers were inadequate to support low-income households and those who are, for example, caring for a child with an intellectual disability. We know from the Indecon report that there are significant costs associated with care. An affected household might be incurring additional weekly costs of €244 compared with a similarly composed household without disability or care needs. We know that only one in five of Ireland's carers receives carer's allowance due to the strict eligibility criteria relating to the payment. The current income thresholds do not reflect the situation. The situation as it stands is also affected by the housing crisis in that many people may comprise a household. A person who is responsible for the care of a child or older person may live in a home with two or three other adults who are working. Their money is used to pay for normal things. Adult children may be working and living at home and so forth. That household still has care costs. Somebody in the household is not able to work because he or she is required to be available to deliver care but does not qualify for carer's allowance. There is an assumption included there. We disqualify people from carer's allowance on the basis of an assumption that everybody else in the household is pooling their resources to cover the costs of the individual who needs care and the person who is delivering care. We cannot make that assumption because in many cases, those people are saving for a mortgage to allow them to move out. They are not necessarily contributing to the costs of the household. Such a situation also creates extreme vulnerability in respect of pensions. Caregivers may be using ten or 15 years of their life delivering care while not qualifying for the carer's allowance. They are then dependent on what they may get from other household members. They are the people who have been shown to be delivering care and should, therefore, have access to a source of income and financial independence. All of that is crucial because the value and contribution to the State of care work happens irrespective of what is happening in the household around that carer. If those family carers were not there and delivering that care, there would be significant costs to the State because other options, such as residential care or substantial home care packages, would be required. On that point, I hope we move towards a statutory home care model instead of a residential care model. Carers are making an enormous contribution to the State. However, they are not getting recognition or support from the State because it is assumed that will be outsourced to their wider families. This also comes back to the independence issue. I am not sure if I have submitted an amendment in respect of the disability allowance but the same issue applies in that respect. It is almost the other side of the care piece. A household comprising five or six people might include one person who does not qualify for the carer's allowance and another who does not qualify for the disability allowance. Two individuals in such a household would not qualify for support because of the incomes of other persons in the household. In the case of the disability allowance, it was also pointed out to me - and this is a strong point - that the idea of means testing the whole household in the context of disability allowance is flawed. Sometimes people with disabilities do not have carers and are able to live alone. However, some of those people might wish to form a romantic relationship and have a partner who they might wish to move in with them. Such people might wish to have a relationship with someone or to have flatmates who live with them but are not their carers. They might wish to have a partner or even a friend live with them but cannot risk doing so because it might jeopardise their disability allowance. All of these amendments go to the core of ensuring that the circumstances, needs and contributions of every person in this State are individually recognised. The direction of travel should be towards the individualisation of core social protection payments for persons who are caring or seeking a non-contributory pension or who have a disability. I note this was one of the key levers identified by the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality.

I would like to make the general point that legislation is not the appropriate place for seeking reports. I accept, however, that this is an opportunity for the Senator to raise these matters and discuss them with me. I have made the point about including in primary legislation, particularly legislation as complex as the Social Welfare Acts, commitments to producing reports. I have already committed to initiating a wide-ranging review of means testing in the Department next year. I made that commitment on Second Stage. The review will cover the treatment of income disregards across schemes generally and will, therefore, include the examination of thresholds and their impacts for the carer's allowance. I increased the income thresholds for the carer's allowance last year to €750 per week for a couple. That was welcome because it was the first change in many years. We have a generous income disregard for carers because we also increased the amount of allowable savings to €50,000. The Senator will appreciate that resources are finite and we try to target them where they are needed most. When we assess means, we assess the means of the entire household because we feel that is the best way of targeting income supports where they are needed most. One is allowed to earn rental income of up to €14,000 per year without any effect to one's carer's allowance or any other means-tested allowance. That applies where a homeowner wishes to rent a room to somebody. It does not affect one's payments. That is useful to people who are able to rent a room in their houses.

I welcome the fact that there will be a review of means testing but I am concerned that the Minister has said it will only apply to the thresholds involved. I imagine the terms of reference for that review are currently being drafted. I specifically request that the review includes consideration of the issue I have raised. There are times when a household assessment is appropriate. When is it appropriate to apply a means test on a household basis and when might it be appropriate to consider a means test on an individualised basis? Including a consideration of that matter in the review of means testing that will take place next year would be a concrete step towards recognising the recommendation from the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality.

“Report on individual means assessment for Disability Allowance
16. The Minister shall, within six months of the passing of this Act, lay a report before both Houses of the Oireachtas on options for assessing applicants to Disability Allowance on individual means, rather than the means of their partner or other household members.”.I have spoken to this already. This is the same issue but it relates to the disability allowance in particular. As I said, there are specific issues here. We talked about situations for households and assumptions we make but in the case of disability allowance there are persons who are living alone who might wish to live with a friend, for example, but would not want to move into a situation where that friend is assumed to be financially supporting them. People want to have relationships that are just based on "I am a person and I live with you and I have a relationship with you". That could be romantic, a friendship or a family member. A person may wish to have a brother or sister come and live with them but may not necessarily want to become a dependant. Due to the way disability allowance is assessed, where a person with a disability is living with somebody else, it is assumed they will be a dependant or the person they live with is going to be financially responsible for them. There might be a person with a disability aged in their 30s who manages well when it comes to managing their disability. We know from the Indecon cost of disability report the additional costs are massive. There can be additional costs of up to €9,027 for items related to a disability somebody might need. Of course, the disability allowance is tied into a person's access to the medical card and all these other things. Thus, a person may have to choose between having enough financially to live - and again the disability allowance does not even meet these costs - but if they are forced to be in a situation where they jeopardise that simply by living with somebody, that really affects a person's financial independence and it can make it very lonely. That is something I have heard from people. If you are a person with a disability you want to be able to have relationships and you will not necessarily say I can only have a relationship with somebody where they cover these immense costs of my disability because the State no longer will. This is just another example of where that individualisation piece could make a huge difference and ensure the relationship of those persons with a disability with the State and with the State supports is an independent relationship and unfounded assumptions are not necessarily made about the household they may be part of.

“Report on child maintenance and social protection
16. The Minister shall, within six months of the passing of this Act, lay a report before both Houses of the Oireachtas on options for ensuring that lone parents’ social protection payments should not be reduced based on the potential receipt of maintenance from a third party e.g. a former spouse or partner, and for ensuring that lone parents should not be required to pursue maintenance from a former partner as a condition of receipt of social protection.”.This is another amendment addressing the issue of child maintenance. I will not go into it at length but there is much concern. Many people are disappointed as it looks like the Government does not intend to set up a child maintenance agency and it was something people were hopeful about. This is around a specific issue related to social protection. It is an amendment around ensuring lone parent or one-parent families' social protection payments would not be reduced based on the potential receipt of maintenance from a third party such as a former spouse or partner. It is also concerned with the matter of ensuring lone parents not be required to pursue maintenance from a former partner as a condition of the receipt of social protection. There is concern people are first of all being required to pursue maintenance when there are many reasons they are not in a position to do it. That is why there was such wide support for a maintenance agency that would take on that responsibility so it is not laid on the shoulders of persons who may have very good and legitimate reasons for not trying to pursue a former partner. The Minister will be aware that separate from the establishment of a child maintenance agency, there is a very constructive proposal from my colleague, Senator Ruane, that I hope will still be considered. It has been supported by the Women's Caucus, which includes women from right across the Houses, and would give Revenue a role in the gathering of maintenance payments. We are aware one-parent families are extraordinarily more vulnerable to homelessness and deprivation and are absolute outliers when it comes to issues of poverty. The core point is we should not have a situation where people in that circumstance are being forced to pursue and seek maintenance from a former spouse or partner. This is especially so in situations where that might make them or their children vulnerable or affect issues such as access and custody. I note also that even where maintenance is awarded we know it is very often not paid. We should not have a situation where a person's social welfare payment is being reduced - because in theory they are getting €100 per week from a partner - if they are not getting that €100 per week from them. We should not have a situation where that rationale is used. The Minister is aware of these issues and of the different solutions to the issue of accessing maintenance but I hope in the interim we can ensure we do not have negative impacts within the social protection system. We can perhaps begin with the matters I address in my amendment.

I do not propose to accept this amendment because I am already addressing the two issues she is requesting a report on. As the Senator is aware, the report of the child maintenance review group was published on 16 November. The Government established that group in 2020 to examine several issues regarding child maintenance in Ireland. The terms of reference were to consider and report on the current treatment within the Department of Social Protection of child maintenance payments, the current provisions relating to the liable relatives regarding child maintenance and the establishment of a State child maintenance agency. The Government has accepted the group's recommendations on the social welfare system. As a result, child maintenance payments will be disregarded in the means test for social welfare payments. This measure will mean that many parents currently on reduced rates of payment will see their payment increase. It will also mean some additional lone parents will qualify for a payment, which is important. It is estimated approximately 16,000 lone parents will benefit from this measure at a cost of approximately €10 million per annum. The efforts to seek maintenance requirement will also be removed from one-parent family payment and jobseeker's transitional payment.This change will remove an additional stress for lone parents of having to go back into the court system because that was not easy for many. In addition, the liable relative provision will be discontinued and this means my Department will no longer seek to recoup a portion of claimed costs from the non-resident parent. My Department is working towards early implementation of these recommendations. I have met with Senator Ruane on this because she has done a lot of work in this area. She has completed work on this matter that I hope to be able to use. We had a very good meeting.  Senator Higgins asked why we were not establishing an agency as sought by the lone parent groups. The Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, and myself looked at this in detail and we discussed the matter. There is an awful lot involved in setting up an agency. There is huge expense, it has to be staffed, and it is not something that can be done willy-nilly. There was not a strong consensus among the child maintenance group whether an agency should be established. Four members were in favour of an agency and three were against it. Before going to all the effort and expense for the taxpayer of setting up a new agency, we have to ask ourselves whether it would deliver better outcomes for families. I know there have been calls for a similar agency to that in place in the UK but according to a recent independent report from the national audit office in the UK, it was found that the number of families without a maintenance arrangement has increased and has almost doubled since the agency was established in the UK. The report also found that unpaid maintenance in the UK is building up at more than £1 million per week and if that trend continues, there will be in excess of £1 billion in unpaid arrears by 2030. On top of that, there are many complaints from single parents about how the service in the UK is working. Instead of an agency, the approach we are taking is to fundamentally reform the family court system and, as part of that, the Department of Justice will look at how we can strengthen enforcement orders on child maintenance. That is the trick here. If people are supposed to pay, they will have to pay and get on with it, instead of this carry-on where people pay a week, miss a few weeks, pay another week and then arrears have accumulated. I worked in the credit union for many years and saw it first-hand. I saw what mainly women had to endure in terms of financial insecurity. This is something I am interested in and, as I said, I had a good discussion with Senator Ruane. The question is how we can find a mechanism where if there is a court order or an agreement made under which people are supposed to pay so much per week, then that is it and they have to get on with it. We need to strengthen the rules around the attachment order and that is the secret to success here because it is the important thing. The bottom line is that a parent has a responsibility towards their child and we just want to make sure that where a maintenance order is in place, the money is received every week. That is the ultimate goal here.

We may need to return to the question of an agency again and if we do, we will be able to learn from and improve on any of the mistakes made in the UK. In the interim, I welcome the fact that the Minister has engaged with Senator Ruane. Getting Revenue involved is at least a starting point for ensuring this is happening and it would be a significant improvement to have it involved in the way suggested in Minister's legislation. I also welcome the commitments in respect of how the current social protection system operates and the requirements that are there; that would be constructive. The Minister mentioned the cost. As regards the €10 million, there is no better place that money could be spent to ensure our social protection system is addressing and delivering social protection to those who are most vulnerable than in the area of lone parent families because they are extraordinarily more vulnerable to homelessness, deprivation, and poverty. Again, it would be money very well spent in that regard. I look forward to further engagement with the Minister, as I am sure does Senator Ruane.

“Report on increase to personal social protection rates
16. The Minister shall, within three months of the passing of this Act, lay a report before both Houses of the Oireachtas on options to increase adult personal social protection rates by €20 instead of €12, in line with rates recommended by the Minimum Essential Standard of Living (MESL) methodology.”.It makes no sense that the previous amendment would be ruled out of order and this amendment would not. The previous amendment related to the benchmarking of social protection rates in respect of the MESL and this amendment gives the figures that attach to that. I cannot see why one amendment would be ruled out of order. It is an unfortunate ruling of the Chair in that regard. Amendment No. 15 looks on the options to increase adult person social protection rates by €20 per week instead of €12. It recognises the €12 increase, which is one of the largest adjustments we have had, given the cost-of-living increases and what we know from the detailed analysis on the MESL, those 2,000 items used by households in a year have gone up by even more. That is the reason I am hoping there would be an increase to €20 per week in line with those increases in costs.
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-13 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	180	I do not propose to accept the amendment. The €12 increase to the weekly rate of social welfare payments from January 2023 supports recipients across all weekly schemes, including pensioners and those of working age. It also includes a proportionate increase for adult dependants which means that the basic increase for a two-adult household will be between €20 and €22.80 per week. Exceptionally, this year, this significant rate increase has been accompanied by a wide range of additional lump sum payments paid in the current year to social welfare recipients and, taken together, for many household types the combination effectively matches, or exceeds, inflation. Apart from the rate increase, as the Senator will be aware, we paid out €1.2 billion in lump sums between October and Christmas. As is the case each year, all budget options will be considered by Government ahead of budget 2024, based on up-to-date data, estimates and economic forecasts. It would not be appropriate to pre-empt this work at this early stage. Three months is also a short timeframe for such a report. In the social protection budget package, a range of options will be considered to provide targeted support for those who need it most. In this respect, while I am not accepting the amendment, the Senator can be assured that the issue she is raising will be considered by Government, along with a range of other budget options when the time comes. The ESRI post-budget analysis shows that budget 2023, combined with one-off measures to reduce the cost of living, will be effective in protecting most households from rising prices this winter. The institute's analysis further shows that the approach taken by the Government of targeted welfare measures combined with universal energy credits will be more effective in protecting most lower-income households this winter than had welfare rate payments risen in line with inflation this year and next.

She spoke to that wider picture and I will speak to something I am looking to address in amendment No. 18, which I also understand has been ruled out of order but it relates to the same principle. The Minister mentioned target measures and I had sought a report on redistribution and as that amendment was ruled out of order, this request will not be eligible. There are some key principles. I welcome the fact that there are some universal measures here and also measures targeting those with greatest need. That has been important to the success of our social protection system. Again, while I have not always been happy with everything about it, in general it has had a role. Ireland has one of the highest levels of income inequality in the OECD; I think we are ranked 32nd of 35 countries regarding the gap between the high and low incomes.The figure that always gets attached to that whenever it is raised is before tax and transfers. We rely on the progressivity in our tax system and the redistributive role of the social protection system, and that protective role, to move from that huge income inequality towards something closer to ensuring a basic level of adequacy. That is something to be borne in mind with regard to those principles of progressivity, redistribution, equality and, crucially according to the MESL, adequacy. Those principles and their key role in our systems should be borne in mind. I have concerns about some of the proposals for changes in the social protection system but today is not the day to discuss them. Those who have higher incomes may get higher rates of social welfare payments. That is moving away from the idea of having some universality and then targeting those with greatest need. If we instead give greater benefit to those who already have greater benefit, I worry we might be shifting the purpose of our social protection system. Those who have the most need often have the least resources. I used the figure of the bottom 10% earlier when discussing this with the Minister for Finance. There are lots of people who have €200,000 or €700,000 because they have a house. There are people who have cushions of some kind but the wealth of the bottom 10%, besides their weekly income, is €600. There is a cohort of families in Ireland who have no safety net when things go wrong for them. I would be worried if we started to shift the focus of the social protection system away from that. It is kind of a philosophical point but it is one we are going to be coming back to during the year ahead. I wanted to build on the correct points the Minister made about universal and targeted measures. Let us keep that as the focus of our social protection system.

“Report on extending Jobseeker’s Transitional Payment
16. The Minister shall, within six months of the passing of this Act, lay a report before both Houses of the Oireachtas on options to extend access to the Jobseeker’s Transitional Payment until a youngest child reaches 18 years of age.”.This amendment seeks a report on the extension of the jobseeker's transitional payment until a youngest child reaches 18 years. We have just discussed one-parent families and the particular vulnerabilities they have. A hugely disproportionate number of the families who move into homelessness are one-parent families. Currently, parents get the one-parent family payment until a child is seven and when the child turns seven the parents move to the jobseeker's transitional payment from age seven to 14. The jobseeker's transitional payment requires engagement with the system. It gives the opportunity of looking to employment and education but it does not have a requirement for full-time availability because it recognises that people may be balancing care responsibilities. There is a period of engagement on a voluntary basis. It is an opportunity to build connections. The problem is that once the child hits 14, the parent of that child becomes invisible to the system in terms of their care. They are just treated as a jobseeker and are presumed to have full-time availability even though those years between 14 and 18 can sometimes be the most vulnerable. It can be the period of time in which young people require the most care. It may be that someone is available part of the time but needs to be there in the evenings for the child. This would make a small difference in terms of the payments because the jobseeker's transitional payment would continue but, crucially, it would allow one-parent families to remain visible in the system until the child turned 18. They could also have access to the additional measures the Minister mentioned, such as the working family payment. This is a good measure. It would just increase the age threshold, not for the one-parent family payment but for the jobseeker's transitional payment, from 14 to 18. It would allow for more effective and authentic engagement between the Intreo offices, social protection systems and so forth and the lone parents who are using them. It would mean parents could have that flexibility of working part-time without being in a position where they are jeopardising receipt of their payment. I hope the Minister can consider this. It is a practical measure that would simply increase the threshold to 18. It would go a ways towards addressing that extreme vulnerability of many one-parent families in this State.

The jobseeker’s transitional payment can be paid until a lone parent’s youngest child turns 14. The big thing about that payment is that people do not have to be looking for work. To extend eligibility for the payment until the youngest child turns 18 would be contrary to the Government’s policy goal of tackling long-term social welfare dependency and its associated poverty risks. We all know the route out of poverty is to get a job. Increasing the age of the children for which the jobseeker’s transitional payment can be paid would have the effect of delaying the interaction between affected customers and the Department’s Intreo services and, consequently, their access to training and employment support services. Improved access to these services will improve their skill sets and job readiness, thereby assisting with their transition into the workforce, and with their subsequent attainment of financial independence. It is worth noting too that there are other supports available for which lone parents might qualify when their youngest child is aged 14 or over. These include jobseeker’s allowance, the working family payment and the back to work family dividend. It is to their benefit that they are able to engage with the full support of the job activation measures, including if they want to retrain or upskill. We want to support them and help them with that journey so they can use their skills to get into full employment. As I said earlier, that in itself brings people out of poverty when they have a good job. I take the point the Senator is making but there are no plans to change that at the minute.
#AliceMaryHiggins	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-party	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-dob	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-13 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	185	There is already a requirement for engagement, and opportunities for engagement with Intreo and other schemes, under the jobseeker's transitional payment. It is not a matter of the requirement to engage or even working; it is about the full-time availability for work. That is the main component. It comes to the fact that within the jobseeker's payment, and in the system more generally, it tends to be very binary. People are considered either fully available or not available at all but there are people who have partial capacity or limited time. It would be constructive if the Minister reviewed this issue. We could strengthen the engagement under the jobseeker's transitional payment between the ages of 14 and 18 without bringing in that requirement for full-time availability because that is a gap. This also has a discriminatory element to it because in households with two parents, it is possible for one parent to be an adult dependant and not be required to be available full-time but that is not the case for lone-parent households. There is a different treatment of two-parent households with a child between the ages of 14 and 18 and one-parent households with the same. They are treated differently in terms of the respect and recognition given for their care roles. I am certainly not suggesting that we put additional constraints on the two-parent households; it is more that we should give similar support and recognition to one-parent ones.Work can be a route out of poverty but it is not always. We know that from the reliance on the working family payment, particularly for lone parents. People often find themselves in precarious forms of work feeling they have to go into that between the ages of 14 to 18 whereas if they were able to take up part-time work they may be able to access something more appropriate.

It is a tight labour market at the moment. If we can find that balance where we can allow people to get back into work and at the same time take account of their family caring duties, which are obviously greater for single parents, that is what we want to do.

There are those who are currently qualified adults or adult dependants who may be reluctant to go on jobseeker's allowance because of the full-time availability requirement. They might be open to part-time work. It is an issue to look at because partial availability is an issue for other cohorts, not only one-parent families. Perhaps we can return to this issue in the new year.

The report should address issues related to the lack of social protection available for public representatives once they leave office.”. Speaking about amendments being ruled out of order because there is a cost to the Exchequer, in printing these there is a cost to the Exchequer. I find it rather confusing that we put these things down as a reason to rule out of order but that is for the Committee on Parliamentary Privileges and Oversight to deal with. We have spoken about Class K and the damage it has done to former Members of this House. I understand why the amendments have been ruled out of order. However we have brought this up every year since 2015. In 2015 the then Minister for Social Protection changed one tiny part of the Bill which excluded county councillors from Class K and moved them into Class S. At that time we initiated a High Court action which was settled without going to court. There is a constitutional question here. It sounds ridiculous. Would anybody take out an insurance policy on their house knowing that if the house went on fire they are not going to get paid? Would anyone take out an insurance policy on their car knowing if the car was stolen they would be left without a car? Quite simply we would not do that. What I ask in this amendment is that the Minister will come back to the House in 12 months' time having taken time to look at the Class K issue and hopefully the next time we meet in this House she will have taken steps to address it.  I understand that the concept behind it, particularly the unearned income side, was aimed at stock holders who were earning massive profits from their investments. Surely the way to handle that issue is through the Revenue Commissioners and to tax them. If a tax is to be put on a public service, then put a tax on public service for being Members of the Oireachtas. That is fine, it should come through the Finance Bill and let us debate it in this House and see how far it would go. Class K is nothing other than a tax on public service. It is a cruel tax because it offers nothing. I think of my colleagues who have left this House. They are damaged forever on their PRSI record. Class K will impact the contributory pension for older Members who come into this House. We really have to come to grips with this issue. It is not easy because anybody looking in on this tonight would think: "they have gold-plated pensions, what the hell do they want?" We do not, anymore. Those days are long gone as the Minister well knows. I do not want to the put the Minister on the spot on this issue but I have decided to take the lead on it and I am willing to take whatever stick comes with it. However we have to deal with it.

However it is not appropriate for me to share that here today because clearly it relates to individuals and I do not intend to speak about individual cases. There was clearly an admission that something was wrong and people do not pay out good money for any reason.

The issue needs to be examined. We talk about motivating people to enter public life and to become councillors. Of all the jobs a person could take, running for election is one of the riskiest. Most jobs do not have a guaranteed point at which you may randomly be fired after three or four years. To have a situation where you know that subsequent to that period of time you are not going to have access to social protection schemes or to supports and your family will not have access to that because the period of time, especially for councillors, is going to be longer than the two years' previous contributions. People are effectively not just taking the risk in running for public office but they are taking a very serious risk in regard to their family’s security after the fact. We should not add jeopardy. It should not be a situation where only those who are very financially secure feel that they can run for public office. Not everyone will be affected by Class K. Those who will be affected by it will not be able to make the choice to run for public office. That is a cohort of the public who are not necessarily already represented as much as we would like in our political system.  This is going to affect diversity. We know this because the records show that women, because of various social factors, tend to be more risk-averse and less willing to take a risk in regard to their families’ income. It affects women going into this area as well. I ask the Minister to look at how this dovetails with pensions. I have many concerns around some of the proposals on pensions. If we move to a 30-year contributory requirement on pensions that will have an impact. Again I will indicate now that I will be absolutely opposed to any move to a 40-year contributory requirement. That would be disastrous. If we move to that we almost guarantee that anybody who spent four years or eight years of their life as a councillor is not going to qualify for a full pension and will therefore find themselves on a reduced-rate pension. That is the concern. The contributory pension may keep pace with inflation but the reduced-rate pension can be far less. We are condemning people not just in the immediate aftermath of a period of public service but in the long term in regard to their pension qualification. We have raised this issue for many years but it needs to be addressed. It affects everybody.The key point is that it has to begin at least by addressing it in terms of local councillors.

This funding is paid by individuals into the pot. It is not Exchequer funding. I dispute the ruling that is made here. Those amendments have been rightly tabled to be discussed on the floor of the House. Senators Craughwell and Boyhan had to find a way around amendment No. 19 so that the Minister would come back with a report. I would ask that the ruling be looked at. Amendment No. 21, in the name of Senator Craughwell, mainly affects Members of this House and the Dáil. It is only now that we are seeing the effects of decisions that were made as far back as the term in office of the former Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, who increased the age at which Members of the House would get a pension from 50 up to 65, 66 or 67, depending on when the State pension age would kick in. I have great sympathy for newly elected Members of both Houses. Indeed, I know the Minister has sympathy in this regard as well. A teacher who is elected to these Houses can go back teaching within a certain number of years. They can go back after five years or perhaps ten years in the case of an extension. After the last election, some of those who were giving out about self-employed people coming in here were able to go back teaching. When a Deputy or Senator who was self-employed before coming in here, or who had been working for a company and gave up his or her job to come in here, leaves or loses his or her seat, he or she receives no money, or nothing other than a couple of months' worth of payments. Of course, the shorter the period one spends here, the less one will get when one goes. One is not entitled to jobseekers' payments or any social welfare benefits. I have great sympathy with this amendment. We should pursue it if we want get people to come in here who are self-employed or are working for companies other than State companies. Members pay the class K contribution while they are in here. If they are only here for a short period of time - perhaps less than ten years - they face a very bleak outlook when they lose their seat. They have families, mortgages and all of the things that every other family has. The vast majority of the public thinks that when people leave this House, whether it is through retirement or through other ways, they are wealthy or whatever. I do not know any independently wealthy people who are coming in here. I certainly do not think there are any such people in this room or in either House at this point in time. I fully support this amendment. I know that the Minister has sympathy here as well. There is no doubt that the current arrangements will stop people coming in here. As somebody said, it is a huge risk to stand for public life. When a person is elected but then loses at the subsequent election, he or she has everything to lose. He or she might lose every single thing - his or her house and family and all sorts of things. I have great sympathy in relation to this. Perhaps the Minister for Finance should look at reducing the pension age from 65 back down to 50. There were very good reasons for it coming in at 50. It is only now that it is affecting people. It has not affected anyone before this. If one goes through the last batch of people who lost their seats in this House and the other House, one will see that very few of them have got employment and that they got nothing when they left. That leads me to my final point. Each one of us is seen – I forget the right term for it – as a person of interest. If you go for a bank loan, you are a person of interest. If you go for a job interview after you leave here, you are a person of interest. When does the status of “person of interest” go away? It puts many constraints on Members of these Houses. You have to divulge all sorts of things. People might not want to employ you because you are person of interest and because of all the stuff it attracts. I ask the Minister, as a member of the Government, to tell us when the "person of interest" status that we all have goes away after we leave these Houses.

If somebody comes in here on class S, the voluntary contribution is €500 per year. If they come in on class A, it is €5,000 per year. A person cannot opt to become a class S contributor when they come in here on a voluntary contribution. That is the first thing. Second, I am aware of a Deputy who lost his seat in this House who qualified for the old age pension just after he lost his seat. I am not sure what his career was beforehand. The impact on him of four years on class K is a loss of €20 a week, in perpetuity, in his contributory old age pension. Some €20 per week does not sound like a lot, but one would hope that after hitting 66, one might continue on for another 20 or 30 years before departing this world. It is the penal nature of it that we object to. I do not mind if we can work out a scheme whereby after a certain number of years, one loses a portion of one's entitlements and after a few more one loses something else. I do not know. The experts can sit and work that type of thing out.  My colleague, Senator Burke, spoke about people who lose their seats. I understand it is extremely difficult for one to find employment if one has been in this House. Being a person of political interest, or even being married to one or being the child of one, is a problem. I did not think it was that important until I stuck my card into an ATM and could not get any money out. When I rang the bank and asked what was happening, I was told that I had been sent some forms to fill in but I had not done so. Suddenly, I found my wife’s account was locked because she did not fill them in. In addition, my children are required to fill them in, as are the Minister’s children and those of everybody in this House. We need to start treating the people in this House as workers. Incremental credit, for example, has now been restored for every part of the public service but it has not been restored for Members of the Oireachtas. I understand that there are delicacies when one is dealing with these things. However, I am a worker first. I work for the State. I am very fortunate in the job I have, but I am a worker and I should be treated like any other worker in the State. I would appreciate if the Minister could give me some positive indication on this.

Everything they have said here is perfectly true. If someone who is a class A contributor comes into this House, they suddenly have nothing. The number of years they spend here will have an impact on their contributory pension, which they may have paid for before they came into the House from whatever form of employment they may have been in. I do not propose to accept this amendment for the simple reason that this legislation, as I said earlier, is not the appropriate vehicle for seeking reports. However, I am very happy to consider it. As I said last year, the best route here is to send a request to the joint Oireachtas committee. If we have all parties’ support on this, and if everybody agrees on it, that is the way we need to bring it forward. I will commit to providing the Senators with the information and supporting them with any data I can provide from the Department of Social Protection in terms of how this can be progressed further. The best thing to do as we are here this evening is to write to the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands to ask it to consider class K contributions by public office holders. The Senator could write to the Chair of that committee and ask for this issue to be put on the agenda for examination in a budgetary and economic context. The committee can bring me or my officials before it and we can give it the information it needs to deal with this matter once and for all. I am happy to support the Senator in any way I can to do that. The Senator is right. I know Members of the Oireachtas who were not re-elected and lost their jobs during the pandemic. They had no access to anything because the place was closed down. They could not take up their former employment because of the restrictions that were in place. They were in a difficult place. That is a real example of a situation that can arise for many others. I commit to the Senator that I will give him as much co-operation and information as I can. The best way forward is to bring the matter to the committee, ask it to consider it in detail and come forward with recommendations. When we have all looked at the issue and there is agreement across all parties, I will be happy to take those recommendations on board.

We have seen improvements in the conditions for people working in the Houses of the Oireachtas. They are workers and that point has been well made. One of the improvements is that secretarial assistants in the Seanad are finally getting recognised as administrative assistants, which is long overdue. The pension for those who had been secretarial assistants for up to 30 years was less than €10,000 per year. We need to recognise all the people who work in the Oireachtas as workers and treat them well. Senator Craughwell's point was consistent with that so I wanted to raise the matter.

I am delighted to have the opportunity to move forward with this legislation. This amendment seeks to replace the existing section 5 of the Bill. It responds to reasonable concerns that the Minister of State's office and Department raised about the previous version of this section, which looks to ensure we report on compliance regarding human rights. It referred to the European Convention on Human Rights and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014. There were concerns about the European Convention on Human Rights, the legislation attached to it, and the definitions of public authorities in that regard, as well as the fact that it is already legislated for. The essence of what I want to do with this section is to narrow it down by removing those references to the ECHR and focusing on what was the second part, but is now the only part of this section, which relates to compliance with the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014. The requirement to reflect human rights and equality in procurement is already there. This amendment ensures that when we have reports on procurement, they report on the manner in which there was compliance with this and how it was reflected. Anything that encourages public authorities to consider and reflect on human rights and equality issues when they are designing procurement is important. I will not go into the other sections of the Bill. We are not discussing them today and I know they will be discussed in the Dáil. I genuinely believe that we get far better economic advantage for the State by applying a price and quality approach rather than a lowest cost approach. Crucially, this is not just about the State and public authorities' expenditure. The impact of good or bad procurement practices is most felt by those who are using or relying on public services and the goods that the State purchases. If we get something that is shoddy or falls short, it is not just bad value but can have significant consequences. One example that I imagine is still on people's minds is CervicalCheck and the Scally report, which clearly identified the failure to apply quality criteria. That contract was awarded on a price-only approach without quality criteria, when the right to health is so fundamental and the right to health for women was so significantly impacted by some of the consequences of that process. This is an example whereby thinking about the rights and equality not just of those involved in the procurement process but also of the end users and receivers of the services and goods is appropriate for public authorities. I believe this section will help to remind them to do it and make sure they report on how they do it. Maybe they will learn from each other in those reports so that those public authorities that apply best practice on this can, through the fact they are reporting on it, give encouragement to other local authorities to apply that public duty to equality and human rights more robustly.

I have looked at my own legal advice and how to strengthen the Bill afterwards. I am confident about the provisions under sections 3 and 4. I believe they are well balanced and give a suitable level of discretion to public authorities with regard to how they apply the legislation. I was conscious that it was possible that section 6 could be read in a way which seemed overly prescriptive and seemed not to recognise the discretion of public authorities or to address the fact that in different public authorities and different procurement processes, some guidelines will be appropriate to some processes but not to others. There are different factors. The Minister of State made a good point. I am talking about guidelines, because we need to support public authorities in how they apply these factors and quality criteria. There are also existing guidelines under other Departments that have particular expertise and insights. The amendment would substantially changed this section, but in a way that would address many of the concerns that have been raised. I do not see it as weakening the section but more as making sure that it is clearly framed as guidance rather than as a requirement. We are giving the potential for an opt-out, but making it, in very strong terms, the preferred option that price quality criteria would be applied. As the Minister of State is aware, in the context of very large public projects, I am pressing that 50% at least would be quality criteria. I refer to the projects of major scale, such as, for example, those in the national development plan. There was a majority on price and only a minority on quality in respect of the children's hospital, and the consequences of that have been seen. If we are putting that requirement on public authorities, it is appropriate that we try to give support and guidance to them when they look to say which quality criteria they should apply. This amendment came from my engagement with the Office of Government Procurement in the previous Oireachtas. One of the things it identified is that it is at the design stage of a request for tender that we can get things right. Sometimes, we cannot just add a criterion in after the fact. It must reflect the purpose of the request for tender, so the request for tender itself must be designed in a way that delivers the most. Sometimes, that means having a request for tender that, for example, includes the phrase "to deliver a playground which promotes inclusion". It is a matter of putting those clauses in because that then gives us the ability to look to quality criteria relating to inclusion and disability, as well as the delivery of slides and swings. That is the reason having guidelines is important. I understand that they were seen to be too prescriptive. What I have done here is very much framed it as guidance by using the phrase "guidance concerning the use and incorporation of qualitative, environmental, social, human rights and equality considerations in the preparation of the procurement procedure". To make it clear that it is not exhaustive, the amendment also calls for "examples, for contracting authorities, of qualitative, environmental, social, human rights and equality considerations that may arise". It is one of the most useful things for contracting authorities if they can look to examples of how others managed to incorporate these factors and reflect them in the design of a request for tenders. The final paragraph is a reflection of a point the Minister of State made, namely: "examples of regulations, national strategic policies, legal obligations, EU directives and international commitments that might be considered or reflected in the preparation or design of procurement procedure or contracts." It now states that these are examples and they might be considered. I am delighted to hear that the National Concert Hall is going to be upgraded, but it might be relevant in that context to consider the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities or the legislation from these Houses in respect of Irish Sign Language and ensuring that they are factored into the design at all stages. These are small things, but it is important to have such examples there. Not everyone in every Department knows about everything, but they would have examples that they could consider as to how others have done it. Here it is very specific guidance of how it should it be done, but not a requirement, and then there are also examples of other laws they might want to draw on or other commitments that we might want to consider. The rest of the section is as it was, but it is now very much moved into a guidance mode rather than a prescription mode. One area where this is going to be very important, because it is a new and developing area, is in respect of green and environmental criteria. I am sure the Minister of State has seen the quite concerning report from earlier this year from the Environmental Protection Agency, which showed that in 2020, from a total reported spend of approximately €322 million on contracts over €25,000, only 17%, worth €53 million, included green criteria. Green criteria were not included in three quarters of procurement contracts in 2020. This is where the connection piece comes in. The Department of Education, for example, only used green criteria in three contracts over €25,000 in 2020. When we think of schools, we think of insulation and the interest among children and school communities in the environment, and we would imagine that procurement for education and schools would factor in green criteria, yet we saw that they did not. Much of that relates to the need to back up the general requirements with the discretionary opt-out and a strong mandate and imperative towards quality that is in the rest of the Bill, with a supportive element of guidance that encourages those whose number one focus might not be the environment. It is not what they are thinking about, but it gives them tools that they can use to factor these things in. The Minister of State raised concerns on that section. I am of the view that my amendment will at least partially, if not fully, address them.

The importance of guidance can be seen in the way that procurement does not work at the moment. I will give the Minister of State a concrete example. It involves a multinational company that operates in one of our hospitals in Galway and that supplies canteen staff. It pays those staff the minimum wage. It paid the minimum wage during the past couple of horrendous years of Covid. Any worker who tried to organise a trade union was not given work the following week. How can procurement be seen to be working correctly when that type of abuse is taking place? Unfortunately, it is all too commonplace. The best way to correct that is by looking at how we do procurement differently. It can be truly transformative. The guidance procedures spoken about by Senator Higgins in terms of the environment and social and human rights should be enough without being overly prescriptive to ensure a better outcome not just for our services and the patients who receive them in hospital but for the workers themselves. I put Sinn Féin's full support behind this Bill. I recognise and welcome the fact that the Government is allowing it to go through this evening.

I agree that the earlier the criteria are introduced, the more likely they are to happen and the more cost-effective they will be. That applies to ecodesign as well. We need to think about it right at the start. It is not the icing on the cake at the end; something that we add on that then does not fit because it has been designed for something else. That applies to a range of areas, in particular in sustainability. It is not an add-on, it must be part of the early design process and we must think of it. Ministerial guidelines are powerful for two reasons. It is not just that it is what the Minister wants coming down to the public sector, but also that it gives an official step-by-step guide and we know where to start and how to work. We are asking people to change the way they do things, so it is a good thing. I appreciate the constructive approach Senator Higgins has taken in working on this legislation and in dealing with my office. The Senator and I have spoken to each other, but our staff have also worked together. That has led to a good outcome. I will not oppose the amendment.
