            <p eId="para_3">Both questions are very similar. They ask the Minister to provide an update on the tracker mortgage scandal, in particular following his meeting with the banks and the subsequent update we got from Bank of Ireland that an additional 6,000 mortgage accounts had been identified as being affected. This is an opportunity for the Minister to give the House an update on the overall picture, whether he has heard anything since from the Central Bank or if it will still be mid-December when he gets a report from it, as he set out in October.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PaschalDonohoe" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_2">
            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Paschal Donohoe)<recordedTime time="2017-11-30T10:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_4">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5"> The Central Bank has advised me that in its most recent update of progress on the tracker mortgage examination, which was published last month, approximately 13,000 impacted accounts were identified as at the end of September through the industry-wide Central Bank examination. Prior to the examination, the Central Bank ensured a further 7,100 cases involving tracker mortgage issues were rectified and remedied.</p>
            <p eId="para_6"> Given the size and complexity of the task, the system-wide examination is taking time to complete. The Central Bank has advised that lenders are at varying stages of the process and that they are being challenged by the bank where the Central Bank is not satisfied with their reviews or redress and compensation proposals. All relevant lenders have now provided phase two reports to the Central Bank. However, the Central Bank's assurance work is ongoing and it is expected that additional accounts will be identified as this work progresses. As the Deputies will be aware, since last month's Central Bank update, Bank of Ireland has now agreed to include 6,000 additional accounts within the scope of the tracker compensation scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_7"> Some lenders have commenced payment of redress and compensation to impacted customers, and the Central Bank expects that all remaining lenders will have implemented their redress and compensation programmes by the end of the year, with the majority of impacted customers receiving their redress and compensation by then. The Central Bank's priority continues to be to ensure that lenders identify all customers affected by their unacceptable failings and that they pay appropriate redress and compensation. The Central Bank will continue to pursue lenders accordingly, in line with the framework of the examination. The timing has not changed. The Central Bank will provide me with a further update report in mid-December on progress in relation to the tracker examination.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelMcGrath" eId="spk_3">
            <from>Deputy Michael McGrath<recordedTime time="2017-11-30T10:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_8">This scandal is growing arms and legs. The 13,000 has now become 19,000 when one includes the extra 6,000 from Bank of Ireland. Prior to that examination another 7,100 cases were uncovered. Between those alone, the total is now of the order of 26,000 mortgage accounts affected. Some banks have provided ranges of potential affected customers. The Minister has acknowledged that the number will grow.</p>
            <p eId="para_9"> The issue I wish to home in on is that of compensation, because it seems to me that there is no consistency across the various institutions. For AIB, it ranges between 15% and 30%. For Bank of Ireland, it seems to be a flat 10% in compensation and redress. For Ulster Bank, it is 12% for non-arrears and 13.5% to 20% for those in arrears. Permanent TSB seems to be in the region of 10%. My view is that the question of compensation should be entirely removed from the banks, and if that cannot be done on a mandatory basis then it should be done on a voluntary basis. There is no consistency. In instances where the harm is broadly the same, the compensation should be broadly the same, but it is not. It can vary by two to three times. That is simply not good enough. That is an issue I would like the Minister to address.</p>

          <speech by="#PaschalDonohoe" eId="spk_4" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Deputy Paschal Donohoe<recordedTime time="2017-11-30T10:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_10">In recent weeks I met the Governor of the Central Bank again on this and other matters. I also met the Financial Services Ombudsman, whose organisation will play a very important role in the aftermath of more citizens receiving compensation and redress from the banks.</p>
            <p eId="para_11"> As to whether I expect the numbers to grow, the answer is "Yes, I do". That is why I was clear that a crucial piece of work which needs to be done before Christmas is to find out conclusively who has been affected.</p>
            <p eId="para_12">As concerned as I am about those who have been affected, I have always been very clear that I want to know whether there are other customers of these banks who may have been affected but who do not know, and also customers who believe they are affected but who are in dispute with the banks in this regard. I expect that matter to be resolved by the middle of December.</p>
            <p eId="para_13"> Compensation levels are a matter for the Central Bank and the Financial Services Ombudsman. They have been challenging the banks on what has been offered. At the end of what has been a protracted and unacceptable affair within Irish banking, on top of all the other issues we have had to deal with, people have to be treated very fairly and they have to understand why they are treated that way.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PearseDoherty" eId="spk_5">
            <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty<recordedTime time="2017-11-30T10:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_14">With regard to the update, I was hoping we might have some more concrete figures. As we know and as Deputy Michael McGrath has alluded to, since the announcement there have been 6,000 additional victims of the tracker mortgage scandal in Bank of Ireland. There is no certainty, however, and there are no targets for when all 6,000 individuals will be compensated and have redress. People are still not clear on the deadline. They are very unhappy with the deadline set for Ulster Bank, for example. It can be extended for the next seven months.</p>
            <p eId="para_15"> Also arising are the issues of adequate compensation and people being put back on the adequate rate. The Minister will be aware that the Dáil passed a motion stipulating that the banks publish a weekly update on their position, detailing all customers affected and the number who have had redress and who received compensation. The Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach was to be updated but that has not happened. Will the Minister ask the banks to adhere to the will of this Parliament, which is that the committee be given a weekly update, as we all agreed in a motion passed unanimously a number of weeks ago?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PaschalDonohoe" eId="spk_6" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Deputy Paschal Donohoe<recordedTime time="2017-11-30T10:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_16">On the Deputy's three questions, by the middle of December we will have to know the total number of people affected by this scandal. It continues to be vital to the Government to establish conclusively the number affected in this extraordinary episode which has caused such distress to so many and to ensure this is accepted by the banks in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_17"> On the question on Ulster Bank, I am not happy with the timing the bank has provided to me. I have engaged on this matter with the Central Bank, which is overseeing it. It has indicated that it believes the timescale given is the quickest in which Ulster Bank can do what is proposed, but it will continue to push Ulster Bank to try to have the work done sooner because its timing is different from the timings of the other banks in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_18"> With regard to the weekly update, I was not aware that the information was not being provided. I will follow up on the matter. My view, however, is that the best time to do this work would be after the Central Bank has published its report, which will be in December. At that point, we must know who has been affected and not affected. Until we know, providing weekly updates will not be helpful in getting the right agreement and solutions in place for all who have been affected. I will follow up on the matter, however.</p>

            <p eId="para_19">The amount of compensation an affected person gets is as if it were determined in a game of roulette. There is no consistency across the various institutions. I am asking the Minister whether he agrees the power to decide on the level of compensation should be removed entirely from the banks. Currently, there are appeals panels but they are under the umbrella of the institutions concerned. There is absolutely no consistency. I have given the Minister the figures. The rate ranges from a low of 10% or so up to a high of approximately 30%; it depends on which institution one is with. That is simply not on. Where the harm is the same, the compensation should be broadly the same.</p>
            <p eId="para_20"> On the allowance for professional advice, AIB is paying €615 while Bank of Ireland is paying €250. This is not on. Even now, people are not being treated in a consistent fashion by the banks. I ask the Minister to consider this. The Central Bank does not have statutory powers but I firmly believe that the issue of compensation will become the story eventually when the institution gets to the bottom of who has to be included and ensures they receive the correct rate and redress. The compensation issue is coming down the tracks very quickly. The current structure is just not good enough.</p>

            <p eId="para_21">The Deputy has made two points. First, for the purpose of achieving complete clarity, I must state the assessment panels or appeals panels in place are not under the umbrella of the banks in any way.

            <p eId="para_23">But the individuals will not be influenced by them. It is very important to be clear on that. If the Deputy has any concerns about this or views on how the arrangement could be strengthened, I will be very happy to hear them and determine how we can achieve what is proposed.</p>
            <p eId="para_24"> With regard to compensation levels, we have to reach an agreement with the banks, based on the powers available, on who will be affected first and how they will receive redress and compensation. There will be differing levels of compensation for people. The main factor that should influence this should be the individual's circumstances. I expect and want everybody to be treated fairly in this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_25"> I should have said in responding to an earlier question by the Deputy that, since this issue developed, I have met a number of people who have been directly affected. The Oireachtas committee had met people; I had not. I felt it was appropriate to do so. I met over recent days a representative group of affected people. I already knew about the level of stress caused for people. That has been confirmed to me again. A reason I met the ombudsman recently was to deal with what will happen in the aftermath of the publication of the report in December.</p>

            <p eId="para_26">The issue of compensation has been discussed widely at our committee meetings for many months now. We are in sync here in believing the arrangement is not working. We have heard testimonies showing it is not. I believe this will be dealt with only through the courts unless there is action to set up some type of uniform redress scheme. This is why we have taken forward the class-action legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_27"> On a separate matter, I have brought to the attention of the Central Bank that it was a policy of Bank of Ireland, where customers with tracker mortgages sought to restructure loans, to add 1% to the tracker mortgage rate as part of the restructuring. I teased this out with the Minister in parliamentary questions over the past week or so. The answer obtained, through the Central Bank, was that this is not allowed unless it is the only viable option for the customer. The matter would have to be dealt with individually, and each individual would have to deem it the appropriate action. My information, which I have on good authority, is that what I describe was policy and standard practice within the bank. It was absolutely wrong, therefore. The Central Bank was not aware of this. I am following this up with it. I ask the Minister, on behalf of those customers whose mortgages were restructured and who had an additional 1% added to their tracker mortgage rates as a result, to take up this issue now instead of having to deal with it six or nine months down the line when we eventually force action on this matter. Will the Minister bring it up directly with the Central Bank and Bank of Ireland, in which he has a significant shareholding on behalf of the State?</p>

            <p eId="para_28">Yes. As I indicated to the Deputy in response to the parliamentary question he put to me, we had to follow up on this matter with the Central Bank. The practice to which the Deputy is referring, on which he has had information made available to him, should not have occurred. It is another example of the appalling way in which this matter developed and has since been handled. If I can play a role in dealing with it, in the aftermath of the Central Bank finally determining who has been affected and who has not, I will do so but I must emphasise to the Deputy that the regulatory body dealing with all of this is the Central Bank and that I have to respect the work it is doing in this area and allow it to do it.</p>
            <p eId="para_29">During the engagement that I will have with the banks in the aftermath of the report being published in December, there will be an opportunity for me to bring this matter up. I will do that. However, the body with which I will first bring it up is the Central Bank and I will be supporting its efforts in this area.</p>

            <p eId="para_31">This question relates to Setanta Insurance and the fallout from the collapse of that company in April 2014. This matter has developed into a nightmare for many of the policyholders concerned. I have discussed it with the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, on a number of occasions. The current state of play is that many Setanta policyholders are being told, legally, that they are potentially on the line themselves. They are potentially exposed by way of judgments against them, including judgment mortgages against their homes, in respect of any shortfall that might be left at the end of the process. This is a disgraceful situation that really needs to be dealt with forthwith. I hope the Minister of State has an update on the matter.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelWDArcy" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Finance" eId="spk_14">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Deputy Michael D'Arcy)<recordedTime time="2017-11-30T10:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_32">Setanta Insurance was placed in liquidation by the Malta Financial Services Authority on 30 April 2014. As the company was incorporated in Malta, liquidation is being carried out under Maltese law.</p>
            <p eId="para_33"> As the Deputy is aware, the Supreme Court delivered its judgment on 25 May 2017 and overturned the previous decisions of the High Court and the Court of Appeal that the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland, MIBI, was liable in respect of third-party motor insurance claims made against the policyholders of Setanta Insurance. The consequence of this is that the insurance compensation fund, ICF, has been deemed responsible for the payment of such third-party claims. As a result, the industry has no liability for the residual claims outstanding following the liquidation.</p>
            <p eId="para_34"> Regarding the actuarial report on the liquidation of Setanta, the Deputy should note that it was the liquidator who commissioned actuarial consultants, Willis Towers Watson, to carry out an analysis of Setanta Insurance's claims reserves as at 30 June 2017. The liquidator sought this report for the purposes of internal management reporting and to assist in determining the potential shortfall in assets available to cover the remaining liabilities as part of the liquidation process. The contents of the report are commercially sensitive in nature and were provided to me solely for the purposes of assessing the likely shortfall in the amount due to Setanta third-party claimants. Consequently, I am not in a position to publish the report.</p>
            <p eId="para_35"> Finally, as indicated previously, there is a legal concern that any Government intervention to fully compensate third-party claimants and then step into the shoes of these claimants to recover directly any balance due from the Setanta liquidation could result in the Government having a lower status in the creditor hierarchy and, thus, significantly reduce the amount it could recoup from the liquidator. In this respect, my Department has just received legal advice from a Maltese law firm on this matter. Officials are considering this advice and may need to consult the Office of the Attorney General before the Government can decide what to do about this issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_36">I thank the Minister of State for his reply. We have a situation here where Irish motorists took out valid insurance policies from a firm that was regulated here, albeit only for conduct of business purposes. The firm went bust and, three and a half years later, many of these policyholders are faced with the very real threat that they will be held personally liable for any shortfall in the context of outstanding claims. That is just not good enough. It is a stain on the industry and the Government must deal with the matter. The figures involved are relatively modest. The overall claims reserve was €112.9 million. We know that the ICF will deal with 65% of that. The liquidator is now saying that there will be approximately 22% left, which leaves a shortfall in the region of €14 million to €15 million. Has the Minister of State sat down with the industry to discuss this issue and to explore potential solutions? When can the Minister of State commit to coming back to the House with regard to the legal advice the Government has received from the Maltese firm and having consulted the Attorney General? These people are in a very bad way. They are getting legal letters, three and a half years on, telling them that they could be personally liable. It is a disgrace and the Government must deal with it.</p>

            <p eId="para_37">The legal letter from the Maltese law firm only arrived in the past few weeks and I have not yet received advice from the Attorney General on it. I have asked the officials in the Department of Finance who are in charge of this section to progress the matter as quickly as possible in terms of getting a legal opinion from the Attorney General. At that stage, I intend to sit down with the insurance industry. I cannot do so until we analyse the aforementioned letter. We will then make a determination as to what is the next step for the Department and, potentially, for the industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_38"> The Deputy's figures are broadly correct. We think that the shortfall will be somewhere between €15 million and €20 million. We do not know for sure because it will depend on the conclusion of the actuarial process. I am not insensitive to those individuals who are caught on the wrong side of this. As I said to the Deputy previously, while I cannot commit to any particular course of action, I am keeping every course of action open and available. I would like to have this matter concluded. I agree with the Deputy that it is a stain on the industry in terms of how people have been affected. I would certainly like to have the matter off the agenda sooner rather than later.</p>

            <p eId="para_39">I ask the Minister of State to clarify when the next tranche of payments from the ICF can be made. I know, for example, that approximately one third of the outstanding claims have had the first payment made, which is up to 65% or €825,000 but my understanding is that such payments can only be made every six months. I ask the Minister to clarify when the next bundle of payments will be made. If they are ready, is it a legislative barrier that is preventing that from happening more quickly? If so, I am sure there would be agreement in this House to deal with that issue so that at least the payments can start to be made, even if only up to the 65% cap. That is one very practical, short-term step that the Minister of State could take to alleviate the burden somewhat. We must find a way of giving comfort to the policyholders who are faced with the frightening prospect, three and a half years on, of being personally liable. I think the Minister of State agrees that it is not good enough. We need to find a solution and time is important. This has been dragging on for a very long period. People need to be reassured that they are not going to be held liable and end up out of pocket themselves.</p>

I will check if there is a legislative gap and if that is the case, I will come back to the Deputy on that. If it is a legislative issue, it will probably be difficult enough to resolve because as the Deputy knows, the insurance Bill is awaiting pre-legislative scrutiny. If it is not a legislative gap but something that could be done, I will consider it. If the term is every six months, we may be able to reduce it to every three months. However, I cannot commit to that until I determine whether it can be done. If it can be done, I will certainly try to do it.</p>

I tabled several amendments to the Bill and debated them with the Minister on the floor of the House. My question simply asks what cost-benefit analysis, if any, was carried out by the Department of Finance before the introduction of changes to stamp duty relating to agricultural land. Stamp duty is a dangerous tax upon which to predicate any budget because it can change drastically from one year to the next, depending on outturns, sales and so forth. As the Minister knows, there is not a lot happening in rural Ireland. We need stimulation rather than measures that will curtail activity.</p>

            <p eId="para_46"> In my Budget Statement I announced an increase in the stamp duty rate for all non-residential property transactions, including agricultural land, from 2% to 6%. An economic rationale for this stamp duty increase was published on budget day. On the recommendation of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, I also announced an extension of consanguinity relief for a further three years and that the stamp duty rate applying under the scheme would be fixed at 1%. Consanguinity relief is availed of in transferring farms to younger family members. It encourages the early transfer of farms to younger generations and is mostly relevant where the transferee does not qualify for an alternative relief such as the young trained farmer stamp duty exemption.</p>
            <p eId="para_47"> Following my Budget Statement I received correspondence from farming interests on a number of issues, including stamp duty. Following further discussions with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine I decided that, in addition to extending the period of the relief and fixing the associated stamp duty rate at 1%, the age rule for consanguinity relief would be removed. This means that it will be possible for all gifts and sales of farmlands to closely related family members who do not qualify for the 100% exemption available under the young trained farmer scheme to benefit from consanguinity relief at a stamp duty rate of 1%.</p>
            <p eId="para_48"> The question of an age limit will be revisited when the measure comes up for review towards the end of 2020. The young trained farmer relief will not be affected by the stamp duty rate change, as it provides for a full stamp duty exemption where the qualifying criteria are met.</p>
            <p eId="para_49"> I have also responded to representations from the Deputy and other Deputies and reintroduced a scheme that allows a farmer to claim relief from stamp duty where he or she sells and purchases land for the purposes of consolidating an existing farm holding. I have introduced these various reliefs in the expectation that they will be of benefit to the agriculture sector and in recognition of the importance of agriculture and the wider rural economy generally.</p>

            <p eId="para_50">I appreciate the move the Minister made after the budget Statement, having been contacted by many Deputies and farming organisations. Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice and I tabled amendments on budget night, but they were voted down. The Minister has moved on the consanguinity relief clause and removed the age limit, but uncertainty was caused. He has not clarified the position where land deals are still being finalised. That remains a matter of concern. In the light of the announcement made yesterday by Commissioner Hogan, the Mercosur deal and so on, this is a volatile time for farming. This measure was unsettling and ill thought out. While there might be cranes and a boom in Dublin, there is no boom in agriculture, given the prices of all products - milk, grain, beef, poultry and pigs. In the context of Brexit, it was an ill-judged decision. As I said on the night of the budget, it is not a good idea to bank budget promises on stamp duty. We saw what happened when things went crazy during the boom before the tap was turned off following the bust. It is not reliable and, therefore, a concern.</p>

            <p eId="para_51">The revenue property-related transaction taxes are generating for the Exchequer will be approximately 3% of the total tax take for next year, which is well below where it was in the period leading up to the crash. Regarding developments in terms of non-housing building and construction, my Department forecasts that this sector accounts for 8% of national income which would rise to 10% in the absence of a measure such as this. The long-term average figure is 7%. I put this measure in place with the aim of shifting some of the human capital and economic activity involved in the delivery of commercial property to the delivery of homes. That is one of my main reasons for introducing the measure. As I have told the Deputy a number of times, the rate of 2% compares to a figure of 6% in recent years and 9% for many years before that. The rate was too low and needed to be increased.</p>

            <p eId="para_52">There has been a trebling of the rate from 2% to 6%. The Minister has stated only 3% of total revenue accrues from stamp duty, but it is false recovery. There is only a recovery in Dublin which I am glad that he has said is in the commercial building sector, not house building. The Government cannot build houses. It has completely lost its way in that regard. The Minister needs to climb a crane to look around to see what to do about the housing crisis. This measure was ill-judged and ill-timed. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine was unclear on what was happening on the night of the budget and the day after. As a result, he gave misleading information because he did not know. It has sent the wrong signal to farmers, particularly young farmers, who are trying to consolidate. Because of Brexit farmers must consolidate, having regard to how they are being treated by the banks, prices and the World Trade Organization talks. They cannot be static. I tabled an amendment on taxing vulture funds that were buying up land. The Minister did not accept it, but it would have generated significant revenue. He missed that opportunity and instead penalised ordinary farmers.</p>

            <p eId="para_62">Values are up by 75%. If we do not use opportunities such as this to reset tax rates after that level of growth, we will be back on the path to having a narrow tax base that will not help to sustain the public services. It is the right measure. I faced a challenge. If I had redefined the definition of non-residential commercial property in the Finance Bill to remove a particular category of property in order that it would not be subject to a higher rate, everyone covered by the definition would then have expected me to do the same for them, but I cannot do that. It is the definition that has been in the tax code for a long period. Changing it for one would create an expectation that I would change it for everyone.</p>

            <p eId="para_65">The Department of Finance engaged Dr. Don Thornhill in 2015 to conduct a review to consider and make recommendations on the operation of local property tax, LPT, in particular any impact on LPT liabilities owing to property price developments. Dr. Thornhill made a number of recommendations in his report. His central recommendation was for a revised system whereby a minimum level of LPT revenues in each local authority area would be determined by the Government, ideally having regard to the apportionment between local authority areas of the historical yield. This, in turn, would allow for the estimation of LPT rates for each local authority area and their application by taxpayers and Revenue. Local authorities could adjust the rate upwards by a factor of up to 15%.</p>
            <p eId="para_66"> The new system was recommended by Dr. Thornhill, with a possible interim deferral of the next valuation date until November 2018 or November 2019. The previous Minister for Finance subsequently proposed to the Government that the revaluation date for local property tax be postponed from 2016 to 2019. This postponement meant that home owners were not faced with significant increases in their local property tax in 2017 as a result of increased property values. The postponement also gives sufficient time for the other recommendations made in Dr. Thornhill's report to be considered fully by the Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_67"> The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2015 gave effect to the postponement of the revaluation date of residential property for LPT purposes and also to two of the recommendations in Dr. Thornhill's report, involving LPT relief for properties affected by pyrite and for those occupied by persons with disabilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_68"> I have consistently stated that my Department will consider issues relating to the implementation of other recommendations in the Thornhill report in line with the 2019 timeline. The Government will make its position clear so that households will know well in advance what are its plans for LPT. In that regard, it is very important that the principle that formed a central part of the terms of reference for the 2015 review of LPT, that is, achieving relative stability in LPT payments of liable persons over both the short and long term, will inform our consideration of the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_69"> My Department will consider work on this matter in the new year in conjunction with the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Revenue Commissioners.</p>

            <p eId="para_70">The Minister is indicating that the baselines will not be considered. The problem is that he is discussing historical information. The baselines were based on a needs and resources model that was developed in 2001 and that has been tweaked since then. Places exist now that did not exist then. How can the needs of such places have been taken into account? I appreciate the point on the amount that is retained and I have done quite an amount of work in seeking to understand the issue and the process behind the amount that goes into the equalisation fund. As regards the self-funding element, in 2016, for example, there was €108 million involved in self-funding, €85 million of which came from Dublin. That amount will increase because the Minister has not changed the baseline rates and is not counting new needs due to population changes. Why do we have a census of the population? Why do we advertise that a census is to be carried out because we want to decide where services are needed and yet the Minister does not factor that into the methodology of deciding where resources are allocated? There is no doubt that there are new needs in places with increased populations. There must be a way of building that into the system or there is a fundamental unfairness therein. If people feel a tax is unfair, they are more likely to destabilise it. There is an inherent unfairness in the LPT. Will the Minister address it?</p>

            <p eId="para_71">We will consider the baseline issue in the context of the review that will start in the new year but we have made no decisions in respect of how the tax will be structured beyond the dates I have indicated. We will put the group in place to make recommendations to me and I will decide on what to do well in advance of the decision point for 2019. My objective is to ensure stability in regard to the LPT such that people know what their future liabilities will be and that organisations such as local authorities that are dependent on the LPT and the payments that come from it via the equalisation fund will know where they stand. It is worth acknowledging that, to date, seven local authorities have voted to increase LPT and four have sought to reduce it. The current broad trend is that more local authorities are deciding to increase the tax than seeking to cut it. That reflects the fact that the demand for increased services to which the Deputy refers manifests itself at local authority level.</p>

            <p eId="para_72">The baseline in Wicklow, which has a population of 142,000, is €8.5 million. In Mayo, the population of which is 12,000 fewer, it is €19 million. In terms of overall spend, Mayo had approximately €130 million compared to €98 million or €99 million for Wicklow, yet the latter is a net contributor. If one pairs counties such as Wexford and Kerry or Tipperary and the part of Galway outside the city and if one looks at growing areas, one sees the same trend. The baseline ends up being a substitute for funding that would otherwise come from the Exchequer for services such as housing, transport and so on. Local authorities are unable to provide for increased needs because of that baseline. It is a fundamental flaw in the system. I will send a submission on the issue to the Minister and I hope it will be taken into account in the context of the review.</p>

            <p eId="para_73">It is not a fundamental flaw in the structure. The structure is as it is because it has a historical link. When the fund was being organised and the structure for the LPT was being put in place, the Department looked back at funding that was previously received by local authorities, through the local government fund, by means of a general purpose grant. I then considered the level of pension-related deductions retained by local authorities. The LPT allocation now takes the place of the two previous sources of funding. As I said, issues regarding baseline, current and future liability and so on will be considered in the work that will be done in the first half of next year. If the Deputy wishes to make a submission on the matter, I would be very happy to receive and consider it.</p>
            <p eId="para_74"> I anticipate, given the views of the Social Democrats on the need to prioritise service improvements over tax cuts, that the Deputy will support the continued role of the LPT as a way of collecting revenue to fund public services in the future. It seems the Deputy is open to it playing a larger role in the future and that is part of the debate we need to have in this regard.</p>

            <from>Deputy Paschal Donohoe<recordedTime time="2017-11-30T11:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_82">The SBCI's purpose is to facilitate access to more flexible, appropriately priced finance with better terms to SMEs as well as promoting the economic development of rural and regional SMEs. It does this by delivering effective financial support to Irish SMEs and addressing failures in the Irish credit market while also encouraging competition and innovation.</p>
            <p eId="para_83"> It began lending in March 2015. To the end of June 2017, €855 million of SBCI funding has been provided to 21,132 Irish SMEs, directly and indirectly supporting 106,728 jobs. This represents an increase of 57% in SBCI lending since the end of December 2016. The interest rate on SBCI loans is 1.15% lower than the average market interest rate on loans to SMEs and 85% of SBCI loans were to SMEs based outside of Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_84"> The SBCI has €1 billion of funding available from the German bank KfW, the European Investment Bank, EIB, the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, and the Council of Europe Development Bank, as well as a loan facility of €215 million available from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF. To date, €881 million of that funding has been committed to the SBCI's seven on-lenders, of which three are banks and four are non-bank finance providers. As the Deputy is aware, the SBCI does not directly lend to SMEs and other organisations but does so via intermediaries.</p>
            <p eId="para_85"> The lending is largely driven by market demands as well as needs that are not fully met by the private sector. My Department's biannual SME credit demand survey indicates that demand for credit from SMEs has been decreasing and that only 20% of SMEs have sought bank finance in the past six months.</p>

            <p eId="para_86">My concern is that this mechanism is not as widely available as it should be. My understanding is that much of it is available through the pillar banks and that, as in the case of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, to some extent, there does not seem to be any great desire to advertise the take-up to SMEs. The interest rate quoted by the Minister is relatively high by European standards. Presumably, it has been designed to help the banks to gather more profit on their business. In areas on the fringes of Dublin or in rural Ireland there are many opportunities and sites that would allow for affordable and social house building, provided small or medium-sized construction firms could access credit. I appreciate that many of them have an impaired credit rating as a consequence of the crash and may not be in a position to access finance. If the Minister wants to make an impact on the housing construction figures which, notwithstanding all of the efforts made and the money allocated in theory, are actually very slow-----</p>

            <p eId="para_90">In response to the Deputy's two points about the availability of credit for SMEs outside Dublin I reiterate the point I made, that 85% of the funding available to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland for lending is made available through its intermediaries to SMEs located outside the capital city. This points to the fact that it has been successful in supporting SMEs in rural Ireland and other cities. It has also participated in several initiatives to make known the funding it is able to provide through the banks, for example, using the SME online tool. If an SME answers eight questions about the size of its business, it will be made aware of the support open to it, including support and credit enabled by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.</p>

That is part of my concern because that means that it will be the guts of another full year before it is fully under way because it will have to establish itself and will probably then be working through the pillar banks. There are bureaucracy and organisation involved, followed by loan assessments and evaluations. The end result is the reason credit and funding are not flowing into small-scale house building, whether on the fringes of Dublin where there are more sites available or throughout the rest of the country.</p>

            <p eId="para_97">Home building finance Ireland will not be lending through the pillar banks or intermediaries. It will lend directly to companies that can provide a viable business plan, that are deserving of funding and that need funding. They will not do it through intermediaries for the reason identified by the Deputy. Those involved in running home building finance Ireland and those who will be making credit decisions are well capable of doing that work and I do not see the need for any existing bank to play an intermediary role. On the timing, I said I was aiming to bring the legislation before the House early next year and to have the organisation set up and running before next summer. While that may not be as fast as the Deputy wants, putting in place a new organisation such this over several months is, by any objective measure, a fast response to what I acknowledge is a problem we need to address.</p>

            <p eId="para_103">This issue relates to Ulster Bank's Global Restructuring Group, GRG, in Ireland. Between 2008 and 2013 over 2,100 SME customers were put into GRG, with loans of between €1 million and €25 million and a total portfolio value in the region of €14 billion, I think, but I will have to double check that figure. The issue is the role of the Central Bank in dealing with the complaints submitted to Ulster Bank about its GRG process in Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_104">I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 32 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_105"> I am informed by the Central Bank that, while it cannot generally comment on interactions with regulated firms, the Ulster Bank Ireland designated activity company is engaging with the bank in relation to this matter.  As the Deputy is aware, in November 2016, RBS announced a new complaints review process overseen by an independent third party and the automatic refund of fees to SME customers in the Global Restructuring Group, GRG, in the United Kingdom and Ireland between 2008 and 2013. In February this year Ulster Bank sent letters to SME customers who were in this group between 2008 and 2013. The letters informed them about the new GRG complaints review process and whether they were included in the automatic refund of fees. Ulster Bank has indicated that a large proportion of its customers have now been contacted. The Central Bank encourages all GRG customers who have concerns or issues to fully engage with the complaints process. More information is available at: <i>http://digital.ulsterbank.ie/business/grg-announcement.html</i>. </p>
            <p eId="para_106"> I am confident that legislative changes since the financial crisis have equipped the Central Bank with the necessary investigative, regulatory and enforcement powers to ensure regulated financial service providers adhere to the requirements of financial services legislation. In addition, the Central Bank is proactively regulating the financial system and has issued regulations aimed at protecting SMEs when dealing with regulated and unregulated firms. The revised SME regulations introduce specific requirements for regulated lenders, including contacting and warning SME borrowers and expanding the grounds for appeal. Under the regulations, regulated financial services firms must have a complaints handling procedure in place. Complaints against financial institutions should first be discussed with the institution concerned. The Central Bank will continue to monitor and engage in this matter.</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael McGrath<recordedTime time="2017-11-30T11:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_107">The central allegation is that the GRG was something of a graveyard for businesses and that Ulster Bank, much like Royal Bank of Scotland, RBS, in the United Kingdom, acted inappropriately and very aggressively in the appointment of receivers and liquidators, with the ultimate objective of gaining control of the assets of the underlying business.</p>
            <p eId="para_108">That is the central allegation. Last month the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, received an update from Ulster Bank. Ulster Bank in Ireland has received 48 complaints at this stage as part of the Global Restructuring Group complaints process and, as of last month, had paid out just €362,000. What is the Central Bank doing on this issue? The Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom undertook an investigation. The Central Bank knows that Ulster Bank engaged in wrongdoing in the treatment of customers in the GRG. As the regulator, what has it done to deal with the issue?</p>

            <from>Deputy Paschal Donohoe<recordedTime time="2017-11-30T11:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_109">I confirm that the Central Bank of Ireland is now engaged in this matter. It would not be appropriate for me to indicate what the status of this engagement is, nor can I do so, because the bank is leading that work as the independent Central Bank of Ireland. The Deputy will be aware of the legal protections in place for firms which have been affected by this issue. They include the Consumer Protection Act 2015 which was passed this year to deal precisely with protection gaps for firms the loans of which are sold by the original lender to an unregulated firm. As I indicated, the Central Bank is engaged in this matter and while I know that it is a serious issue, it would not be appropriate for me to answer on the bank's behalf about the work it is doing, nor can I do so.</p>

          <speech by="#PearseDoherty" eId="spk_67">
            <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty<recordedTime time="2017-11-30T11:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_110">I have been raising this issue at the joint committee on finance for a couple of years. I also brought it to the attention of the Taoiseach on the Order of Business last week. This is another scandal involving 2,141 Irish companies being placed with the Global Restructuring Group, which basically was death row. Ulster Bank informs us that fewer than 100 of these companies came out of the process alive, while other reports suggest only six survived.</p>
            <p eId="para_111"> The Minister referred to compensation and other matters. Ulster Bank has acknowledged wrongdoing in the application of complex fees. However, this is only one aspect of the issue. In Britain, where the Financial Conduct Authority is continuing its assessment, we know that the authority's interim report summary found, among other matters, that the GRG had placed "an undue focus on pricing increases and debt reduction without due consideration to the longer term viability of customers". It also found a "failure to handle the conflicts of interest inherent" in the structure and operation of West Register, GRG's property arm. Even the name, West Register, was duplicated by Ulster Bank and the experiences of Irish businesses have been the same as those investigated by the Financial Conduct Authority. Has the Minister discussed this issue with Ulster Bank? Is he willing to engage with the victims of GRG to hear at first hand their experiences at the hands of a bank that is regulated in the State?</p>

            <p eId="para_112">No, I have not discussed this matter with Ulster Bank. The reason is that this matter and the work being done on it are being handled by the Central Bank. I must recognise the authority and role of the Central Bank in the matter. Given its seriousness, I first want the Central Bank to conclude the work under way before I make any further comment.</p>

            <p eId="para_113">I thank the Minister for his reply. I respect the independence of the Central Bank and it is true that while matters are ongoing, it does not disclose actions relating to individual institutions. However, Deputies deserve some more information on what the word "engaged" means in this context. The Minister has indicated that the Central Bank is engaged in this issue. We know what the bank's role is, what its statutory powers are and what harm has been done in this case. Deputy Pearse Doherty outlined some of the allegations made. While a start has been made in refunding complex fees in Ireland, that is not the full story. Although the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom did not uphold some of the most serious allegations made against Royal Bank of Scotland, it certainly found much evidence of inappropriate behaviour. There is no reason to suggest the same practice was not evident in Ireland in the case of Irish borrowers of Ulster Bank. The central allegation is that GRG was essentially a graveyard for businesses which went into the group but did not come out again. We need transparency, answers and accountability in that regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_114">I am aware of the Deputies' views on this matter and the way in which the issue has unfolded and been dealt with in the United Kingdom. I am also aware of the consequences for many of the companies and firms that dealt with the group. There may be a point in the future at which I or the Central Bank can say more about the work the bank is doing, but I cannot do so while the work is ongoing. I am well aware of the seriousness with which the Deputies view the matter, but I expect that given that they are hoping to see progress made on the issue, they will also understand the only organisation that has and should have the power to do this work is the Central Bank. Before I comment further on the matter, I must allow it to do its work, at which point it will also comment.</p>

            <p eId="para_115">I too value and respect the independence of the Central Bank. However, it was also behind the curve on this issue, which is not new. I acknowledge that the Central Bank and Ulster Bank are engaging, whatever that word means in this context. It could mean, for example, that they are engaging on the fees structure, which is at the minor end of what has been alleged about GRG, or that they are asking whether GRG organised strategic defaults to put viable Irish businesses into liquidation, thereby collapsing them, imposing serious hardship on the directors and families concerned and putting many thousands of workers out of work. That is what lies at the heart of the allegations. When the finance committee started to deal with this issue, the Central Bank was not involved in any engagement or taking any action, but the committee pushed it in that direction. We will have a module on the activities of Irish banks on this issue at the start of 2018.</p>
            <p eId="para_116"> I reiterate the question I asked the Minister. I welcome his engagement last week with victims of the tracker mortgage scandal. Will he also engage or is he open to engaging with victims of GRG - the businesses that were put to the wall as a result of its activities - in order that he will be better informed on the full consequences of the group's actions?</p>

            <p eId="para_117">I met victims of the tracker mortgage issue after the Central Bank had done a substantial amount of work in dealing with the issue. As that work was unfolding, I met a number of people who were affected by the issue because I believed it was the appropriate thing to do. I am open to engaging with people on this matter in the near future. However, given the Deputy's recognition of the independence of the Central Bank, he must also understand that before I engage further in this matter, I must allow the Central Bank to conclude important work that is under way. I know that it is endeavouring to do so.</p>

            <p eId="para_121">I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 14 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_122"> The cost of insurance working group's report on the costs of motor insurance was published in January 2017. It makes 32 recommendations, with 71 associated actions to be carried out within agreed timeframes which are set out in the action plan. The most recent meeting of the working group took place on 25 October and the group has met 14 times thus far this year. In parallel with the ongoing implementation of the motor insurance report's recommendations, the working group has been undertaking an examination of the employers' liability and public liability insurance sectors. In addition, two subgroups examining the specific issues relevant to these sectors were established and have been meeting on a near weekly basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_123">In line with the commitment to publish quarterly update reports on the implementation of the recommendations made in the report on the cost of motor insurance, the working group has published three update reports to date, most recently on 23 October 2017. I am pleased to note that of the 32 actions due for completion before the end of the third quarter, 29 have been completed. Substantial work has taken place on the nine action points categorised as ongoing.</p>
            <p eId="para_124"> Of the three actions which have not been fully completed to date, two relate to the same recommendation which requires the approval of the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Garda Commissioner for potentially far-reaching co-operative mechanisms between Insurance Ireland and An Garda Síochána to be formalised. The other outstanding action is contingent on the establishment of the new office of the legal costs adjudicators, now scheduled for 2018.</p>
            <p eId="para_125"> While it is inevitable that some recommendations will take longer to implement than envisaged at the time the report was written, I am satisfied that, in overall terms, the recommendations made in the report are being implemented in a timely fashion. The fourth quarterly update should be published early in the new year and will focus on the 14 actions due for completion in the final quarter of 2017. All of the remaining actions are scheduled to be completed before the end of 2018.</p>
            <p eId="para_126"> In response to the question of whether reductions in motor insurance costs have been achieved, the most recent CSO-CPI data for October indicated that average private motor insurance premiums had decreased by 15.2% since peaking in July 2016.</p>

            <p eId="para_127">I thank the Minister of State for the answer and understand he had to summarise everything within the time available. The first issue concerns the effectiveness of the report and its implementation. It is worth reflecting on the fact that in the three years before the actions were taken, there were significant annual increases in the cost of motor insurance premiums. I understand that in 2015 alone the rate of increase was over 30% and that there were double digit increases in other years. I reiterate that having no increase will not be a result, rather we need to see significant decreases in insurance policy costs. The Minister of State might comment on the establishment of a fully functioning, integrated insurance fraud database and a database of uninsured drivers. It was indicated that both would have an impact on premiums. What progress has been made in establishing the databases?</p>

            <p eId="para_128">Of all the insurance issues I have taken up since I was appointed Minister of State, this involves the most effective group of people I know. The group is cross-sectoral and comprises officials from the Departments of Justice and Equality; Transport, Tourism and Sport, and Finance, as well as the Central Bank. Everyone is working to try to implement the recommendations made in the report as quickly as possible. There is, however, no silver bullet and the effect will be cumulative. We have to examine a number of facts. Prior to 2011, there was, in effect, a price war in the insurance market. Price wars never end well. Companies were providing insurance policies at too low a rate. The increase in cost since has been about 60%. There has been a 15% increase since the peak. However, things are moving in the right direction. We have dealt with all of the recommendations made, the implementation of some of which will take time. It will require co-operation with other Departments and agencies over which we do not have control, but we are pushing and pulling in every which way we can to try to implement as many of the recommendations made as possible in order that we can bring down the cost of insurance. I know of the impact hikes in the cost of insurance premiums are having on individuals and businesses.</p>

            <p eId="para_129">I welcomed the publication of the report in 2016. It contained a number of ambitious recommendations and targets, as well as an action plan. My question relates to the 11.6% increase in 2014, the 30.8% increase in 2015 and an increase of up to 28% in 2016. We know that we have reached the peak, but many people, including taxi drivers, have seen their premiums rocket. I recognise, however, that work is being done. I refer to the targets set in the third update on progress. The approval of the Garda Commissioner is required for a mechanism to provide for further co-operation between the insurance sector and An Garda Síochána in insurance fraud investigations. Does the Minister of State have a specific update on that matter and why the target has been missed? I refer to the giving of approval by the Minister for Justice and Equality for a mechanism to provide for further co-operation between the insurance sector and An Garda Síochána in insurance fraud investigations. Why have the targets not been achieved?</p>

            <p eId="para_130">I will touch on the issue of fraud as quickly as I can. Fraud has a major impact on the cost of insurance. There are two types. The one which receives more coverage is where somebody sets up an accident. Another type which occurs much more frequently than the first involves exaggerated claims. There is a perception that it is not quite fraud because the Irish mindset is that if there is an accident, one will get the maximum one can out of it, rather than what the level of a compensation claim should be. Serious constitutional issues need to be concluded in respect of An Garda Síochána in the transfer of information. There are data protection and other concerns which perhaps were not thought out effectively. We are working on that aspect and doing the very best we can, but we may or may not be able to achieve implementation of that recommendation. It will depend on the advice from the Attorney General and the views and opinions of other Departments.</p>

            <p eId="para_131">While we give the global figures, it is worth pointing to some individual cases which are often not reflected in the figures. Some two or three issues come up in my office time and again. One concerns people who have been accident and claim free for several years and are now a bit older. They are finding it more difficult to obtain quotes which are getting are higher.</p>
            <p eId="para_132"> The second issue concerns people who are driving cars which are approaching the age of ten years or thereabouts. They are also experiencing difficulties, despite the fact that their cars have passed the NCT and so forth. In the modern era such cars would not be seen as unreliable or unsafe. However, motor insurance companies are taking a different view.</p>
            <p eId="para_133"> The third issue is more disturbing. In my constituency I have dealt with a number of cases in which people have moved to new houses a couple of miles away. In one case a woman who was renting in one part of the constituency and then bought a house somewhere else had to pay €300 for the privilege of having a different address.</p>

            <p eId="para_136">I thought I had heard of everything, but this is the first time I have heard of that happening. I will ask the officials whether they have been made aware of it. One criticism I have of the insurance sector concerns the arbitrary nature of the figures quoted to customers. On multiple occasions an arbitrary figure seems to have been plucked out of the sky. One man told me that his insurance premium had increased from €500 to €900. His broker told him that he could not get it any cheaper with the company. He then went to a different broker who contacted the same company and was quoted the original price. I cannot explain it. When I put the case to the insurance companies and asked them to explain it, they were unable to do so. There is an inconsistency which is creating a difficulty and adding to insurance costs. The global figures are decreasing. I always advise people to challenge brokers or insurance companies when premium costs jump to try to get the best possible price.</p>

            <p eId="para_137">I echo the concerns expressed by Deputy John Curran. Taxi drivers are being driven out of self-employment. Young drivers cannot obtain insurance policies or have to be included in secondary or other policies. As a result they have to sell additional cars. There is a contradictory policy within the State whereby we are trying to incentivise people to improve their cars via the obtaining of NCT certificates, but insurers will not provide insurance policies. It is also an issue of competition. Have licence applications been rejected? Many insurance companies misrepresent themselves by offering numerous marketing gimmicks and schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_138">We are all familiar with the different branding that exists under the one arm, and especially under the one underwriter.

            <p eId="para_139">No cases have been brought to my attention relating to taxi drivers whose insurance has increased by such an amount that they have gone out of business. If the Deputy is aware of individual cases, I ask that he tell me and I will take up the matter. If someone has not had an accident, or there is no obvious reason that his or her premium should increase, I ask that the Deputy make me aware of it and I will take it up on his or her behalf.</p>
            <p eId="para_140"> I am aware of an important facility for young drivers which is not commonly known. One company, AIG, gives young drivers the opportunity to place a black box-type device into their cars. It provides information about where the car is, how fast it is driving and how it is being driven. AIG's premiums are around half that of the average of other companies, but drivers must know that if they drive irresponsibly, their premiums will be withdrawn. AIG has removed insurance in some 18 or 20 cases. The opportunity is there, however, and it is half the cost of other companies for young drivers. It is a good idea for young drivers, if people are prepared to take it up. I am raising it here, although perhaps I should not,-----</p>

Will the Minister tell us what lobbying, discussions and communications took place for the Government to make the decision in 2014 which facilitated Apple and others?</p>

            <from>Deputy Paschal Donohoe<recordedTime time="2017-11-30T11:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_146">I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 12 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_147"> Capital allowances for intangible assets were introduced in Finance Act 2009 to support the development of the knowledge economy and the provision of high quality employment. When the capital allowances were introduced, to ensure that a measure of tax remained in charge annually, a restriction was provided to cap the amount of income that the allowances could be used against in any year at 80%. The restriction did not deny the use of the capital allowances. It merely lengthened the period over which they could be utilised.</p>
            <p eId="para_148"> Ireland is not unique in providing capital allowances for intangible assets and the tax treatment of intangible assets is similar to the approach taken in other countries, such as the UK and the US. In the Finance Act 2014, the cap of 80% was increased to 100%, effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2015. The rationale for increasing the cap was to bring the tax treatment of intangible assets into line with the tax treatment of similar assets in other jurisdictions. The change also ensured that the treatment of intangible assets was in line with the treatment of other capital assets in our tax code. Noting a significant increase in the use of the capital allowances in 2015, the Coffey review recommended that to ensure some smoothing of corporation tax revenue over time, the 80% cap be restored. The cap does not affect the overall capital allowances available but merely lengthens the timeframe over which they can be used.</p>
            <p eId="para_149"> Regarding meetings, my officials and I meet a range of organisations and individuals regularly and I note that this subject was discussed at length on Committee and Report Stages of the Finance Bill. As I noted on those occasions, as part of regular pre-budget meetings, I met with the American Chamber of Commerce but the subject of capital allowances for intangible assets was not discussed. I did, however, have many meetings with my officials on this and other policy choices. On the basis of these discussions, I implemented the recommendation of the Coffey review and re-introduced the 80% cap to capital expenditure incurred from budget night. </p>
            <p eId="para_150"> Regarding meetings held at the time of the 2014 change, I gave an undertaking on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill to ask my Department to review its records from that time to establish the position with regard to that period. This review is ongoing.</p>

            <p eId="para_151">The change made by the former Minister, Deputy Noonan, in 2014 is a scandal. Séamus Coffey said that had we not made that change, we would have collected €722 million in additional tax in 2015, and presumably there would have been a similar figure in subsequent years. Mr. Coffey said that if one ensured that all claims for this allowance was under the 80% regime, we would have an extra €1 billion next year. In 2015, a window was opened, through which Apple jumped, using Jersey and Ireland. This was conveniently opened that year by the former Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan. We need to know what lobbying took place, what discussions were undertaken and what the rationale was for increasing that allowance in 2015. It cannot be a coincidence that after the double Irish was closed, Apple and others restructured their tax avoidance arrangements using Irish companies and Jersey to escape billions of euro in tax.</p>

            <p eId="para_152">I have not commented on any engagement or action that may have been taken by an individual company in the Paradise Papers, and it is not appropriate for me to do so. However, something that emerges from the papers is that they show how quickly large international companies can respond to changes in tax codes in any jurisdiction and if further efforts are to be made to increase the efficiency and the legitimacy of global tax collection, it must be done on a co-ordinated basis. All countries and all jurisdictions must move in the same direction.</p>
            <p eId="para_153"> On lobbying, I have already given a commitment to make those records available. I have outlined the rationale. We changed the tax treatment of intellectual property assets in line with what was happening in other jurisdictions with which we could compare ourselves. I entirely reject the Deputy's description of this as a scandal. That change was made for the reasons I outlined but as we were making those changes, the OECD process on how we deal with these matters was under way elsewhere and that was a factor in what took place.</p>

            <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2017-11-30T11:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_154">During the committee hearings that year, it was said that the much trumpeted double Irish would, in fact, be replaced by another scheme through which the same companies would be able to avoid pretty much the same amount of taxes, but in a slightly different way, by speaking about patents and intellectual property rights. That is exactly what happened. The Government was warned about it. The Minister acts as though he is some sort of innocent and Apple got the better of him, but the change that the then Minister, Deputy Noonan, made in that budget resulted in them avoiding billions of tax, just as I said it would at the committee meeting. The mechanism through which they did this has now been revealed in the Paradise Papers. The former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, met the CEO of Apple earlier that year, as did the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, and in the 2015 budget which was presented in October 2014, the change was included which opened the window for this tax avoidance scheme. Is the Minister seriously suggesting that he did not know this would be the result, and that conveniently Apple would be allowed to onshore billions of euro of assets and, as Séamus Coffey pointed out, not pay any extra tax at all even though the profits in that year jumped by approximately €50 billion?</p>

            <p eId="para_155">I have outlined to the Deputy the reason those changes were made. I have given him a commitment that any records for the period in question that are available will be shared. A recognition of the change to the tax code that was made in last month's budget is entirely missing from the points made by Deputy Boyd Barrett. In light of the understanding we now have of how big and valuable these assets are, I believe it is appropriate to go back to the regime that was in place previously. I reiterate that a key insight which has emerged from these papers is the need for all countries and jurisdictions to move on the same journey at the same time as we seek to improve global tax collection.</p>

          <p eId="para_160">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_161">That Dáil Éireann approves the nomination by the Taoiseach of Deputy Josepha Madigan for appointment by the President to be a member of the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_162">Pursuant to section 4(1) of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 1946, I have assigned the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation to Deputy Heather Humphreys of Cavan-Monaghan. I have now moved that the nomination of Deputy Josepha Madigan of Dublin Rathdown be approved. Following her appointment, I propose to assign to her the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.</p>
          <p eId="para_163"> In appointing the Minister, Deputy Coveney, as Tánaiste, I am very conscious that in his important role as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, he has responsibility for Brexit. I believe his appointment as Tánaiste, Deputy Prime Minister, will enhance his position in representing the Government overseas and in the negotiations that are currently under way. It will make it easier for him to co-ordinate the work of other Departments with respect to Brexit.</p>
          <p eId="para_164"> The assignation of the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation to the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, means that for the first time in seven years the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation will be from outside the Dublin region. That the Minister is from the Border region is particularly relevant in the context of Brexit and the Government’s commitment to bring more good jobs to all regions of Ireland, especially rural Ireland. The ministerial experience of the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and her background in business and finance makes her very suited to this role.</p>
          <p eId="para_165"> Deputy Madigan will build on the work of the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, in the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. She will drive forward the Government’s agenda for arts, culture and heritage, including the Creative Ireland programme, which is an ambitious ten-year capital plan for the arts, and the multi-annual increases in funding for culture and heritage. I have also decided to establish a new Cabinet committee - Cabinet Committee G - to deal with justice and equality. As a solicitor and mediator, in her new ministerial role Deputy Madigan will be a member of that committee and will take a special interest in driving forward the five-point agenda for gender equality, which I set out at FemFest at the weekend. I commend these appointments to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_168">I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, on her move to the important portfolio of Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation. I also congratulate Deputy Madigan on her elevation to the important post of Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.</p>
          <p eId="para_169"> These appointments have been made necessary by a resignation from which no one takes any joy, but which was absolutely required. That the Taoiseach and some Ministers are spending so much time trying to claim that nothing was wrong, and that vindication is on the way, is a sign of an unwelcome approach to recent events. As Fine Gael Deputies are willing to admit away from the microphones, the resignation of the former Tánaiste was more than justified by the failure to acknowledge repeated briefings, the provision of misleading information and the detached attitude to vindicating the rights of a grievously-wronged citizen at a critical moment. This stands independent of the other matters to be examined in the tribunal. It is important that people on all sides are capable of learning lessons from this crisis. It is important for everyone in the House to note that the co-ordinated attempt to say that everything is the fault of civil servants reflects poorly on the Taoiseach and the Government. It is something we need to keep a perspective on.</p>
          <p eId="para_170"> The enterprise portfolio is one of the most important in the Government. In my view, in recent years it has suffered from the obsession with minor steps and branding. Bigger strategic challenges have been neglected. The recent admission that the Government is abandoning core research and innovation targets marks the first time in 20 years that this area, which is so fundamental to our future, has been allowed to drift. Ongoing activities are being rebranded and launches are getting bigger, but the basic progress has stopped. I ask the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, to pay attention to this dimension of her new portfolio.</p>
          <p eId="para_171"> I wish Deputy Madigan the very best in the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. It is a very important portfolio. Her first task should be to ensure the provision of ring-fenced funding to, and the preservation of, the RTÉ orchestras, which are so vital to our national cultural life. There should be no threat hanging over them.</p>

          <p eId="para_172">On a personal level, I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and the incoming Minister, Deputy Madigan, on their new portfolios and I say comhghairdeas to Deputy Coveney on his elevation to the position of Tánaiste. The Taoiseach now has a very strong Cork flavour to his Government. In addition to the Tánaiste, we have the Minister, Deputy Creed; the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, whom I do not see in the Chamber; and of course Deputy Micheál Martin. No doubt the Tánaiste will find that he has many allies and alliances to work on. I wish him well.</p>
          <p eId="para_173"> I remind the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, that issues of enterprise and decent work are at the core of any progressive Government. Brexit throws up many challenges.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">I wish the Deputy well in her work. I have no doubt that Deputy Madigan will advance the cause of diversity in society in her new brief of culture, heritage and Gaeltacht and will recognise many cultures, not least that of our Traveller citizens. I look forward to her proposals as a member of Government in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_175"> Having wished the Deputies well personally, I hope they will not take it personally that Sinn Féin will not be supporting them in their elevation to these roles. As they know, we are actually members of the Opposition. This is where the Opposition in the Dáil sits. As such, our role is to hold my friends to account - to support them when they are doing the right things but to oppose them vigorously when they make the wrong decisions and bring us in the wrong direction as, sadly, they do so often. We need a change of Government. Whatever about the anxiety in the course of recent days about a Christmas election, Santa Claus is back on track and Christmas has not been cancelled. Let us be very clear that a change of Government and a change of policy is required, not just a change of faces.</p>

          <p eId="para_176">On behalf of the Labour Party, I sincerely congratulate on a personal basis the three Deputies mentioned by the Taoiseach in his announcement - the three Ministers. I know how important it is for the friends of families of individuals. We get many down days and we occasionally get up days. It is an important occasion for them. I had reason to expect this announcement in respect of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, the new Tánaiste, when we met for the Brexit forum at 8 a.m. this morning. I wished him well on the day. I felt a certain joyousness of expectation in our discussion. That discussion underscored the serious job of work which needs to be done. The Minister's work in that regard is enhanced by having the status of Deputy Prime Minister or Tánaiste attached. The fact that the new Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation is from a Border county is also an important signal.</p>
          <p eId="para_177"> I wish Deputy Josepha Madigan sincerest congratulations. To be elevated to Cabinet directly is a great personal triumph. I wish her well in that regard. We will continue to question all challenging issues. There is no doubt about that. We will continue to hold this Government to account. My final point is that Ministers are given seals of office and are politically accountable. It is not a matter of individual civil servants. Ministers are corporate soles and they are individually accountable for the operation of their Ministries. From a Labour Party perspective, we will certainly continue to hold them to account.</p>

There has been much discussion about people being thrown or not being thrown under buses over the last while. Our concerns are not about the Deputies as politicians or as individuals, whom we may wish well, but about the issues they are addressing. That is what we are concerned about. Coming into Christmas, most people want to see this Government deal with the housing and homelessness crisis, the health crisis and the inequalities and injustices in our society. We will hold the Ministers to account on those issues. I particularly hope that we can begin to excel in the arts area. I wish the Deputies the best of luck.</p>

          <p eId="para_179">This reshuffle has been landed on the Taoiseach because of a major political crisis.

The Taoiseach and his willingness to defend the indefensible have also been exposed.</p>
          <p eId="para_180"> On the appointments, it is quite incredible to appoint somebody as Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht who has a track record of anti-Traveller bigotry and of using anti-Traveller bigotry in her election material. It does not say a lot about the Taoiseach and his willingness to incorporate minorities and others. There is tut-tutting from Deputies on the Opposition benches. We have seen that Fianna Fáil were willing to support this Government when homelessness and housing issues were at record levels. That was no problem, so I would appreciate if they would not tut-tut when I am making an important point.</p>

          <p eId="para_182">In recent weeks we have seen pensioners having to sell their jewellery to get vital operations. We have seen homelessness and housing issues reaching record levels and workers' rights being suppressed. We will challenge the hard-right agenda being increasingly shown by the Taoiseach.</p>

          <p eId="para_183">I will not lower myself to that standard, not on this particular day anyway. I also congratulate the new Tánaiste and wish him well. Like Deputy Martin, he passes through Tipperary when he goes to Dublin. I also congratulate the newly appointed Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Heather Humphreys. It is a very important brief because of Brexit, which is having a huge impact already, especially on the Border counties. We are staring it in the face and we need it dealt with, along with employment in that area. I also wish the new Minister, Deputy Madigan, well in her new portfolio. It is sad that these appointments had to come in this particular fashion.</p>
          <p eId="para_184"> After the congratulations, the comhghairdeas and wishing the Ministers well, I have to say that the Taoiseach must get a firm grip on what is going on. During the talks, the Taoiseach's predecessor promised us that there would be a huge change, a sea change, at administration level and in the public and Civil Service as a result of the election. Sadly, that has not happened. It has to happen. This whole debacle, the Taoiseach's own admissions and those of the Minister for Justice and Equality yesterday, have made it blatantly clear that all is not well in the Department of Justice and Equality. All is not well in many Departments. The ordinary people whom we are supposed to represent are being let down by those of us who serve in here.</p>
          <p eId="para_185"> I take grave offence at the comments of Deputy Mary Lou McDonald suggesting that her party is the only Opposition. She might look past Fianna Fáil and see us over here. Every day we are championing causes, sometimes when very few others will. We will be holding the new Ministers to account on many issues. Above all, we must get the whole sea change, or at least some kind of a change, in the attitude of the public service. There are thousands and thousands of excellent public servants, but when it gets to the top it seems that people are very powerful and very indifferent to Ministers, who are held accountable by the electorate. If we cannot change the attitude, we will have to insist that the Secretaries General be elected by the people. They have to be held accountable in some shape, make or form. I wish the new Ministers well in that but, on behalf of the Rural Independent Group, I am putting forward the caveat that we will be watching them and all their actions line by line.</p>

          <p eId="para_188">I will comment on each brief individually. We had a good meeting with the new Tánaiste in respect of Brexit. I will reiterate a call that was made at that meeting. We need a meeting of all political leaders early next week, not later, on what is happening in respect of Brexit so that we can maintain a common position and get the best outcome for our country. Perhaps the Tánaiste might be able to join the Taoiseach at such a meeting. It is urgently required because developments are happening at a certain speed.</p>
          <p eId="para_189"> I wish the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, well in her new portfolio, but her appointment has to signal a dramatic change in how the State sees the whole issue of sustainability. Since that morning meeting, I have had three meetings with three or four businesspeople and they have all been saying the exact same thing. This Government is atrocious when it comes to promoting the new agenda of sustainability and the associated opportunities for business and enterprise. It has to change. This new appointment should be used as an opportunity to change track completely from what this Government has been doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_190">I wish the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Madigan, the very best of luck. I recommend that her first action is to turn to her colleague, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, and ask for help in the implementation of the report made by the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment earlier this week that would provide the funding for orchestras and journalism into the future. This funding must be provided. The Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Madigan, should work with the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, to turn that report into a reality. It was an example of how this House can and still does work. Let us use that work. The Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Madigan, should make her first action a defence of the creative communities and our media world. She should take the report and implement it with the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, early in the new year so that we can fund the orchestras and our media and content creation industries. </p>

          <from>Deputy Charlie McConalogue<recordedTime time="2017-11-30T12:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_324">I wish to be associated with the congratulations to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, on becoming Tánaiste, to Deputy Humphreys, on her move to the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and to Deputy Madigan, on her promotion to Cabinet.</p>
          <p eId="para_325"> The issue I wish to raise with the Tánaiste relates to agriculture.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">This is an area with which he is very familiar, given his previous stewardship of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. I am sure he is aware of the pressures on farming family incomes and the various challenges facing the sector not only because of the inclement weather over the course of the past year, with a fodder crisis facing many farmers in particular parts of the country, but also as a consequence of developments internationally, including the threat posed by the current Commission negotiations with the South American beef-producing countries in Mercosur and the very real challenges posed by Brexit.</p>
          <p eId="para_327"> The particular issues I wish to focus on today are the communiqué published yesterday on the post-2020 future of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP and, second, the question of spending under the current CAP programme until 2020. Fianna Fáil very much welcomes the communiqué in many of its aspects, particularly the focus on small and medium-sized family farms and the agreement that the reduction in the maximum payment under the basic payment scheme will not happen until after 2020. However, the key focus when considering the future of CAP must be on its budget. Will the Government ensure every effort is made to protect the CAP budget post-2020, given that it makes up 75% of average Irish farm incomes? In addition, will the Government undertake to ensure direct contributions are increased in order to achieve that objective?</p>
          <p eId="para_328"> In regard to spending under the current CAP programme, the Government is clearly failing to live up to the promises that were made, including by the Tánaiste when he was Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. During his tenure in that office, he gave a clear undertaking that €1.4 billion would be spent on the various schemes, including, for example, the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, an announcement that was welcomed by all the farming organisations. However, replies to parliamentary questions I have submitted in recent weeks and months indicate that by the end of 2021, when all participants in GLAS have been paid the full amounts owing to them, just over €1 billion will have been spent on the programme, which is €380 million less than what the Tánaiste, as Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, promised the expenditure would be. Those outstanding moneys should be directed towards reopening GLAS, providing additional funding for the areas of natural constraint, ANC, scheme, and bringing the suckler cow payment under the beef genomics and data programme, BGDP, up to €200.</p>
          <p eId="para_329"> Will the Tánaiste address these two points in his reply, namely, the future of CAP funding and, second, the failure of the Government to live up to its standing commitments under the various schemes?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SimonCoveney" eId="spk_113" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade">
          <from> The Tánaiste<recordedTime time="2017-11-30T12:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_330">It is good to have an opportunity once again to talk about agriculture. In regard to the future of CAP, the Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr. Phil Hogan, has managed this issue in a way that is politically intelligent. He has already launched a document on the future of CAP, which will allow us to have that discussion early in the context of the negotiation that will undoubtedly take place around the multi-annual financial framework for the EU budget post-2020. This affords us an opportunity to address, at an early stage, the need to prioritise CAP.</p>
          <p eId="para_331"> Payments under the Common Agricultural Policy contribute hugely to the economy, with the current round representing some €12 billion in payments to Irish farming families over its lifetime. That is broken down into direct payments and payments under the various rural development schemes, some of which the Deputy mentioned. The last round of CAP facilitated a very ambitious transformation of agriculture in Ireland in terms of recognising environmental responsibilities, improving technology within the sector, and exploiting the extraordinary and sustainable opportunities in this country for growth and expansion in agriculture and farming generally. We want to continue that progress into the next round of CAP. We have an Irish Commissioner who understands that thinking, but it will be up to the Government to form alliances across the European Union with other countries which value and prioritise the supports that allow us to have a sustainable and growing food sector and to support farming families into the future. That is partially a job for me as well as being a job for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, and, at the highest level of EU summits and so on, a job for the Taoiseach. We must seek to focus on how money will be spent in the future, particularly given the significant reduction in available EU funds that will arise due to the departure of the United Kingdom. Brexit is estimated to create a shortfall in funding of between €12 billion to €14 billion per year, which is one of the pressing reasons that agriculture and the future CAP must be prioritised from our perspective.</p>
          <p eId="para_332"> In regard to the domestic delivery of particular schemes, I can get back to the Deputy if he has specific questions. The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has, year after year, undertaken a very ambitious programme of roll-out and increased expenditure during the lifetime of the rural development programme. The Minister is anxious to deliver on that undertaking.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CharlieMcConalogue" eId="spk_114">
          <from>Deputy Charlie McConalogue<recordedTime time="2017-11-30T12:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_333">In the context of the Food Wise 2025 targets and given that the agrifood sector is our largest indigenous employer, it is crucial that we work with our European partners to plug the gap in funding that will arise after the UK leaves the Union, which could potentially amount to some €3 billion under the CAP budget, and that we live up to our responsibility to contribute more if necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_334"> Will the Tánaiste comment specifically on current Government spending under the CAP programme up to 2020? As Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine at the time, he committed to spend €1.4 billion under GLAS. It is crystal clear, following replies to parliamentary questions in recent weeks, that the Department will fall €380 million short of delivering on that promise. It is absolutely unacceptable that the Government should not live up to the promise made by the Tánaiste, when he was in the Department, and on which the now Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, is obliged to follow through. There are other things that can be done with that funding, including, as I suggested, increasing the disadvantaged payment through the ANC scheme, reopening GLAS and enhancing payments for suckler cows under the BGDP. Will the Tánaiste, working with the Minister, Deputy Creed, ensure the promise he made is lived up to and that funding is delivered? Farmers must not be shortchanged on what was promised to them.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SimonCoveney" eId="spk_115" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade">
          <from> The Tánaiste<recordedTime time="2017-11-30T12:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_335">The straight answer to that question is "Yes". We will ensure farmers are not shortchanged and that all the available funding under the rural development plan is fully drawn down for a whole series of schemes, including GLAS, the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, the sheep welfare scheme, the beef genomics and data programme, the organic farming scheme, the knowledge transfer programme and so on. There is a multitude of schemes through which farmers receive support. It is a key priority for us to draw down all available funds, and Ireland is good at doing that. We will ensure we do the same this time around.</p>
          <p eId="para_336"> The total expenditure envisaged under the agri-environment scheme, including GLAS, over the lifetime of the scheme is €1.4 billion. That will include transitional funding for remaining commitments arising from the agri-environment measures in the Rural Development Programme 2007-2013. There is a continuation of some of those schemes. It is not accurate to say there will be a pool of €300 million plus left on the table which we should reallocate to some other schemes. That is not how the schemes work.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryLouMcDonald" eId="spk_116">
          <from>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald<recordedTime time="2017-11-30T12:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_337">We are now fast approaching the critical meeting of the European Council to discuss the next stage of the Brexit negotiations. At this point in the process, the Government has maximum leverage and may avail of a veto to secure the best comprehensive deal in our national interests. There is an effort in the British press and by the Tories to bounce us into some kind of vague, cobbled together deal, after which, I assume, they would move on without a second thought for Ireland, our peace agreement, or, indeed, our economy. There is a very real danger that the best interests of Irish citizens, North and South, will be sacrificed in order to allow Britain and the European Union to move ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_338"> The Fianna Fáil Party, for its part, seems to have moved away from its stated aim to support the Good Friday Agreement and secure special designated status for the North. The party is apparently now prepared to settle for something far less.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">I appeal to the Tánaiste that his Government cannot follow the lead of Fianna Fáil in this regard. The Government must take and argue the principle that any progress that does not explicitly contain protections for Ireland's economy, our citizens and the Good Friday Agreement really is not progress at all. That is the Tánaiste's duty. Ireland cannot become collateral damage. I do not believe the Government should be bought off with vague assurances in order to allow the wider talks process to proceed. This will be another test of the Taoiseach's and the Tánaiste's leadership. The Government cannot back down in the defence of our national interests. The best way to secure our national interests is not this talk about regulatory divergence or convergence. Across Europe, and even within the British Government, it is accepted that Ireland is uniquely exposed with regard to Brexit. People recognise that Ireland requires a unique solution. That solution is for the North to be granted designated status, or whatever term is used. This means remaining in the Single Market, it means remaining in the customs union and it means the protection of the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts. That is Sinn Féin's position, it is the position of the EU Parliament, it is the stated position of the Dáil and it is a position from which the Tánaiste must not resile. It is vital that we have clarity and binding agreements. Without this the process should not be allowed to progress. Any talk of parallel processes is nonsense and dangerous at that.</p>
          <p eId="para_340"> Will the Tánaiste indicate if this is the position he will adopt in his meeting with Donald Tusk in Dublin tomorrow? Will the Tánaiste commit to using the veto if the Government does not achieve an agreement and if it is deemed necessary?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SimonCoveney" eId="spk_117" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade">
          <from> The Tánaiste<recordedTime time="2017-11-30T12:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_341">I thank the Deputy for an opportunity to put a number of things on the record in relation to the Government's approach to Brexit. I shall first turn to the veto issue. The talk of whether or not Ireland uses a veto misunderstands the reality we currently find ourselves in. There is very strong solidarity across the European Union among 27 countries, including Ireland, around what is required to allow this process to move on to opening up phase two, which is about future relationships, trade and transition arrangement, etc. The idea of whether or not Ireland will stand alone and use its veto actually misunderstands the fact that we are standing with another 26 countries at the moment. Yesterday I spoke with the German foreign minister who reconfirmed that position. I also spoke with the Luxembourg foreign minister who reconfirmed that position. When I represented the Taoiseach in Brussels last week I got that point reinforced to me, very strongly. I spent over an hour with Michel Barnier last week who also said that the EU's challenge is Ireland's challenge. They will not abandon Ireland on this issue. This is why we are working together to ensure that three areas that require substantial progress actually deliver that progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_342"> Clearly there has been a lot of progress although there is still some work to do on citizens' rights issues. Then there are the Irish issues. There has been very good progress on the common travel area. We have had deep discussions and a lot of very detailed work has been done in ensuring Ireland can maintain, in full, the benefits of the Good Friday Agreement on this island. That has posed very challenging questions on how we manage the Border questions in the future. How do we ensure that we can protect what we enjoy today, which is largely an invisible border that has developed over time and which has allowed the normalisation of relationships through trade and movement on the island? How do we protect that in the context of Brexit? We have very strong support in doing this, as I have already said. Between now and the meeting on 14 December we are looking for a language that reflects the need for credibility around how we are to approach this issue and solve it during phase two and the parameters within which that can be done. We will not have all of the answers by the middle of December but we are looking for significantly more clarity than we currently have from the British negotiating team in order to support, with the other 26 countries and with Michel Barnier, the move to open phase two of the negotiations. I believe that most people would like see phase two happen sooner rather than later given the uncertainty that remains in the absence of phase two beginning.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryLouMcDonald" eId="spk_118">
          <from>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald<recordedTime time="2017-11-30T12:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_343">I thank the Tánaiste. I do not for one second misunderstand the issue of the veto or how it might be deployed. I do not gainsay it either because I have seen myself the sense of solidarity at the European level. I do not believe that the Tánaiste or any Deputies should miss the clear impatience in some circles to move on to phase two. My concern arises around the position of the Government because it is a mistake to be ambivalent on any level on this issue. It is a mistake to give any message other than that Ireland requires a resolution and an agreement that protects the Good Friday Agreement in all of its parts and also protects Ireland's economy. This requires the North to remain within the Single Market and to remain within the customs union. There cannot be ambiguity on those matters as we move in to phase two. I put it to the Tánaiste that if the Government goes down that road then it is making a very big mistake. I also put it to the Tánaiste that, solidarity notwithstanding, in the absence of that level of certainty and clarity the Government would be left with no option but to exercise the veto. I ask the Tánaiste for reassurance that he sees these matters and that he understands these matters, as Sinn Féin does, in accordance with the position that has been adopted by the Dáil, which recognised all of those strands and the necessity to have full clarity on them.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SimonCoveney" eId="spk_119" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade">
          <from> The Tánaiste<recordedTime time="2017-11-30T12:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_344">I assure the House that we are not looking for some kind of constructive ambiguity in language to get us over a political problem. I regard the decisions that may or may not be taken on 14 December as of real, historic significance for Ireland. This is about the permanent change, potentially, in the relationship between Ireland and Britain and the relationships on this island. We have been very clear on this issue and unlike others we have not changed our position for months. Perhaps what has changed is the expectation of others that Ireland might, under pressure, change its position. We have not done that. I have been very clear that our first preference in respect of solving the Border issues and the North-South co-operation issues and so on would be for the United Kingdom as a whole to show a willingness and an appetite to remain part of the same customs union and the same trading platform as the rest of the European Union. That is, however, a decision for the British Government and its negotiating teams to make. In the absence of being able to solve the challenges, which run deep, that we face on the island of Ireland by a broad trade agreement in phase two between Britain and the European Union, then we have to recognise that Northern Ireland has unique challenges that will need tailor-made unique solutions. We have made that very clear. We have spoken about the need to avoid regulatory divergence because, essentially, if we had two jurisdictions on this island operating to different rule books for regulation it would be impossible in a practical sense to maintain the kind of relationships we have today. This is why we have taken such a firm stance on this issue and we will continue to hold to that position. Hopefully we will see progress that can allow us to move on to phase two in the middle of December. If it is not possible to do that, so be it.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin<recordedTime time="2017-11-30T12:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_345">In addition to his other duties the Taoiseach has retained for himself the role of Minister for Defence. It is not clear to me that he takes any real responsibility for the area of Defence. It is not acceptable for a Cabinet Minister to simply delegate the entire responsibility for a Government Department to a Minister of State. The Taoiseach does not answer parliamentary questions on the matter. I do not know if he attends monthly management meetings of the leadership team of the Department of Defence or if he regularly attends meetings with the Secretary General or other senior officials of the Department. He seems to be sidestepping personal responsibility for his Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">Very serious issues are arising. The wives and partners of Defence Forces personnel are outside the gates of Leinster House this morning to continue to highlight some of these issues, in particular the clear fact that many members are leaving because they cannot live on current earnings. The Tánaiste will tell the House that the matter is being examined by a public sector pay commission, but the Government was happy to act unilaterally in respect of the new Garda Commissioner and the highly paid academics we needed to attract. I believe genuinely that the Government would find consensus in the House for a bespoke pay review for the Defence Forces, which is warranted and urgently required. I cannot understand why it is willing to recognise the Garda associations in pay negotiations but will not do the same for the representative associations of Defence Forces' personnel.</p>
          <p eId="para_347"> Reports this week have made it clear that an Air Corps whistleblower faces discharge from the Defence Forces. That a serving member of the Defence Forces can face disciplinary action for chronic inactivity, as it was stated, following a work-related industrial dispute is disconcerting, in particular when it is reported that he has told the Minister of State that he was targeted for raising safety concerns. Mr. Christopher O'Toole has been appointed to examine protected disclosures on the working environment at Casement Aerodrome. It is reported that the terms of reference he was given were impractical. This is all the more concerning now that we know the State Claims Agency carried out a number of health and safety management audits of the Defence Forces and that the Defence Forces can only offer speculative explanations for why prior inspection reports from Casement Aerodrome have gone missing. That is unsatisfactory, especially in the light of the fact that copies of these documents are in circulation among politicians and the media. Efforts to establish whether the documents were deliberately destroyed have amounted to asking the Defence Forces to investigate themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_348"> What action will the Government take to ensure every member of the Defence Forces will earn at least a living wage? Will it commit to recognising Defence Forces' associations in pay negotiations? Is it satisfied that the Defence Forces' members who met the Minister of State, Deputy Paul Kehoe, to discuss these concerns are receiving the full protection warranted under the Protected Disclosures Act? Has it considered the establishment of a commission of investigation to establish whether the health and safety management regime at Casement Aerodrome meets the standards of the day and whether the allegations have any credibility?</p>

          <p eId="para_354">There will be answers to these questions. </p>
          <p eId="para_355"> On the wives and partners of Defence Forces' personnel who are making a point today, I note that successful negotiations with the Permanent Defence Force representative associations have led to significant pay increases under the Lansdowne Road agreement for Defence Forces' personnel. The public service stability agreement for the period 2018 to 2020 provides for a series of further pay increases in the next three years. Given the ministerial offices Deputy Brendan Howlin has held, he will know of the difficulty in separating one sector from all others for special treatment in public sector pay, but that is what he is asking us to do. There are other issues about what the Department of Defence can do about other supports available to Defence Forces' personnel. There have been reviews in that regard. There are many sectors in the economy and society that can make a very valid case for improved pay and working conditions. I understand that, of course, the Defence Forces will make that case for themselves through the representative organisations and, in this case, private family members. Of course, the Government will listen. However, we have to operate within a certain pay structure across the public sector. If we were to start to dismantle it for individual sectors, the Deputy knows of the chaos it would cause.</p>
          <p eId="para_356"> As a former Minister for Defence, I record the Government's strong appreciation of the role the Defence Forces play. I have visited many peacekeeping missions around the world and had the privilege to spend time with families who have lost loved ones in the service of the country in the Defence Forces. They are valued. We are building personnel numbers in the Defence Forces and the recruitment campaign is a success. We are adding substantially more personnel to the Defence Forces than we are losing and will continue to see that trend develop into 2018.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin<recordedTime time="2017-11-30T13:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_357">I appreciate the Tánaiste's reply and understand he cannot give me a comprehensive response on the Casement Aerodrome issues. I look forward to either a direct briefing or a written response in due course. I have full knowledge of pay issues in dealing with the public service as a whole, but there is a compelling case to be made for separating out the Defence Forces for a bespoke review. I say this in the full knowledge of how difficult it would be. The shockingly low pay levels across the sector are having an impact on retention in key skills areas. When these difficulties arose in the health sector, we managed to formulate a way to deal with them. For example, we had a formula for skilled nurses. We need to recognise what is happening. The fact that the people concerned are not allowed to manifest their voices publicly does not mean that they should be ignored. As such, I ask whether consideration will be given to a unique pay review within the Defence Forces and outside the Public Sector Pay Commission.</p>

          <from> The Tánaiste<recordedTime time="2017-11-30T13:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_358">The Minister of State with responsibility for defence matters tells me that this is happening in the context of having special skill sets within the Defence Forces. It is important to note, having regard to the broader arrangements in place, that combined increases in recent months for new recruits have ranged from 8% to 24%, depending on the point on which they are on the pay scales. We are seeing an economy which can afford to pay the public sector more. The bodies which represent members of the Defence Forces have bought into and want to be part of negotiations and their members are starting to benefit, but that is not to suggest there is no frustration in the Defence Forces. However, across the public sector, including within the Defence Forces, deals negotiated with representative bodies mean that we will see continuous improvements in pay into the future, which is positive.</p>
          <p eId="para_359"> On the Air Corps, the Minister of State has only recently received observations and replies from the three individuals who made protected disclosures on the independent review report which he had commissioned and forwarded to them. Having received responses on the report from the three individuals, the Minister of State will have to make recommendations to the Government. We will make decisions on whether further action is required.</p>

          <p eId="para_362">Now that the Government has apparently survived its own health scare, perhaps it can turn its attention to the far more pressing matter of the health of the nation as a whole. There appears to be a lack of urgency in the Government's response to the Sláintecare report, produced by the cross-party Committee on the Future of Healthcare. The report, with its far-reaching recommendations for radical changes in this country's approach to health care, was published back in May, but we are still waiting for the establishment of an implementation office that will see its recommendations brought into action.</p>
          <p eId="para_363"> If proof was needed of how much a major revamp of our delivery of health care is required, then one only needs to look at recent developments. At a time when waiting lists for treatment in Irish hospitals are spiralling out of control, the recent RTÉ "Prime Time" investigation revealed how a number of consultants were in breach of their contracts to provide a certain number of hours in the care of public patients, opting to boost their salaries with work in private hospitals. One who was observed for eight weeks was found to be working fewer than 13 hours on average in the public system even though he was contracted to work 37 hours a week.</p>
          <p eId="para_364"> Such scandalous behaviour, for which HSE and hospital management must also take their share of responsibility, no doubt at least partly contributed to the latest waiting list figures in our hospitals. There were almost a half a million people, more than 494,000, waiting for outpatient treatment at the end of October. That is an increase of 56,000 people on the same time last year. Despite several undertakings to improve the situation, there has also been an increase in the number of people waiting for inpatient and day case operations and procedures compared with this time last year. More than 80,000 people are on waiting lists as inpatients, also up on last year. The number waiting for 15 months or more as outpatients has almost doubled, up by 88% to almost 92,000. Add in those waiting this unacceptable length of time for inpatient or day case procedures, and there are little short of 500,000 people the length and breadth of Ireland facing absolutely unacceptable waits for a call from their local hospital. They have been forced for more than 15 months, and much, much longer in some cases, to live in pain, to live in fear and to live constantly waiting for the postman to deliver a letter that will finally signal relief. Meanwhile, the workload of nurses and other staff has increased to a point of great stress to them and to a point where questions should be asked about the level of care to some vulnerable patients. They are simply being spread too thinly on the ground. Resources are being stretched in most hospitals and the solution is not just a question of more beds. The required additional medical resources in terms of staffing, equipment and theatre facilities must be allocated too.</p>
          <p eId="para_365"> The Committee on the Future of Healthcare recommended that the implementation office for Sláintecare would be located in the Office of the Taoiseach. I understand that there was a worry among at least some members of the committee that the Department of Health might be given the responsibility for implementing the wide-ranging and radical changes recommended by the report. They felt that such a move would hamper progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_366"> Can the Taoiseach confirm that the implementation process will be under the control of his Department and not the Department of Health? Can he indicate when the process will be up and running?</p>

          <p eId="para_367">On the last question, the progress report will be made to the Minister of Health but the Minister for Health reports to the Taoiseach in the context of the Cabinet subcommittee on health, which has a specific focus on Sláintecare. The Taoiseach holds the Department and the Minister to account on progress made.</p>
          <p eId="para_368"> The concept of Sláintecare is an all-party approach to ensure we have consistency in terms of providing decent health care across the country as Governments change and we are absolutely committed to this, as are other parties. We are anxious to get on with the implementation process to which we have committed. In July the Government agreed to move forward with the establishment of a dedicated programme office, specifically the recruitment of a lead executive. This marked a critical first step in gearing up for the significant programme of reform and demonstrates the Government's commitment to this process. Some €1 million has been allocated to this office for 2018 in line with the report's recommendations. The recruitment process for a head of this office is already under way and is being managed by the Public Appointments Service. It is essential that we are positioned to attract candidates of real calibre who can be responsible for driving the reform programme in which the office will be involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_369"> In parallel to this process the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, is developing a response to the report and a draft implementation plan, which will be done and published by the end of this year. This process seeks to translate the Sláintecare report into a programme of action for the next ten years and will consider issues that arise in designing such a programme, including key actions, deliverables, costings, timelines and the interdependencies which will be necessary across Departments. It was acknowledged in the Sláintecare report that more detailed consideration of these issues would be required and this work is under way. The process is being led at a most senior level in the Department and in the HSE and also involves close engagement with the Department of the Taoiseach and the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform. The involvement of these Departments was a key recommendation of the report and that is why it is happening. We will have an implementation plan, as recommended by the Sláintecare report, by the end of the year and the Minister, Deputy Harris, is on schedule to get that done. In parallel, we are putting in place a delivery office with people who have the motivation and talent to ensure we move the process forward into next year.</p>

          <p eId="para_370">My own local hospital, University Hospital Galway, UHG, which is the busiest in the country, is an example of the woes of the current health system, with its growing waiting lists and overcrowded emergency department. The situation has been made worse by the fact that leaking roofs over the operating theatres in Merlin Park Hospital have resulted in some procedures having to be carried out in UHG and, of course, the cancellation of many operations. I appreciate that there has been some movement to reduce the inpatient and day case list but I find it disturbing that this hospital still accounts for more than a quarter of all the patients in the country who are waiting for more than 15 months for inpatient treatment that they badly need. Put another way, one in 11 patients on the waiting lists for inpatient or day case treatment nationally have been waiting for more than 15 months. In Galway that proportion is one in six patients. It is shocking, for instance, that a total of 114 people have been waiting for more than a year in Galway for cardiac treatment, when this time last year there was just one patient in this situation. There were 17 people last year waiting for more than a year and a half for oral surgery and this total has since soared to 570. We seem to be going backwards, rather than forward, in terms of health care and the reforms suggested in the Sláintecare report cannot come fast enough.</p>

          <p eId="para_371">I suspected there would be some questions relating to Galway in the Deputy's contribution. As part of budget 2018 it was announced that funding to improve access to emergency care in 2018 will enable the opening of additional hospital capacity, including new beds, and additional diagnostic services and surgical capacity will be provided to reduce emergency department overcrowding. Additional capacity will be introduced in Galway in this respect. A new 75-bed ward block was completed in 2016 and the new acute mental health department is expected to be operational by the end of 2017. Galway is a pilot site for the national patient flow improvement programme and it is starting to work. There has been significant progress in planning for the new emergency department, with a design team to be appointed in the coming weeks, and there has also been a significant upgrade of the maternity unit, as well as 30 additional beds opened in 2016 as part of a wider winter beds programme. The cystic fibrosis outpatient department was completed a number of years ago and we are also looking at elective orthopaedic contingency implementation work at Merlin Park.</p>
          <p eId="para_372"> I am not saying we are where we need to be and there are clearly issues with, and pressures on, health provision in Galway, of which the Minister is very aware. However, we have a significant funding programme, both capital and current, and that will ensure we address these issues over time. </p>

          <p eId="para_374">Yesterday and today Deputies across the House, myself included, have been receiving phone calls from school principals who are very concerned that the minor works grant will not be paid by the end of this year. It is a crucial grant, amounting to €50 per student which, for a 100-student school, means €5,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">If these schools do not receive it, they will have to ask parents for the money instead. It is absolutely unacceptable that the Government would stand over it. I ask the Minister for an update today on the status of this payment, and a commitment that the minor works grant will be paid to every primary school in the country before the end of this year.</p>

The Department is reviewing the position to see what would be the timing that could be achieved for the payment of such a grant. Work is continuing at the Department.

          <p eId="para_377">In the programme for Government, a whole chapter is dedicated to ending the housing shortage and homelessness. It speaks of ending the need for rough sleeping by providing a high level of funding for homeless services and supporting emergency beds and accommodation options. This month, the Dublin Region Homeless Executive quarterly rough sleepers count revealed a 33% increase in the number of people forced to sleep on the streets in November. The only real accommodation solution for rough sleepers with complex needs is the Housing First programme. To date, only 180 Housing First tenancies have been created by the Government. This is well short of targets for 2017.</p>

As the Deputy rightly pointed out, the Housing First initiative is being rolled out and a new co-ordination group is being put in place to ensure that we effectively use the resources available. The Minister has pointed out his plans, for example, to double next year the number of social houses being built. Every action is on a very rapid ramp-up by the Government. No money has been spared in backing these proposals to make them a reality on the streets.</p>

          <p eId="para_385">The Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill was published last July. Last summer, it was the stated intention of the new Minister to get the Bill through before the summer recess. Meanwhile, a new Social Welfare Bill has been published and is progressing. We are now waiting nearly half a year for detailed amendments to come from the Government that would address the complex issue facing defined benefit pension schemes. It is not acceptable simply to park a piece of legislation that was to be fast tracked. When will we see these amendments and when will the Bill be advanced?</p>

          <p eId="para_387">A key recommendation of the national rare disease plan of the previous Government was to establish a rare disease technology review group. I understand there is a chair but no members. The Minister understands and is cognisant of the serious situation in this country whereby citizens cannot get certain drugs because of a very flawed process. This is a life or death situation for citizens and the Minister is aware of this. Will he comment on when this will be set up?</p>

          <p eId="para_388">I thank Deputy Kenny for raising the issue. He is entirely correct. When it comes to a number of rare diseases, which affect a small number of people in the country, the quality-adjusted life year, QALI, test alone will never make it possible. As he correctly said, Professor Barry, the head of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, NCPE, is undertaking a working group on this issue. Recently, I highlighted to him the priority I attach to this and I expect its work to commence very shortly. I will keep the Deputy informed.</p>

When will the Government recognise the significant importance of having a second runway to the economic development of our country?

We have one of the highest rates of addiction and gambling <i>per capita</i> in the world. Will the Minister consider initiating this?

There is no increase in the wage grant for projects funded by Pobal. I raised this matter in a parliamentary question but the reply I received stated that staffing matters are an issue for the social economy projects and have no direct impact on Pobal. Either the Department misunderstood the question or it showed a blatant disregard for the problem I am trying to solve. This issue falls within the remit of the new Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Madigan. I ask that it be addressed in the context of projects across the country. Otherwise, many of these beneficial projects will be put out of business.</p>

          <p eId="para_415">On page 4 of the programme for Government, there is a reference to creating a social economy and a number of points are made. One of the first of these relates to sound public finances and a stable and broad tax base. Senior officials from the Revenue Commissioners appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts this morning. They informed it that eight out of ten of the highest earning companies in the country paid zero tax last year and that some even got tax rebates. It is time the Minister for Finance came to the House to explain this. This is not about whether we should have the 12.5% rate of corporation tax - that is a separate argument - it is about the companies that pay zero tax. At the same time, small businesses in my constituency are being hounded by the Revenue Commissioners for the smallest of misdemeanours, such as when they miss their VAT payments by a couple of weeks and so forth. Why does this imbalance exist? It goes to the heart of everything we are doing here. We debate all types of issues relating to health, housing and so forth and we have no money for them, yet these companies are getting away with paying zero tax. Will the Minister come to the House to give a statement on these matters?</p>

          <p eId="para_429">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_430">That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to establish an office of a Digital Safety Commissioner and to provide for its functions to ensure the oversight and regulation of procedures for removal, by digital service, undertakings of harmful digital communications; to provide for the creation of codes of practice for digital services undertakings; to establish an advisory committee to the Digital Safety Commissioner and to provide for related matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">I am delighted to have the opportunity to introduce the Digital Safety Commissioner Bill, which I believe is a significant move towards promoting a positive and safe online culture for all. It builds on the work of Fiona O'Regan and the Law Reform Commission report on digital safety and harmful communications. I understand that consideration is being given to similar proposals by the Government. However, I am introducing this Bill with a view to moving the debate forward and encouraging the Government to deliver in respect of this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_432"> The office of the digital safety commissioner would be a statutory body. It would be responsible for the promotion of digital safety for all, supporting and implementing measures to improve digital safety and advising the Government of the day on policies relating to digital safety. It is a new departure which would bring us up to date given the time in which we live and the risks experienced by users of the Internet, particularly children, and it would attempt to mitigate some of those risks. It would also be responsible for the promotion of a positive online experience, which should be emphasised. Crucially, it would be responsible for ensuring digital service providers, such as websites, social media platforms, apps and so forth, abide by minimum codes of practice and national digital safety standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_433"> Central to this would be take down mechanisms to remove harmful communications. This could be appealed to the commissioner if they are not removed. Failure to abide by the code of practice and national digital safety standards would see a code of compliance for the provider or platform revoked. This is about providing timely, quick and effective remedies so people can be confident that the website or platform they or members of their family are engaging with will deal with abusive material, harmful communications or material posted without consent. Many providers have good mechanisms, but some do not have any. Certificates of compliance will ensure that users and parents can distinguish and choose.</p>
          <p eId="para_434"> Online safety, online bullying - which is becoming ever more prevalent - and the posting of harmful materials are among the biggest child protection issues of this generation. The Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, ISPCC, has been very enthusiastic about the potential of Bills such as this. There must be a cross-Government approach to ensure these issues can be dealt with, including actions such as this Bill, additional offences, education programmes and the promotion of good behaviour online to make the Internet a positive place for all. We are conscious of the tremendous benefits that online platforms can provide, so promoting active and positive online citizenship would be a central feature of the work of a digital safety commissioner.</p>
          <p eId="para_435"> We are also proposing the establishment of an advisory committee, 50% of which would be drawn from civil society, youth and children’s groups and which would include specific youth members. This would ensure that new developments, technologies, trends and platforms come to the attention of the commissioner quickly and that the office has the ability and scope to evolve and develop over time, as technology and online behaviour rapidly do. This Bill would be a significant step in improving the online experience of all and in giving people more confidence in their safety from abuse and harmful material. I look forward to discussing it on Second Stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_440">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_441">That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Planning and Development Act 2000, to amend the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 and to provide for related matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">This Bill seeks to initiate proper regulation of short-term lettings, which would bring more homes back into the conventional rental market. The Bill provides for a 90-day limit on short-term lettings without planning permission. These limits will only affect so-called professional lettings and portals such Airbnb, etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">It is not necessarily geared towards affecting those who wish, if they have the opportunity to do so, to take advantage of the opportunities for short-term lettings during the course of a year in order to supplement their income. The number of lets over 90 days being used in this fashion has increased significantly in recent years. This has had a detrimental impact on the conventional rental market and has prevented the renting out of many homes that would otherwise be available to people. If those homes were available to rent, it would have a positive effect in terms of the continuing crisis relating to the provision of housing and the rental sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_444"> The Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government produced a report on this matter in recent months and the Bill reflects what is contained in that report. It is one of a series of Bills we have introduced in recent months in an attempt to instill in the Government the sense of urgency needed to address various issues relating to the housing sector, create a positive impact and help the many people who are experiencing great difficulty in obtaining properties such as those to which I refer. Similar legislation has been introduced to regulate matters in other cities across the globe. We examined the position in those cities - for example, Berlin, Amsterdam, London and San Francisco - and are of the view that the Bill reflects the best of what is contained in the regulations put in place by the authorities there in an attempt to address this issue. Of course, this is an issue that needs to be addressed as a matter of some urgency. I encourage those of all parties and none to support the Bill. It should move quickly to Second Stage and then be scrutinised by the relevant committee in order that it might have the desired effect which is so urgently required.</p>

        <speech by="#PaulKehoeFG" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Defence" eId="spk_198">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Deputy Paul Kehoe)<recordedTime time="2017-11-30T13:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_449">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_450">That Dáil Éireann approves Ireland's participation in two European Defence Agency projects – (1) Joint Procurement Arrangement for EU SatCom Market and (2) European Centre for Manual Neutralisation Capabilities, ECMAN, pursuant to section 2 of the Defence (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">In commending the motion, I will briefly outline the function of the European Defence Agency, EDA, and the background to the programmes in which Ireland wishes to participate. I brought this motion before a meeting of the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade yesterday. The EDA is an agency of the European Union and was established by a joint action of the Council of the European Union in 2004. Its purpose is to support the member states and the Council in their efforts to improve European defence capabilities in the field of crisis management and to sustain the European security and defence policy as it stands and as it develops in the future. On 6 July 2004, the Government approved Ireland's participation in the framework of the EDA. The agency is focused on assisting member states in capability development and obtaining better value for existing spending levels, improving competitiveness and securing greater efficiency, particularly in the area of research, technology and procurement of defence capabilities. The primary reason for Ireland's participation in the agency is to support the development of Defence Forces capabilities for peacekeeping and international crisis management operations. The Defence (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 prescribes that participation in projects or programmes in the EDA is subject to Government and Dáil approval.</p>
          <p eId="para_452"> The proposal put forward by me today is to seek approval for Ireland to participate in two EDA projects - one in the area of satellite communications and one in the area of manual neutralisation capabilities. The aim of this joint procurement arrangement is to provide commercially available satellite communications, fixed and mobile, as well as related services through the establishment of framework agreements on behalf of the contributing members, to promote ease of access and to improve efficiency. The provision of strategic satellite services is an essential prerequisite for the major deployment of troops overseas and in support of other major operations. It is vital that the Defence Forces maintain appropriate systems and procedures for the provision of strategic satellite services. This project represents an opportunity not only to procure satellite services in an efficient, cost-effective and timely manner but also to ensure security of supply and back-up in the event of any failure on the part of an existing supplier or an urgent operational requirement which cannot be met under Ireland's normal contractual arrangements. There are no costs to the Exchequer arising from participation in this arrangement. Costs only arise if the service is availed of on a pay-per-use basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_453"> I will now provide some detail on the second EDA project, which is the European Centre for Manual Neutralisation Capabilities, ECMAN. The ECMAN category B project is a follow-on activity of the EDA's category B programme on manual neutralisation techniques courses and exercises programme. Ireland's participation in that programme was approved in 2013 and will finish in 2018. The aim of this follow on project is to continue to develop manual neutralisation capabilities to the highest standards in order to retain capacity in dealing with improvised explosive devices when it is not possible to destroy or disrupt the device through other means, for example, a controlled explosion. Participation in this project would provide explosive ordnance disposal personnel with access to a training system which is designed to continuously update and improve their safety when operating in an extreme environment. It also enables those already qualified to maintain skill levels through an efficient relicensing arrangement linked to refresher courses. This capability is highly specialised. There is a lack of availability elsewhere due to its sensitive and classified nature and it is mainly developed through multinational framework arrangements. The cost to the Exchequer of Ireland's participation in ECMAN is €75,000 per year for six years - a total of €450,000 over the lifetime of the project. The costs will be met from within existing resources. </p>
          <p eId="para_454"> Ireland's participation in the EDA affords us the opportunity to keep abreast of best practice and new developments in the defence environment, particularly as it impacts on multinational crisis management operations. The Government's White Paper on Defence, published in August 2015, states that Ireland will identify opportunities to participate in multi-national capability development projects within the framework of the EDA in support of the Defence Forces' operations, capacity and capability. These projects are prime examples of how the Defence Forces can develop their capabilities in satellite communications and in manual neutralisation capabilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_455"> I commend the motion to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LisaChambers" eId="spk_199">
          <from>Deputy Lisa Chambers<recordedTime time="2017-11-30T13:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_456">At the outset, I acknowledge the wives and partners of members of the Defence Forces who are protesting outside the House today and who will be there for the next number of hours. I will be joining them when I leave the Chamber. I wish them well and congratulate them on the fantastic work they have done to date in highlighting the difficulties their partners face serving in the Defence Forces in light of current pay and conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_457"> Fianna Fáil will be supporting the motion. The EDA was established under a joint action of the Council of Ministers in July 2004 during the Irish Presidency.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">Its mission, as stated on its website, is to support the member states and the Council in their effort to improve European defence capabilities in the field of crisis management and to sustain the European security and defence policy as it stands now and to develop it in the future. Ireland has participated in the framework of the EDA since it was established and it is important to note our participation in it does not impose specific obligations or commitments on Ireland, only that we make a contribution to the budget which funds the agency's day-to-day running. </p>
          <p eId="para_459"> Within its key mission, the EDA has three main sub-missions. They are to support the development of defence capabilities and military co-operation among the European member states; stimulating defence research in technology and strengthening the European defence industry; and acting as a military interface to EU policies. This work is done for the purposes of good and with the sole interest of protecting our people. We and the European Union are facing new and evolving threats all of the time. One prime example of this is in the area of cyber security. We need to protect our public services and ensure the business community and the many multinationals operating here operate in a safe jurisdiction and that we have protections in place to protect them from a cyber attack. Surely we can all agree and see the benefits of working with other member states to research in this area and to develop new technologies by pooling resources and technologies and allowing a small country such as ours to benefit from economies of scale by working with others. This approach is a no-brainer. We would be foolish and reckless to opt out instead of participating. </p>
          <p eId="para_460"> The key activities of our Defence Forces internationally are peace-keeping, co-operation with other countries in conflict prevention, strengthening national and international security and operating within a global community to promote peace and security across the globe. As a nation, we have a very proud record of operating within the UN. Since we became involved, our service has been constant; we have never had a day's break. Participation in the European Defence Agency means Ireland has access to research and information that allows us to develop and maintain our military capabilities. For the most part, due to the size of our country, this is research we cannot generate ourselves. Ireland's objectives in participating in the European Defence Agency is to achieve economies of scale in participating in defence procurement and to keep up-to-date on best practices, particularly in the area of multinational crisis management. This important work on the part of our Defence Forces is to keep up-to-date on best practice and to build the capabilities of our Defence Forces and in turn protect those serving in the Irish Defence Forces. This important work requires us to have the most up-to-date training and the best possible capabilities and that we enhance our capabilities and capacity by working with other member states. Some in the House are quite happy to laud the Defence Forces for their great humanitarian work, most recently in the Mediterranean, yet they will stand up and oppose any training of our troops to prepare them for this important work. The hypocrisy is unbelievable. I have said in the House before when our soldiers go overseas they are not going on holiday; they are operating in dangerous environments. We must at all times ensure our people have the best training and that they participate in training exercises with armies from other countries so we can share our knowledge and learn from best practice. We cannot take an insular approach to defence activities. The work our soldiers do in this sphere is peace-keeping and peace enforcement. We should always support any training activity that prepares them for such work.</p>
          <p eId="para_461"> I will address the two projects which are the basis of this motion. The EU Satellite Communications Market, category B project allows us to participate in a satellite service where all the member states pool resources and we access the resource only if we need it. This clearly allows for economies of scale for a country such as ours. Communications are vitally important in this day and age. We need to ensure we have a service that is consistently present and that there is no lapse in service. There is no cost unless we use it. Supporting this project and participating in it is sensible and wise. </p>
          <p eId="para_462"> The second project, the European Centre for Manual Neutralisation Capabilities, ECMAN, category B project, deals with providing courses and training for soldiers dealing with improvised explosive devices, IEDs. We have key expertise and experience in this area. Unfortunately we have lost experts in this area in the past number of years. We still have something to offer to other member states by participating and giving to the EDA and this project. We can also learn. The cost of this project presents value for money for our Defence Forces and our country and I am very happy to support it on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party.</p>

          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh<recordedTime time="2017-11-30T13:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_463">I also acknowledge the great work of the wives and partners of the Defence Forces members and the fact they have had to come to Dublin today to protest and highlight the demands for pay and conditions. It is a disgrace and the situation is getting worse and not better. My approach to all the EU defence related motions that have come before the House since the Lisbon Treaty referendum result, which tied Ireland to the European Defence Agency, is to view them with a healthy amount of suspicion, given the purpose of the European Defence Agency and most of our EU partners is to gradually achieve an EU army and to increase military spending. The other aim is to increase interoperability, make national armies indistinct from and dependent on each other and to enhance military capabilities above what would be required, even in an Armageddon scenario, to defend the EU. We acknowledge that Ireland has a unique reputation to protect in terms of our neutrality and proud record of peace-keeping with the UN over decades. Every step that further aligns us with the EU military project further erodes our neutrality and further undermines the reputation built on UN duties, which have resulted in the loss of 86 Irish soldiers since 1960. Nobody is denying the threat level is greater in today's world and that armies and armed groups around the world are becoming more sophisticated, as the Minister said in committee yesterday. There is a need to afford the soldiers of the Defence Forces the greatest level of protection possible and for their skills to be increasingly honed and their equipment adequate not only to protect themselves but also to protect those they seek to protect. That can be done without eroding our national interest and our neutrality. The State's neutrality should not be sacrificed on the altar of interoperability and greater efficiencies. In committee yesterday, I argued that one of the motions to which we are being asked to sign up, while being benign, could increase our dependence on the EU military machine. Signing up to the EU Satellite Communications Market, category B project ties our military, Army and Naval Service operating overseas to the same satellite communications system as most other EU countries despite the fact we already have a satellite communications contract which to date nobody has highlighted as flawed and as far as I know there is no problem with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_464"> I was told yesterday that the European Defence Agency system run via an Airbus Eurostar or other equivalent satellite is just a back-up. Interestingly the EDA satellite communications contract is with Airbus, which is one of the largest suppliers of such communications in the world. It is a French company with more than €14 billion turnover. While I was told - it was repeated today - there is no additional cost and it will only arise each time we use it, I believe the system will be used every time the Irish Defence Forces are on operational deployments overseas with troops of other countries because it ensures the buzzword of interoperability. </p>
          <p eId="para_465"> While we have signed up to interoperability on this, we are no closer to protecting our soldiers abroad or at home from Lariam, despite a Dáil motion instructing the Minister and military to do so. We are also way behind other EU militaries in admitting the failures of the past and the legacy of very sick serving and former members of the Air Corps. When will these issues get the same attention as the headlong rush into the EU-led military agenda?</p>
          <p eId="para_466"> On the second tongue-twisting motion before us today, the European Centre for Manual Neutralisation Capabilities, category B, I highlighted the dangerously low levels in the Defence Forces of skills in explosive ordnance disposal personnel. I am concerned that if they are away on training courses with this project, it would leave the country more exposed and put more pressures on the soldiers who are still at home and who are already over-stretched to cover call-outs. I was not reassured by the reply because it did not show how that section of the Army would grow quickly enough to address this shortfall. I also asked where within the very tight defence budget were they able to find the annual €75,000 it will cost? What will suffer as a consequence? </p>
          <p eId="para_467">I apologise that I am about to step out. I want to visit the protest outside and I will be back before the end of the debate.</p>

          <p eId="para_468">I wish to deal with the two elements in the motion before us, which the Labour Party will be supporting. The first element on joint procurement of satellite communications makes sense to me, providing for efficient procurement, economies of scale and all that goes with it. There is no cost to us unless we decide to purchase. I do not see any downside to that aspect of the motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_469"> The second element relating to training in improvised explosive devices also makes sense to me. I would certainly see providing access to training as being attractive to the personnel themselves. In any organisation, people tend to jump at an opportunity to enhance their skills level. I believe this will also be positive. This element appears to cost us €450,000. The Minister of State has indicated that will come from existing resources. However, if something comes from existing resources, a pot somewhere is reduced with less funding available for some element of the budget. I would be happier not to see a budget cut for some line element associated with this.</p>
          <p eId="para_470"> Earlier I met the people outside the gates of Leinster House. In his earlier contribution, Deputy Howlin identified the need for a special review of pay for Defence Forces personnel. I thought the Tánaiste's response was reasonably positive in terms of taking advice from the Minister of State at the Department of Defence. I call for it again today. It is a scandal that Defence Forces personnel are relying on family income supplement, a matter I have raised previously in defence debates.</p>
          <p eId="para_471"> Overall, I do not see any downside to the two elements in the motion. As I said at the beginning, the Labour Party will support it.</p>

          <p eId="para_474">That is even worse.</p>
          <p eId="para_475"> What a load of nonsense. The European Union border regime alone is like some sort of horrific nightmare from a dystopian science fiction horror movie in terms of our complicity in the horrors that are going on in Libya. We are involved in training the Libyan coast guard, which, in turn, is deeply implicated in slavery, systematic rape, beatings and torture of vulnerable people who are trapped. Up to 1 million people are trapped in Libya because the Western powers went in and destroyed Libya. Now the country has collapsed and these desperate people are looking to come to Europe for a new life. Thousands of them drown in the Mediterranean Sea with more sent back. I am absolutely amazed that the Minister of State finds this amusing, by the way. It is an horrific situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_476"> If there are threats out there, it is because of what Western powers, including European powers, have done in places such as Libya and the inhuman response of the European Union. Instead, we are developing systems essentially to make it easier to repel these people and co-operate with some of the forces guilty of this horror. Of course, it dates back to beyond that. There is the horrific EU-Turkey deal, again about repelling desperate Syrian migrants coming from the disaster in Syria, turning a blind eye to the horrific human rights of the Turkish regime against its own people, against journalists, locking up politicians and so on. We are quite happy to do deals with Turkey.</p>
          <p eId="para_477"> We are willing to engage in trade with horrific regimes such as Saudi Arabia, which is beyond words in its horror with the denial of human rights at the most basic level. After the former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, went to the United Arab Emirates and was asked if he raised human rights issues, he said it was not really appropriate to raise human rights on trade missions. It is that kind of amorality of being willing to work with these regimes. We are doing big trade deals with the Egyptian regime. We were complicit in the US military assault on Iraq which destroyed Iraq and in turn had a knock-on effect in Syria. There would be no ISIS threat were it not for all these things.</p>
          <p eId="para_478"> We then justify beefing up the European military industrial complex as a response to that to protect ourselves when we have actually created that mess or been complicit in creating the mess that generated those threats in the first place. On these particular initiatives, the European arms industry has boosted its lobbying budget over the past five years from €2.6 million to €5.8 million. The 36 different meetings between the arms industry and the European Commission between 2013 and 2016 form the backdrop to this. This is the totally immoral arms industry trying to cash in on this stuff that European and other Western powers have helped generate through their direct involvement in horrors in the Middle East, Libya and Turkey or through complicity with the US war machine at Shannon here. Those are the issues we should be addressing.</p>
          <p eId="para_479"> Of course, we should also care about our soldiers who are standing outside the gates of Leinster House. Some of them are on family income supplement because we do not even pay them decent wages. We want to line the pockets of the European military industrial complex. We should have nothing to do with the international arms industry and the warmongering agenda that lies behind it.</p>

          <p eId="para_480">We will not be supporting the motion. We do not agree with the strengthening of the links between the arms industry and national governments in Europe and we certainly do not think Ireland should have anything to do with any of them. In putting money onto any of these things, we have no idea where it will end up and what it will be used for. Obviously the whole focus of fortress Europe now is on preventing refugees getting into Europe rather than preventing others from bombing their homes, making refugees of them in the first place.</p>
          <p eId="para_481"> I am really disappointed that Fianna Fáil and Labour are prepared to support the motion. Perhaps I should not be shocked; maybe I am too naive for this place.</p>
          <p eId="para_482"> The head of the European Defence Agency, Jorge Domecq, said: "What is missing or really killing our defence effort is [that] we do it in an isolated and fragmented manner." If Ireland is going to sign up and be part of some sort of European army, whatever form it takes, God help us all. At the moment European countries are spending €200 billion on arms. This is all madness. This is driven primarily by the US where, if there was a decrease in worldwide war efforts today, huge numbers of jobs would be lost in America. Promoting the arms industry in America today is one of the prime reasons that we have such wars and destruction going on worldwide. More than 60 million people are displaced because of war. It is just nuts; it does not solve anything. People do not make bombs, fighter planes and guns to make peace; they do it to make war.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">We are involved in it. The fact that we still facilitate the war effort by allowing Shannon to be used is crazy. We should not be signing up to this and I do not believe the Irish people would agree to our signing up to this. There is currently a huge effort to increase the whole security arrangement in Europe. It feeds the arms industry. We keep dropping bombs on people in order to create people who cause problems like ISIS. It is just nonsense.</p>

          <p eId="para_484">Obviously, we understand that the SatCom project, which we are being asked to sign up to in this motion, has a variety of uses. It will involve a pay per use of the system for defence forces in the field. However, as part of that debate it would be wrong not to look at the EU satellite technology and to highlight the use of satellites and satellite data transmission as part of Europe's increasingly high-tech and militaristic defence of its borders against migrants. However, this is not benign technology. There is something deeply disturbing about the EU using its enormous power to train satellite surveillance on refugees from war-torn and impoverished states trying to cross its borders. It is chilling. It is not cheap either. The European Commission agreed in 2015 to provide €47 million to Frontex for satellite services dedicated to border surveillance. In total, more than €6 billion from the EU budget and a similar amount from national budgets is to be spent up to 2020 on border surveillance technology, including satellite surveillance. Data from all these technologies are fed into Frontex's situation room and the idea is that they would form real-time surveillance of Europe's borders to protect it against a non-existent threat from desperate people trying to get to Europe's shores. All of this is being done at the behest of the arms companies which provided this technology in the first place, the same arms companies which benefited and profited from the disruption and war in those countries which led to the people becoming refugees in the first place. While the close relationship between the arms industry and EU's governance structure is not new, we know, for example, that the defence industry was heavily involved with the European convention tasked with establishing the EU constitution and so on. All of this is set to get worse. The Government would be better off spending that money giving our soldiers decent pay and conditions, rather than wasting it on this offensive measure.</p>

        <speech by="#MattieMcGrath" eId="spk_207">
          <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath<recordedTime time="2017-11-30T14:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_485">I, too, am very concerned about this, having listened to the Minister of State's contribution and read his speech. It is proposed that we join up to these two projects just on a whim, as it were. This motion was slipped into the business today nicely when people are very busy with everything else. What would have happened if an election had been called? Would the Government have put down this motion for Tuesday night before we did anything else?</p>
          <p eId="para_486"> The motion relates to the joint procurement arrangement for EU SatCom Market and European Centre for Manual Neutralisation Capabilities, ECMAN, pursuant to section 2 of the Defence ( Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009. I am certainly not in favour of it. We have gone too far down the road of involvement with our European colleagues, who have not been much good to us in many other areas. If we were being attacked, I wonder would they come to our defence. They did not come much to our defence when we needed them in the banking crisis. Where were they? They could not be seen or found. They screwed us in the so-called bailout. They charged us 6% interest for it, while the IMF was charging us 3% interest for its funds. That shows us where our friends were.</p>
          <p eId="para_487"> However, this is too serious a matter. It would befit the Minister of State better if he were to go out today and meet the soldiers and their wives who are outside the gates of this House - I hope he met them - and take note of the ridiculous and shameful way our soldiers are being treated. They are being paid less than the minimum wage and expected to work 24-hour shifts, with €20 of a stipend to cover a 24-hour shift, but it would cost more than that to get a taxi to or from work. These are proud men with 40 years service. Their families, including fathers, sons, daughters, uncles and cousins, are involved in highlighting this issue. They have served in many countries with the United Nations, but not in this slimy slithery way in which we are getting involved in these projects and putting them in danger in the name of so-called protecting our borders.</p>
          <p eId="para_488"> We have not had one proper debate in this House on the Syrian crisis, on the Iraq crisis or all the other crises. I tried several times to have such a debate. Deputies Noel Grealish, Kevin O'Keeffe and myself were allowed raised a Topical Issue on it, thanks to the Ceann Comhairle, on Holy Thursday evening, a very appropriate evening. No Government time was provided for it. We had no hope of securing a debate on the persecution of the Christians in the Middle East and minority Muslim sects. I was talking earlier to Deputies Wallace and Daly about their visit to Syria and perhaps we should all go and see what is going on there. I went to Lebanon. We can see what is happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_489"> We are respected all over the world for our neutrality but now we are being sucked into this vast industry. Some €200 million being spent on planes and all war missiles and €6 billion on protecting our borders. I do not know what will happen to our own Border between the North and the South. I got some hope today from a senior civil servant at the European committee when he said that things were looking more positive. We should mind our own business and let the people over there mind theirs. We should not be hanging on and giving them the stamp of approval that we would pony-up and send our soldiers out there. We should equip the ones at home and give them enough money to feed themselves so that they would not have to be living on family income supplement. They should be shown respect, instead of putting them into areas, and not knowing where they are going or what they are doing, or what we as a people are being sucked into without the people being consulted. This started off with the Lisbon treaty, followed by the Nice treaty, in respect of which the then Government went back to the people a second time to get it through. The Minister of State was not part of that Government, but others were.</p>
          <p eId="para_490"> I certainly am not going to take a lecture from Deputy Lisa Chambers with respect to her saying that she is disgusted with us not supporting this motion. She should support the soldiers at home as well. That would be more important than what she was criticising.</p>

They have helped out when we have had flooding and in times of emergencies. The Government should support and respect them, rather than getting involved in business that is none of our business. It should keep out of it.</p>

        <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" eId="spk_222">
          <from>Deputy Eamon Ryan<recordedTime time="2017-11-30T14:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_506">I met the partners of people in the Defence Forces outside the gates of this House today and yet again I am hearing the same story, that our Defence Forces are at point of real crisis under the Minister of State's watch. That extends from officer level down to private level. We are all rightly proud of our Defence Forces, the work that 790 or so of them are doing in overseas missions and the work they have done in past. The way they have represented this country has been a huge service and brought great credit to this country, but they are being let down currently by the Government in how they are being managed. The response to that should not be what we are seeing here and what we have seen with the recent Government decision, as I understand it, to join PESCO, which is for us to go all in in terms of development as a key member of a new armaments-arranged combined European army development. We bring real strength to Europe with our tradition of neutrality and peace keeping and our tradition of scepticism and outright opposition to some of the military adventurism that we have seen from European neighbours in recent years and down through the years. We will not be able to support this proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_507"> If the Minister of State is responding at the end of the debate, perhaps he will be able to answer another question I would like to ask. Why are we debating this matter in advance of a debate on the Government's decision that Ireland should join PESCO? Surely the Government's decision to go in this direction is strategically broader and of more historical significance than the decision to participate in EDA projects. By contrast, the Danish Government is maintaining its position that a country can be a full member of the EU without necessarily having to buy into this very real level of security co-operation and support for defence armaments industries. The EU is very upfront and clear about what it is seeking to do. An additional €500 million will have to be provided for armaments supports in 2019 and 2020 and €1.5 billion will have to be provided each year from 2021. I presume there will be an ongoing ramping up from there on. It was a mistake not to debate the Government's strategic decision on PESCO in advance of debating these operational investments. Why is the decision not on the agenda for next week? Surely we have to do it before 11 December, when, I understand, PESCO will be signed off at the European Council. Why are we not debating that? A date has not even been set for it to be debated next week. We have to debate it in advance of 11 December. When we have that debate, and the same point is raised here, the Green Party will stand for Ireland taking a strategic decision to maintain a proud and strong EU that is proud of its tradition of bringing peace to Europe in a way that did not exist for generations prior to its establishment. We cannot develop a Europe which is at peace with itself, but at war near its borders with neighbouring countries in a way that undermines the whole peace project aspect of the EU, which I like.</p>
          <p eId="para_508"> Deputies have mentioned member states' recent activities in Libya, which have devastated the region, as an example of what results from investment in armaments technology. I once heard someone referring to the kinetic power of munitions and military force. We bring the power of intelligence to peacekeeping and how it works. One can have all the satellites in the world. I understand that when Irish soldiers went to Liberia, where they did an incredible job as part of an incredible mission, they shared a computer with the people of a nearby village. That, more than anything else, helped to swing the local population over to them, thereby enabling them to carry out their peace mission. I was proud to be in government when we supported the difficult mission in Chad. It was difficult to get equipment and helicopters to Chad. As I understand it, the best thing we did there revolved around our decision not to build a big fortification. We did not drive our trucks through local villages in the middle of the wet season, thereby destroying the roads used by local farmers. That marks the intelligence of the personnel we are proud to have serving in our armed forces.</p>
          <p eId="para_509"> We bring these skills and strengths to Europe. I do not think it is necessary to buy into the big new satellite technology that allows others to look down from space and press a button from a military drone to kill people who do not know what is coming until they have been zapped. Lord knows what their surviving relations will do against the EU for ever and a day. That is not the way Europe needs to go. I want to support our Army. I would fund our Army. It needs funding. We should invest not in armaments but in human intelligence. We should start by investing in the soldiers who are increasingly unhappy with the way the Minister of State is running the Department of Defence.</p>

          <p eId="para_641">As a member of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, I formally move the motion which requests Dáil Éireann to authorise the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission to conduct a defence of legal proceedings taken against the Oireachtas. On Monday of this week proceedings were issued in the High Court, as set out in the text of the motion on today's Order Paper<b>. </b> The proceedings named, among other parties, the Oireachtas as one of the defendants in the case. Under the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Acts, the commission can, in legal proceedings initiated against Members of Dáil Éireann or Seanad Éireann as regards matters arising solely from the performance by Members of their parliamentary functions, authorise the conduct of a defence of legal proceedings on behalf of or for the benefit of Members. The Houses of Oireachtas Commission considered the proceedings and agreed to conduct a defence of the legal proceedings. Therefore, pursuant to section 42(f) of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Acts, I move the motion to request Dáil Éireann to authorise a defence of the legal proceedings.</p>

          <p eId="para_642">It is correct that the course of action outlined be taken. For anyone to contemplate taking a court action in this instance to force the Dáil agenda or delay or interfere with the right of the Taoiseach to seek the dissolution of the Dáil is a step too far. It is for this House to decide its business. It is for the Government to decide its business. We can make recommendations to and cajole, beg and implore a Government to take our issues on board, but to seek to dictate from outside the business of the Dáil for the sake of having an extra seat in a constituency is a step too far.</p>
          <p eId="para_643"> I am aware of the constitutional provision and the right of people to be represented, but it has to be operated within reason. The boundaries of a constituency can no more be changed on the day the census results are published than on the day the Constituency Commission reports. Perhaps a mechanism should be included in future electoral amendment legislation to ensure that when a boundary commissions is set up, its report will be adopted in law within three months, unless previously passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas. That is something we can consider, but it was not considered prior to the setting up of the boundary commission. For us to decide anything other than this and not to defend the Houses of the Oireachtas and our duty to set our own business in this House would be wrong. It is right that the House defend itself.</p>

          <p eId="para_644">Unlike the previous speaker, I will not try to determine what the decision will be of the High Court which constitutionally is independent. We should not be making decisions for it on the floor of the House. All Members of the House have to live by the Constitution. Bunreacht na hÉireann is the basic law to which we are all obliged to adhere. Article 16(2)(ii) is crystal clear. The courts will make a determination, but, in truth, the initiative taken by Joe Costello has had an effect in that the Business Committee has now tabled for debate the Boundary Commission Bill, all Stages of which are to be taken next Thursday. I commend Deputy Joe Costello-----</p>

          <p eId="para_652">-----except to say it appears that there is nothing that gets Members of this Chamber more excited than the issue of seats. They are more excited about it than the issues which concern the people. The matter has been resolved in that the boundary commission will be legislated for next week and the appropriate level of representation proportionate to the size of population will be established. I do not believe there is a particular need now for us to act and presume the proceedings will be withdrawn by Mr. Joe Costello on foot of this. While I understand the Houses of the Oireachtas will have to be formally represented, I am not in favour, without a substantial debate if the matter remains controversial, of assenting to a particular defence. It would have to be discussed properly, certainly by our group, as to whether we should defend the right of the House not to have people adequately represented or, for that matter, the other side of the argument. It is academic at this point.</p>

          <p eId="para_653">I am delighted that the Business Committee has taken this course of action as we have no choice but to defend the legal proceedings, although I vindicate the right of former Deputy Joe Costello or any citizen to take a case. The Government needed to be prodded and former Deputy Joe Costello prodded it well. The matter has been placed on the Order Paper for next week and will be discussed and debated and the Bill enacted. While the boundary commission will take some time to discuss the matter, the legislation should not be unduly delayed. Deputy Alan Kelly wrote to everybody in Tipperary claiming credit for the change in that county. He is mad to have a change made. He almost had heart failure last week on "Prime Time" over not getting his way; therefore, he will be saying, "Aye, aye, Sir," again when he gets going.</p>

          <p eId="para_655">There are two principles at stake, one of which concerns the right of the House to order its own business. I absolutely believe we should not invite the courts to get involved in that matter. The second principle concerns inequality in representation. In 2007 I was involved in a constitutional challenge on that issue as there were great variations in some constituencies. In ten constituencies there were very significant variations. In a Dáil that is very finely balanced it can matter in the choice of Government formed. I believe it will be a moot point, given that the legislation is to be passed before Christmas. I hope that means that this challenge will be withdrawn.</p>
          <p eId="para_656"> In the case Deputy Finian McGrath and I took in 2007 neither of our constituencies was going to be affected by the proposed change.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">Nor did we seek to contend that the election should not be held. The hearing happened during the election campaign. Mr. Justice Frank Clarke, the judge involved, said at the time that there was an obligation not only on the Government but also on the Oireachtas to set in train immediately the review of constituencies. He said the matter was of the utmost importance. We should learn some lessons in this regard, specifically that such a review must be done in a very timely way once the census of population has concluded. That is what we sought in 2007 and I think that is what has been happening since.</p>

          <from>Minister for Health (Deputy Simon Harris)<recordedTime time="2017-11-30T15:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_785">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_786"> The Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2017 was published on 17 November and concluded its passage through the Seanad last week. I welcome the broad support in that House for the core principle of community rating which is a long-established aspect of Government policy on the health insurance market. This short Bill comprises seven sections dealing with the specific issue of health insurance, particularly the risk equalisation scheme which supports the system of community-rated health insurance. Risk equalisation means that everyone pays the same price for the same product, irrespective of age, gender or health status. In other words, older and sicker people pay the same price as younger and healthier people.</p>
          <p eId="para_787"> In a community-rated market like ours the risks are shared across the market as a whole, making insurance more affordable for less healthy and older people than it might otherwise be. In risk-rated markets, on the other hand, the premium charged is based on the insurer's estimate of each person's risk, taking into account relevant factors such as age and existing medical conditions. Under this model, healthier people pay low premiums, while sicker people pay high premiums. Moreover, under a risk-rated system, the premium for someone who has held health insurance for many years will rise if his or her health deteriorates.</p>
          <p eId="para_788"> The Health Insurance Act 1994 requires all insurers to apply community rating. However, older and sicker customers are not shared equally across the Irish insurance market because of the relatively recent arrival of competition.</p>
          <p eId="para_789">Community rating is supported by a risk equalisation scheme, where the cost of insuring older and less healthy people is spread across the market through the imposition of a stamp duty levy on every health insurance contract issued. Levies are paid into a fund, out of which risk equalisation credits are paid to insurers in order to reduce some of the additional costs they incur when insuring older, less healthy members. The scheme does not take money from the market, rather it distributes it to subsidise the health insurance costs of older, less healthy people. The aim of risk equalisation is to look at the market as a whole, and to distribute fairly the differences that arise in insurers’ costs due to the differing health status of the insured population as a whole. This is an important point because we often hear insurance companies using this to suggest that somehow or other it takes money from the market; the scheme does not do that at all. It tries to ensure equity and fairness, which I believe is reflected by a societal belief that is held across the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_790"> The number of people who currently hold private health insurance is more than 2.1 million, with three commercial insurers operating within the market. There is, however, a clear disparity in the membership profile and thus the associated costs being incurred across the various commercial insurers. Community-rated health insurance systems across the world use risk equalisation to share some of the higher costs of older and sicker patients across the whole market. The US, Australia, Germany and the Netherlands are just a few examples of other countries that use risk equalisation to support community-rated health insurance. The overall goal is to channel competition in the health insurance market in a way that benefits everyone who wishes to purchase private health insurance. The benefits of our system of community rating can best be seen as supporting the market as a whole and ensuring that, through the provision of risk equalisation credits for older customers, they can be helped and supported to purchase health insurance at a more affordable price if that is their wish.</p>
          <p eId="para_791"> Legislation is needed each year to update the amounts of credits paid to insurers under the risk equalisation scheme and the amounts of stamp duty levied on health insurance contracts to fund the credits. As part of the process, the Health Insurance Authority carries out an evaluation of the market and recommends the level of credits that should apply next year, taking into account the changing demographic profile of those insured and market developments including price and product developments. I have considered and accepted the recent recommendations made by the authority for the rates next year. The first is a general decrease in the amount of risk equalisation credits payable in respect of those aged over 65 years, based on age, gender and level of cover. The second is the stamp duty to remain unchanged in respect of advanced contracts at €444 per adult and €148 per child, and a reduction of the stamp duty in respect of non-advanced contracts to €177 per adult and €59 per child. In general, insurers will receive lower levels of risk equalisation credits next year. The provision of lower credits is possible as there has been a reduction in the market average claims cost per insured person in the previous 12 months. Given that the scheme is designed to be self-financing, with the total amount of credits provided matching the stamp duties raised, the main stamp duty levy on health insurance products remains unchanged next year. In addition, the stamp duty for non-advanced contracts is being reduced by 20%.</p>
          <p eId="para_792"> I am mindful that the risk equalisation rates need to support the sometimes competing aims set out in the legislation and increase the scheme's effectiveness, without substantially increasing stamp duty levels. I am pleased, therefore, that this year it has been possible to maintain the main stamp duty at the existing level. In addition, I believe the revised rates strike the right balance by ensuring that the scheme continues to be as effective as possible and, at the same time, remains robust, transparent, and promotes fair and open competition in the market.</p>
          <p eId="para_793"> The risk equalisation system currently allows for a small measure of compensation for health status through a payment of €90 for each overnight stay in a hospital and €30 per day case admission. I believe the support for insuring less healthy consumers should be increased and, therefore, small increases are also proposed to the existing level of hospital utilisation credits provided to insurers under the scheme, increasing to €100 per night for overnight stays and to €50 for day case admissions. These utilisation credits are a proxy for health status and will provide additional support in respect of less healthy people. This change results in a higher proportion of credits being directed to less healthy people than to older people. This is a step towards improving the health status element of the scheme within the boundaries of the current risk equalisation scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_794"> As a necessary support to community rating, I am committed to making the risk equalisation scheme as effective as possible in a way that promotes fair and open competition. While the changes to the credits will help to maintain levels of support for community rating, further improvements to the scheme are also planned. The scheme is a state aid and requires approval from the EU, with the current scheme approved to 2020. As part of ongoing development, it is planned to further enhance the risk equalisation scheme with the introduction of a more refined measure of health status. The most appropriate measure is based on diagnosis related group, DRG, activity data, which will allow better targeting of credits to all people who require higher levels of health care. I have asked officials to focus on progressing this, in conjunction with the Health Insurance Authority, in the months ahead. A working group has been established to inform the private hospital data collection aspect of this process and any implications arising. Refining the health status measure using DRG data will further reduce the incentive for insurers to attract low-risk people and avoid high-risk people.</p>
          <p eId="para_795"> The Bill makes a number of changes to the lifetime community rating, LCR, scheme in operation in the health insurance market. This scheme was introduced in 2015 to encourage people to take out insurance at younger ages. This Bill provides the basis for these amendments to LCR. Following enactment, I will make a regulation next year, which will set out the specific details of the changes and further enhance the operation of the lifetime community rating scheme. Since its introduction, LCR has had a positive impact with an increase of more than 150,000 persons holding health insurance between January 2015 and January 2017.</p>
          <p eId="para_796"> Earlier this year, the independent Health Insurance Authority reviewed the operation of the LCR scheme and made a number of recommendations. The changes being made now are to ensure the continued smooth operation of the scheme in a fair and balanced manner. Under the existing scheme, people holding health insurance who leave the country to go abroad for work or other reasons may incur loadings on their return. The main changes included as part of this Bill mean that people will be able to work, travel or live abroad and will not incur loadings on their return. This change is being made because the main objective of the LCR scheme is to encourage people to take out health insurance at younger ages, rather than penalising people who have spent periods of time outside the country. People will also be permitted to have breaks in insurance cover of at least six months while living in the country, without incurring loadings on resumption of cover. This will be based on having private health insurance for at least three years prior to taking a break in cover. The current LCR scheme provides for breaks in insurance cover for periods of unemployment, to recognise circumstances where individuals were forced to cancel their health insurance. The current legislation, however, does not provide any allowance for breaks in cover for reasons other than unemployment - for example, individuals who are involved in the full-time care of a dependent relative - so I am broadening the approach to provide for such circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_797"> In addition, a change is being made to take account of time served working in the Permanent Defence Force and as a staff member of the European Union working in this country to ensure that loadings are not unfairly incurred when these groups seek to purchase health insurance with an Irish provider. I am also ensuring that loadings are payable for ten years only, rather than for life as is currently the case. This amendment is being made to prevent circumstances arising where the application of loadings is of such magnitude and duration as to act as a disincentive for people taking out health insurance. Taken together, the changes being made to the operation of lifetime community rating will ensure that the scheme involves a fairer and more reasonable approach to loadings on health insurance premiums than has been the situation to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_798"> I will now outline the specific sections of the Bill. Section 1 defines the principal Act as the Health Insurance Act 1994. Section 2 amends section 7(a) of the principal Act to expand the Minister's regulation-making powers in relation to the operation of the scheme. This section also provides that, where increases in unadjusted net premiums apply, such increases are payable for ten years only.</p>
          <p eId="para_799"> Section 3 amends section 11(c) of the principal Act to provide for 1 April 2018 as the effective date for revised credits to be payable from the risk equalisation fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_800"> Section 4 amends Schedule 3 to the principal Act to provide for the revised amounts payable from the risk equalisation fund in respect of the hospital utilisation credit for health insurance contracts renewed or effected from 1 April 2018. Schedule 3 contains revised amounts for the provision of inpatient services on an overnight basis and for the provision of inpatient services on a day case basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_801"> Section 5 replaces table 2 in Schedule 4 to the principal Act with effect from 1 April 2018 whereby the applicable risk equalisation credits payable from the risk equalisation fund in respect of certain classes of insured persons are revised.</p>
          <p eId="para_802"> Section 6 amends section 125(a) of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 to specify the applicable stamp duty rates for 1 January 2018 to 31 March 2018 and for 1 April 2018 onwards.</p>
          <p eId="para_803"> Section 7 provides for the Short Title, commencement, collective citation and construction of the Bill. This annual legislation for credits and levies under the risk equalisation scheme also provides an opportunity to reflect on the role of private health insurance within the health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_804"> One of the first priorities I identified was the need for a long-term consensus on the direction of health policy in Ireland. In this regard, I supported the establishment and continued work of the all-party Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Future of Healthcare. I am committed to working with Members of the Oireachtas and with Government colleagues to make tangible and sustainable improvements in our health services. I believe that the Sláintecare report now provides a framework and a direction of travel in which to do this.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">There is an unprecedented level of consensus and support for the vision and strategic direction outlined in the report that I am determined to harness to work with colleagues across the political spectrum in moving forward with the reform agenda. The Government has given its approval to move ahead with the establishment of a Sláintecare programme office in my Department. The office has been tasked with implementing a programme of reform, as agreed by the Government, arising from the Sláintecare report. The office will be led by a senior programme executive with a strong track record in implementing reform. The recruitment process to fill this position is under way and being managed by the Public Appointments Service. It is essential that we be positioned to attract candidates of calibre to lead what will be a considerable reform programme. An extensive executive search is being undertaken as an important step in the recruitment process.</p>
          <p eId="para_806"> The majority of additional funding for new health initiatives in budget 2018 has been targeted at areas identified in the Sláintecare report. They include a new primary care fund, additional home care and transitional care beds, a reduction in medicine and prescription charges and targeted funding for waiting list reductions. Further to this, I recently announced the following steps to drive the reform agenda: an impact study of private care in public hospitals chaired by Dr. Dónal de Buitléir which is to report next summer; a public consultation process on the future alignment of hospital groups and community health organisations which will be launched in the coming days and the establishment of a board to oversee the performance of the HSE. I am committed to bringing to the Government before the end of the year a detailed response to the Sláintecare report and a draft programme of reform. It is vital that we do not waste this opportunity for change and real improvement in health services. </p>
          <p eId="para_807"> In addition to Sláintecare, work on the health service capacity review is progressing within the Department. The review will be more comprehensive than any previous capacity review because it is not just looking at the acute sector but also at aspects of primary and social care capacity. I expect to receive the final report on the capacity review before the end of the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_808"> Taken together, the Sláintecare report and the capacity review of the Government's ten-year capital plan - particularly the latter - present all of us with a great opportunity to define a clear direction of travel for reform. The current and potential role of private health insurance, both as a source of funding for the health service and as a driver of the model of care people receive, will also be considered as part of ongoing work in this area. In the meantime, by revising the credits and stamp duties required next year, we can continue to provide the necessary support to ensure health insurance costs are shared across the insured population. Unlike previous years when the Bill has been brought before the House, 2018 will see stamp duty levels remain the same or, in some cases, decrease for everybody with or who is taking out a health insurance policy. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <from>Deputy Billy Kelleher<recordedTime time="2017-11-30T16:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_809">I thank the Minister for outlining the detail of the Bill. At this stage it is an annual event that we have to change the legislation before the end of the year to address the proposals outlined by the Minister. Fianna Fáil will be supporting the Bill which is in keeping with the ethos of the party and its view on lifetime community rating and risk equalisation, of which we have been in favour for many years, and there have been conversions along the road. The Government has converted to our view, which we welcome. If we can get to a situation where the vast majority of parties represented within the Parliament have a coherent vision for the health service, it will mean that we will be travelling in the same direction, no matter who is sitting in the Minister's seat. For too long, the health service has been without a clear and coherent plan from one Government to the next. This has done untold damage in the provision of health care services. That is not a political point but an observation. The Sláintecare report is the platform from which to make progress in that regard as there is broad political support for it and will be in the years ahead, regardless of where or even whether individual Members sit in the Chamber. I expect the same approach to be adopted by other political parties. That will give us a chance to invest in the public health system to ensure there will be access for all when needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_810"> There have been times in the private health insurance market when changing policies in the context of universal health insurance have undermined people's willingness to take out health insurance. They were unwilling to take it out in the years which it was believed would proceed the implementation of a policy which never actually happened. The downturn in the economy, the pressure on families, a reduction in incomes and the threat of compulsory health insurance meant people did not take out health insurance because they thought they would be forced to take it out at some stage in the context of universal health insurance system. There is no doubt that that undermined the health insurance market. However, there has been a recovery which we must acknowledge and welcome. The more people who take out private health insurance, the greater the extent to which the burden is lightened on the industry. That means that older people will not have to pay as much for health care.</p>
          <p eId="para_811"> Risk equalisation is to be welcomed and should be supported. Intergenerational solidarity transfers the burden from those who most need health care to a broader base of the population which in itself means that the health insurance market can survive and thrive. Lifetime community rating is critically important and something for which we have called for a number of years. It is welcome that it has been introduced and is having a very positive effect on the health insurance market. It encourages young people to take out health insurance or at least to take it out at an earlier stage in life than otherwise would be the case in the absence of incentives. They might not take it out while they are young and healthy; rather, they might wait for a number of years and take it out just before entering a certain age cohort, which undermines the concept of having an insurance fund because it means that they will take more from it than they will put into it.</p>
          <p eId="para_812"> When we talk about health insurance, we must also talk about Sláintecare, the policy direction in which we are travelling and, equally, what is happening at the heart of the public health system with reference to private practice in public hospitals. The "Prime Time" programme left a sour taste in the mouths of many. There are now a number of well paid professionals who are in breach of their contractual, ethical and moral obligations by spending more hours in private practice than they are entitled to do under their contracts. This is a matter which must be addressed very quickly, regardless of our direction of travel in the context of the Sláintecare report. The Minister referred to the matter when it was raised at the joint committee last week and agreed that we would ensure contracts were adhered to. I asked at the time - I hope the Minister can consider this - whether the issue was related to the Department of Health or the HSE or whether there was a need for an independent outside audit assessment of the contracts. There is a difficulty for hospital managers because of the incentives created by stretched budgets. While there is nothing in writing, there seems to be an incentive, a policy direction or an instruction from somewhere within the Department of Health or the HSE to engage in as much private practice as possible in the public health system.</p>
          <p eId="para_813"> When the redesignation legislation passed through the Houses to ensure all public beds would be available for patients with private health insurance, I said it would automatically incentivise hospitals to fill beds with private patients. That was completely obvious and it is what has happened. The question is whether it is happening because it is being driven by consultants who want to push as many of their private patients through the system as possible or if it is being done to address budgetary deficits by hospitals which want to undertake private work for which they can charge insurance companies. It is something at which we really have to look. That the public health system subsidises consultants to do additional work over and above what they are obliged to do, while public patients cannot access treatment or diagnostics, leaves a sour taste in the mouths of many. I urge the Minister to look at it in detail quickly. The perverse incentives created by the 2014 legislation were bound to encourage this activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_814"> The Minister has outlined the Bill in detail. I do not need to need to go through all of it again as we enact this legislation every year. However, I note that there are a few additions which we welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_815">For example, we welcome the ten-year cap.</p>
          <p eId="para_816"> There will be huge challenges in the provision of health care in the coming years. That fact is camouflaged at present because of the demographic of the population. We have a large number of young people but the balance will tip very quickly. The recent ESRI report should set off alarm bells for policymakers and we have to start addressing capacity issues very quickly. It will take time to build up capacity because it takes a lot of manpower, training programmes and advance planning. We do not seem to plan our health care provision. Instead, we react instead to one crisis or another. When the capacity review is published at the end of the year, using ESRI projections up to 2030, we will have a template for what is required. In addition, there is the Sláintecare report, which will set out the policy direction on which we have to travel.</p>
          <p eId="para_817"> We cannot pretend that we will get away without investing and we have to start the process now. Investment is required in the shape of bricks and mortar, in order to expand the public hospital system, and in health professionals. There is an expansion of GP training but we are light years behind what we will require in the years ahead in respect of secondary and allied health care professionals. If we are to shift the focus from the hospital-centric system we have to primary and community care, we need to enhance the capacity in terms of personnel and professionals in those settings. Moving chronic illness and disease to those settings will require a lot of nurse specialists and we will need increased training programmes to prepare for it. This is the right way to go and it has been confirmed by the Sláintecare report.</p>
          <p eId="para_818"> I urge all Deputies to read the Sláintecare report. A great deal of work was put into it and there were some exceptional presentations made to the committee. It is very positive that we were able to get consensus from all political parties represented on the committee to point our health services in a particular direction. It has to be accepted, however, by the Government and those which succeed it, that this will require investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_819"> At present, half the population have private health insurance and there are few waiting lists for those people. Of those who do not have health insurance, 687,000 are on some form of a waiting list. The 687,000 people on waiting lists come out of a population of 2.3 million, therefore, and not out of a population of 4.6 million. This shows that the health services are teetering on the edge of collapse in terms of their ability to deliver care in a timely manner. If it was not for the private health system being able to cater for those with insurance, the public health system would have collapsed long ago. Our public health system is dependent on a very active private health insurance market which encourages people to take out insurance or, indeed, forces them to do so out of fear that they will not be treated in the public health system. Many take out insurance for fear they will not get things such as diagnostics in the public health system. It is not because they want a nice room, menus or flat-screen televisions. Citizens want timely access to quality diagnostics and care but our public system cannot give that to them at present. People are leaving west Cork on buses heading for Belfast for cataract operations because ophthalmic services are very poor there and in certain other parts of the country. The situation would be far worse were it not for people feeling forced, out of fear, to take out private health insurance. A constituent of mine aged 90 was waiting for a cataract operation but he was told it could take three years. With some interventions and representations, the matter was subsequently addressed but a person aged 90 does not that have that much time. His wife also needed a cataract operation so they were dependent on each other. It was difficult to witness the hardship caused to that couple because they could no longer do the things they always did, such as walk the road, go to the shop or go to mass. They had to rely on neighbours and friends to take them places. We were hoping they would be able to get their operations within a year but were told it would take three.</p>
          <p eId="para_820"> If the Minister goes to the print room of these Houses, he would see that we are all sending leaflets out advising people how to get treatment abroad under the EU cross-border treatment directive or the treatment abroad scheme. That is an admission of failure on our part.</p>
          <p eId="para_821"> We welcome the contents of the Bill and the fact that there is now a vibrant health insurance market but we have to be conscious that people only have a certain amount of cover. We need to ensure that there is competition in the market place and that health insurance costs do not escalate again. There is health inflation and the cost of treatment is continually rising, while new technologies and advances in medicine, in implements and in devices such implants create additional costs that are borne by the people with private health insurance or those in the public health system who are on waiting lists. I welcome the Bill and hope it has a positive effect on attracting people into private health insurance. We should be under no illusions, however. Most people take out private health insurance not for the flat-screen television or the menu but because they fear the public system.</p>

        <speech by="#LouiseOReilly" eId="spk_241">
          <from>Deputy Louise O'Reilly<recordedTime time="2017-11-30T16:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_822">It is fair to say that the political differences between the Minister and me are most acute when it comes to health and, in particular, the issue of private versus public health care. We see legislation of this sort every year and with each year we are reminded of the body of work that progressive parties have ahead of them to address the imbalance in health care and remove private health care from our public hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_823"> The question of health insurance is a fraught one. On the one hand, it facilitates the skipping of queues and the bypassing of waiting lists. On the other, it represents a large number of people who go without other things in order to have health insurance because they are afraid that, without it, they will end up waiting 24 months for a colonoscopy or some other procedure. The health insurance market exists because the Government is a champion of it and because people are afraid of having to enter the public system and being left to wait for months or years for treatment. Nowhere would this be more starkly illustrated than if we took a trip to the print room.</p>
          <p eId="para_824">It is not exactly a massive vote of confidence in the health policies being pursued by the Government, with the support of Fianna Fáil, when we see the Minister's own colleagues printing leaflets advertising to their constituents the facility to leave this jurisdiction and go abroad to get treatment. If that is not a vote of no confidence in the health policy of the Government, I really do not know what is.</p>
          <p eId="para_825"> We find ourselves where we are because successive Governments have driven as a matter of policy the privatisation and commodification of our health service. We have to ask whether this is the best way to run the health service. Is the manner of health insurance in this country fair given that a lot of cover is driven by fear and it constitutes an extra burden to be carried by citizens, and given how much is already contributed to the health budget by taxpayers? Is this a case of citizens carrying the can for the Government's failure to enforce and police the 12.5% corporation tax and other areas of non-income-based taxes?</p>
          <p eId="para_826"> The Oireachtas deals with a Bill such as this every year. It is about taking away the risk from insurance companies to equalise risk for certain policyholders - if only the Government was as quick to intervene in the market in other areas. While we will allow the passage of the Bill in order that older people and others are protected, we do so with serious reservations about a health service that buckles under the weight of demand, and we point out that fear drives people to take out private health insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_827"> At present, the health care system is funded primarily through general taxation, accounting for 69%, with out of pocket payments making up 15.4%. Private health insurance only contributes 12.7% to the health care system, but almost 46% of the population has private health insurance. This is the case because successive Governments have failed to provide universal health care free at the point of delivery based on need and not ability to pay. Insurance companies trade fear for profit in the health market, and we have those in here who continue to cheerlead for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_828"> With regard to the Bill, it is important to see that lifetime community rating rules will exempt members of the Permanent Defence Force. Other new proposed changes with respect to no loading applying to people working abroad are also important, given that many people may be out of the country for a period and then return. This has particularly been the case of many young people who were forced to leave during the financial crash and subsequent austerity years.</p>
          <p eId="para_829"> Under close scrutiny, the Bill reveals the existing disparity between the health of men and women, and this cannot be ignored. If we look at the risk equalisation for men compared to women in the amendment to Schedule 4 of the principal Act contained in the Bill, we can see there is a higher risk rate for females, which is an indication that in older years there are greater health risks for me and all women. This is something which needs to be looked at from a health perspective and not from this insurance market risk equalisation perspective.</p>
          <p eId="para_830"> We have this debate yearly because of the necessity to intervene in the health insurance market, but we should be having a debate in here every week, if not every day, about the privatisation of health care by means such as this and others. The commodification of health care has been one of the most damning elements of the neoliberal privatisation agenda. The push to turn people's health and well-being into a revenue stream is morally repugnant. Where a public health system sees illness and patients in need, the private sector sees money and opportunity. Such a situation is how we end up with the unrealistic stretched income targets being set for hospital groups to generate private income, which then put hospitals under severe pressure, compromising patient care and creating myriad problems for the equitable delivery of health care based on need. The fallout is that private patients are treated ahead of public patients in our public hospitals. Deputies and Senators from the parties who push these policies then act surprised when they see the outworkings of their policies showcased on "Prime Time" again and again.</p>
          <p eId="para_831"> We will allow the Bill to pass, but it is high time we had a debate and addressed the issues of private health insurance and private health care in our public system. A total of 46% of people in the State have private health insurance. A total of 34% are covered by medical cards. I am very proud to say I am member of the 20%. This is because I do not believe in private health insurance. I do not believe that privatisation has any place in a public health care system. I look forward to the day when the 20% become the majority, by virtue of the fact that the public health system provides for people who now feel they have to go to private health insurance to get decent quality health services.</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2017-11-30T16:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_832">Private health insurance is a fundamentally parasitical enterprise. It preys on the fears of people about the prospect of being ill and needing care and the inability of the public health system, for which they pay through their taxes, not being able to provide them with that care. This is a shameful enterprise that, week in week out, with wall-to-wall advertising on the radio, plays on those fears to profit from a fundamentally unequal health system, and from what is euphemistically known as the two-tier system. As I have said many times in the House, it just absolutely drives me round the twist listening to advertisements about going to the accident and emergency department at the Blackrock Clinic or to the Beacon Hospital if people can pay. If people cannot pay, they must line up on a trolley in St. James's Hospital for the rest of the day and maybe into tomorrow, or go to St. Vincent's hospital for hours and hours, or wait years for vital operations.</p>
          <p eId="para_833"> Incredibly, some people wait four years for cataract operations and people in chronic pain needing hip replacement wait two years. Children needing scoliosis operation wait months longer than they should have to, and in some cases wait up to two years. All the while, somebody is making money out of it. In fact, the worse the situation is in the public health system, the more there are waiting lists, and the longer those lists are, and the more accident and emergency units are overcrowded, the more these private health care operators stand to profit. It is really sick. I accept that in a sick, unfair, fundamentally unequal health system such as this, the Bill is a very moderate attempt to level an unequal playing field through risk equalisation and community rating. Of course, it is simultaneously propping up the whole market, as the Minister calls it. This is another thing that drives me mad. I do not know how many references the Minister made to the market for health.</p>

          <p eId="para_837">I fundamentally object to the health needs of humans being referred to as a market. Our State has an obligation to provide health care as a matter of human right to our citizens. There is an idea that a market has sprung up because we have been unable to do this, because we have underfunded our health service, inflicted savage cuts on it and slaughtered staff numbers and the budget and, consequently, have driven more and more people out of fear to take out private health insurance, in the hope they can skip a queue when they really need to. There should not be a queue, but if there is a queue, people out of fear and anxiety will seek to get up the queue when they are sick and vulnerable and need help. It is the failure of the political system to establish a national health system with cradle to grave health care of the highest quality as a matter of right for our citizens that has spawned this rotten profiteering parasitical two-tier system.</p>
          <p eId="para_838">We saw the extreme end of that with incredibly well-paid private consultants not even doing the hours they are supposed to do. In case anybody gets me wrong, I am aware that there are many decent consultants who would not do that. However, we create the conditions for that and we have the ultimate responsibility for the profiteering and self-serving, selfish behaviour of some well-paid consultants who want to make even more money. We have created those conditions through our chronic under-funding and under-resourcing of the public health system and our support of the parasitical private health insurance industry. There is no doubt about that.</p>
          <p eId="para_839"> Obviously, and correctly, I am not entitled to a medical card. At a time when health care is being rationed, it would be shameful if I were. However, I believe every citizen should have access to the cradle-to-grave health care that a national health system would provide. As a matter of principle I would not take out private health insurance. It is absolutely wrong that one could jump a queue by dint of one's income. I would never take out such health insurance. Contrast that to the behaviour of the Taoiseach when he was Minister for Health. He introduced an additional levy on people who did not take out private health insurance by the age of 35 years before a deadline of May 2015. He had posters and T-shirts that touted, advertised and threatened on behalf of the private health insurance industry, urging people to get private health insurance or they would pay. He said at the time: </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_840">As Minister for Health, I wanted to take a lead. I also wanted to avoid the levy ... I can honestly say that I feel a lot better having taken out health insurance again.</p>
          <p eId="para_841">What is the message there? It is that if one does not have private health insurance, one has something to worry about. He could afford to get it and he was relieved. What was he relieved about? He was relieved that he does not have to rely on the public health system.</p>
          <p eId="para_842"> Is it not absolutely shameful that the person who was in charge of the public health system said he was relieved he did not have to rely on that system because he got private health insurance? That is shocking. No Member of this House should have private health insurance. If we have it, we are saying that the system over which we preside cannot provide for citizens. People must take out private insurance if they can afford it. Huge numbers cannot. The fear tactics on that occasion worked. Some 150,000 additional people took out private health insurance after the scare tactics mounted by the then Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, in 2015. It was dragooning people into taking out private health insurance to the benefit of the private health insurance industry. What happened at the time was shocking.</p>
          <p eId="para_843"> Consider the profits these health insurance companies make and the extraordinary waste in advertising. The money is not going to health care but to advertisements that urge people to go to the companies' hospitals so they will not have to queue. That is all waste. It is money diverted from the front line of public health care. I do not know why the Minister is shaking his head. That is a fact.</p>

          <p eId="para_845">People are spending €2 billion on private health insurance. Would it not be far better if that money went into the public health system? It would go a hell of a long way towards sorting out the problems in that system. That is in addition to the €2.5 billion to €3 billion, or 18%, they fork out on out-of-pocket charges, such as accident and emergency charges, overnight stay charges, general practitioner charges and so forth.</p>
          <p eId="para_846"> I recall what the Government said when it tried to defend the savage cuts it imposed on the public health system during the austerity period. It boasted that we spend one of the highest proportions of GDP on health, forgetting that a huge proportion of this does not go to the public health system. Only 69% of the spend goes into the public budget when one strips out the out-of-pocket charges ordinary people must pay and the €2 billion spent on private health insurance. That money and a system of progressive taxation could be used to fund a state-of-the-art national health system so that when people need health care, they need not worry. The last thing people need to worry about when they need health care is whether they can afford health insurance premiums or, if they do not have insurance, the out-of-pocket charges they might have to pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_847"> The other issue with this Bill is that the industry report prepared for the Government has not been not published. Is it available to the public? Can we see it?</p>

I am glad I asked because I do not believe we should pass legislation without either seeing the report on which it is based or being certain that the levies and the distribution of credits are all being passed on. Is it guaranteed that they will all be passed on to where they should be in terms of equalising the cost of insurance and not into the back pockets of certain health insurance companies? Does the legislation ensure that is the case and that there is accountability for the disbursement of the levy credits?</p>
          <p eId="para_853"> That is an aside to my fundamental point. We will not oppose the Bill because it is trying to equalise a fundamentally unequal system. However, I object in the strongest terms to the fact that this Government has propped up the private health insurance industry, touted on its behalf and exacerbated people's fears and anxieties about having or not having private health insurance and also the concerns that arise from our abysmal failure to fund and resource the public health system properly, which is what should be resourced in order to ensure that there is genuine equality, not risk equalisation, in access to health care. All citizens deserve that as a right because they are human beings, not because they are players in the so-called market.</p>

          <p eId="para_854">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. Clearly, there is a huge crisis for the health insurance market and it is deepening by the day, if not by the hour. I first started thinking about health insurance when I got married in 1984. I started my family and established a business. When health insurance products first come onto the market, I welcome them with open arms. I do not dismiss those who cannot afford private health insurance but there is some comfort to be gained from having it.</p>
          <p eId="para_855"> This issue has been abused and hijacked over the years. There was a problem in the insurance industry due to spurious claims being made. I recall seeing a television advertisement by the insurance companies which described how a person named John, played by an actor, had an accident and decided to claim. The advertisement showed him putting his hand in everybody else's pocket. Many people have their hands in pockets with regard to the costs of the insurance industry. That is unacceptable. I recall being quite ill in hospital on one occasion. I received the best of care at Shanakiel Hospital, which has since closed, in Deputy Kelleher's city of Cork. On the morning I was due to leave, a little envelope was slipped under my tea and toast. It contained a hefty bill in respect of the cost of a private ambulance to take me from one hospital to another.</p>
          <p eId="para_856">I could have walked from Shanakiel Hospital across to the regional hospital but I could not walk back because I was under anaesthetic. I could nearly have bought the ambulance for the amount I was charged. This is happening and it is being hijacked. I am aware that medical professionals are bound by the Hippocratic oath. I sympathise with medical staff in the hospitals, for example, those involved in the tragic case of Savita Halappanavar. I know a full investigation into this case is ongoing. Accidents will and do happen. The private costs are spiralling out of control and the charges are being heaped on. I profoundly object to people who might be in difficult situations or who might be very ill entering accident and emergency departments and having forms shoved in front of them and being asked to sign in order to show that they are private patients. The Minister looks perplexed but he knows this is happening all the time.</p>

          <p eId="para_858">Is it? Well it is happening all the time in the hospital in Clonmel and in other hospitals. A patient might then be on a trolley for two or three nights and be charged the price of a bloody top-class hotel room when they do not even have a bed. This practice is widespread - certainly in Tipperary. I would not say that unless it was the case. What is happening is wrong. I heard a solicitor on the radio advising people not to sign the forms. Hospital staff should not ask sick people to sign forms because they might not have 100% of their faculties if they are very ill. This is happening and it is distasteful. The HSE is getting the funds through charging private companies but the patients might never get hospital beds. It is another way of operating in the HSE which is literally robbing the system and that is not good enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_859"> While I have dealt with many consultants and while I have the highest respect for them, there was a recent exposé involving hospital consultants. I go back to Barry Desmond's time as Minister, which was long ago when I was a young man. He was fighting so that the consultants would be sorted out and could not use public hospital facilities to treat private patients. That was a long time ago. I think Barry Desmond is still alive; I am not sure. I wish him well if he is alive. He fought that battle but he did not win it. The problem was not tackled and it still obtains. A vet or a dentist must set up his or her own laboratory and deal with patients in his or her own way. Why should consultants use public hospital facilities to treat private patients? It should not be happening, full stop. It will go against the consultants but fair play is fine play as far as I am concerned. Are consultants supposed to work 30 hours per week under their contract? I am not sure about the figures. I compliment RTÉ on the exposé to which I refer. What is happening is not acceptable. </p>
          <p eId="para_860"> The Health Insurance Act 1994 made provision for the establishment of the Health Insurance Authority, HIA, but the body was not brought into existence until 1 February 2001, which was much later. What is wrong with a system like that? Why did it take so long? The 1994 Act was amended by the Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2001 providing for, among other things, an enhanced role for the HIA, with more responsibility than was envisaged under the 1994 Act. I welcomed that. The HIA is funded by a levy imposed on private medical insurers but, like everything else, this was passed on to the punters. Premiums were to be independent of the State. The role of the HIA includes acting as a registrar of medical insurers and undertakings and vetting new market entrants. It is also involved in consumer protection and the provision of information. It also provides advice on matters of medical insurance to the Minister for Health. The HIA receives returns from medical insurers every six months and, on that basis, makes recommendations to the Minister regarding risk equalisation. Since people are asking the Minister questions, can I ask him how often he has met representatives from the HIA? Does he meet them regularly? Is the HIA doing its job? Is it like the rest of the quangos in that it is costing us money but does very little and we get very little value for money out of it?</p>
          <p eId="para_861"> This country is affected by a plethora of issues. We are all regulated but nobody is doing anything. Most of them are toothless, useless and fruitless. They get paid and get their perks and Mercs but are often very ineffective. This is true not only in health but across the board. I do not understand why insurers cannot see that these increases are creating an even bigger mess. The dropout rate in respect of health insurance is enormous, which is a worry. I meet poor old dears. I met one about two years ago who cancelled her insurance only about a week before she got sick. She had been paying it ever since it existed but just could not afford the increase and dropped out. When she needed it, she did not have it. There are many issues to be dealt with. I moved from VHI to Aviva but found that the goalposts kept changing. Now we find if we go for a procedure, we are covered for very little. We are covered to get in the door. The health insurance industry could be compared to the people on Grafton Street with billboards coaxing customers into their premises. However, once customers go in, some of them are fleeced. I am not saying that about premises on Grafton Street. We need to regulate this because health insurers are getting customers in and are chopping and changing and people do not know the extent of their cover. That is a fact. I do not know whether the Minister is shaking his head in disbelief or asking "What's he talking about?", but it is happening.</p>

          <p eId="para_863">It is regulated but my point is that the regulator - as is the case with most regulators - is useless. We have seen it in the insurance industry and in the context of energy prices. Look at the concrete industry. It is a cabal of the highest order and the regulator is doing nothing. All the smaller people are being forced out of business and gobbled up. We have regulators and legislation but both are ineffective. This is true across the board. We saw what happened with the banking regulator. The same illness has spread across to health, an area one would think would have a clean bill of health, but they are not being regulated. If they were, RTÉ would not have to go in and expose what is happening. I am surprised the Minister is not aware that people are asked to sign forms when they enter hospital. This happens all the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_864"> I mentioned what Barry Desmond tried to do 30 years ago. I was not in politics at the time but he was fighting this battle. Why is it taking for ever? Are they too powerful to fight? Consultants should have their own facilities to treat private patients. We can do it. Someone can go to the Mater Private Hospital and be in and out. It is streamlined from start to finish like any private hospital I have visited. "Conveyer belt" is the wrong term to use but it is efficient. When someone is called for an appointment, it is not done the way it is done in public hospitals where 100 people could have appointments for the same time. That is incompetence of the highest order and it causes stress and trauma, blocks up the place and is frustrating. One sees managers running up and down with flipcharts and they are managing chaos - because it is chaos. It should not be this way. Private hospitals in Kilkenny, Waterford and Galway can do it. They are efficient and patients get the treatment. They pay for it but they get it. If someone goes into the public hospital for treatment, he or she will not get it but he or she will be charged for it out of his or her medical insurance. It is difficult to understand what goes on. The nurses and other front-line staff are doing great work trying to do what they can but there is no throughput. Every Christmas, and it will happen this year as sure as it will get dark tonight, there will be bedlam in every hospital because hospital administration offices close down for nearly three weeks. The last week of work involves parties and celebrations. This is a fact. It will be bedlam. When we come back on 11 or 12 January, nobody will be called because nothing is going out. This happens every year. If we are honest, we know this happens. We cannot continue to allow it. One could not do that in any private company because one would be out of business by March if one just abandoned the place and left a skeleton staff. It happens, including in my local hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_865"> I heard a very disturbing report on my local radio station about a young man who lost his life in a hospital in Cork some years ago. The report in question related to the inquest into his death. His solicitor, Cian O'Carroll of Cian O'Carroll Solicitors in Cashel, spoke on the radio about this tragic case. The young man had visited the hospital with a violent headache and was sent home on three occasions. The hospital never carried out the proper procedures and did not follow protocol.</p>
          <p eId="para_866">The protocols are laid down but the hospital did not follow them. I want the Minister to investigate that because the family involved got no satisfaction at the coroner's court in Cork. The young man died in Cork.</p>

          <p eId="para_874">I am talking about health standards. What is the point in paying insurance if one is treated like that in hospital? Does the Acting Chairman not get it? Is it not connected? Let us be fair. If one pays health insurance, one expects it to be foolproof. I am not saying it happens every day but one person dying is one too many. It is appalling that the man in question was sent home without having a lumbar puncture performed, particularly when he had a violent headache and had scans and it did not show up. Apparently, in 10% of cases it does not show up. He saw ten junior doctors and one consultant during those visits to Clonmel. That is appalling. It will cost the State a fortune in a pay-out. He lost his life and his partner lost him. She has four kids and is expecting another child. He was a young man in full health and just got a violent headache.</p>
          <p eId="para_875"> If there are protocols, they must be followed. They are followed in factories. There are protocols for everything. It is more vital to have protocols followed in hospitals than anywhere else. They clearly were not followed in this instance. As already stated, I heard the solicitor interviewed. It was broadcast on Tipp FM this morning after 9 o'clock. I am familiar with the case and that is why I listened in. I was not expecting it; it just came on. The family are seeking a judicial review because the solicitor was not allowed ask questions in the coroner's court. The medical personnel were not allowed to answer. They were debriefed before the inquest on what happened so they would not talk about it. They were debriefed and told it was over, finished and done with. This is very serious. Consultants at South Tipperary General Hospital, including Dr. Paud O'Regan and Dr. Peter Murchan, work very hard. My late brother was a paediatrician at the same facility in Clonmel. There are many good outcomes but also a lot of bad ones. It is appalling to lose a young man like that. It is ironic that I happened to hear the interview on Tipp FM this morning. Everyone in the region has been working on these packages to try to get issues sorted out in the hospital. We are working to get extra beds and extra capacity.</p>
          <p eId="para_876"> The most important thing is insurance. There is a widespread practice when people are on trolleys in hospitals. They are glad to have gotten there by ambulance or car, they are on trolleys and there is someone running after them saying, "Will you sign this please?" It is totally unfair and wrong. It is morally and financially wrong. One might be half comatose and in agony; they are delighted to be in the premises and this is happening. There are administration staff sending out bills. There is funding allocated to hospitals every year based on turnover and the money they bring in. There are a lot of things wrong with that and it needs to be sorted out.</p>

          <p eId="para_877">I am happy to have the opportunity to speak on the Bill. I thank the Minister for signing off on the legislation for medicinal cannabis and I am delighted to hear that Vera Twomey and her daughter Ava will be returning home from Holland to Macroom for Christmas. I hope other sufferers will benefit from the medicinal cannabis in future and that unnecessary delays can be avoided.</p>
          <p eId="para_878"> I have spoken many times on the issues of health, health insurance and the two-tier system that exists in this country. In recent weeks, I have raised the cross-border health care directive and the ability of people in the Republic experiencing long delays in the health system to avail of medical procedures in the North or in other EU countries. This directive refunds patients who cannot afford insurance, meaning that hip operations, cataracts, and other procedures do not cost Irish patients a cent. However, because of the endless failings of the HSE and their waiting lists, many Irish patients have been forced to pay for private health insurance to get their operations completed urgently but they do not receive any compensation. As Deputy Kelleher stated, and he is completely right, it is an appalling situation for Ministers to be handing out leaflets telling people they can go for operations abroad. That is a failure of our system. It is disappointing that I have to point people who are in need of cataract, hip and knee operations towards Northern Ireland. It is a failure for me and for any Minister to advise people to travel to the North in order to have operations. A constituent recently contacted me in tears after hearing about the cross-border directive. The person had waited for years for a hip replacement on the HSE public waiting list but, due to the enormous levels of pain she experienced, she was forced to pay close to €15,000 to get the operation done under private health insurance. It was €15,000 she did not have to spare and she was heartbroken to learn she could have availed of it for free under the directive. This is another example of the two-tier system that operates in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_879"> Last week on "RTÉ Investigates" we saw how one poor lady was forced to sell her jewellery to have her procedures performed under private health insurance. That is not good enough. The biggest reason for the two-tier system is the incompetence of the HSE. There should not be a need for people to avail of private health care when we have a public system.</p>
          <p eId="para_880"> I welcome the Bill and am happy to support it because I believe the risk equalisation mechanism is very important to prevent ill or older people from paying huge premiums to health insurers. People should not feel forced into paying for private health insurance, which adds extra stress to their unfortunate health issues. There is a need for stricter regulations on private health insurance. Insurers are happy to put extras on bills for the simplest of reasons. They can totally exploit their customers and take advantage of the fact that they require urgent treatment and are in poor health. That is not good enough. As with the motor insurance industry, I favour the introduction of legislation to place stricter limits on the private health insurance sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_881"> On a semi-related matter, yesterday I met a group of parents and children, as many other Deputies did, who suffer from MPS. MPS is a rare genetic disorder and, Vimizin, the necessary medication for these patients, is not supported by the HSE and is currently only offered on a trial basis. Not even private health care can help these patients and I ask that the Minister approve funding for it as soon as possible. The drug is made in Cork but is not available for patients in Ireland. Pharmaceutical companies must take responsibility for their greed in the context of the prices they charge. We were able to help patients who needed Orkambi, so I plead with the Minister to do the same in this instance.</p>

          <p eId="para_882">This is the annual event at which we look at the 2013 permanent risk equalisation scheme and make the normal annual adjustments to elements of it. There are three provisions in this legislation that propose changes to the rates to come into effect in April 2018, to make related amendments to stamp duty legislation, to adjust the lifetime community rating system and to extend the Minister's powers. What the Minister is proposing to do is to tweak a very dysfunctional private insurance system relating to a very dysfunctional health system. In many ways, we are having the wrong debate. We are talking about a situation in which nearly half the population feel they have no choice but to take out very expensive private health insurance. That kind of two-tier system does not happen anywhere else. Many people who cannot afford private health insurance feel they have no choice but to pay for it because our public system is so weak. The standard plan B cover that many people take out costs something in the region of €1,500 per person. That is way beyond the reach of many people, especially the elderly, but they make sacrifices in a whole lot of other aspects of their lives in order to maintain private health insurance. They do so out of fear that if they are faced with serious medical conditions, they cannot depend on the public health system. This is an extraordinary indictment of our public health system. We are alone in Europe in this kind of thing. Every other European country has a reliable, dependable public health system whereby people feel that when they need care, they will be able to access it in a timely manner. In Ireland, 46% of people feel, mainly out of fear, that they have to fork out for huge premiums that are increasing year on year. In return for those expensive premiums, they get a very poor deal.</p>

            <p eId="para_884">The sad deaths of two men in less than 24 hours underline the scale of the challenge we face in housing. With their passing and their loss to their friends of families, it is not a time, obviously, for political point scoring. I express my condolences to those who have felt their loss.</p>
            <p eId="para_885"> It is, however, another call to action to get to grips with the housing crisis. Their passing represents a moral challenge to this House and to the Government. The stakes in this housing crisis could not be higher. It is an immense ethical and economic task. That challenge demands clear concerted action. A Housing First approach is the best mechanism to resolve long-term homelessness. Wraparound services that recognise and deal with the complex needs of people affected by homelessness is the only viable long-term solution. The Government must get bricks and mortar on the ground to deliver the houses that are badly needed to support such an approach.</p>
            <p eId="para_886"> A number of steps can be taken in the short term to alleviate the crisis that is scouring our cities and towns. Housing charities engaged on the streets in helping those affected have proposed a series of ideas to avoid the tragedies we have seen in the past few days. The Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, should get moving on addressing those ideas, such as out-of-hours response in local authorities, dedicated contact and a formal count of rough sleepers.</p>
            <p eId="para_887"> Ultimately we need to redouble our efforts to ensure the targets in Rebuilding Ireland are achieved. The repercussions of a lack of supply are felt most severely by those least able to bear it. The sad events of recent days must serve to underline how addressing supply is the key objective. The Government will ultimately be judged on that. I hope the Minister of State can set out what immediate steps he is taking on these issues.</p>

            <p eId="para_888">A number of weekends ago, the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, speaking on "The Week in Politics" said that the homelessness crisis would get worse before it got better. I do not think even he realised how prophetic his words would be. As Deputy Cowen said, we have had two more deaths of people forced to sleep rough as a result of homelessness. That is seven deaths in a matter of weeks. I also offer my deepest condolences to the families and friends of those who tragically - and unnecessarily in my view - lost their lives.</p>
            <p eId="para_889"> This comes in the context of a significant increase in the number of rough sleepers - 184 according to the last count. As 50 people availed of the night café on that same night, obviously the number is significantly higher. We also have the highest recorded number of people in emergency accommodation at 8,000, including 3,000 children. As we know, many of those children spend several years in emergency accommodation before getting a permanent home. This does not include adults and children in domestic violence refuges and step-down accommodation. It does not include people given leave to remain who are trapped in direct provision and using direct provision as emergency accommodation or that even wider category of people who have no home of their own, but are sofa-surfing and in imminent risk of homelessness.</p>
            <p eId="para_890"> As I have said a number of times previously, nobody chooses to sleep rough. People sleep rough because of the absence of emergency accommodation or appropriate, safe and secure accommodation. I understand that the 58-year-old man who tragically died in the Minister's constituency was on a priority list for the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive for Housing First tenancy. The problem was that the executive did not have any properties to offer him. At the same time 1,800 turnkey projects have been offered to the Government for purchase in the last 12 months. Less than 600 are being pursued and even fewer have been purchased or tenanted.</p>
            <p eId="para_891"> I fully agree with Deputy Cowen that this is not a matter of party politics. However, I appeal to the Minister to review that list of 1,800 turnkey projects and ensure that as many of them as possible are purchased by the State as soon as possible to ensure that the people in emergency housing need or who are being forced to sleep rough are given the opportunity to have a safe and secure home in which to live. I ask the Minister to come back to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government with that full list of 1,800 properties that the housing agency and others have and tell us what is happening with them - what properties will be bought and when they will be tenanted - so that no more people end up dying on our streets as a result of rough sleeping and the homelessness crisis.</p>

            <p eId="para_892">I join my colleagues in expressing sorrow, sympathy and support for families and friends of the two individuals who died in recent days. For those of us from the constituencies where the deaths happened, it brings the crisis home. I know very well the streets in Ranelagh where that poor man died. It is deeply shocking. There is a sense of loss and tragedy when that occurs. The crisis is right among us in all our communities and is real.</p>
            <p eId="para_893"> We need to work collaboratively to address this issue. A range of measures are needed. The need for a Housing First response is clear. Unfortunately there have always been cases of rough sleeping. There is now a clear connection between what is happening in our wider housing and homelessness crisis and this, the worst edge of it. We have to connect and tackle it in a co-ordinated way.</p>
            <p eId="para_894"> All the parties in this House need to identify how we can support the agencies looking to provide housing for people through social welfare and a range of different supported housing needs. People in that sector are increasingly running into difficulty in getting planning permission. We need certainty for those agencies. We need to assist those agencies in the provision of housing, by ensuring the planning process is not a restriction. We need to stand up to the concern that some neighbourhoods have over having a particular type of housing in their midst.</p>
            <p eId="para_895"> We need to support radical changes in provision. We need to cater for people who are homeless and also to cater for specific categories of people who are in need of supported accommodation. Our party will certainly help through our councillors at local level in identifying sites and ensuring planning permission is as smooth as possible. Local communities need to be brought in behind the sorts of solutions we need, avoiding unnecessary delay in the provision we need to make.</p>
            <p eId="para_896"> A point that has been repeated <i>ad nauseam</i> but bears repeating is that these terrible tragic incidents highlight that the Government, the Department and local authorities need to step up a gear and adopt a completely different attitude and approach. A person I met recently on the streets of Dublin cited the example that in Britain after the Second World War Chamberlain was instructed by Churchill in the then post-war government to build 3 million houses, and they were built within a certain number of years. That is the level of political commitment that we need.</p>
            <p eId="para_897"> The Minister of State has the support of all House to do this. His Department officials have to step up to that plate. The urgency and scale of the response required cannot be underestimated.</p>

            <p eId="para_898">First, I wish to pass on my deepest sympathies to the families and friends of the two people who died on the streets, but these deaths, the seven in total who have died in recent weeks, and the 30 or 40 that the Taoiseach said who die every year bring shame on politics, the Government and our society. They are not acceptable but they are not necessary. That is the key point.</p>
            <p eId="para_899"> We have talked about the vacant homes that exist in this State and gone on to debate the issue and questioned whether there are 180,000 such homes, as indicated by the Central Statistics Office, or a percentage of that figure but, nevertheless, there are thousands of them. The Peter McVerry Trust issued an email this week following the two deaths stating that it estimates that 250 to 300 Housing First solutions would solve the worst aspects of the crisis on the streets, the rough sleeping. There are certainly that number of vacant units and many more, but we must have the determination and will to get hold of them and to make them available to people who are sleeping on the streets. That is what needs to be done. We need to go way beyond that. Unlike the comments we heard from Eileen Gleeson, all of the people who are sleeping on the streets are there because of the failure to provide affordable public housing but many of them do not take up the emergency accommodation because they are terrified.</p>
            <p eId="para_900"> I got a text yesterday when I was sitting in the Dáil from a man who has been homeless for three years. He is in one of the emergency accommodations in Dublin 8 and he said he is terrified living there. I know some of the emergency accommodation is okay but the Peter McVerry Trust and all the other agencies tell us that, in many cases, it is terrifying to go to those facilities. People are not willing to go to them and then they end up on the streets.</p>
            <p eId="para_901"> I will not go through all the requests the Peter McVerry Trust has made: the Minister of State will also have received this email. It sets out a series of simple requests which should be met. We need to deal with the vacant homes issue, to get hold of the vacant homes necessary for those Housing First places and then move on to build the council houses that can solve the deeper problem.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government (Deputy Damien English)<recordedTime time="2017-11-30T17:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_902">This week we tragically heard of the deaths of two individuals on our streets. We all agree this is not acceptable and should never happen. It is certainly something that we want to avoid. All Deputies agree that it should be avoidable and that it should not happen. It is as simple as that.</p>
            <p eId="para_903"> I join the Taoiseach, the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and many others in this House in extending my sympathies and condolences to the families of those who died.</p>
            <p eId="para_904"> The Minister, Deputy Murphy, regrets he cannot be here and had hoped this issue could have been discussed yesterday, but the Deputies will be aware that he has spoken on this issue on a number of occasions in recent days and I know he was being kept informed on this matter all Tuesday evening by the Dublin Region Homeless Executive and officials at his Department. He wanted to be here tonight to be part of this discussion but he just could not make it.</p>
            <p eId="para_905"> Clearly, this is a very difficult time for those involved and for their families. Out of consideration for the families involved, I ask that we respect their privacy and not speculate on the circumstances of the deceased or the causes of death at this time.</p>
            <p eId="para_906"> While it is not appropriate to speculate on the circumstances of an individual case, it is appropriate that the House discuss the issue of homelessness and what we are doing to address and support those who are sleeping rough at this time.</p>
            <p eId="para_907"> As Deputies will be aware, an official count of those sleeping rough in the Dublin region took place on the night of 7 November 2017. A total of 184 individuals were recorded as sleeping rough on that night, which matches the feedback we get from the different agencies. We knew the numbers were 150 to 160 upwards from the reports we had been getting most nights.</p>
            <p eId="para_908"> As the Minister, Deputy Murphy, has said on a number of occasions, no person should have to sleep on our streets or be without shelter at any time of the year. At the housing summit last September, the Minister, Deputy Murphy, emphasised the need for all housing authorities to have sufficient capacity in emergency accommodation and to have appropriate facilities in place for every person sleeping rough on any night of the week and he instructed the Dublin Region Homeless Executive to ensure the delivery of 200 additional permanent emergency beds by Christmas, building on the new beds that were opened this time last year and since then during this year. The purpose of this was to ensure there will be a bed and all the necessary supports available for anyone who needs them this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_909"> Fifty of the 200 permanent beds are now in place and the remaining 150 emergency beds will be brought into use in the coming days and weeks and they will all be in place by mid-December. These supports are being put in place with our partner organisations. For example, the new facility which the Minister, Deputy Murphy, visited last week on the Cabra Road is being publicly funded, including through my Department and the local authority, and operated by our partners, the Peter McVerry Trust. The people who use this facility will have access to a range of health and welfare supports as well as food and sanitary facilities which they would not have on the streets. Facilities like this will provide some stability so that the housing authorities and the HSE can work with the individuals involved to create a pathway for them to exist homelessness into independent living.</p>
            <p eId="para_910"> As the weather becomes colder, my Department has been working with local authorities to ensure that their cold weather initiatives are in place. These arrangements ensure that additional temporary shelter can be brought into use across a range of existing services and facilities for singles and couples who need them during the cold weather. Arrangements are now in place across urban local authorities and additional temporary beds are in the system for those who need them. Anyone who is following this issue understands that when the weather drops to a certain level more people seek to engage and use the existing services.</p>
            <p eId="para_911"> Our first priority when dealing with homelessness must be to look after those who are most vulnerable - the more than 180 people who are sleeping rough on the streets at night - to get them into safe shelter and then on to one of the many pathways of more secure and sustainable supports, which all the Deputies have raised in regard to the Housing First option.</p>
            <p eId="para_912"> Exits from rough sleeping into Housing First tenancies are also critical and will continue in parallel with this work. The homeless executive will also implement its targeted programme to reach out to all those sleeping rough and to provide them with the interventions and support they need. Housing First is the best solution, but there are people who need beds immediately, and we are providing those on a permanent basis with the 200 new beds that will be in place by mid-December as well as the temporary beds. I acknowledge that in many cases this is emergency accommodation, which is not ideal for anybody. Certainly the standards are a little higher in the new facilities we have opened and they are a little more user friendly. We must also work on raising the standard of the older facilities. Again, they are only emergency accommodation and were only meant to be temporary. Our efforts have to concentrate on the more permanent solutions and bringing forward housing supply. Deputy Cowen mentioned housing supply. He was right in that the issue is one of supply and bringing onstream new and other houses. Deputy Ó Broin mentioned the issue of vacant properties and we are trying to bring them back into use.</p>

            <p eId="para_913">We should deliver the 250 to 300 Housing First places that the Peter McVerry Trust has asked for. The houses exist and should be identified and made available. Critically, the supports should also be made available. I have a personal friend who I have known since I was 12 years of age who is now homeless again. We had got him onto the Housing First system. He got himself clear of his addiction for about a year running up to that, but the supports were not in place for him. He was put into a place where there was no furniture, no beds, nothing and there was nobody around to support him. He cracked up again and now he is back on the streets. That is what happens if the supports are not provided. This issue is not just about numbers or how many emergency beds we have, it must be about the real supports and working with these human beings to provide them with accommodation that is sustainable.</p>

            <p eId="para_914">We all have similar friends. When we bring the issue down to the personal level it shows that this counts. I have one specific question for the Minister of State. Why is it only in mid-December that those additional 200 units come into place? Given that we know the scale of the numbers has risen and that the cold weather comes in mid-November, why do these additional units not kick in until mid-December, which is very late? The units are welcome, but they are being put in place too late. I understand that all the places were full this week. We did not have the capacity we needed.</p>
            <p eId="para_915">The level and scale of this crisis has been clear for many years. Why do we say every year that we are getting there? We always seem to be saying that the facilities are opening next week or the week after. We ran into planning difficulties in the Liberties last year. Why do we not have these facilities in place from mid-October or the end of October? We know it is going to be cold from mid-November onwards. Why does it take so long to get these units in place?</p>

            <p eId="para_916">Like the previous speaker, I have questions about the fact that these facilities are not yet available, even though they were supposed to be made available after the summit. We look forward to them being made available as soon as is practically possible. We have been told that funding is not an issue. I would like to see that proven by virtue of the facilities being put in place. Houses should be purchased using the Housing First approach. I remind the House that this problem is not confined to Dublin. I understand the Minister of State will meet representatives of the Midlands Simon Community next week to discuss a funding shortage it is facing at its facilities in Tullamore and Athlone. I implore the Minister of State to meet the funding deficit that exists because it cannot be met from the locality. The Midlands Simon Community provides the only emergency services that are available in Athlone and Tullamore. It is imperative that they be supported. The Minister of State has said this is not an issue. He can prove that by meeting the shortfall that exists. I expect him to do so.</p>

            <p eId="para_917">The Minister of State's disappointing reply was exactly the same as the reply we would have got if the tragic events of recent days had not happened. It was promised under Rebuilding Ireland that there would be 300 new Housing First tenancies within a year, but just 180 of them have been delivered. The target of 300 was not close to enough, given that so many people are spending long periods of time in emergency accommodation. My question is exactly the same as it was. Approximately 1,800 turnkey units that are ready to go have been offered to the Government in the past year. Why are just 600 such units being purchased? Will the Minister of State commit to a review of the entire list? Will he come before the housing committee as a matter of urgency to discuss how many more of those units can be bought and how quickly they can be bought? Although I welcome additional emergency accommodation that is safe and of a good quality, I emphasise that people desperately need homes, rather than emergency accommodation, to be provided as a matter of urgency.</p>

            <from>Deputy Damien English<recordedTime time="2017-11-30T17:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_918">I was about to answer Deputy Ó Broin's specific question when I ran out of time. It was not the Ceann Comhairle's fault; it was probably my fault for speaking slowly for once. The Deputy has suggested that 1,800 homes have been offered to the State in various ways. I am not sure the figure is as high as that, but it is certainly more than 1,000. Like the Deputy, I am not happy with the progress that is being made in this regard. I sat down with the Housing Agency a few weeks ago to try to track the process and see what is causing the delays in completing these transactions. Money has been provided to bring these properties on board, recycle them back out to the local authorities and reinvest the money that accrues from that process in further property transactions. Additional resources will be provided for this activity if it is needed.</p>
            <p eId="para_919"> The system is not delivering these properties as quickly as it should. Even when the houses have been transferred over, there have been delays in getting tenants to occupy them. This is not acceptable. I have sat down with those involved to talk through the issues. I will be happy to appear before the committee again to go through the issues. There are many quick wins to be gained here. We want vacant properties, including those in the possession of the banks. I think the Deputy understands that not all such properties are suitable. When we go to find them, we learn that some of them are not vacant. They can be unsuitable for other reasons. There are other issues that we can fix through the Housing Agency. It is not good enough that delays are persisting. We will fix the processes. We will deal with them. I think there are approximately 900 properties in view. More than 600 of them have been taken over. I want to be able to purchase the rest. We will look for more because we have the resources to do so. I think we can do that.</p>
            <p eId="para_920"> Deputy Boyd Barrett has raised other vacant properties. In many cases, they are people's private properties. We do not own them all. We are trying to put a lot of schemes in place to make it attractive to hand them over to us. We will announce additional schemes to make it even more attractive. The Peter McVerry Trust has been engaged by some local authorities to find these properties. Other non-governmental organisations and approved housing bodies have also been asked to do this work. We are all trying to get these vacant properties. I emphasise that the Peter McVerry Trust is part of the solution. It is doing some great work.</p>
            <p eId="para_921"> On Housing First, I am very disappointed to hear about the case mentioned by Deputy Boyd Barrett. I would love to get the details of it. The whole idea of having the Housing First approach is that the supports are absolutely meant to be there. I would like to track that and see it because it is not good enough. I am very disappointed to hear about it. Perhaps the Deputy and I will have an opportunity to chat about it.</p>
            <p eId="para_922"> We are trying to drive on the Housing First approach because we all agree it is a major part of the solution. It has been mentioned that just 180 tenancies have been achieved this year. It is not enough. It is below our target. We are appointing a national director of the Housing First scheme to drive it on and make it work. It is the best solution for most people. We need a supply of housing, as Deputy Cowen has said. When we can get the supply of houses, the Housing First approach is ideal for people. We need to make sure the supports are there. I will discuss that with the Deputy on a future occasion. Deputy Ryan raised the same issue. We are dealing with it. I cannot recall the specific question he asked in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_924">Some of the new beds being provided under the emergency provision were announced during the year. We put many extra beds in place in the early part of the year. We are committed to doing more. In October 2016 and again in September or October of this year, we sat down with all the people involved in this sector to try to work how many additional emergency beds were needed. We committed resources on the basis of their advice, their rough counts and their research. We knew by September or October what would be needed. Money was set aside. It has taken time. In some cases, it was difficult to get the necessary facilities accepted in local communities. Some politicians, including councillors and Deputies, opposed them as well. That makes it awkward. I welcome Deputy Ryan's support.</p>
            <p eId="para_925"> Deputy Cowen asked about the Simon Community facilities in Tullamore and Mullingar. I will be happy to engage on this matter when I visit the midlands tomorrow. It was discussed when I did an event with the Dublin Simon Community during the week. Funds are in place to keep the facilities in the midlands open well into the spring. Funding will not be the issue. Westmeath County Council is reviewing the provision of services. It has to ask us for the money. The money is there to supply these services. When all of that has been sorted out, funding will not be an issue. The issues at present relate to the service and the costs. We will tease through that. I assure the Deputy that when an application is made by Westmeath County Council and the evidence is presented, money will be made available.</p>

            <p eId="para_932">I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, for coming to the House. Over 12 months ago, I raised staffing problems at St. Patrick’s Community Hospital, Fermoy, County Cork. We seem to have bigger problems this time. There seems to be a big problem with maintaining staff levels in the hospital. I do not think the HSE is taking a hands-on approach to this job. I spoke recently to a potential applicant for a job in the hospital who was told six months ago their name would be kept on file. When they approached the hospital recently to see whether they could get a position, they were told to reapply.</p>
            <p eId="para_933"> I particularly want to highlight the non-attendance by a doctor or medical officer at the St. Patrick’s Community Hospital site. This has caused fierce problems for the community. Families who have loved ones at home sometimes put them into respite care at St. Patrick’s Community Hospital for certain periods. It is an invaluable service for them. The HSE has informed us that a solution has been put in place. I will give an example of a person living near Mitchelstown who needs 24-hour care. He was offered a bed in Mallow but this was not sufficient because even with the care and attendance of those who provide cover at St. Patrick’s Community Hospital, he still needs family members to travel and stay with him when he is in hospital. It is a total disgrace that this person and his family members have not received any respite in the past four or five months.</p>
            <p eId="para_934"> Why has the HSE not acted before now to find a replacement medical officer? I have asked this question previously. I acknowledge that we had an officer who resigned. The most recent officer retired. Anyone in business would have a track record of his or her employees that would indicate who is going to be retiring 12 months down the road, and not just in a couple of weeks or months. I am led to believe that a temporary solution has been found and I acknowledge that. In fairness to the local GPs, they have come together to try to organise a roster. That is no more than a temporary solution. It will not fix the long-term problem that will continue to arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_935"> There are 72 beds in St. Patrick’s Community Hospital. Previous Governments put tremendous amounts of money into the upgrading of the hospital. It is now acknowledged as one of the best long-term care facilities in County Cork. As I have said previously, this building was falling down some years ago. It was the last place to which one would want to send a loved one. People seem to be dying to get in there now. We do not want to lose this facility but wish to keep it. The town has already lost the St. Francis Welfare Home, which also cared for elderly people and people of no means. I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House this afternoon. I await her response. I know she will sound positive. I want her to set out a longer-term solution that will get this matter resolved.</p>

            <p eId="para_936">I thank Deputy O'Keeffe for raising this issue. My colleague, Deputy Jim Daly, the Minister of State with special responsibility for mental health and older people, cannot be here, unfortunately, and has asked me to take this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_937"> The overarching policy of the Government is to support older people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible. This is clearly what older people want and only those in genuine need of residential care should go down that route. Short-term beds, including respite and rehabilitation beds, contribute to the provision of an integrated model of care for older people, enabling them to return home following a period of hospital care or to postpone admission to long-stay residential care.</p>
            <p eId="para_938"> The Health Service Executive is responsible for the delivery of health and personal social services, including those at facilities such as St. Patrick’s Community Hospital in Fermoy. The community hospital provides long-term respite, convalescent and palliative care. It was registered with the Health Information and Quality Authority on 28 June 2015 for a period of three years. The hospital normally caters for people over 65 years of age but also provides care to young chronically sick patients and palliative care to adults. The Deputy will be aware that the five-year capital programme announced last year includes refurbishment works at the hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_939"> Challenges emerged in recent months in respect of medical cover at the hospital, which is provided by three local GP practices. One practice provided this service three days a week. The remaining two practices provided the service on the fourth and fifth days. Following the resignation of a medical officer in-----</p>

            <p eId="para_942">There could be. Actually there is. I will read what is here and then I will come back to that question. I thank the Ceann Comhairle. Following the resignation of a medical officer in 2017, the HSE managed, with great difficulty, to engage another GP to provide the service. However, in September 2017 a second medical officer retired. Despite strenuous efforts to engage another GP in the area the HSE was unable to source GP cover for the fifth day. The HSE decided that it was necessary to protect the 54 long-stay beds and that the respite service affecting nine beds in Fermoy had to be curtailed. This service was to be provided by local nursing homes.</p>
            <p eId="para_943"> I am pleased to advise Deputy O’Keeffe that, following a recent meeting with a local general practitioner, agreement has been reached to provide the necessary medical cover on a temporary basis. This will enable respite beds to reopen in the community hospital in Fermoy. I understand that this is expected to happen in the coming days and patients are booked in for next week. The public health nurse continues to liaise with the families. As I have said, this is a temporary measure and the Health Service Executive has confirmed to the Department that the Cork and Kerry community health care organisation will continue in its efforts to find a permanent sustainable solution. Officials from the Department will continue to monitor this situation carefully and the HSE has been asked to keep the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, updated on progress.</p>
            <p eId="para_944"> I will come in on some of the issues which the Deputy raised when I respond to his supplementary statement. I take note that the statement only covers five days.</p>

            <from>Deputy Kevin O'Keeffe<recordedTime time="2017-11-30T17:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_945">I thank the Minister of State for taking time out to deliver this statement on health. I received a similar response from the HSE to a parliamentary question which I raised in early October. The Minister of State has outlined the problems, but we do not seem to be getting any solutions. She mentioned that the beds would be opened up soon, but I am reliably informed that not all of the beds will be made available. I do not know if we will also have staffing problems. The ironic thing about this is that there are SouthDoc facilities less than 50 yards down the road from the hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_946"> In this day and age and with modern technology, how can this happen? Yesterday I listened to a GP who was before the Joint Committee on Health speaking about technology and using Skype for consultations instead of people having to visit the GP in person. There was a headline in the newspaper this morning which said that it could take a week to get a GP appointment. These people just want beds and care in order that their family members can have a bit of respite for themselves. The Minister of State knows that people become accustomed to their surroundings. It is not fair to send them all over the county to different beds at different times. I will give the Minister of State an example. A while ago I mentioned the closure of St. Francis Welfare Home. It was forcibly closed and the four or five remaining patients were relocated. I would say that they had all gone to their eternal rewards within 18 months because they never became accustomed to their newfound locations. That is why I brought this matter before the Minister of State today. I know she will pass the buck to the HSE but, at the same time, she is in government. The long-term situation is that we have the facility. Will the Minister of State please get it staffed properly?</p>

            <p eId="para_947">First of all, I have been in situations, as has Deputy O'Keeffe, where services have been suspended for short periods of time. The difficulty is trying to get proper staff. I will, however, take on the Deputy's concerns. To be honest, I am not familiar with Fermoy. I will speak to the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, about the issue. I have taken down a number of the Deputy's points, and also the point which the Ceann Comhairle raised about the five-day service. I am not too sure what happened to the other two days. I will try to find out.</p>
            <p eId="para_948"> All I can say is that the solution in place at the moment is temporary. I think that has been identified by the Minister and by the HSE. There is a real effort being made to provide a proper service with permanent staff. We all know the pressure which rural GPs in particular are under in respect of staff and services. I am afraid I cannot answer some of the Deputy's direct questions, but I will ask the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, to come back to Deputy O'Keeffe on them. As I have said, I am not familiar with the service in the area in question, but I understand where the Deputy is coming from. It can be very upsetting not only for the patient but also for the family when older persons are shunted from one service to another. It can affect them greatly. We must all do our best on this matter. Unfortunately, it is difficult to get staff at the moment. We all understand that. However, that should not be an excuse for not providing people with a proper service. I will relay the Deputy's concerns to the Minister of State and I hope he will return to him. We might have a better outcome to this matter in a few weeks. I take on board the Deputy's concerns and I will take on board what the Ceann Comhairle has said about the five-day service. It could be a seven-day service.</p>

            <p eId="para_955">There is real genuine concern among people right across the east coast who use the DART service that the downgrading of stations seems to be going ahead. It is certainly going ahead in my constituency. I am aware the Minister is also a resident of the Wicklow constituency. To use a terrible pun, it is full steam ahead for the downgrading of Greystones DART station. Iarnród Éireann has put out tenders to let the train station out as a commercial premises. The station will move to an unmanned service, which will have detrimental impacts on the people in Greystones, young and old, but on disabled users in particular. I have been hearing from staff within Iarnród Éireann that there are broader, larger plans to move towards a greater number of unmanned stations. We know this is not only being rolled out on the DART line but throughout the rail service across the State. To date, 34 train stations have moved from a manned service to an unmanned service. As I touched on, this will have an impact on people and communities. It will affect elderly people as no one will be available to help them to purchase their tickets. It will also affect our disabled citizens. There has been some positive progress in respect of access to public transport for people with disabilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_956"> At this point I want to put on record my sincere condolences to a constituent, friend and colleague of mine, John Doyle, who during the course of his life was a disability rights campaigner who campaigned for independent living.</p>
            <p eId="para_957">He passed away on Sunday night and his funeral took place this morning. Throughout his life, John, along with others, fought long and hard to try to make our public transport system accessible to people with disabilities. He and others were fundamental in forcing Dublin Bus into acquiring the new bus fleet, with low floors accessible by wheelchairs, that was rolled out in the 1990s. There has been progress on that, and also in terms of the 24-hour notice which wheelchair users and people with disabilities have to give to train stations and Iarnród Éireann. A trial programme will be rolled out in the new year and this will reduce the notice period for people with disabilities who want to use public transport to four hours. That is not acceptable. There should be total equality across the board. People with disabilities should be able to use our public transport services at any time without having to give notice. Reducing the notice period to four hours is welcome, but it should be zero hours.</p>
            <p eId="para_958"> The downgrading of DART stations is going to have a major impact and will destroy any progress that has been made. I am informed that a plan for Greystones, which will see it become an unmanned train station in the new year, is due to be rolled out. Is the Minister aware of any other plans? Has he been speaking to the NTA or Iarnród Éireann about plans to have other unmanned DART stations in Dublin and Wicklow? What consultation has taken place?</p>

            <from>Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport (Deputy Shane Ross)<recordedTime time="2017-11-30T17:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_959">I thank Deputy Brady for raising this very important matter. It is quite unusual for a Deputy to be questioning a constituent and making that constituent accountable for what happens in his or her own constituency. However, I am happy to answer his question about accessibility.</p>
            <p eId="para_960"> I take the Deputy's point about reduction to a four-hour notice period not being sufficient. People with impaired mobility are currently required to notify train stations of their intention to travel at least 24 hours in advance if they require assistance. I agree that this is totally unacceptable and that we should aspire to total equality between people with and without disabilities in accessing public transport. Irish Rail hopes to commence, early in the new year, a pilot project in respect of the DART which is aimed at reducing the period of advanced notice from 24 hours to four by guaranteeing staffing across grouped stations and ensuring flexibility to enable staff to move between stations to provide assistance. Irish Rail anticipates that the pilot project will run for six months, at which point the information gleaned will be used to inform how best to develop its customer service across all networks. I hope that particular experiment will extend beyond Irish Rail to Dublin Bus and other public transport services.</p>
            <p eId="para_961"> I completely accept Deputy Brady's bona fides. He highlights the need for haste in this matter. Things seem to be moving very slowly. The amount of money that has been allocated to improve accessibility this year and into the future has increased enormously, and will, while I am a Minister, increase even faster. The four-year capital envelope for public transport announced in budget 2018 includes a multi-annual allocation of almost €28 million for the accessibility retrofit programme for the period 2018 to 2021. This represents a trebling of the previous allocation for accessibility under the plan. That is a convincing commitment to public transport accessibility, on which I insisted. I recognise that difficulties exist not only in the context of the downgrading of the DART but also in other areas of public transport. That is why we have given such a large increase to improve accessibility. It is also why we are launching this pilot scheme to see if we can reduce the notice period. Ideally, there would be no notice period. However, we cannot achieve that overnight.</p>
            <p eId="para_962"> There are also other projects involving Dublin Bus. In conjunction with the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Finian McGrath, I launched a "Please Don't Buggy in the Wheelchair Zone" campaign with Dublin Bus recently. The purpose of this campaign is to deal with the issue of buggies blocking access for people with wheelchairs. There is a public campaign to increase awareness about this issue. Please do not doubt the commitment of the Government to this issue. It is being hastened and is a priority. We will insist upon that.</p>
            <p eId="para_963"> On the issue of the Greystones Station, Iarnród Éireann has taken the opportunity to assess whether there is any commercial interest in the ground floor of the station building, particularly as the existing area reserved for retail is vacant. While seeking expressions of interest, there has been no change to any arrangements - including staffing - of how the station functions. Iarnród Éireann will be in a position to assess the degree of commercial interest in the station building early next year. This will enable it to make a decision on the station's future use and it will be done in tandem with a review of staffing. Customer needs will be taken into consideration should there be any change.</p>

            <p eId="para_964">I want to hone in on one sentence the Minister uttered. He said that ideally we could get to a position where people with disabilities will not need to give notice. However, the move towards unmanned DART stations will ensure that never happens. We need stations to be manned in order that disabled citizens can be assisted in getting on and off public transport. While the Minister may aspire to that, if the downgrading of our train or DART stations goes ahead, we will ensure that citizens will not get equal access to public transport. There is real concern about this. I am hearing from staff in Iarnród Éireann that this is a done deal.</p>
            <p eId="para_965"> There is talk of letting out the train station in Greystones to commercial interests. I would argue that the space there is not available at the moment because it is used as staff quarters. The company is moving quite swiftly towards converting it to an unmanned station. What other DART stations are being looked at in this regard? Has consultation taken place, particularly with disability organisations? There is concern about this matter. Sydney Parade Station services St. Vincent's Hospital and we know there are no direct buses from Wicklow that serve the hospital. The DART is the only public transport available in this regard. If that station is not manned, people with disabilities will be disenfranchised; they will not be able to get to St. Vincent's. Sandymount Station services the Enable Ireland premises that houses a school for disabled children. If that station is not manned, there are going to be problems.</p>
            <p eId="para_966"> Ideally, there should be no notice period. What specific consultations have taken place with Iarnród Éireann?</p>

            <p eId="para_967">I have responsibility for policy and overall funding of public transport. I am not involved in the day-to-day operation of public transport. The operation of DART stations is a matter for Iarnród Éireann and is not an issue in respect of which I have any statutory function.</p>
            <p eId="para_968"> For customers requiring assistance, Iarnród Éireann plans to confirm new arrangements for mobility-impaired customers shortly which will dramatically reduce the current advance notification period and ensure a better response when customers requiring assistance cannot give notice. These new arrangements are being designed following extensive customer research and liaison with the company's disability users' group.</p>
            <p eId="para_969">It is absolutely imperative that people with disabilities are accommodated and we should aspire to the ideal we both mentioned. Like every service, CIÉ, Iarnród Éireann and Dublin Bus must continually adapt and change in line with trends in customer behaviour and technology. We cannot ignore advancing technology.</p>
            <p eId="para_970"> Regarding the issue of station staffing which the Deputy mentioned, I understand from Iarnród Éireann that this is under review in response to changed customer behaviour, with customers moving to prepaid ticketing and ticket vending machines. This obviously alters the pattern of how stations are staffed. The company has indicated that key stations such as Killester and Sandymount, which are adjacent to major facilities for the mobility-impaired, will always be staffed.</p>

          <p eId="para_973"> Cuireann sé áthas orm deis a bheith agam an Bille seo a chur faoi bhráid Thithe an Oireachtais. Tá an phráinn agus an ghéarchéim a bhaineann leis an gceist seo sáraithe de bharr go bhfuil fear den scoth a bhfuil dea-cháilíochtaí aige, an tOllamh Ciarán Ó hÓgartaigh, tofa le bheith ina chomharba ar uachtarán reatha an choláiste. Tá mé thar a bheith cinnte go ndéanfaidh an tOllamh Ó hÓgartaigh obair iontach ar fad mar cheann ar an gcoláiste. Cé go bhfuil an fhadhb phráinneach réitithe, níl an fhadhb fhadtéarmach réitithe. Tugadh stádas speisialta do Choláiste na hOllscoile, Gaillimh sa bhliain 1929. Bhí amhras ann faoi thodhchaí an choláiste ag an am, ach socraíodh go gcoinneofar ann é ar an mbunús go mbeadh freagracht faoi leith náisiúnta ar an gcoláiste ó thaobh oiliúint trí mheán na Gaeilge de, ní hamháin an Ghaeilge í féin, ach ábhair eile nach í freisin.</p>
          <p eId="para_974"> Cé go ndearnadh leasú ar Acht Choláiste Phríomh-Scoile na Gaillimhe, 1929 sa bhliain 2006, tá sé fós mar aidhm ag an ollscoil ceannródaíocht a thabhairt ina bplean forbartha maidir le hoiliúint trí mheán na Gaeilge a chur ar fáil. Mar a deir Acht an Choláiste Ollscoile, Gaillimh (Leasú), 2006, "the governing authority of the College shall ensure that one of the principal aims for the operation and development of the College set out in each strategic development plan prepared after the commencement of this section is the provision of education at the College through the medium of the Irish language". Ar ndóigh, tá sé sin á dhéanamh ar bhealaí éagsúla ag an ollscoil. B'fhéidir go bhfuil sé imithe i léig beagáinín le sé bliana anuas, ach tá sé á dhéanamh. Tá trí ionad Gaeltachta ag an ollscoil ar an gCeathrú Rua, i gCarna agus i nGaoth Dobhair thuas i dTír Chonaill.</p>
          <p eId="para_975"> Go dtí an bhliain seo, bhí sé leagtha síos ag an ollscoil ina gcuid rialacha féin go gcaitheadh Gaeilge a bheith ag an uachtarán. Mar sin, níor tháinig an cheist seo aníos riamh. Nuair a tháinig athrú ar an riail sin i mbliana, dúradh nach raibh aon ghá Gaeilge a bheith ag uachtarán an choláiste agus go bhféadfadh sí nó sé feidhmiú go praiticiúil ó lá go lá go sásúil gan aon Ghaeilge a bheith aici nó aige. Is ionann é sin agus a rá nach bhfuil duine amháin, in aon áit ar domhain, le sár-Ghaeilge a bheadh ard-oilte leis an jab seo a dhéanamh. Is léir go bhfuil a leithéid de dhaoine ann mar go bhfuil duine le sár-Ghaeilge faighte. Nach gcuireann sé iontas ar an Aire - caithfidh gur cheistigh sé é seo - go bhfuil rud éigin teipthe sa chóras oideachais, agus muid ag múineadh na Gaeilge sna scoileanna ar fad ó luath sna 1920í, mura bhfuiltear in ann teacht ar dhuine amháin ard-oilte leis an jab seo a dhéanamh?</p>
          <p eId="para_976"> Tá seacht ollscoil sa tír. Go deimhin féin, tá an tAire i mbun tuilleadh ollscoileanna a n-ainmniú faoi láthair. Tá suas agus anuas le 20 forais oideachais tríú leibhéal eile sa tír. Ní raibh sé mar dhualgas ach ar cheann amháin de na hinstitiúidí sin go mbeadh an Ghaeilge ag an uachtarán. Táimid ag iarraidh go leanfaidh muid an dualgas sin. Ní dóigh liom gur éileamh iomarcach é. An bhfuil Ollscoil na hÉireann, Gaillimh tite siar mar thoradh ar an nGaeilge a bheith ag a cuid uachtarán? An bhfuil míbhuntáiste éigin ag an gcoláiste de bharr an riachtanais sin? An bhfuil teipthe ar an ollscoil? Tá sé follasach, tar éis go raibh Gaeilge ag chuile uachtarán ó 1929 i leith, agus daoine ardcháilithe a bhí iontu, go bhfuil éirithe thar cionn ag an ollscoil. Tá sé sa chéad 250 ollscoil ar fud na cruinne, rud atá dochreidte i gcathair chomh beag le Gaillimh. Tá fás agus forás ar an ollscoil. Mar sin, ní léir cén bunús a bhí leis an bpolasaí seo a athrú.</p>
          <p eId="para_977"> Iarraim ar an Aire an Bille seo a scaoileadh ar aghaidh go dtí Céim an Choiste ionas gur féidir linn an cheist seo a chíoradh tuilleadh. Nuair a bhí ionadaithe ó Ollscoil na hÉireann, Gaillimh istigh ag an gcoiste Gaeilge, níorbh léir domsa ag an am go raibh aon argóintí fónta curtha ar aghaidh acu ar son an bheartais a bhí tógtha acu. Tá mé oscailte le héisteacht leo arís. Creidim go bhfuil sé áiféiseach bheith ag caint ar aidhmeanna na straitéise 20 bliana don Ghaeilge - ina measc go mbeidh 250,000 cainteoir laethúil Gaeilge sa tír seo agus go mbeidh méadú mór ar líon na ndaoine a deireann go bhfuil an Ghaeilge acu - agus ag an am céanna bheith ag baint an bun ón nGaeilge seachtain i ndiaidh seachtaine.</p>
          <p eId="para_978"> I dtaobh na Gaeilge de, ní mholfainn an dá Rialtas a bhí againn le sé bliana anuas. Ba mhaith liom moladh a thabhairt do rud amháin fónta agus tairbheach atá déanta acu, áfach. Tá mé sásta a rá go gcreidim go bhfuil an polasaí oideachais Ghaeltachta atá curtha i bhfeidhm le gairid tairbheach. Tá an coincheap an-mhaith, ach an t-aon locht a bheadh agam air ná go bhfuil sé á cur i bhfeidhm sách sciobtha. Guím chuile rath ar an Aire agus an straitéis seo á cur i bhfeidhm aige. Agus an infheistíocht sin ar fad á déanamh, tá sé beagáinín contráilte go bhfuil lucht an Rialtais ag rá go bhfuil siad ar son na straitéise, ach ag an am céanna ag rá nár cheart dúinn bheith ag súil go mbeidh duine amháin mar cheann ar ollscoil amháin as na hollscoileanna ar fad sa tír a chaitheadh Gaeilge a bheith aige nó aici.</p>
          <p eId="para_979"> As I have said in Irish, this is a simple Bill. There are two sections to it. The change is absolutely minor. The effect of the Bill is to replace a section that was in the statutes of the college that has required the president of the college since 1929 to be competent in the Irish language.</p>
          <p eId="para_980">The problem is that the college has done away with that requirement. The Oireachtas should show its disapproval of the short sightedness of that decision by amending the existing legislation as I have proposed, to make it a condition that the president of the National University of Ireland Galway must be proficient in the Irish language. As I pointed out, there are 20 third level colleges in the State, including seven universities. As such, NUI Galway represents 5% of the total number of institutions, which is not out of line with the percentage of regular speakers of the Irish language.</p>
          <p eId="para_981"> It is fitting that one president, out of all 20 institutions, should be required to have fluency in Irish and it is especially fitting that it should be the head of NUI Galway. The college has three Gaeltacht centres which do their daily business in Irish and whose internal memoranda are always in Irish. Fortunately, the current president is a fluent Irish speaker and was brought up in an Irish-speaking household. However, under existing provisions, a situation might arise in the future where a person is appointed to the university who could not go to any of those centres and speak the first official language. Proficiency in the language is also important for the president's dealings with the public. In fact, Galway city council sought and was granted bilingual status for the city. The tradition has always been that the president of NUI Galway spoke Irish on public occasions, as well as English when needed. As it stands, however, a future president might be appointed who would not be required to be able to do so. It is surely an indictment of the education system if we cannot find one person capable of both running the college and speaking the two official languages. In fact, what happened, as we predicted, is that there was no difficulty in recruiting a president who is a fluent Irish speaker. The problem I am seeking to address by way of these provisions is that if the law is not changed, we do not know whether the same effort will be made on the next occasion to ensure the incoming president is an Irish speaker.</p>
          <p eId="para_982"> The 20 year strategy for the Irish language is a strategy for growth. For too long we have been talking and hearing about the death of the language. What is actually happening is that we are seeing growth in usage of the language in urban areas. People in middle class areas of Dublin, surveys show, have the most positive attitudes to the language and make up its fastest growing support base. It is a similar story in Galway city. Indeed, one of the most extraordinary developments in the past 20 to 30 years is the growth of interest in and usage of the language in urban Ireland. There are highly qualified people in every discipline who are fluent Irish speakers, capable of carrying on their everyday business through the language.</p>
          <p eId="para_983"> I urge the Minister to accept these proposals. I am always worried when preparing a Bill, given that I do not have huge resources at my disposal, that I will make some drafting mistake, typographical or otherwise. However, any such errors can be amended, as happened with the Electoral (Amendment) Bill I brought forward on a previous occasion in this House. That legislation did require some debate and amendment in committee, which is something to which I am always open. It would send a strong signal of our serious intent in regard to the Irish language if the Bill I am introducing were to go forward to Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_984"> Molaim an Bille. Tá súil agam go mbeidh tacaíocht leathan le fáil aige ar fud an tí. Níl ach dhá alt sa Bhille - is Bille gearr atá ann. Ba mhaith liom a rá, mar fhocal scor, go bhfuil a fhios agam go bhfuil an spéis ag mo chomhghleacaí, an Teachta Catherine Connolly, labhairt ar an mBille seo. Mar a tharla, bhí cruinniú poiblí eagraithe aici don oíche anocht i nGaillimh agus bhí uirthi dul chuig an gcruinniú sin. Bhí an díospóireacht seo le bheith ann an tseachtain seo chaite ach tharla rudaí i rith na seachtaine sin, agus cuireadh rudaí bun os cionn. Mar sin, ní raibh sí in ann a bheith i láthair anocht. Creidim go bhfuil tacaíocht fhorleathan don chur chuige atá agam agus bheadh súil agam, fiú gan an Rialtas, go nglacfar leis an mBille seo ar an Dara Chéim agus go mbeidh deis againn é a phlé ag an gcoiste maidir le leasuithe is gá a dhéanamh agus an Bille seo a achtú.</p>

          <p eId="para_987">A Aire, tá sé go maith go bhfuil deis agam labhairt ar an ábhar seo. Tá mé ag iarraidh labhairt freisin maidir le scolaíocht agus an Ghaeilge ina iomláine.</p>
          <p eId="para_988"> Tá fadhb mhór ann mar gheall ar an nGaeilge agus oideachas sa tír seo. Ní hamháin go bhfuil mise á rá sin: aithníonn go leor daoine agus an Roinn féin an fhadhb sin. Ceapaim go bhfuil ar a laghad trian de na múinteoirí atá ag teacht amach as an gcóras gan a bheith in ann labhairt as Gaeilge ar chor ar bith. Bhíos ag caint le múinteoir amháin i scoil Ghaeltachta agus dúirt sí liom gur chuir sí iarratas amach ag iarraidh múinteoir i gcomhair post agus fuair sé 70 iarratas. As an 70, ní raibh duine amháin sásta obair a dhéanamh, nó múineadh trí Ghaeilge. Bhíos ag labhairt le múinteoir eile i scoil Ghaeltachta a dúirt go raibh 13 múinteoir sa scoil. Nuair a d’iarr mé air an méid a bhí in ann Gaeilge líofa a labhairt, dúirt sé go raibh ceathrar in ann é sin a dhéanamh. Táimid ag caint faoi scoileanna sa Ghaeltacht, agus múinteoirí nach bhfuil in ann labhairt i nGaeilge le páistí faoina gcúram atá ag iarraidh labhairt as Gaeilge leo. Is é an scoil ceann de na suímh is tábhachtaí sna Gaeltachtaí mar gheall ar an nGaeilge. Muna bhfuil an scoil ag baint úsáid as an nGaeilge, bí cinnte nach mairfidh an Ghaeilge sa todhchaí ar chor ar bith.</p>
          <p eId="para_989"> Bhíos ag caint le príomhoide agus dúirt sé liom go raibh múinteoir nua sa scoil aige. Dúirt an múinteoir “tar anseo” le páiste, chuaigh an páiste chuige agus dúirt an múinteoir, “no, that means go into the corner.” Seo múinteoir atá tar éis teacht tríd an gcóras iomlán. An fhadhb atá ann ná go mbaineann na scrúduithe a dhéanann na múinteoirí sna hollscoileanna leis na hollscoileanna agus nach bhfuil baint acu leis an Stát. Is é an ollscoil an breitheamh go huile is go hiomlán maidir leis an gcaighdeán agus tá sé sin ag déanamh an-chuid damáiste don Ghaeilge sa tír.</p>
          <p eId="para_990"> Is fáinne fí é. Nuair a théann múinteoirí isteach sna scoileanna gan chaighdeán sár mhaith acu, titeann an caighdeán atá ag na páistí. Nuair a éiríonn na páistí níos sine agus nuair a thosaíonn siad ag déanamh staidéir agus iad ina mac léinn sna hollscoileanna, bíonn caighdeán níos lú acu agus ag an nglúin sin. Caithfidh go mbeadh an Rialtas lán sásta díriú air seo.</p>
          <p eId="para_991"> Baineann sé leis an bhfadhb atá againn aistritheoirí a fháil don Aontas Eorpach. Nílimid in ann na poist sin a líonadh ag an mbomaite mar níl daoine ag baint amach an caighdeán chun na poist sin a líonadh.</p>
          <p eId="para_992">Mar gheall ar na Gaelscoileanna, is í an fhadhb atá ann ná go bhfuil 25% de thuismitheoirí ag iarraidh a bpáistí a sheoladh chuig Gaelscoil ach níl ach 5% de na páistí ag fáil Gaelscolaíochta. Tá saghas bearna ollmhór idir an líon daoine atá ag fáil na seirbhíse agus an líon atá á éileamh. Níl aon chóras ann inar féidir le scoil athrú ó chóras amháin go córas eile. Ní féidir le scoil lán-Bhéarla athrú go scoil lán-Ghaeilge. Tá córas ann inar féidir le scoileanna Caitliceacha athrú go scoileanna il-sainchreidmheacha, ach ní féidir leo an bogadh sin a dhéanamh mar gheall ar theanga.</p>
          <p eId="para_993"> Tacaímid le Bille Theachta Uí Chuív atá os comhair na Dála, cé gur sop in áit na scuaibe é. Cuireann an Bille seo ceal ar Acht a thug an Teachta Ó Cuív isteach nuair a bhí sé ina Aire le freagracht as an nGaeltacht. Ba é Acht an Choláiste Ollscoile, Gaillimh (Leasú) 2006 a lagaigh na riachtanais oifigiúla maidir leis an nGaeilge go mór. Anois tá an Teachta ag iarraidh fáil réidh leis an reachtaíocht ar thóg sé isteach. Aontaíonn Sinn Féin le haon ghníomh a láidríonn an Ghaeilge. Molaimid an Teachta Ó Cuív as a bheith in ann admháil go raibh an tAcht ar thóg sé isteach lochtach agus as a bheith sásta é a leigheas. Ní thuigimid cén fáth gur gá Bille nua a thabhairt isteach in áit Acht 2006 a leasú arís nuair nach bhfuil ach líne amháin sa bhreis sa Bhille nua seo. Bhí an plé sin againn inniu. Ba bhreá liom a fháil amach cad is cúis leis seo.</p>
          <p eId="para_994"> Fuair an Bille leasaithe ar thóg an Teachta Ó Cuív isteach in 2006 réidh leis an riachtanas fostaíochta Gaeilge agus Béarla a bheith ag duine le hearcú ag an ollscoil. Bhí Sinn Féin go mór i gcoinne an Bhille seo deich mbliana ó shin ach achtaíodh é. Thuigeamar ag an staid sin an damáiste a dhéanfadh é seo don Ghaeilge. Tá sé ríthábhachtach go bhfuil Gaeilge ag uachtarán Ollscoile na hÉireann, Gaillimh. Tá stádas faoi leith ag an ollscoil le fada chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn agus tá dualgais bhreise uirthi an teanga a chothú. Is rud tábhachtach é sin.</p>
          <p eId="para_995"> Is féidir liom mo pháiste a sheoladh chuig an nGaelscoil ag an mbunleibhéal. Anois, i gceantair éagsúla, is féidir páistí a sheoladh chuig meánscoileanna Gaeilge. Níl aon ollscoil le Gaeilge sa tír. Níl an deis ann oideachas iomlán a dhéanamh i nGaeilge. I mo thuairim, is é sin ceann de na baic is mó atá ann mar gheall ar an gcaighdeán a bhaint amach. Má táimid ag iarraidh go mbeadh státseirbhísigh in ann dul i dteagmháil le saoránaigh na tíre ina dteanga féin, ba cheart go mbeadh na státseirbhísigh tar éis dul tríd an gcóras oideachais iomlán trí Ghaeilge. Ba cheart don Rialtas díriú isteach ar ollscoil lán-Ghaeilge a chothú sa tír. Ba bhuille mór don Ghaeilge an cinneadh fáil réidh leis an riachtanas Gaeilge d'uachtarán na hollscoile sna blianta atá caite. Ní raibh cosaint reachtúil ann le chur i gcoinne a leithéid. Buíochas le Dia gur ceapadh Ciarán Ó hÓgartaigh mar uachtarán i mbliana, mar bhí baol mór ann go mbeadh duine le beagán Gaeilge sa ról. Is gá dúinn an teanga a chur chun tosaigh agus daoine a ceapadh le hardchumas teanga acu, go háirithe iad siúd a bheadh poist shinsearacha feiceálacha acu.</p>
          <p eId="para_996"> Ba mhian liom mo dhíomá a léiriú inniu freisin. Guím gach rath ar an Aire nua, an Teachta Josepha Madigan. Le cúnamh Dé, beidh an t-ádh uirthi na rudaí cearta agus cuí a chur i bhfeidhm. Ach tá fadhb ann leis an gceapachán freisin. Níl an fhadhb ag Teachta Madigan. Baineann sé leis an Taoiseach féin. Ba cheart go mbeadh cáilíocht, taithí nó suim éigin ag polaiteoir sula mbeadh sé nó sí ceaptha i ról áirithe mar Aire. Má chuirtear an t-ainm "Josepha Madigan" agus an focal "Gaeilge" isteach i Google, is féidir a fheiceáil cé mhéad torthaí a fhaightear. Ní thagann aon toradh ar ais. Is droch rud é sin. Is leathanach bán folamh atá ann. B'fhéidir go mbeidh sí go maith sa ról, níl a fhios againn go fóill. Feicfimid. An fhadhb atá ann ná nuair nach bhfuil suim, motivation nó spreagadh éigin ar duine an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim, is léir nár ghníomhaí Gaeilge é nó í i ndairíre. Muna bhfuiltear ina gníomhaí Gaeilge, ní féidir dul i dteagmháil le muintir na Gaeltachta ina dteanga féin agus a bheith in ann na rudaí casta a phlé, agus tá go leor rudaí casta ag baint leis an ról sin. Ní féidir le duine nár ghníomhaí Gaeilge é nó í na rudaí sin a phlé ar chor ar bith. Ba cheart go mbeadh an Rialtas ag díriú isteach ar an bhfadhb seo i bhfad níos mó.</p>
          <p eId="para_997"> Chuala mé go raibh an tAire i gContae na Mí inniu mar gheall ar a phlean nua oideachais don Ghaeltacht. Cuirim fáilte ollmhór roimh an bplean sin agus roimh an airgead nua atá á chur ag an Aire isteach san earnáil sin. Is céim mhaith í. Táimid ag fanacht uirthi le fada, ach ceapaim gur céim chun cinn í. Is gá dom a rá gur rud ceart é sin.</p>

          <from>Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Richard Bruton)<recordedTime time="2017-11-30T18:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_998">Níl Gaeilge líofa agam agus nílim abálta an díospóireacht a fhreagairt as Gaeilge. Nonetheless, I thank both Deputies for their contribution to the debate. I absolutely understand their passionate commitment to the language, which I greatly admire. I note Deputy Peadar Tóibín's concern about Ministers appointed to posts who do not have a record of interest in the Irish language. If that was the qualification then I might not be in this post myself. I have had the privilege to introduce the first ever policy for the Gaeltacht. I believe this policy is innovative and valuable. We are putting serious resources behind it. We want to create an immersion model within the Gaeltacht to make sure that the beacons we have in Gaeltacht schools are protected and that we have more schools that have the deep commitment to the immersion to the language, which the Deputies have rightly said is not there. Even in schools within the Gaeltacht there are some teachers who do not have that.</p>
          <p eId="para_999"> We are committing real resources to upskill teachers and provide immersion courses at third level so that teachers who are coming out would have full immersion in their own qualification. Similarly, there are Master's courses that will ensure that teachers who are in schools can acquire the skills they need. I strongly dispute the contention that we need the leader of policy in any sphere to be themselves fluent in Irish in order to develop and execute policies that protect and create centres of excellence for Irish that can be a model for growing the language and the love of the language in the State. I believe that this is the fundamental principle of what we are debating: does the leader of learning in an institution have themselves to be fluent in order to develop a strategy that delivers the policy objectives we are trying to secure?</p>
          <p eId="para_1000"> My understanding of the history of this issue is that there never was a statutory requirement in this regard. It was always the universities' statutes since 2006 and it was not an Oireachtas-----</p>

          <p eId="para_1005">The original provision stated that it shall be the duty of the Seanad of the National University of Ireland when making an appointment to any office or situation in the college to appoint to such office or situation a person competent to discharge the duties thereof through the medium of the Irish language provided a person so competent and also suitable in other respects is to be found among the persons who are candidates or otherwise available for such opportunities. As the Deputy said, that referred to any office or situation. Also, there was no obligation that everyone should have Irish. Where there were two equal candidates, the obligation in the Act was that the candidate with Irish should be selected. That was the provision that was changed by the 2006 Act.</p>

          <p eId="para_1007">I agree with the thinking behind the change in the 2006 Act given the problems that would otherwise be created in recruiting across the whole spectrum of college activity. The goal of protecting Irish by way of that sort of provision has not been successfully reached and I can see why the changes were made. The changes were made in the context of the absolute obligation on the college more broadly to create an environment in which it was the lead proponent of the development of the Irish language as a university. It was being given a unique responsibility and the President had an obligation to execute it. The college had to put strategies and policies in place and it was subject not only to internal monitoring but to monitoring by outside agencies, as the Deputy said himself. I understand the record of the college is very strong in meeting that external scrutiny.</p>
          <p eId="para_1008"> The question to which we are driven back is whether we should show our disapproval, as Deputy Ó Cuív said, of the college authority in making a decision, which was its decision to make under the legislation, that it should not insist on Irish when looking for a President. It is important to bear in mind that, in its wisdom, the Oireachtas decided in 1997 and again in 2006 that this should be a decision of the board of the college itself. Bearing in mind its absolute responsibility to promote successfully the Irish language, it was within the board's discretion to make a decision on whether the interests of the college were best served by making this a requirement. In its exercise of the authority the Oireachtas gave it, the college decided it should not apply the rule. It made a selection which gave the college a broad field of competition. As Deputy Ó Cuív has recognised, the college succeeded in selecting someone with very strong Irish and a very strong tradition in the language. Had the college excluded people who, like myself, had Irish and a strong interest in the language but not the opportunity to be fluent at the time the competition was opened, it would have narrowed the field.</p>
          <p eId="para_1009"> It is the college that should make the judgment, not the Dáil, the Members of which are not engaged on a daily basis in executing the policy responsibilities the board is given. The Dáil was right to give the board that responsibility and it made its decision with its eyes open. Many of the members of the board cannot be questioned in their commitment to the Irish language, but they made this decision. Deputy Ó Cuív is asking us to remove that decision-making power from the board that has been charged with this responsibility and to take it back onto ourselves. That is not right. The board of the college must make a decision in the context of its broader responsibilities, which include providing a quality education for the entire region. I am aware of the quality of the education the college delivers because it has been a critical element of the success of enterprise agencies in developing the medical technology sector in the region and the strong IT performance of Galway city and its environs. Many other really strong creative sectors have been delivered on foot of the good educational work of the National University of Ireland, Galway, Ollscoil na Gaillimhe. We have entrusted a board to take on a responsibility and it has executed it well. Had the board chosen a president who did not at the time of his or her appointment have fluent Irish, that would not have reduced by one iota the obligation we have set for the college to promote the Irish language in the very many ways it does. The college has a strategy, scéim na Gaeilge and a special academic unit. It has made a huge commitment to the language and we are asking it to do more in this sphere to help us to deliver our policy for the Gaeltacht. We should continue with the present policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1010"> I can see the argument articulated by Sinn Féin's Deputy Peader Tóibín. He would like a total immersion university through the medium of Irish. That is not the public policy in place at present. We expect NUIG to meet its responsibility to the Irish language as well as its other responsibilities. While there is an internal consistency in what the Deputy says, I dispute Deputy Ó Cuív's assertion that by opposing his Bill we are reneging on the principle of the immersion policy we are seeking to build for the Gaeltacht. I do not accept that. In the Gaeltacht, we are trying to ensure that native Irish speakers have the language teaching and quality of education that allow them to protect and grow their communities. I was in Ráth Chairn in Deputy Tóibín's constituency today where it was inspirational to see the commitment among the parents, teachers and children to the school they were delivering. That is a different matter from the assertion that we should insist on a total immersion programme for a university with wider responsibilities to the region of which Galway is a part. While that is a debate for another day, I do not consider that it could be easily done. We are struggling enough to deliver what we are doing. We will have to create innovative mechanisms, such as e-hubs, to ensure we get the quality teaching across the range of second-level programmes we need to deliver a genuine Irish language immersion education in secondary schools. It is not possible to go beyond that and hope one will get a broadly based university across the diversity of programmes without being able to tap into wider non-Irish speaking skills that make up a major part of a successful university in today's reality. One needs access to non-Irish staff, never mind what languages they speak.</p>
          <p eId="para_1011"> One needs to have a mix of languages and culture. Indeed, NUIG has been very strong in itself developing the internationalisation of its staff and student base. It would not have been able to do that under the old legislative dispensation. I do not dispute for one moment the commitment of either Deputy Ó Cuív or Deputy Tóibín in this area. Stepping back, however, to look at my own responsibilities and the way we seek to ensure we empower leaders to perform the tasks we set them, it would be wrong for the Oireachtas to rap the knuckles of a board which is very committed to the purpose we have given it, and to delivering that effectively, and say it cannot operate the discretion the legislators who were here in 1997 and 2006 gave them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1012">It would be a step backwards and would not do something for the greater promotion of the Irish language. It would simply narrow the choice the college would have in selecting its president and would not enhance the policies which the Deputies want it to fulfil in the other spheres.</p>
          <p eId="para_1013"> I cannot support the Deputy's proposal, though I support much of what he said. I agree that many of our Irish teachers are not of the standard we need in order to deliver a spoken language which inspires a love for it in young people and, as Deputy Tóibín said, we need to do much better in this regard. I am committed to doing so and the Gaeltacht policy is a success, with 80% of primary schools and 96% of secondary schools stepping up to the plate and committing to putting in place a plan for their schools to drive forward the language, a bit like at NUIG. That plan will be embedded in schools and we will support them with extra teaching resources, extra training, support with planning and innovative hubs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1014"> I thank the Deputies for putting this forward. It is a worthwhile debate because we need to think through what we want to achieve with our Irish language policy. In my period in this job - however long I have - I want to lift the commitment in the Department and across the whole system to teach Irish in a way that is more alive and which inspires love and commitment. We are doing that with our reform of the junior cycle and of the primary curriculum, where there is a shift from an emphasis on a memory-based exam to one on projects in which young people can get involved. There will be a focus on the spoken language and there are many worthwhile policies which will, I hope, ensure Irish becomes stronger but I do not think the Deputy's proposal is among such policies so I cannot support it.</p>

          <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív<recordedTime time="2017-11-30T18:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1015">The Minister's arguments are totally flawed. When the 2006 Act was passed it was not foreseen that NUIG would ever take the extraordinary decision not to require the president of the college to be able to do business in both of our official languages. That is why it was not included in the Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_1016"> We delegate certain powers to authorities but we in this House have never delegated powers in such a way that, if we believe they have been misused, we cannot overrule them. I have been a strong proponent of not handing all power away to non-elected people. What is the point of having an Oireachtas or Dáil Éireann if the people cannot affect policy, if ultimately the people are not sovereign and non-elected groups can do what they want without question from us?</p>
          <p eId="para_1017"> The Minister said being able to speak Irish is not necessary and that a policy can be promoted without it but languages are about communication and I believe that English speakers who do not speak Irish, and have no experience of being able to speak in two languages with full facility, do not fully understand this. Languages are about doing business but let us suppose that somebody was appointed to NUI Galway who did not have English - it would be farcical. They could have the best policies in the world but they would not be able to communicate with the constituency in its own language.</p>
          <p eId="para_1018"> Irish is an everyday part of Galway and in recent years the city council and mayors have made brave efforts to ensure that Irish is part of everyday discourse. When dealing with the public, the president of NUIG has, up until now, always been able to communicate in whichever of the two official languages was appropriate on a given occasion. Whether it was internal or external, this was no problem because the Act states that the president must have English as well. That may sound trite but it highlights that, to do the job properly, Irish is a necessary qualification as much as high academic achievements are. Irish is a day-to-day requirement, both within the university and with the general public, in order to do the job properly. It is not some ornament but this does not seem to be fully realised by the opponents of this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1019"> In practice, if there have been controversies - and there have been some, such as relating to appointments, promotions and gender discrimination - the president would have been able to defend the college's position or announce changes in the media, on TG4 or Raidió na Gaeltachta as well as in the English-language media but the Minister is proposing that we Irish speakers will have to go to other media if we want to hear what the president of the college is saying. This is in a city which is partly in the Gaeltacht, is on the edge of the largest Gaeltacht in the country and is where the Irish language is part of everyday business. He is saying all the Irish-language sections of the university will have to switch to English when the president of the college is there. In my experience, when one English speaker enters the company everybody turns to English because all of us have a facility in English, whereas I know no Irish speaker with a third level education who cannot also speak English.</p>
          <p eId="para_1020"> Similarly, on all public occasions such as public addresses, lectures and conferrals, it has been traditional for the president to speak in Irish and English. By the Minister's move, the Irish language is something for a policy but it is not something that really counts, such as when one speaks it. It is time those of us who speak Irish every day of every week recognise that what makes a language a language is not academic books or Government policies but is, instead, people speaking it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1021">What the Minister is basically suggesting is that we open ourselves to the future possibility that the university president will not be able to function fully as a president for all of the college and all of the people in the college in the way he or she should be able to in an official language of the college, of the State and of the city, at the edge of the largest Gaeltacht in the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1022"> I do not buy the argument that there is any danger in the world we cannot get one competent person to be president of the college who happens to be bilingual. There is no absolute measure of who is the best person for every job. Interview boards have to make a call on these issues. I am sure across many disciplines, and one would be surprised where they are across the globe, there are plenty of competent people who happen to know both official languages of the State. Therefore, I do not accept the idea the university would not be able to get anybody competent. I will put it this way. Supposing the statute had been left the way it was and supposing the job was advertised and the university was honestly able to come back and state it could not get anybody it would have been an interesting situation. As it happens, this situation clearly has not arisen because the person appointed as president not only has Irish ach go bhfuil sé aige ón gcliabhán. He has it from the cradle. He is top quality and significantly qualified in business. He has operated abroad and in a university in Dublin. In fact, the fear expressed completely collapses.</p>
          <p eId="para_1023"> What I think was behind it, and I will say it on the floor of the House, is people wanted to apply for and get this job but they did not have Irish. They wanted it opened up for themselves. I am sorry, but if they were that interested they could have learned Irish. We are not speaking about imposing something huge, we are talking about working Irish and an academic qualification. We are talking about people who claim to be the best academics we could imagine. They say where there is a will there is a way. There was a year lead-in and if the calibre of people the Minister says he wants for the university were interested they could have made sure they had the necessary qualification in Irish in a year. Many people have gone abroad and achieved the equivalent in other countries in the same length of time. The Minister is calling this one wrong. He is doing a much greater disservice than he understands. I ask him to think between now and the vote next week, but I will press this Bill to the end on behalf of my party.</p>
