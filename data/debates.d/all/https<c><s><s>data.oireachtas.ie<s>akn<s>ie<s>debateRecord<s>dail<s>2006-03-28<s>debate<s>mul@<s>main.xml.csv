#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 6, inclusive, together.Mr. Justice Barron has completed all his reports. His reports on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of 1974, the Dublin bombings of 1972 and 1973, and the murder of Seamus Ludlow have each been referred to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights for consideration. I received last month Mr. Justice Barron's final report on the Dundalk bombing of 1975. This report also contains references, in the form of appendices, to other incidents that were brought to the attention of the inquiry, including bombs in Castleblayney, Dublin Airport, Silverbridge and the Miami Showband murders. The Government has not yet had an opportunity to consider the report in detail. It is currently being considered by the relevant Departments prior to consideration by the Government. As with other reports, it is envisaged that it will be referred in due course to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights.This marks the completion of the work of the commission of inquiry. I take this opportunity to put on record my gratitude to Mr. Justice Henry Barron and his predecessor, the late Mr. Justice Liam Hamilton, for all their work on these reports.On 26 April 2005, the Government appointed Mr. Patrick MacEntee SC as sole member of a commission of investigation to examine specific matters relating to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of 1974, including aspects of the Garda investigation and missing documentation. This was in accordance with the recommendations of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights which considered the Barron report on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.As the House knows, I previously granted two extensions of the timeframe for the completion of the report, from 14 November 2005 to 31 January 2006, and then again to 28 February 2006. I also published the two interim reports from Mr. MacEntee and placed copies in the Oireachtas Library. At the end of February, Mr. MacEntee informed me that more time was required to complete the inquiry to pursue a new line of investigation which has arisen. He therefore requested a further extension of the timeframe to 31 May 2006.He also provided for me a further interim report, as required by the legislation. I have published that report and have placed a copy in the Oireachtas Library. It is clear from this third interim report that Mr. MacEntee requires more time to pursue specific inquiries as there remain important opportunities to advance the investigation that might otherwise be lost. It is for that reason that I have granted the additional extension. It is, of course, unfortunate that the victims and survivors of these terrible atrocities will need to wait a further period before the final report is available. However, I believe they will agree on the importance of Mr. MacEntee being allowed sufficient time to pursue any lines of inquiry that he deems relevant.I am grateful to Mr. MacEntee for the work he has completed to date. As he is independent, I am not in a position to comment on his ongoing work. I look forward to receiving his final report in May.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I join the Taoiseach in thanking Mr. Justice Barron for the work he has done and for completing his report on the Castleblayney, Silverbridge, Miami Showband etc. aspects as contained in his terms of reference. Will the Taoiseach indicate to the House when he intends to put that into the public domain via the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights? Is it his intention that the Opposition leaders be shown sight of the report before it is released through that committee?Does the Taoiseach expect that the latest deadline of 31 May for the report from the MacEntee commission of inquiry will be met? On the third interim report, to which the Taoiseach referred, and Mr. MacEntee's reference to what he called a variety of contacts and the fact that a meeting with certain entities whose assistance had been sought by the commission for some time had become feasible, does the Taoiseach know what variety of contacts and specific entities are referred to? Is that reference to the British authorities or to loyalist paramilitaries?On a separate area of inquiry by Mr. Paddy MacEntee SC, which relates to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform's missing files, does the Taoiseach have any knowledge or information on whether that segment of the inquiry has concluded? Is he satisfied that Mr. MacEntee has received the co-operation and assistance from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform that the situation requires? Does the Taoiseach know whether Mr. MacEntee is getting more co-operation from the British authorities than Mr. Justice Barron experienced? Will the Taoiseach give the House an approximate date by which he thinks the investigation by Mr. MacEntee's commission of inquiry will be concluded?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I hope the completion of the Barron work by the Department will not take too long. The only delays that have arisen in any of the reports seem to have happened when decisions were made on whether to redraft them on foot of debates, which always seem to take place, involving speculation about names. I think the reports on some of the other incidents, such as the bombings at Dublin Airport and Silverbridge, are shorter in substance than some of the others. I hope we will be able to move on the matter. I certainly will not delay it. The intention is to bring it to the Government and get it to the committee as quickly as possible after it has gone through the departmental system and the Office of the Attorney General.Deputy Rabbitte correctly stated, in respect of the second issue, that Mr. MacEntee hopes to produce a report by late May. I have no reason to think he will seek a further extension, although he has sought a few extensions already. It depends on how he thinks he is progressing.On the work by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the Garda files, Mr. MacEntee raised two issues in his first interim report. He raised the issue of criticism of archiving arrangements. He said that some documentation — he did not specify it — which was previously missing had been located. I interpret that reference as relating to Garda files. As I understand it, he is getting full co-operation on that aspect of his work. I am not sure what he will say about it all at the end. I have a feeling he will say things from bits that are picked up.Deputy Rabbitte asked about Mr. MacEntee's references to "certain entities". The Department of the Taoiseach's interpretation of the matter is that Mr. MacEntee is talking about the British authorities. Having read the report carefully, I am aware that Mr. MacEntee does not explicitly refer to the British authorities, but that is how all my good colleagues interpret that reference. It seems to open up the possibility of co-operation with people who did not give information previously. I do not know whether it will come to anything significant, although obviously I hope it will.There has been a variety of contacts, including one meeting of significance with the "certain entities" last month. As a result of these contacts, the commission has received information in the form of certain security and intelligence documentation, a portion of which the commission considers to be material to its investigation. I assume that information was not received previously. The information in question has been sought by the commission since last summer. While we are not aware of its significance, we are grateful that it has come across.The commission has also received assurances from the "certain entities" that information relating to two separate parts of the investigation will be made available to the commission at the end of this month — now, in other words. As I understand it, the commission is confident that the information in question will come across. It is obvious that the information from my officials is just as we get it, but I understand that the contacts with the "certain entities" have opened up the possibility of meeting other individuals who are important to the investigation. To date, the commission has met one individual who has provided material assistance. It is actively seeking to contact two other individuals it believes may be able to assist in the investigation. That is the reason for the work and it appears to be a fairly hard line of progress.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	3	I have given the Taoiseach credit in the past for his interest in this from the beginning, and I repeat that now. I agree with Deputy Rabbitte in respect of Mr. Justice Barron and Mr. MacEntee. The truth about matters such as this is of critical importance to the integrity and credibility of any Government. One of my near neighbours was blown up and killed in the Dublin bombings. The fact that there never has been finality on it still causes great upset to the families involved. Closure is very important for them and politically for the Government. It was a long time ago, and as the Taoiseach has previously pointed out, this is the first occasion where it has been possible to have a comprehensive analysis of investigations into these atrocities at what was a terrible time for politics and for people on this island.Has the Taoiseach raised this matter recently in his discussions with the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair? I know the Attorney General considered the possibility of taking a case to the European Court of Justice against the British Government. This did not work with regard to the families of Justice for the Forgotten, so I presume the Government does not want to pursue a case that is not likely to be successful. Will the Taoiseach inform the House whether the Attorney General is still considering that option or is it likely to run into the sand? I support the request for the extension from Mr. MacEntee in the hope that this might bring finality. In the context of the Government's analysis and the consideration by the Attorney General, where do matters stand now?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	4	I have continually raised the inquiries aspect with the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, and sought to apply pressure as regards co-operation with our investigations. We have received a great deal of co-operation in recent years. Numerous Secretaries of State have been involved in this aspect and have helped. I always like to see more help and more files and so on, but so far they have been helpful. There is never any indication that any of these issues will be investigated by the British authorities in their own jurisdiction, as I, the other party leaders and the committee have urged. I do not believe this is something they will do.As regards the Attorney General's position, the advice in that regard is now quite clear. While he continues to look at other options so that no approach is totally ruled out, he has advised that the chances of getting anywhere as regards the European Court of Justice are poor, based on the time limitation. His judgment is that this would not work and he believes the time limitation would prohibit it. He has given me lengthy advice in this regard. I am not saying there are not other avenues, but that one is closed.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	5	I add my appreciation to Mr. Justice Barron for his work. On Mr. Patrick MacEntee's request for an extension, is the Taoiseach convinced that this will be the last request for an extension or are we involved in an open-ended process in the hope that additional evidence and personnel might become available? In regard to that extension, is there any news on the €9 million remembrance fund? I understood from the Taoiseach's answer in January that December 2006 would be the deadline for applications to that fund. Will the Taoiseach indicate what the interest or take-up has been in that fund to date and whether an extension of the December date is being considered?Following his reply about the European Court of Human Rights being a possible course of action to bring about greater co-operation from the UK Government, the Taoiseach stated that this might not be a good idea or that it was not available to us, but he also stated that the Attorney General was examining a number of ways in which we could follow this up. Is he in a position to tell us any of the other ways or any progress that has been made in this matter or whether he is happy with the current co-operation from the UK Government?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	6	Looking at Mr. MacEntee's third report, it depends on the end of May deadline, whether he has the information he expects by the end of March, and the two subsequent people who have been identified who it is expected will talk to the inquiry. I cannot be sure except that it may open up lines of inquiry, but Mr. MacEntee seems to believe that May would provide enough time. Obviously in these events if something else opens up, I would be open to being persuaded by him if he believes that can bring finality to it.I say the same to Deputy Sargent as I said to Deputy Kenny. The Attorney General's view is that the time limitation of bringing a case to Europe on this would not work. There are many precedents for that, not least the Justice for the Forgotten case. He has not ruled out that when we come to the completion of this work and see all the reports going through the committee, including Mr. MacEntee's report, it may not give up new opportunities. He has not come down on any specific one, as I understand it, but he is keeping his options open where he may be able to frame subsequent cases. It might be difficult but he certainly does not want to rule that out in the future.I followed up on the issue Deputy Sargent raised in the House in January. If he recalls, he suggested running an advertisement campaign, which we did in the national and local newspapers. That generated many inquiries. We also highlighted the matter in Civil Service offices which generated more interest. I do not know the exact number of cases or if they are processed but it did generate a range of activity. It was a worthwhile exercise.

Is he aware that Justice for the Forgotten has established that the documentation pertaining to that request is within the British national archives? Has he had such a trawl in his Department's records and is the corresponding copy of that letter in his Department's files and any response that might have issued from the British authorities to the request?What is the Taoiseach's view of the former Taoiseach's refusal to co-operate with Mr. Justice Barron and the subsequent Oireachtas committee's deliberations in regard to his series of reports? Is the Taoiseach aware whether the former Taoiseach has co-operated — if the requests were made — with Mr. PatrickMacEntee's ongoing inquiry? If it is the case that such a request has been made and has not been acceded to, will the Taoiseach call on the former Taoiseach to now co-operate with Mr. MacEntee before the conclusion of his work? When does the Taoiseach intend to publish the most recent report received from Mr. Justice Barron which the Taoiseach advised the House in his earlier response was received last month relating to the December 1975 bombing of Kay's Tavern in Dundalk and other incidents that occurred not only in the Border area, including in Castleblayney, County Monaghan? Will he bring it forward in the same way as previous Barron reports and refer it to the committee that has already deliberated on the previous reports? The Taoiseach referred to Mr. MacEntee's interim reports but as this is a unique process, what is his intention regarding Mr. MacEntee's final report and how does he intend to process it? Will it be brought to committee or brought before a full sitting of this House? Has he given some consideration to how the final MacEntee report will be processed when received this May?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	8	I will treat the report in the same way as I treat any reports. I published his interim reports immediately. When his final report is published it will be discussed by the Government and also in this House. If any parts of the report are relevant to the committee's work, I will supply the report to the committee as I have done with regard to all reports on this level. To the best of my knowledge, archives relating to the 1974 and 1975 periods have all been made public at this stage.The former Taoiseach, Mr. Liam Cosgrave, has stated his position on these matters. I do not take issue with Mr. Cosgrave nor will I do so.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	9	It is obvious that to clear up all these issues the full co-operation of the British State authorities is necessary, otherwise it will be a sham. What hope is there of getting the British State to reveal all the information it has on these issues in the Republic when in a far more recent case in Northern Ireland, the Blair regime is actively frustrating the full inquiry into the Pat Finucane murder? Does the Taoiseach agree that Prime Minister Blair is treating him, the head of the Irish Government, and the Irish people, with contempt, by continually stonewalling and refusing to direct the security services in Britain and in Northern Ireland to reveal all they know? What action will the Taoiseach take if Mr. MacEntee states in his final report that he has not received sufficient information from those who have that information — the British security forces — to draw definite conclusions? This is an extremely frustrating matter for elected representatives of Dáil Éireann who have been coming into this House for years asking the Taoiseach to get the co-operation of Mr. Blair. Since certain political commentators believe that Mr. Blair, like Mr. Bush, is directly in touch with God, I suggest the Taoiseach might pray he would be moved to reveal all. This seems to be the only hope left at this stage.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	10	We embarked upon an investigation process some years ago. The late Mr. Justice Hamilton did excellent work and this work was completed by Mr. Justice Barron. We have got as much data as we could for all these cases from everybody both here and from British intelligence whether that was through the NIO, British security or wherever. They were extraordinary times. We have tried to go back and follow them through as much as is possible and to assist the relatives.As I have continually outlined throughout this process, the people whom it is most important to help — I certainly tried to do so — are the victims. The victims must be central to all we do in dealing with the terrible events of the past. I have met several victims' groups and officials and am in ongoing contact with many victims on all sides. We provided financial support to the victims' groups. We and the British have set up a number of inquiries to deal with specific cases. We got the British Government to carry out the Bloody Sunday tribunal for six or seven years, at enormous cost. It was vital that was done. We have also received much co-operation.I answered questions last week on the Finucane case. I devoted a complete Question Time to it and gave my clear view on where I would like to have seen more progress.They were very troubled times, which gave rise to enormous difficulties. When one looks back at those times and on the way matters were handled, they were even more troubled than we thought as we lived through them. One can see how people acted and how things happened. They would not happen today, but we are not talking about today, we are talking about 30 years ago. There were so many events and actions, and the Garda Síochána, Departments and others were stretched. It would be easy for me to criticise people of that period but I have no intention of doing so as it would serve absolutely——

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	12	We are talking about our own system. Much more will come out on these issues. Deputy Rabbitte asked me to follow up the court case, which I did. We will hear much more about that also. It will be another extraordinary saga of those times.There is only so much data we can discover in these cases. For the past five or six years we trawled as extensively as we possibly could for information. I have left no stone unturned in this regard. However, we will not be able to re-enact everything. The British have set up a well resourced historical inquiries team that will provide a thorough examination of unresolved deaths throughout the Troubles. The Police Ombudsman is reviewing cases involving the police, which is useful and can bring closure for victims and survivors, and will hopefully build community confidence, but it will not solve all the cases. Some of the reports that are coming down the track will probably open up more than they close, but that is inevitable.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	13	The Taoiseach has turned over the stones but Mr. Blair has not done so.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	14	I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. Perhaps this is not a fair question to ask but, arising from the discussion in the House on the Finucane murder and the decision of the House to make an all-party recommendation for a full public inquiry on that issue, is the Taoiseach satisfied that the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, is on the level in his discussions with the Taoiseach on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings? Has the Prime Minister all the information he needs to give the Taoiseach a straight answer to a straight question? Is the utmost and fullest co-operation available to Mr. MacEntee, Mr. Justice Barron and the Irish Government in this regard? Is the Taoiseach satisfied, man to man, that the Prime Minister is in a position to give a full, honest and truthful answer that information is concealed, even from the British Government, that might be relevant to this matter? Some people decided to do this. Instructions were given and people placed bombs in cars. People died and people were murdered as a consequence and that pain still affects those families. I know the Taoiseach would like to see that matter sorted out. Perhaps this is a question he cannot answer but I thought I should ask it anyway.

In respect of the correspondence to which I referred earlier, I asked the Taoiseach was he aware of that correspondence which issued in May 1975, a year following the 17 May 1974 atrocities. He did not answer on that. The response the Taoiseach gave me in respect of whether copies or records of the exchange of correspondence were in his Department was that everything in his Department has been published.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	16	Or they have been sent to the archive. Everything from my Department goes to the archive.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	17	Therefore, something may be in the archive that has not been published. Is that the case? Will the Taoiseach say whether the documents to which I already referred, which were initiated and issued by a former Taoiseach and in respect of which, I understand, responses were received, are in his Department? I must ask that question because if all those documents are not published how can the Taoiseach's answer satisfy my question, if they may be in the archive? If they are not, how does he explain their being missing?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	18	On that question, I do not believe anybody is saying they are missing. I am aware of them because I know that Justice for the Forgotten found the records in the British archive. Data and information in my Department, even if redacted and amended under the 30-year rule from 1974-75 are now in our archive. It is available for public use and historians have already gone through much of the data and written a considerable amount about it. As to whether that letter and a reply to it are there, I do not know, but at this stage it would have been passed over. If the reply was a straightforward one, it would not have been held back unless it was a matter concerning security and intelligence.On the question of when I will publish the report, as I said to Deputy Rabbitte, as soon as I have the report and it is through the system in terms of the Departments and the Attorney General's office, I will bring it to the Cabinet and publish it as soon as possible.In reply to Deputy Kenny's question — when is one ever sure? I am happy with the issue of Derry and that we got full closure on that. On the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, the British authorities have been helpful. They have gone out of their way, through various Secretaries of State, and have helped judges. I know that the late Mr. Justice Hamilton received a great number of files earlier on and a great deal of co-operation, as did Mr. Justice Barron. The latter's report is probably as close as we will ever get in regard to this matter. Members will recall that Mr. Justice Barron fairly well pieced together the whole circumstances of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. There were some other issues which should have been followed up, which we considered — the question of the van, the UDR man staying overnight in a Dublin hotel and other such issues. They came under the terms of reference and I hope we will get some more finality on that.Deputy Kenny particularly asked me to reply on the question of the Finucane murder. I do not want to leave on record that I am happy with the position — I am not. For whatever reason, the British Government has taken the view of the Inquiries Act and, in that respect I have to agree to differ with the British Prime Minister and the British Government. It is not compatible with what we agreed in Weston Park, with what Judge Cory stated at the time of his report or with what he has said now. It is not compatible with the kind of inquiry we thought we would get under the 1921 legislation. The British Government held back, it changed the legislation to the Inquiries Act. As I said previously, I cannot stand here or anywhere else and say this is a full, independent judicial inquiry for one reason concerning one clause. As I said publicly, I hope they do not find a judge to take that job. I hope no self-respecting judge takes that job because if he finds something, he cannot use it or show it. Therefore how is he fulfilling an independent judicial position? How is the inquiry full, if he has information which he cannot put forward, and how is it independent? It is neither what we nor the Finucane family nor all the rights activists who have helped them since 1989, have sought, namely, a full, independent judicial inquiry. I have said to Prime Minister Blair, I have put on the record of the House and I have stated in the UK that I do not think what we are being offered is full, independent or judicial. I have my reasons for believing that is so but they are my reasons. There is no point in me speculating but it is easy enough for people to work out by the fact I am saying I have my reasons.As I know this record is closely watched by the British authorities when we discuss Northern Ireland issues, I say again that if they want to convince people of what everybody knows, that there was collusion at whatever level, what would change in the world? We all know that. It is just for it to be proved in an independent, judicial fashion. I have met nobody, except the British Government, who believes the Inquiries Act will give that and I have met a great many people on this issue.

In my Department, the number of staff allocated to deal with freedom of information requests is one higher executive officer, who is the freedom of information liaison officer and is responsible for receiving and monitoring requests and co-ordination generally of requirements under the Act as they relate to this Department; 18 key decision makers across divisions, mainly at assistant principal level, who are responsible for general examination and primary decision making; and two assistant secretaries and two principal officers who are responsible for the internal review process. All freedom of information applications to my Department are processed by statutorily designated officials in accordance with the 1997 and 2003 Acts and, in accordance with those statutes, I have no role in the processing of individual applications.MonthReceivedGrantedPart GrantedRefusedNo RecordsTransferredWithdrawnJan1000100Feb8212102Mar2100100April4020011May1000010June5210200July3210000Aug3110100Sept0000000Oct12522300Nov1010000Dec5113000Total4514107923MonthReceivedGrantedPart GrantedRefusedNo RecordsTransferredWithdrawnJan211Feb3111Mar11April211May211June7331July6321Aug51211Sept51211Oct1645142Nov5212Dec7511Total6122184125MonthReceivedGrantedPart GrantedRefusedNo RecordsTransferredWithdrawnJan981Feb11Mar4*AprilMayJuneJulyAugSeptOctNovDecTotal*ongoing

I knew the Ceann Comhairle would come around at me some way or other. That is why I wanted to put that in. My question to the Taoiseach is this. Can he confirm that the Department of Finance has written to the Secretary General of his Department requesting that any development within his Department which might impact upon the Freedom of Information Act would be made known to the Department of Finance forthwith?My second question relates to the issue of fees for appeals in respect of the Taoiseach's Department and, indeed, all others. If somebody applies to his Department under the Freedom of Information Act, is refused for whatever reason and appeals that decision, the cost of appeal is €150. If the Information Commissioner allows the appeal, there is no rebate to the person who makes that successful appeal.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	26	Is it practical, commonsense and fair if an appeal is allowed by the Information Commissioner in the case of a freedom of information request to the Taoiseach's Department, where there are a small number of refusals, that the appeal charge be repaid to the person who lodged the successful appeal?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	27	Deputy Kenny did raise the first issue with me. As he will recall, I was not aware of it either. I understand the situation was changed in that regard to facilitate litigation. Action has been taken since then to highlight the matter. A further process exists through which aspects of legislation that curtail freedom of information are examined by the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service and reported to the Department of Finance and the Information Commissioner. The latter has considered the reports made by each Department and Minister to the joint committee. I have outlined the areas of non-disclosure in my Department, which pertain to the National Archives Act 1986, and I understand that the commissioner has no problem with these because the information in question is usually withheld for security reasons.On the second issue, an internal appeal to my Department costs €75 at most, while an appeal to the Information Commissioner costs €150. The cost for medical card holders is €25 and €50, respectively. Appeals concerning personal information are entirely exempt from those fees. An appeal to the Information Commissioner is a quasi-judicial process, the completion of which can take many months involving a considerable amount of work. The procedure followed by my Department is a fair reflection of the system. The cost of a first appeal is €15 and there is no cost for personal information. As the cost of processing is in the order of €425, I do not think the charge is unreasonable.

This is a very narrow question, referring specifically to the Taoiseach's Department.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	32	The Taoiseach either shares the concern or he does not.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	35	There are no immediate plans to extend the retirement age of officers and other ranks in the Defence Forces. The White Paper on Defence 2000 and the earlier Defence Forces review implementation plan recommended a reduction in retirement ages in an effort to address the age profile and fitness of the Defence Forces. More recently, however, the retirement age for people recruited to the public service has been increased. Improvements in the age profile in the Defence Forces have been achieved through a programme which included early retirement packages, regular recruitment and short-term contracts.A key element in military life is the need for personnel to maintain a level of fitness for combat readiness. There is constant need to balance this requirement with the need to retain experience and expertise, particularly at managerial level, in the Defence Forces. I will continue to monitor the needs of the Defence Forces in this area and, mindful of ongoing experiences in other areas of the public service, will introduce changes if required.
#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-party	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-dob	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	36	I acknowledge that the age profile of members was a significant issue for the Defence Forces prior to publication of the White Paper and that there were concerns about ensuring that members' fitness levels were commensurate with the duties required of them. The Minister hit the nail on the head at the end of his contribution. There are two aspects to this issue, the officer corps and other ranks. Some movement has been made by the Minister with regard to other ranks, and rightly so. The period of service has been extended to 20 years for those who came into the forces after 1994. That was a good idea as much expertise is amassed in that time.I ask the Minister to perhaps review the issue for personnel who reach the age limit and who have certain qualifications that would be required for managerial posts. An administrative side, consisting of IT for example, is needed in addition to the operational side of the Defence Forces. Certain skills are needed that can only be required over a period of time. Nevertheless, I am concerned that the age profile is constantly kept in check.With regard to the officer body, I am aware that commandants retire at 56, which is very young, as the Ceann Comhairle, to whom I listened on television on Sunday night a few weeks ago discussing people's ability to do jobs regardless of age, will appreciate. Such personnel may have much expertise but are caught in no man's land. At 56, a person, while still relatively young, may be too old to take up another job. The Pensions Commission report states that no pension should be given out until age 50, after 30 years' service. Many professions are looking at extending the retirement age because of the increased life expectancy.I ask the Minister to examine two issues. The first concerns the officer body, where commandants retire at 56. This should be considered in view of the fact that our increased overseas commitment has placed a strain on the officer corps. Many officers have to leave the Defence Forces at 56 years of age, despite having much expertise that could be put to valuable use. The same applies to other ranks. After 20 years' service, their expertise could perhaps be used in the administrative side of the Defence Forces.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	37	The statistics for retirement by commandants on age grounds, as opposed to voluntary retirement, show that 26 retired voluntarily in 2000, while only three had reached the age of retirement. In 2001, five retired on age grounds, with 29 retiring voluntarily. That is the trend. Many of the commandants are retiring voluntarily and are not compelled on reaching the stipulated age. In other words, they retire at an age under 56.Deputy Timmins will be aware that the maximum retirement age for officers ranges from 47 for a lieutenant, which is at one end of the scale, to 63 for a lieutenant-general, at the other end of the scale. I appreciate Deputy Timmins's comments regarding the age profile of the Army. We must keep the age profile below a certain level. That was the main criticism levelled at the general profile of the Army in the 1980s.With regard to retaining people, I presume the Deputy is referring to people of officer and non-officer rank who have acquired certain qualifications. I will keep the matter under ongoing review.
#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-party	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-dob	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	38	With regard to the officer corps, what is commonly known in the Defence Forces as a hump period may occur. In the early 1970s, for example, a larger number than usual were taken in, and there were three or four years when officers were caught in that trap. The Minister correctly pointed out that the number of officers who have retired on age grounds has been small, and I appreciate that, but in the next few years that number may increase just for a short period, and perhaps action can be taken for that cohort.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	39	We will keep the matter under review.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	40	Following a request from the United Nations, the EU is examining the provision of a supporting operation, under an EU flag, for MONUC, the UN mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Various options for the mission are being considered within the EU, which has indicated that it is positively disposed towards supporting MONUC. Fact-finding missions to the Democratic Republic of Congo and to the United Nations in New York have been undertaken.The main purpose of the mission is to be available to support MONUC during the upcoming election process. The EU will not substitute for MONUC, but rather will provide a supporting role in the event of unrest during the election period. The current plan is that a protection force, possibly up to 400 troops, will be located on the ground, probably in Kinshasa. Outside of that, there will be an over-the-horizon force, either in Europe or possibly in a neighbouring state, ready to deploy should it be required. Total numbers could be approximately 1,500.Germany will provide the operational headquarters for the mission, which will be based in Potsdam. The force headquarters, which will be supplied by France, will be based in Kinshasa. Germany and France will together provide approximately two thirds of the force. The mission is in the initial planning stages. The specific structure, organisation, tasks and roles of the force and the contributors to it have yet to be fully elaborated. This should happen over the next couple of weeks.Ireland is positively disposed towards the proposed mission and supports a positive response from the EU to the UN. In this regard, Ireland wrote to the chairman of the EU military staff confirming that Ireland was prepared to offer up to ten headquarters personnel for the mission subject to national decision-making procedures, which will be adhered to. Our proposed contribution is well in line with that of other contributing member states and has to be looked at in the context of our existing major commitments to peacekeeping operations in Africa and the Balkans.I assure the Deputy that any contribution will satisfy the requirements of the Defence Acts in terms of participation. Discussions are ongoing in the UN on an appropriate mandate for the mission. As the proposed offer involves fewer than ten troops, Dáil approval is not required in this instance. I cannot state specifically when the UN Security Council resolution will be passed or when a Government decision will be made. However, I expect this to be in the next few weeks, given that the elections in the Democratic Republic of Congo are due in June. I understand that Germany, which will lead the force, expects to deploy at the end of May or the beginning of June.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	41	The Minister and everybody else is aware that the security situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo is extremely volatile. It appears the country has been in the grip of civil war and subsequent humanitarian disaster since the 1960s. The elections scheduled for June have been postponed a number of times due to security concerns. There is no doubt that any mission to the Democratic Republic of Congo for Irish troops would be extremely dangerous. Is the Minister assured that our troops have the necessary training and experience for this? He referred to this partially in his reply. Do the troops have the experience to deal with the situation in the country? I do not mean this as an insult to Irish troops. However, I recall that three years ago French authorities rebuffed an offer by the Irish Government to send Irish Rangers to join the UN mission in the Congo to help stabilise the State. Will the Minister provide reassurance on this point? What is the envisaged length of time for the mission?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	42	I will answer the Deputy's last question first. If Irish troops are committed, it is envisaged that the mission will last approximately four months. I appreciate the Deputy's comments regarding the security situation on the ground. The Deputy will appreciate that a heavy force is already in the Democratic Republic of Congo. MONUC consists of almost 17,000 appropriately armed troops.The United Nations has requested the EU to supply a force, of a rapid reaction type, to help during the election period. That would be available to help if disturbances occured during the election period. The force will consist of two elements, 400 troops on the ground based in Kinshasa and more than 1,000 troops based either in a neighbouring state or somewhere in Europe, which can be called upon if required. We have written to the EU military council to make an initial offer of up to ten officers, who would be based in headquarters. That would either be in Potsdam or Kinshasa. The offer is being considered and we have received a reply stating the appropriateness of the offer.Approximately 1,000 troops will be provided by France and Germany and 500 will be provided by all the other countries. Our offer is well in line with proposals made by other countries, though I will not go into detail on those.The safety of our troops always weighs heavily on me and the Government when a request is made for their deployment overseas. We and the military authorities are satisfied that Irish troops are sufficiently trained and have sufficient force protection assets such as body armour to ensure they will be safe in the Congo. This was carefully weighed when we decided to respond positively to the EU request.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	43	As our defence and peacekeeping operations expand is the Minister confident the triple lock mechanism will be maintained? I have concerns that, due to the length of time UN, Government and Dáil decisions, required for the triple lock, take, the Government may in future try to subvert it by sending troops on missions without the conditions having been satisfied. I and the Labour Party regard the triple lock as a vital mechanism and we are determined that it should be maintained.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	44	I am delighted Deputy Sherlock takes that view because I also believe it is a vital mechanism and should be maintained. Deputy Gormley agrees, meaning there is virtual unanimity in the House that it should be so, and I assure him that every time Irish troops are committed abroad the requirements of the triple lock will be rigidly adhered to. The first element of the triple lock involves a Government decision to commit troops abroad. The second part is a UN resolution. The third element is a Dáil motion, which only applies when more than 12 troops are committed. In this case we have offered ten and if it is accepted we do not, strictly speaking, need a Dáil resolution under the Defence Act 1954, I will recommend to the Government that the proposal is discussed in the House.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	45	So the triple lock does not apply.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	47	All three elements of the triple lock apply when more than 12 troops are committed overseas. When there are less than 12, two elements apply and they have been applied in this case.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	48	The Garda Síochána has primary responsibility for law and order, including the protection of the internal security of the State. Among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces is the provision of aid to the civil power, meaning in practice to assist, when requested, the Garda Síochána, which duties include the protection and guarding of vital installations, the provision of certain security escorts etc. As the Deputy will appreciate, it would not be appropriate for me, for reasons of security, to comment on the exact nature of the deployment to Shannon Airport on 1 March and 5 March 2006.The estimated additional cost to the Defence Forces was approximately €60,000 in respect of security duty allowance, food, fuel and hire of equipment.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	49	I thank the Minister for his reply. Can he confirm that security was breached at Shannon on that occasion by four peace activists? Does he agree we were very lucky that those people were peaceful? Does he share my concerns that security at Shannon could be breached at some stage by terrorists? Is he confident the Defence Forces will be in a position to defend the Irish people from a serious terrorist attack at Shannon? I understand the Minister is responsible for emergency planning but is an emergency plan in place to deal with such an attack? Given the declaration in the Constitution that there is only one army in the State is he happy that the Commander in Chief of a foreign army addressed his troops at Shannon Airport?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	50	I am aware of the incident to which Deputy Gormley refers. I do not have much detail on it but believe it was a minor incident. In such situations the Garda Síochána requests the assistance of the Army, which is entitled to go to the aid of the civil power, namely the Garda, when they are in need of assistance. The Garda made such a request in this case, as is normal when a Head of State, especially one of such a major power as America, visits Shannon Airport. The Army studied the request and was satisfied that it was appropriate to aid the civil power in this case. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, whom I consult on these matters, is satisfied that the amount of troops deployed alongside the gardaí was commensurate with the risk.Ireland is happy to provide security for any American President who might land at Shannon, regardless of whether the Government of the day or individual Ministers agree with his policies. If, for example, a member of Deputy Gormley's party becomes president of the US and lands at Shannon we will equally provide security for him or her.I am satisfied that Irish troops have sufficient training. There is a Ranger Wing and the force possesses a wide range of equipment and is provided with specific training for situations of this kind.As Deputy Gormley said, the Constitution provides that only one legal army can exist in the State. We are satisfied that the provisions for allowing troops to transit through Shannon Airport do not contravene that provision. The Deputy asked if I was happy that the Commander in Chief of a foreign army addressed troops at Shannon Airport. As I understand it no meeting was planned but President Bush happened to meet the troops as they were transiting through the airport and he took the opportunity to talk to them as their Commander in Chief. I do not have any difficulty with that.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	54	It does.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	56	It entails a number of elements. First, the medical fallout will be dealt with by the Department of Health and Children, which has an emergency public health plan to deal with such situations. The Army and the Garda Síochána have had specific training to deal with such an eventuality. It is impossible for me to guarantee we can successfully prevent a terrorist attack. Larger countries than ours have failed to do so but we are as prepared as we can be. If the attack involves chemical weapons or nuclear fallout the specific plans include the deployment of trained staff and equipment, among other things. The matter is discussed at least every month by the emergency planning committee.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	57	The role of the Defence Forces is set out in the White Paper on Defence. The Naval Service provides the maritime element of the Defence Forces and has a general responsibility to meet contingent and actual maritime defence requirements. Arising from the White Paper the primary role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the EU. Fishery protection accounts for over 90% of operations.There are no plans to expand the role of the Naval Service or for the involvement of Naval Service assets in overseas missions, although individual members of the Naval Service may be deployed on overseas peace support operations, as they have been in the past, within a ceiling of 850 personnel serving overseas at any one time.
#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-party	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-dob	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	58	Can the Minister confirm that the fleet replacement involving three vessels over the next four to five years, will take place? I will understand if the Minister cannot answer this now but I believe the Naval Service, due to its geographical location, is somewhat apart from the mainstream of the Defence Forces. How many civil servants in the Department are assigned to naval matters? While fisheries protection amounts to 90% of this work and is the primary role of the service, does the fight against drugs need to be escalated? The quantity of drugs brought in by sea has increased over recent years. A greater role could be found for the Naval Service and the Minister should examine the possibility of deploying craft that could react more quickly than the current fleet. Has the Minister considered expanding the Naval Service to assist in the fight against drugs?I read an article that referred to one of our naval vessels having an operating theatre and medical facilities on board. Does the Minister see a role for this vessel when Ireland assists in humanitarian crises? Depending on the location, this vessel could assist in providing medical relief.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	59	I spoke to officials in my Department today about the replacement of the three ships. Arrangements are being put in place to effect this. We must decide if we are to replace like with like or introduce new ships.I do not know how many civil servants deal specifically with the Naval Service but most of them probably also deal with other issues. I will retrieve the information and revert to the Deputy.The role of the Naval Service is set out in the White Paper on defence and we follow its proposals. Some 90% of the role of the Naval Service involves fisheries protection duties. In the opinion of experts this requires a flotilla of eight ships. Each has a life span of approximately 30 years and three are now approaching the end of that period.The Naval Service acts as an aid to the civil power, so Deputy Timmins's proposal that it assist with drug enforcement and seizures is a matter for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Government. I cannot unilaterally decide such matters during Question Time.Concerning humanitarian assistance, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, is engaged in an initiative to position supplies for use during future humanitarian crises. I do not see a role for the Naval Service in this regard. Such supplies would be airlifted to ensure quick delivery to locations that have suffered as a result of a tsunami or an earthquake.

I trust the Minister is fighting for that extension to his portfolio. The Department of Defence is the one Department that could do this task correctly and we will support the Minister in his efforts to achieve this. I see a role for the Naval Service in humanitarian backup and supply to coastal countries. The ship with medical facilities on board could be used as a floating hospital.The Minister has referred several times to the White Paper published in 2000. Has he any plans to review that paper, given the escalation in the fight against drugs, the events of 11 September 2001 and the evolution of battle groups? Perhaps it is time to produce another White Paper on defence.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	66	The steering board of the European Defence Agency, EDA, met in Defence Ministers formation in Innsbruck, Austria, on 7 March 2006 and one of the items discussed was the need for a new mechanism for joint investment in research and technology projects. The EDA is proposing to establish a category A or opt-out programme with an associated budget. The first area of joint work being considered is force protection and the detection and neutralisation of a range of threats to military personnel, vehicles and installations in the context of ESDP missions. The agenda item was premised on the view that category A or opt-out programmes would enable more member states to contribute to the overall research and technology effort, would allow each member state to take its own decision on whether to contribute to such a programme and would leave control firmly in the hands of member states that choose to contribute.While discussions took place at the meeting on the outline concept of such a programme, significant further elaboration and refinement is required before decisions can be taken, probably at the next steering board meeting in May. Participation in any EDA programme is a matter for each member state on a case-by-case basis and the EDA does not have the authority to force states to contribute to, or participate in, any particular programme.The main focus of the EDA is on obtaining better value for existing spending levels and securing improvements and greater efficiency, especially in the area of research, technology, manufacturing and procurement. Ireland has advocated that the EU should prioritise the development of qualitative aspects of capability development. This view, and a recognition of the need for greater efficiency and effectiveness in defence expenditure, is shared by many of my ministerial colleagues at EU level at a time when the majority of member states, including Ireland, have no plans to increase their defence spending.The EDA is an important forum through which the EU can seek to improve competitiveness and efficiency in the defence equipment sector which has been notable for fragmentation and duplication. While Ireland is not a major consumer of defence equipment in relative terms, we should encourage developments which improve market efficiencies or which may yield some economies of scale for equipment procurement for the Defence Forces.

Is the Minister aware that Javier Solana, the EU foreign policy chief, stated that the purpose of the fund is to spend more together and more efficiently on research and technology? The press release stated that the Ministers reviewed three possible approaches to increasing spending and collaboration on defence research and technology. How does that square with the Minister's claim that the commitment to the EU will not involve increased military spending? Will the Minister make a commitment that the State will not participate in this fund and increased spending in the future? If he is not giving that commitment, how much money does he intend to spend on the first aspect he mentioned and will this research and technological forum cover aspects of military nuclear research?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	68	In his question Deputy Ó Snodaigh referred to this matter being decided in Innsbruck on 6 and 7 March. This is incorrect. No decision was taken. It was discussed in a general way and the view around the table was that it will have to be teased out more before any decision, even a decision in principle, is taken. If a decision is taken at the May meeting or a subsequent meeting to go ahead with this programme it will be for each state to decide whether to participate. Deputy Ó Snodaigh referred to a statement by Mr. Javier Solana. While I am aware of Mr. Solana's views and he has his own brief, the defence ministries of the member states have no plans, collectively or individually, to increase expenditure in the short term. Ireland is no exception.What is proposed is a system to get better value for the money we are spending. The defence equipment, research and technology markets are fragmented. Individual countries purchase their equipment, research and technology. The goal of the EDA is to create a centralised market whereby they purchase together in the hope of getting greater value for money. It is not a matter of spending more but of maximising the value we are getting from existing expenditure. On the surface it appears we have no great reason to join this because what is proposed is joint investment in research and technology, initially in force protection such as body armour. As far as I am aware there will be no nuclear aspect to that.Ireland spends no taxpayers' money on military research and technology. However the technology and research used by civil firms, particularly in computing and communications, is increasingly being integrated into military technology. Items produced by civil companies may be used by the military, for example truck gear boxes made by a civil company could end up in army trucks although that was not the initial intention. A number of Irish companies supply components for other companies which finish up in military hardware produced elsewhere. If Irish companies could achieve economies of scale as a result of the joint approach proposed by the EDA, I would look positively on it. It is not immediately apparent that the benefits will be sufficiently significant. We must return to the drawing board at the next meeting, in May, which I will attend, and see precisely what is proposed. I will examine it from the perspective of private Irish companies rather than that of the Government because it spends no money on military research and technology and has no intention of doing so.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	72	Okay.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	73	I propose to take Questions Nos. 41, 73, 95, 98, 116 and 122 together.Last July, while visiting Mellows Barracks in Galway, I spoke of my desire to see more women applying to join the Defence Forces. I indicated then that while much was already being done to encourage more women to apply, I intended to review the measures in place with a view to maximising the number of women applicants to the Defence Forces. At that time I pointed out that the number of females being enlisted each year is almost in direct proportion to the number applying, approximately 9%. An increase in the numbers applying should therefore be reflected in the numbers subsequently enlisted.As I have already indicated to the House on a number of occasions, I commenced that review process on 5 August 2005 by writing to both the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform along with a number of outside organisations seeking their views and recommendations on how more women might be encouraged to apply to enlist in the Defence Forces. All the replies have now been received, the last on 17 January 2006, and are being examined. Officials, both civil and military, of the Department of Defence will shortly meet with representatives of each of the organisations who made submissions along with the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, and the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA. These meetings will consider the ideas and suggestions to see what, if any, improvements or changes can be made to the programme of recruitment to encourage more females to join the Defence Forces. I anticipate these meetings will take place over the coming weeks.Since I raised this matter last July there has been considerable focus on the minimum height requirement. Indeed one of the submissions received in response to my letter of 5 August specifically called on me to abolish the height requirement. The current minimum height requirement for entry to both the Permanent Defence Force and the Reserve Defence Force is 162.5 cm., or 5 ft. 4 in., for both men and women. It was set in April 2002 and is based on the professional advice of the medical corps and the experience of training units. The advice at that time was that, having regard to the nature of the job, the duties of military service and the training exercises undertaken by members of the Defence Forces, persons of shorter stature are more likely to incur back and lower limb injuries. A key element in military life is the need for personnel to maintain a level of fitness for combat readiness. Inherent in this physical requirement is the ability to carry heavy loads and execute physically demanding tasks in training and on operations. The personal load carrying equipment and personal weapon place considerable weight on the musculoskeletal system.As I indicated to the House on 29 September 2005 I have asked the military authorities to report to me on the height requirement and I will consider all aspects of the issue in light of that report. However the height requirement is only one element of the overall matter of how more women might be encouraged to join the Defence Forces. In this context it is important we examine the range of possible contributing factors. To that end I intend soon to commission research into women's attitudes to military life and a career in the Defence Forces. I envisage such research including interviews with currently serving female members of both the Permanent and the Reserve Defence Force. The Government is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for men and women in the Defence Forces, including the Reserve Defence Force, and to the full participation by women in all aspects of Defence Forces activities.
#MarieHoctorFF	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-party	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-dob	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	74	I welcome the Minister's commitment to undertake research. He cannot go further than those on the ground with first-hand experience. The figure of 5% is low in view of the 26% who are in the Reserve Defence Force. Where does Ireland stand compared to international figures? In view of the Minister's research how will he overcome the perception in the Defence Forces that the Army is not a place for a woman to seek a career?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	75	Although the figure of 5% is low, it is in line with international experience. The figures have increased in some of the European states but not by much more than the Irish average. In recent years there has been a substantial increase in the number of women applying to enlist in the Defence Forces. The percentage of women in the Defence Forces is almost directly proportional to the number that apply. In the past two or three years the average annual intake of female applicants has been in the order of 9% or 10%.I agree it is not just a question of height because there is a range of other factors. The Garda Síochána recently got rid of the height requirement and introduced a physical fitness test instead. I have asked the military authorities to consider this matter in light of what the Garda has done. If I can establish an appropriate and medically suitable physical fitness test to replace or further reduce the existing height requirement, I will be glad to do so. I expect to have the military authorities' report on or before 1 June. We will therefore be in a position, before the Dáil rises for the summer recess, to see what further action can be taken in this regard.The reports I received from the various organisations I contacted about the desirability of getting women to join the Defence Forces have been very good. A number of very useful suggestions have been made and I am sure further suggestions will be made, not only at the meetings we will have with the organisations and as a result of their interaction with PDFORRA and RACO, but also as a result of the research I am commissioning.Getting rid of or reducing the height requirement and replacing it with an appropriate and medically suitable physical test and addressing other matters, such as women's perception of Army life and bullying, will give rise to a substantial increase in applications to join the Defence Forces. As the Deputy pointed out, while the number of females in the Permanent Defence Force amounts to only 5%, it is up to 26% in the Reserve Defence Force, in respect of which the same height requirement applies.

He said that one submission referred to abolishing the height requirement and that there were other interesting suggestions. Will he share those with us?Does the Minister agree that many other armies, including the US Army, have a far lower height requirement than that which obtains in Ireland and that there may be no medical basis for our height requirement? As I mentioned several times previously, a great number of females are precluded from joining the Defence Forces because their average height is less than that of men. The requirement is 5 ft. 4 in. for both males and females. Is there resistance from the Defence Forces to the reduction of the height requirement? One could make many cases for saying, the lower the height, the better, but I will not go into that.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	79	On the first question, I have been written to on a confidential basis and will therefore not elaborate on the suggestions that have been made. They will emerge very shortly when RACO and PDFORRA talk to the organisations in question.I have not come across an army with no height requirement but I am aware that others have much lower height requirements than ours. I perused the list some nights ago and noted that the US Army has a height requirement of 4 ft. 11 in., and we are certainly out of line with that. The military authorities have told me they received medical advice that it is dangerous, in view of the operational requirements of Irish troops and the loads they must carry, sometimes through jungles on foreign missions, for people under 5 ft. 4 in. to be engaged in such duties. I put it to them, however, that the United Kingdom and the United States do not expect their armies to do any less than we expect ours to do. I am informed that some armies — I am not quite sure which ones — do not expect the same commitment from their female recruits as we do but I hope we can establish a suitable physical fitness test to allow us, at a minimum, to reduce the height requirement, if not abolish it.On Deputy Timmins's last point, there has been no resistance to reducing the required height. We have received full co-operation from the Army.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	81	We already do that to a certain extent. It is safe to say, on looking at the suggestions of the various organisations, that we will be engaged in a more focused campaign aimed specifically at females.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	82	The White Paper sets out a comprehensive programme for the development of defence and the Defence Forces for the period 2000 to 2010. This programme is expressed in terms of policy decisions taken and goals, objectives and plans to be achieved. These include a rebalancing of defence resource allocations achieved through payroll savings and the sales of properties, and the reinvestment of these resources in new equipment and improved infrastructure for the Army, the Naval Service and the Air Corps.To achieve that objective, a barracks reinvestment programme was initiated by my Department to complement expenditure on the normal range of building and engineering works for the purpose of providing modern living, operational and training accommodation for the Defence Forces. This special programme was centred mainly on the Curragh Camp and on Collins Barracks, Cork. While the main elements of this programme were completed in 2004, a number of other projects have been and will continue to be undertaken. Details of the expenditure of €64 million on major capital projects, that is, projects costing over €1 million, undertaken in the Curragh between 2000 and 2005 are shown in the following table. There is one major capital project ongoing in the Curragh Camp and a further one is planned to commence later this year.ProjectDate contract placedProject cost (€)2000New Pool and Gym Upgrade, Curragh Camp23 May 20008,006,065.54Accommodation Blocks A and B, Clarke Bks, Curragh Camp24 Aug 20001,596,773.18Stores 1, 2, 3 and 4, Curragh Camp1 Sep 20006,920,072.53New Transport Technical Stores, Curragh Camp31 Oct 20002,302,035.14Refurbishment of Ordnance Stores, Connolly and Plunkett Bks, Curragh Camp30 Nov 20003,706,873.35Accommodation Upgrade Connolly Bks, Curragh Camp6 Dec 20003,188,312.31Ordnance/Transport Schools, Curragh Camp6 Dec 20003,460,036.262001New NCO’s Mess East, Curragh Camp11 Jan 20012,666,449.96Combat Support College, Curragh Camp23 Jan 20016,673,872.62NCO’s Mess West, Curragh Camp31 Jan 20014,447,733.81Vehicle Garaging, Curragh Camp8 Aug 20014,628,978.36Refurbishment Kitchen Officers Mess — Ceannt Bks, Curragh Camp20 Sep 20011,082,000,122002Combined Vehicle Workshop, Curragh Camp2 Jan 20029,038,649.45Container Storage Yard, Curragh Camp9 Sep 20021,049,167.472003Special Storage Building, Curragh Camp18 Sep 20032,114,034.222004Workshop and Office Facilities, Plunkett Bks, Curragh Camp31 Aug 20041,749,941.652005Refurbishment Accommodation Block 7, Connolly Bks, Curragh Camp.18 Aug 20051,543,786.54
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	83	I welcome that reply. Is the Minister in a position to elaborate on the types of major capital projects under way at the Curragh? I welcome the capital investment because there was a period in which the Defence Forces had been starved of it. While many of the barracks in which members of the Defence Forces were housed were fine architecturally, they were from another era. I welcome the decision to engage in a major upgrading programme. Are projects being considered that may not require major capital investment? Are there capital investment projects in addition to that at Collins Barracks, Cork? Is there a proposal, as part of the celebrations on the anniversary of the 1916 Rising, to mark the fact that seven barracks at the Curragh complex are called after the signatories of the Proclamation of Independence?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	84	There is one major capital project under way at present, that is, the refurbishment of block 7, Connolly Barracks. This project will provide modern accommodation for 99 Defence Forces personnel.On the question of major capital projects planned for this year, it is proposed to upgrade the infantry weapons wing and the NCO school. The upgrade will provide modern office training and ancillary facilities for the school. It will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the delivery of training and will benefit both staff and students.Three other large projects are under way at the Curragh, a new sports changing facility, the reroofing of Pearse officers' mess and the renovation at MacDonagh Barracks, blocks G and H. I expect all three projects to be completed this year.Other major capital projects under way include the refurbishment of accommodation facilities at Custume Barracks, Athlone, the refurbishment of accommodation at Cathal Brugha Barracks, Dublin, the upgrade of brigade headquarters and the medical facility at Collins Barracks, Cork, the upgrade of the kitchen and dining hall at Sarsfield Barracks, Limerick, and the refurbishment of the armoury at Mellows Barracks, Galway. It is expected that these projects will be largely completed this year. The capital allocation for building work projects for the Defence Forces in 2006 is just short of €22 million.The Deputy asked about commemorating the signatories of the 1916 Proclamation. We have plans to unveil seven monuments to seven individual signatories. I will go to the Curragh shortly to do that.
#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-party	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-dob	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	85	I know the people of Kildare South are decrying that they do not have a Fine Gael representative. It is good to see Deputy Carey taking an interest in the area. I know that many people from Finglas are in the barracks there. The mental telepathy on the monuments for the signatories of the 1916 Proclamation shows a Government on song and in tune with its backbenchers.The Minister mentioned that €22 million is to be spent this year on capital projects. If the Minister cannot outline the figure now, I will accept it later. How much of that spending comes from funds obtained from the sale of Defence Forces resources? The Minister is familiar with the Curragh Camp and he will return there shortly. Would he agree there is considerable space in the area, given that the Department of Defence is seeking land to locate the Defence Forces headquarters in Newbridge, which will prove very costly, when a few miles away it could easily obtain a site with the compliments of the Minister, which would save the Exchequer several million euro, which money could be pumped into upgrading the facilities, in which Deputy Carey is very interested?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	86	We have already allocated the money to upgrade those facilities. I do not know how much of the capital spending comes from funding obtained from the sale of Defence Forces resources: I will let the Deputy know. I imagine the percentage of that spend arising from the sale of property is quite low. We have almost run out of money obtained from property sales and the money being provided now is the money I have managed to wrest away from the Department of Finance in the annual Estimates wrestling match. It is quite a significant sum, which relates to additional major capital projects, improvements etc. over and above routine expenditure on wear, tear and maintenance. It represents a significant investment.We have gone a considerable distance towards the acquisition of a site in Newbridge. The land at the Curragh has a value. I am not sure that land is any cheaper. While I realise we own the land there already and if we are not using it——

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	92	On the issue of the efficiency or inefficiency of the driving tester system, I begin by wishing Mr. Gay Byrne the best of luck in his appointment as chairman of the Road Safety Authority. I thank Mr. Eddie Shaw for his services as chief executive. I wish the chief executive designate Mr. Noel Brett every success in an absolutely critical area. Mr. Byrne has rightly identified as an immediate priority the scandal of 400,000 people driving with provisional driving licences, which means that one in five drivers on the roads have not successfully completed a driving test. It is obviously critical to the economy, our social fabric and to the country that an effective and efficient driver testing system be in operation.It is scandalous that 130,500 people are now waiting on average 32 weeks to take a driving test. The delay varies from place to place: in Portlaoise it is 63 weeks, in Raheny it is 58 weeks and in Wicklow it is 50 weeks. Obviously driver testing is rightly a fundamental part of the Government's road safety programme. According to the Department of Transport, the backlog is due to a surge in applications between December 2000 and March 2003. The Government has identified outsourcing as a solution to the problem, which would be especially effective if the work were done during the summer months when the days are longer and more time is available. However, because of a clause in the Sustaining Progress agreement, outsourcing to deal with the inefficiency of the driver testing system is prohibited.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	94	Does the Taoiseach agree fundamentally that the current situation is unsustainable, that the Government must do something about it and that outsourcing is the one and only method to address the problem effectively? This means that the constraint in Sustaining Progress must be overcome. How does the Government intend to address the problem of 400,000 people driving with provisional licences and 130,500 people waiting for driving tests? An average of 50,000 young people aged between 18 and 20 come on stream each year, most of whom will apply for driving licences. How does the Taoiseach propose to deal with this fundamentally important issue, identified by Mr. Byrne yesterday, when he said he would walk away from the job if the matter was not addressed effectively by Government?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	95	The driver-testing backlog is totally unacceptable and must be eliminated as quickly as possible. Each additional month that it takes has a negative impact on road safety. Driver-testing and road safety are directly linked as we have said time and time again and I have said it here. The problem is not just an industrial relations one. It affects people's lives as well. As Deputy Kenny knows the arbitration board in its adjudication pointed out repeatedly that it was not concerned with the merits of the dispute as to how the backlog of driving tests should be solved. However, it felt its continuance represented a potential threat to road safety and the board urged a resumption of discussions at which all opinions — it emphasised all opinions — should be considered with a view to ensuring that a solution is implemented without delay.The Minister for Transport has gone to exceptional lengths to maximise the contribution that can be made by reducing this problem in the existing system and to try to use existing staff to the maximum. Despite bonus payments, additional recruitments and redeployment of existing civil servants, the backlog cannot be cleared quickly enough. In answer to the Deputy's point, I can see no alternative to contracting for extra resources on a temporary basis. In that context, I want to support the acknowledgement by the Minister for Transport that the staff of the Department, including the public servants who work in the Road Safety Authority, will continue to be the backbone of the service. Nobody is trying to dismantle or discontinue the service. The staff in question represent the backbone and the front line of the service. While they do the job as best they can, they cannot deal with the numbers which exist at present. In this case, the contracting of staff resources has been proposed as a temporary measure. The Minister does not intend to replace the existing staff by assigning their work to other people. There have been discussions between the Minister for Transport and the driver testing unions. The unions have been engaging with the Minister over the last week. The Minister has told me he hopes a satisfactory outcome will be reached. I acknowledge that the unions have engaged actively in the process of trying to find a resolution, even after the arbitration board issued its determination.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	96	Is this not a case of the Government being unable to govern in the interests of the greater public? Will the Taoiseach assure the House he will ask the unions for an immediate derogation in respect of Sustaining Progress so this matter can be dealt with? I am quite sure everyone involved in the trade union movement is anxious to ensure human lives are saved on our roads. This matter cannot be dealt with at present because the proposed changes to the system are prohibited under Sustaining Progress.The Government is unable to deal with a problem that has been identified. Some 400,000 people are driving on provisional licences. Some 130,000 people are waiting for driving tests. The Bacon report and the Goodbody report of 2001 measured the cost of the loss of one life on the roads as €2.8 million, when matters such as education, allowances and training are taken into account. The country will lose 35 years of productivity if a person unfortunately and tragically dies in a road accident at the age of 30. Over the next ten years, we need an additional 40,000 workers per year to keep the economy ticking over.The implications of the Government's failure to take action in this regard are fourfold. First, some 400,000 people who do not have full licences have to pay extra insurance premiums, amounting to €23 million per annum. Second, many people cannot take up employment because they do not have full licences. Third, a social stigma is associated with not being deemed to be a qualified driver. Fourth, the inability of the system to deliver means that thousands of inexperienced drivers of all ages are on our roads.The IT system that has been operating in Ballina since 1989 is a disgrace because it is unable to cope with this system. This fundamental health and safety issue is of importance in people's lives. The Government is unable to deliver, in the interests of consumers, an efficient and professional system of training and testing those who give certificates of competency to drivers. The employees of the outsourced contractor have been trained and are ready to work in this area. Will the Taoiseach seek an immediate derogation from the unions, under Sustaining Progress, to relieve the pressure in this area? Such action is needed if we are to reduce the waiting times of the 130,000 people who are waiting for driving tests and take action in respect of the 400,000 drivers who do not have full licences.In this country, 11 people per 100,000 die on the roads, unfortunately. If we were in line with international best practice, just six people per 100,000 would die on the roads. If we could reduce this country's level of road deaths to that level, some 130 lives would be saved each year. In this instance, the Taoiseach should govern in the public interest.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	97	As I have said previously, if just one person dies on the roads, that is one person too many. Some 399 people died on the roads last year, which is several hundred less than the number of people who died when there was a fraction of the current amount of vehicles on the roads. That does not detract from the Government's desire to minimise the number of people dying on the roads.It is not a question of a derogation from Sustaining Progress. I think everybody on the union, staff and Government sides was surprised by the interpretation of the arbitration board in its findings. The Deputy has asked the Minister to engage with the trade union and staff sides to try to reach a resolution to this problem. The Government is already engaged in such discussions. I appreciate the willingness of the staff side to do that.I think every public servant is in favour of increased flexibility in working arrangements and the elimination of rigidities and restrictive practices, with a view to enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the public service, which are among the central themes in the modernisation of that service. I emphasise that the Minister is not trying to remove the driver testing service from the public service or abolish the jobs of the staff who have worked hard in the driver testing area over many years. The high numbers of learner drivers and people who want to do the driving test mean we need to introduce an outside contractor, at least in the short term. As Deputy Kenny said, a contractor is aware of the discussions which have taken place in recent years and is ready to operate in this area. We have engaged, in the interests of good industrial relations, with the fairly long process that has been a feature of this issue. We understand that we have to follow the system for dealing with public servants, even if it takes a long time.We have tried to do everything we can to address the difficulty we are facing. As I have said, the Minister has gone to exceptional lengths to maximise what can be done within the system. We cannot deal with the problem within the system. We need to out-source and contract. We have the capacity and resources to do that, even on a temporary basis. We need to reach a conclusion in respect of industrial relations and we are trying to do that. We do not want to act in an arbitrary way as that would not be in the interests of good industrial relations practices. We will try to make progress. We are pleased that the unions have engaged with us in trying to reach a quick resolution to this problem.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	98	Just when most law-abiding citizens felt this country's crime problem could not get worse after the killing of Ms Donna Cleary some weeks ago, there was an extraordinary drive-by shooting on the M50 on Sunday morning. People could not believe that rival gangs could engage in such a shoot-out at dawn on a busy motorway. Most citizens are in disbelief that somebody — possibly an innocent motorist — was not killed, just when they thought things could not get any worse. It seems that young thugs are visiting nightclubs in flak jackets, with deadly weapons stowed away in high-powered vehicles which they have secured from their ill-gotten gains. They are prepared to risk a shoot-out on a busy motorway because they know the chances of being detected or convicted are minimal. It should be borne in mind, in this context, that Deputy O'Donoghue told the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis on 21 April 1997, a couple of months before he became Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, that "for Fianna Fáil there is no acceptable level of crime".The Taoiseach will appreciate that the serious crime to which I refer is being fuelled by the drugs racket. That is what is really behind most of the serious crime we are experiencing. Cocaine-crazed young thugs are prepared to regard human life as expendable so they can get their hands on the lucrative and obscene wealth that comes from the drugs racket which is plaguing and ravaging many communities in Dublin and elsewhere. What is the Garda Síochána's response to this problem? Is the intelligence that is available to the force defective? Is the Garda looking for more powers? Is it looking for more resources? Does the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, understand not only that he has political accountability in this House for the law, but also that he has political accountability in the House for the Garda? I remind the Taoiseach of a statement made in the House on 27 June 1995 by the current Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue:In every county old people spend sleepless nights in fear of marauding intruders. In every house parents are increasingly and justifiably in fear of the free availability of drugs. On every street of every town and village people walk in fear of crime. Our streets have been taken from us by criminals. They rule by threat, intimidation and force.It was not true then, but sadly one can only come to the conclusion that it is true now.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	99	As regards the incident, at 4.30 a.m. on 26 March a shooting occurred between the M50 motorway and the Lucan road. A car containing five passengers, two male and three female, had several shots fired at it. Two of the passengers were wearing bullet-proof vests. The driver of the car received a flesh wound to the elbow and was brought to hospital. He was reluctant to stay and discharged himself. He declined to make any comment. He had sustained gunshot wounds just two weeks previously on a Saturday morning in the Finglas area. He also declined to make a comment at that stage. The other four passengers in the car have made voluntary statements. The scene was preserved and a search was conducted of a section of the M50 to locate anything of evidential value.Deputy Rabbitte knows and correctly said that where this gang of thugs is concerned, most of this has to do with drugs. They are probably involved in other areas of crime as well. The Garda has been actively involved against them for a considerable time. Significant resources have been deployed on Operation Anvil in terms of numbers and overtime. The Garda Commissioner has assured the Minister that the level of resources will enable the force to deploy significant intelligence driven methods and high intensity operations against organised crime, especially drugs and particularly in this area.Operation Anvil was set up to deal with the difficulties in the west Dublin area. The Garda is concentrating substantial resources in terms of manpower, overtime and intelligence gathering on what it considers to be a highly dangerous group of criminals. With a view to augmenting these efforts, the Garda Commissioner has allocated 50 additional gardaí to the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, which I referred to last week. Their sole duty is to target the groups involved in organised crime. That unit is headed by a detective chief superintendent.To date Operation Anvil has yielded 1,792 arrests, including 33 for murder, 374 firearms seizures, 3,934 vehicle seizures, 26,231 Garda checkpoints, 8,347 searches for drugs, 873 for thefts and 776 for firearms. These figures show the level of activity but also indicate the level of viciousness involved in these gangs. We have seen their activities over the past six months. If the Deputy wants, I will go back over the figures for 1994 to 1996. However, I believe he knows them and that is not really the point. Obviously the Criminal Justice Bill will help in some of these areas. However, on reading the reports I am convinced that it is not just a question of resources. Like me, Deputy Rabbitte might say that if a person gets shot on a Saturday morning, refuses to say anything and releases himself from hospital only to get shot two weeks later by fly-past gangs and say nothing again, he should perhaps be arrested for his own safety.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	103	I heard the first part of the Taoiseach's reply describing what happened on Sunday morning near where I live. To be honest, it sounded more like the Garda report. I do not know whether the Taoiseach is auditioning for a part on "Crimeline" or taking responsibility, as Head of Government, for what is happening out in gangland. It is fair enough to say that the figures for Operation Anvil show the level of activity, criminality and the real threat that exists.It is a tragedy in the middle of all of this that the Government is undermining the national drugs strategy which was designed to reduce demand for drugs. The lead community member of the drugs strategy, Mr. Fergus McCabe, felt obliged to resign because of the manner in which it is not being supported by Government and the way the community input is being diminished.At the same time we have this extraordinary explosion whereby, for example, a 27 year old in the constituency of my colleague, Deputy Burton, was shot because he owed a debt of €500. That is the level it has reached. It is being driven by the drugs craze. There is no sign of the Government being in control. When the Taoiseach talks about Operation Anvil, the fact is that out of 75 killings in the five years I mentioned last week, there have been 12 convictions. These young thugs believe they can do this with impunity. They believe they will not be brought to justice and that on a lottery they have a great chance of escaping conviction. As matters stand, they are right.It is all very well for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to fulminate into any number of microphones about any number of issues he cares to think about, including the Taoiseach's political prospects. However, what is being said to people who believe that it is the first duty of a Government to provide for their safety when there is open warfare on busy motorways? All we can say about Sunday morning is that it was a miracle that nobody was killed. There were three young women in the back, cars coming in the opposite direction and machine gun fire across the vehicle. It is extraordinary.There is no confidence in the House and none outside it that the Government is in control of this situation or that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform understands the crime wave we are living through. He seems to have convinced himself that he is doing a good job and that the fault lies elsewhere, when in fact a 27 year old can be shot because he allegedly owes €500. That is how cheap human life has become and there is no evidence I can see that there is any preparation to sit on these gangs until they are brought to justice. They are running through this city with impunity and the Minister, meanwhile, is addressing every other subject except the one for which he is politically accountable to this House.

He said the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was responsible to this House for what the Garda did. I was giving him the factual position from information the Garda had given us. I thought that was what he required. I agree with the Deputy that it was a miracle nobody was killed. If it had not been 4.30 a.m., there would have been large volumes of traffic, but even at that time a considerable number of people are on the road. Thankfully nobody else was injured.In terms of numbers, as I said previously, Deputy Rabbitte continually wants to point out that matters are much worse than they were. We know that is not the position.

Will the Taoiseach take this matter seriously? Since 2001 we have had warnings from British and US weather services that ignoring climate change will surely be the most costly of all possible choices for us and our children.In 2003 the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, issued a report, Climate Change: Scenarios and Impacts for Ireland, which has not been responded to in the detail that is required. Today's newspaper refers to the shocking report of the European Environment Agency, Transport and Environment: Facing a Dilemma 2005. It reads like an arrest warrant for the Government. It states that greenhouse gas emissions in Ireland are up 130% over the past ten years while the EU average is just 22%. It states that 370,000 people die per annum in the EU as a result of air pollution alone and that in the past ten years Irish people have doubled the distance they travel, mainly by car, compared to other EU countries. In many EU countries people have reduced the car miles they are travelling.Will the Taoiseach admit there has been a failure in terms of public transport investment and planning and the implementation of required building regulations? Will he indicate the action he will take in this regard? The €27 million in renewable energy grants are a welcome drop in the ocean. Who will pay the €1 billion plus bill that will accrue between 2008 and 2012 under the emissions trading scheme? Where is the national climate change strategy review that was promised before the end of last year and why has the Taoiseach continued to subsidise large polluters like CRH when, according to today's newspapers, he is penalising green industries like Ecocem?The Government has not said — it has been stated frequently in England — who will pay for the flood protection that is required. In last Friday's edition of The Irish Times it was stated that the Taoiseach’s constituency, and quite a number of others, will be under water by the end of this century due to the predicted 6 m rise in sea level. That will signal the end of Dublin, Belfast, Waterford and Cork, in addition to a number of other areas. Will the Taoiseach put in place contingency plans for that and will he radically address the change in policy the Government needs to make if we are to have any hope of survival in the years to come, as a country and a planet?

That is the crucial issue on which we have been working as we have been growing as a country. We have effectively doubled the entire economy in the past nine years.

We have to continually work and strive to achieve that balance. We have to take account of all the sectors. I do not fundamentally disagree with the points made by Deputy Sargent in that they are crucial issues for the future, but they cannot be dealt with at the expense of crucial industries that generate huge economic activity and create significant employment. We have to try to work——

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	159	In reply to Deputy Sargent's question on the climate change strategy, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will publish shortly the review of the national climate change strategy which will take stock of all the developments since 2000. He will also propose additional measures for the country to cost effectively meet its target for the purpose of the Kyoto Protocol. Existing and potential new measures to reduce transport emissions will be addressed in the review process. I cannot give the Deputy an exact date for publication of these proposals but I understand the information will be available shortly.On the emissions trading for the next round, we will announce within a day or two, if not today, the allocations for the sectors concerned for the period 2008 to 2012. Other issues such as VRT, biofuels — the Minister referred to the €27 million to be made available — transport emissions and air quality are vitally important. Nobody is arguing against them and the Minister will set out our position on these.

I hope he will acknowledge that in the latest planning and development legislation, we fundamentally took account of the interests of all the sectors. One cannot just take account of one or two sectors, one has to take a balanced view of these issues. If we did not do so, I would be answering questions from Deputy Sargent about high unemployment and other issues.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	163	It is estimated that we will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by about 1 million tonnes of CO2 in the next decade and there will be a 41% reduction on projected emissions.This is without factoring in the additional investment and benefits which we believe will arise from the significant investment, of almost €35 billion in today's prices, being made in Transport 21.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	164	I fear the Taoiseach needs a serious wake-up call on climate change. Energy is the defining issue of our age. I remind the Taoiseach we are talking about the future of mankind rather than about balance. There is no balance in the Taoiseach's approach. JamesLovelock predicts that by the end of this century the earth will be able to support only 1 billion people; therefore 5 billion will die. I ask for some balance when faced with this scenario. I wonder what the history books will record about the Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, and the seriousness with which he dealt with this issue. There are children in the Visitors Gallery. The cars used by the Taoiseach and members of the Cabinet do not run on biofuel so I question how serious he is about it. Is the Taoiseach in agreement with other EU leaders who stated cuts in greenhouse gas emissions of between 60% and 80% will be required? The Kyoto Protocol is letting the Taoiseach off the leash to create another 13% of emissions above the 1990 levels. Does he agree that cuts of between 60% to 80% are required and is he serious about it? Has he informed the other leaders he is in agreement with them? Will the Taoiseach face his Cabinet colleagues with the scenario of ecological genocide unless we radically change our whole transport policy and our level of greenhouse gas emissions?It is a question of different methods of employment. Those who do not produce greenhouse gas emissions should be encouraged. Will the Taoiseach encourage that type of industry and penalise the polluter? Will he reward those who are efficient in terms of their energy use and introduce fiscal measures to do so? This is the kind of balance we mean. I ask for that kind of balance and the reversal of the capital investment programme for transport which has closed down freight, given more roads but not enough public transport and resulted in the bad planning which has people commuting over 50 miles a day.

My party called for the Dáil to be recalled before St. Patrick's Day with a view to bringing this Bill back to the House as early as possible. I do not object to this method of dealing with it, nor do I object to it being concluded at 10.30 p.m. tomorrow. However, the range of amendments brought in by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is very extensive. I give the Taoiseach notice that we will not tolerate any attempt to guillotine Committee Stage of the Bill because of its importance.

We ought to record that this is becoming the hallmark of the style of legislation of the Minister, Deputy McDowell.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	197	That is correct.

That would be all right, given the state we are in, if it were a once-off. However, he has done this on several previous occasions. It is disrespectful to the House and unfair to Members on this side of the House.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	199	The basic point which has been made but needs to be reiterated is that the additions to the Bill make a mockery of the original Second Stage debate. We do not have enough time available to us to get to grips with the Minister's motivation for effectively upturning the original Bill and presenting a whole new animal. I ask that the Government would allow additional time so the Opposition might engage more constructively, as we want to do given the importance of this issue.

This is not the first example of the approach he has employed, which has resulted in more than 200 amendments across substantive legislation that has only 38 sections.A situation arises whereby what is proposed does not amount to a recommital. I am not sure whether there are precedents for the methodology employed in terms of a revisitation by motion of the Second Stage content of the now to be amended legislation. It should have been recommitted. Substantially more time should have been provided, not only for Members in this House but for the many interested and concerned parties in civic society who are also concerned and taking time to consider what the Minister now proposes.The Human Rights Commission is among those parties which have been in contact with the Minister's office to reflect that they find the process most unsatisfactory. It does not allow time inside or outside the House for external or internal appraisal of what is involved. There was less than 24 hours from the provision of an explanation on the new sections by the Minister's Department to the various spokespersons receiving the detail last evening, which leaves inadequate time to prepare. I hope the Taoiseach will take on board this point. There is tacit acceptance that the Minister's approach is not appropriate and needs to be revisited. I hope we will never see a repetition of this approach in future legislation and that the lesson is well learned.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	205	In his response to Taoiseach's Questions today, the Taoiseach rightly stated that reports that came before the Government would be published as speedily as possible. In that context, has the Minister for Education and Science told the Taoiseach when the Harris report will be published, given that she has had the report in her possession at the Department for a number of months? The report deals with the decline in competency in spoken Irish in primary schools.When can we expect the safety analysis report on the Corrib gas field to be published by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources? Following my question last week to the Government, when does the Taoiseach expect to receive the report on the shooting of John Carthy at Abbeylara?Is the Taoiseach concerned about the decrease in the level of exports from this country last year, which resulted in the lowest growth in 20 years at 1.3%? In that context, when can we expect to see the control of exports Bill? I am sure the Government is concerned about the balance of payments deficit referred to by Davy Stockbrokers in its economic report. If this situation continues, there could be serious trouble ahead.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	207	First, the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, has——
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	208	As leader of his party, I have on occasion allowed the Deputy to ask questions but it cannot become the norm to ask about every conceivable report.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	209	There were specific debates in the House on the report.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	210	I accept that.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	211	The Minister gave a tentative date as to when he might publish it. The report concerns safety, natural gas and energy supply. Second, the Minister for Education and Science is in possession of the Harris report. I am sure she will publish it and I would like to know when.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	212	It might be better to submit a question to the Minister.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	213	Third, as you know, a Cheann Comhairle——
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	214	Under Standing Order 26, it is not in order to rhyme off a list of reports on the Order of Business.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	215	I find that extraordinary.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	216	If I understand the ruling of the Ceann Comhairle, he will allow me to answer on this occasion.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	218	I do not have a date for publication of the Harris report but the Minister for Education and Science will publish it with her response to the report. The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources hopes to deal with the Corrib gas report shortly. I raised the matter of the Deputy's interest with the Minister last week. He was not able to give me a date but he hopes to be able to do so. I do not have an update on the Abbeylara report.The control of exports Bill will update our export control legislation in the area of strategic export controls in the context of the recommendations of the recently published review of Ireland's export control system. The heads of the Bill are being worked on but are not yet ready, so I do not have a date for its publication.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	219	Has the Government set its face against using the opportunity of the census to refurbish the electoral register?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	221	As I understand it, the Central Statistics Office does not believe this is a suitable way of dealing with the matter. It is concerned about its work on the census and about operating that system. The Minister of State raised this issue with the CSO and I relayed my views on its possibility but it does not seem possible. The census will take place soon on 23 April. Other options are being considered by the Minister, Deputy Roche.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	228	——not least in terms of a cost benefit analysis. Following the week of the recess over the St. Patrick's festival, will the Taoiseach or any of the Ministers provide a report, either by way of statements in the House or placing information in the Oireachtas Library, of what was achieved following the large sum of taxpayers' money expended on the effort?

Apparently, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government did not attend the parade in Tokyo. What was he doing?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	231	The Deputy will have to submit a question in the appropriate way.

#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	233	In view of the fact that the large increase in carbon emissions here are attributable almost exclusively to the increase in road transport, given that the Minister for Transport has consistently said that he will not provide for the allocation of additional buses to Dublin Bus——

Is there any movement on the introduction of that Bill which has been languishing on the list since the Taoiseach took office?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	245	The Taoiseach to reply on the promised legislation.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	250	If the Deputy listened, she might. The State Claims Agency will deal with this matter in a sympathetic manner.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	251	The Government should not hide behind the State Claims Agency in this case. This woman needs to be told she will not have to——

Given that the Government has refused to pursue the pharmaceutical companies that provided infected blood products to people in need in this jurisdiction, including many who have died, when will the hepatitis C and HIV compensation tribunal amendment Bill come before the Dáil in order that we can properly address this most vexatious matter in this Chamber?

The eligibility for health and personal social services Bill will clarify how means tests are calculated, and it is very important that it comes before this House as quickly as possible. In light of the difficulty regarding oil and gas supplies, when will the minerals development Bill come before this House in order that we can discuss the possible gas or mineral finds in west Cavan?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	258	The eligibility for health and personal social services Bill, which is to update the current provisions relating to the health and personal social services, is due to be introduced later this year.

I do not see any reference to it on the list of promised legislation. Does the Taoiseach agree that it would be more suitable for such a body to be under the control of the Minister for Defence, in which context he might seek a role for the involvement of the Naval Service in humanitarian affairs?

The chairperson of that inquiry has taken on the task of doing further work. That will obviously provide new heads and those heads also must be cleared. The legislation will be published this year.

However, what appears to be a narrow technical motion is important from the parliamentary perspective in that it allows the principle of the new amendments to be discussed in a debate similar to Second Stage. Although these motions to instruct have not always been debated, I welcome the fact that this one will today be debated in the House and hope that will become the norm.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	298	I move:That, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, it be an Instruction to the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights that it has power to make provision in the Criminal Justice Bill 2004 in relation to:—the Firearms Acts 1925 to 2000 including increasing fines and penalties generally for firearm offences, creating mandatory minimum sentences for certain offences, introduction of a gun amnesty and amendments governing the grant of firearm certificates;—the Explosives Act 1875 to provide for new offences relating to fireworks and increased penalties;—offences relating to organised crime including an offence of participating or contributing to any activity of a criminal organisation for the purpose of enhancing the ability of such an organisation to commit or facilitate a serious offence whether inside or outside the State, an offence of committing an offence for the benefit of a criminal organisation and an offence of conspiracy to commit a serious offence;—the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 in order to strengthen the existing sentencing provisions for drug trafficking offences, create a new offence of importation of drugs with a value of €13,000 or more, and a new offence of supplying drugs to prisons;—a requirement in the interests of the common good, obliging persons convicted on indictment of certain drug trafficking offences to notify certain information to the Garda Síochána;—sentencing including creating a statutory basis for suspended or partially suspended sentences, imposition of a fine and deferral of sentence, restriction on movement orders and electronic monitoring of offenders;—civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults;—the Children Act 2001 to provide for civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by children aged 12 or over and other juvenile justice matters, including amendments to facilitate the transfer of responsibility for the provision and operation of children detention schools from the Department of Education and Science to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform;—the establishment of a body to be known as the Criminal Law Codification Advisory Committee to advise on the drawing up of a criminal code and monitor its implementation;—a new offence of possession of an article intended for use in connection with certain offences;—section 19 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 in order to expand the existing offence of assaulting or threatening to assault a peace officer to include medical personnel;—the Criminal Justice (United Nations Convention against Torture) Act 2000 to clarify the meaning of ‘torture' as defined in that Act;—the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act 1961 to clarify that a district court judge may exercise his or her powers in relation to his or her district anywhere in the State.This motion provides that the select committee be instructed to consider the amendments to the Criminal Justice Bill 2004 that I will present. I consider the amendments to be highly important and I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the House on the motion.Before I outline the main areas involved, I will stress my overall objective in bringing the amendments to the Bill. I am concerned that the criminal law should not only be seen to be up to date and relevant to the needs of modern society, but must also be effective in responding to those needs. We must ensure that the criminal law is able to respond in a way that will retain the confidence of the public and that it provides a strong deterrent to those who seek to undermine the stability and good order of our society. The amendments I propose, together with other reforms I have introduced, especially in the Garda Síochána Act 2005, will go a long way towards achieving those objectives.This Bill is the culmination of detailed and considered assessment of what enhanced powers the Garda Síochána need to combat crime, in all its manifestations, in the early 21st century. Although the level of headline crime in 2005 is lower than in 2002 by 4.4% and, by comparison with most western democracies, Ireland's crime rate is very low, crime nevertheless remains a significant problem. In 1995, with a population of almost 3.6 million people, there were 29 serious crimes per 1,000 of the population, while in 2005, with a population of more than 4.1 million, this rate had fallen to 24.6 crimes per 1,000 of the population. From that point of view, we should always keep everything in perspective. The crime rate per head of the population has declined quite significantly in the past ten years.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	300	While the Fine Gael leader is fond of referring to the number of crimes committed in recent years, he may be interested to note that during the two year term of the rainbow Government there were 102,484 headline crimes recorded in 1995 and a further 100,785 headline crimes recorded in 1996. Despite the fact that there were 600,000 less people living in Ireland and despite the fact that the more accurate PULSE system for recording crime was not in operation at the time, the number of headline crimes was heading for well over 500,000 if the rainbow Government had remained in office for five years.The Bill, as initiated, was debated at length and thoroughly in this House on Second Stage. I also discussed the subject matter of the proposed amendments when I appeared before the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights in September last year. The drafts of the amendments, which had been approved by the Government in November and December last, were also circulated to the committee as well as being sent to the Irish Human Rights Commission. In addition, I ensured they were available on my Department's website as soon as they were approved by Government. Since then the drafting process has been in hand and it has been a detailed and painstaking process. In other words, I have made every effort to encourage debate on the issues covered by the amendments I now propose. At the September session of the Oireachtas joint committee I emphasised that if Opposition members wanted to table amendments of their own or draw them to my attention for inclusion in the Bill, I would give them every positive consideration.I am now in a position to bring the formal amendments before the committee and, in keeping with my approach to open debate on the issues, I have already made my proposed amendments available to all the Opposition spokespersons on justice in the House. I will now outline the main areas of my package of amendments and highlight what I consider are the main issues.The first major group of amendments will update the law on firearms and explosives. I am bringing forward a wide range of amendments to the Firearms Acts 1925-2000. First, I propose the introduction of mandatory minimum sentences, of between five and ten years, for certain firearm offences, including possession of a firearm in suspicious circumstances, possession of a firearm with criminal intent, possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life or cause serious injury to property, possession of a firearm while hijacking a vehicle, and use or production of a firearm to resist arrest. In addition to the introduction of mandatory sentencing I will also introduce a new offence concerning the modification of firearms such as "sawing-off" a shotgun and increasing fines and penalties generally for offences under the Firearms Acts.I have indicated previously my intention to introduce a gun amnesty in the context of introducing minimum offences and I am now bringing forward proposals to that effect. I propose introducing a statutory basis for an amnesty during which firearms may be surrendered to the Garda Síochána before new penalties and minimum mandatory sentences are introduced. The reason is that there may be people in whose property there are firearms and who may feel that it would be dangerous, embarrassing or whatever to hand them up, but if we are introducing a new system where knowingly being in possession of those firearms after a certain date attracts a mandatory minimum penalty, it seems only fair to persons in that situation to state that they have one chance to come clean and hand up the firearms before they attract the mandatory minimum sentence. This would enable those in possession of firearms, who are not in compliance with the legal requirements, to regularise their position, and thus enable the Garda Síochána to concentrate on more serious offenders. During the amnesty period persons who surrender weapons will not be prosecuted for the simple illegal possessing of the weapon. However, surrendered weapons will be forensically tested and where found to have been used in a crime, the weapon and the forensic evidence will be admissible in any proceedings subsequently brought. The amnesty is for possession of the weapon; it is not in respect of a crime committed using the weapon.I understand, through Deputy Haughey and Deputy Bruton, that the parents of the late Ms Donna Cleary wish to be associated with this amnesty proposal and have asked me to indicate to this House that they support it and will publicly support it when the time comes.I am also bringing forward amendments governing the grant of firearms certificates. Under these amendments I propose that I, as Minister, may deem certain firearms as "restricted" by reference to specific criteria, including the calibre of the weapon which relates to the size of the bullet it fires, the action type, in other words, whether it is automatic, semi-automatic or whatever, and the muzzle energy — whether these are high velocity weapons, for instance — of the firearm. In future any person wishing to obtain a certificate for such a firearm will have to apply directly to the Garda Commissioner. It will not be a matter in which one applies at one's local Garda station. The conditions under which firearms certificates may be granted are also being amended and will include, among other things, a condition that safe and secure storage be provided for the firearm before a firearms certificate is granted.The amendments I propose to the Explosives Act 1875 include the introduction of a new offence of possession of fireworks for sale without a licence and I will also increase fines in that regard.Deputies will be all too aware of the need to continue the fight against organised crime and therefore I will propose a number of amendments in this area. These amendments will have the additional benefit of ensuring our law is brought into line with our commitments under UN and EU instruments. I have examined Canada's provisions on organised crime. We can usefully draw from those provisions. I have also taken account of useful comments made by the Irish Human Rights Commission in framing my proposals in this area, as I have done in other areas.When I addressed the committee in September last year on this issue, I said there were problems with criminalising membership of a criminal gang because relationships in such gangs are fluid, complex and more a state of mind than a matter of provable fact. Nevertheless, that should not deter us from putting an offence of participation in a criminal gang into our law and I will propose such a course.I propose that the offence will be one of contributing to or participating in an activity of a criminal organisation, not necessarily to the commission by a criminal organisation of a serious offence, although the intention behind the contribution must be to enhance the ability of the organisation to commit or to facilitate it in committing a serious offence. It will not be necessary to prove the commission of a specific offence. The offence is to be punishable by up to five years imprisonment. I also propose an offence of committing an offence for the benefit of a criminal organisation, based on the Canadian criminal code, which is to be punishable by up to ten years imprisonment. In addition, I will provide for the offence of conspiracy to commit a serious offence. Although conspiracy is already a common law offence here, it does not cover conspiracies in Ireland to commit an act abroad, as required by the international conventions. My amendment will close this loophole.I propose significant updates to the laws pertaining to drug offences, including changes to strengthen the provisions on the ten year mandatory minimum sentence for drug trafficking inserted into the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 by the Criminal Justice Act 1999. The 1999 amendment provided for minimum sentences of ten years on conviction for possession of drugs of a certain value for sale and supply. The court was provided some grounds which it could take into account if it felt a sentence of less than ten years was appropriate but the legislation was clear in stating that this was to happen only where exceptional and specific circumstances would make a ten year sentence unjust. My new proposals will seek to ensure that the grounds for considering a sentence of less than ten years are clarified further. It is being proposed that, as against mitigating factors such as co-operation and a guilty plea, the court will also be required to take into account evidence of previous drug trafficking convictions. A record of such convictions will be a counter balance to any reduction that may have been felt to be appropriate. In this context, I propose to direct the courts when applying the exception to have regard to the public interest in deterring and preventing drug trafficking.I will provide for a new offence of importing drugs having a value in excess of €13,000. This offence will attract the minimum ten year sentence.In line with a commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government, I will propose a new offence of supplying drugs to a prison. A further commitment in the agreed programme is the establishment of a drug offenders register, whereby convicted drug offenders must register with the Garda. The proposal is based on the same principle as the sex offenders register and will enable the movement of convicted drug dealers to be recorded in a similar fashion, so that it will be a requirement that the Garda is notified of changes of address and movement in and out of the State. This register will assist the Garda in monitoring illegal activity and should provide useful intelligence in the fight against drug crime.My main proposal in the area of sentencing policy puts the arrangements for suspending sentences on a statutory footing for the first time. I will provide that, where both a fine and custodial sentence are proposed, the fine may be imposed but the sentence deferred on condition that the person keeps the peace, is of good behaviour and meets any conditions stipulated by the court. I have in mind that a District Court judge will be able to impose a fine immediately for certain kinds of behaviour, while deferring a decision on a custodial sentence so as to determine whether the offender can reform himself or herself.I propose provisions for new restriction on movement orders, which in some circumstances may entail electronic tagging of offenders. These proposals will give the courts significant new and additional means of dealing with offenders, especially those convicted of public order offences and minor assault type cases.My proposals on anti-social behaviour orders will address a serious and pressing issue for many in society. There will be two distinct sets of arrangements, one for children between 12 and 18 years of age and the other for adults. My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, will address the issues pertaining to children later in this debate but I wish at this stage to draw attention to the fact that there will be significant similarities between the two sets of proposals, for example, the same definition of anti-social behaviour will apply in both cases. The application for an order will be a last resort after other options have been tried and have not been seen to work. In both cases, only a senior Garda may apply for an order. The orders will be granted by means of civil rather than criminal procedures, thus ensuring that those who are the subject of an order do not acquire a criminal record. Breach of an order will be a criminal offence, much like breach of a barring order. In the case of children, the proposals are closely tied to the philosophy and procedures of the Children Act 2001. In other words, every effort will be made to divert the child from the criminal justice system and there will be parental involvement at all significant points. Overall, my proposals represent a fair, balanced and proportionate response to an urgent social problem. I have been at pains to ensure we learned from difficulties experienced with the British model and I am satisfied that I have achieved that in my proposals.The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, will address the House later on proposals to amend the Children Act 2001. For now, I will just mention that, in addition to amendments to provide for the introduction of anti-social behaviour orders, the amendments will serve two other main purposes: to give effect to reforms in the youth justice system; and to amend provisions pertaining to the age of criminal responsibility.The programme for Government includes a commitment to codify all substantive criminal law into a single crimes Act. In January 2003 I established an expert group to consider possible approaches to codification. The group published a report on 29 November 2004 which, among other matters, recommended that a criminal law codification advisory committee be established on a statutory basis, similar to the Company Law Review Group, to oversee the codification project in order to cement commitment to the process on a long-term basis. Pending the enactment of the provisions in this Bill and in line with the wishes of the expert group, I intend to proceed with the establishment of this committee in shadow form and on a non-statutory basis. I have already obtained the necessary approval of the Government in this respect, as well as for the implementation of an innovative co-operative arrangement between the committee and a third level institution to facilitate the research function of the committee. I have appointed Professor Finbarr McAuley, who also chaired the expert group, as chairperson of the committee and I am considering other possible appointees to the committee in accordance with the recommendations of the expert group.My package will include several other miscellaneous proposals to address various issues. I want, in particular, to mention a proposal to protect staff at accident and emergency departments in hospitals and other emergency workers, including ambulance crew and fire brigade staff, from attacks and assaults and a proposal to create a new offence of possession of an article connected with certain offences. I will address the fall-out from a Supreme Court judgment relating to the issuing of search warrants by District Court judges. This is a very important aspect of the administration of justice and I want to move quickly to address certain doubts arising from that judgment.I may wish to bring a limited number of additional amendments on Report Stage and Members of the Opposition are free to do likewise.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	302	To a large extent, these will pertain to issues already covered by the present set of amendments and to the Bill as initiated. However, I refer to a proposal on reckless endangerment of children arising from the recommendations of Mr. Justice Murphy in the Ferns Report. I also plan to bring forward some minor but necessary amendments to the European Arrest Warrant Act and the Garda Síochána Act.l am sure the House will agree that my proposals go a long way towards meeting the objective I set out in the introduction to my remarks. They will complement elements of the original Bill which provide powers to search, preserve scenes, detain people for questioning in respect of serious offences and other powers recommended by the late Eamonn Leahy, SC, the husband of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin. I pay tribute to Mr. Leahy for the work he did before his death in putting together a programme for the reform for Garda powers. My proposals address key issues, bring the law up to date in important respects and will go a long way towards assuring the public that the issues about which they are rightly concerned are being addressed in a serious and effective way. It is very well to give the Garda Síochána powers, but we must ensure these powers are exercised properly and in an accountable fashion. When the Garda legislation was going through the House, I indicated it was my intention in parallel with the Criminal Justice Bill 2004 to bring in the Garda Síochána ombudsman commission, the Garda inspectorate and other amendments made in light of the Morris report on the events in Donegal.It is important we have accountability if the Garda Síochána is given extra powers. What we read about as having happened to innocent people in Donegal should not be permitted to recur. I am confident the measures in the Garda Síochána Act 2005, the ombudsman commission, the inspectorate, the duty to account, the new provisions regarding discipline and the other package of reforms of the Garda Síochána will mean the reforms being introduced today are not in any sense a tilt of the balance against the individual and in favour of the State.All of us as citizens are entitled to have our constitutional rights vindicated. The right to life is just as much the right of the victim. The right to property and for a person's home to be inviolable is not just to be protected with regard to the State. A person must also have protection for all rights, such as bodily integrity, the right not to be raped, wounded, assaulted or mugged. All of these are human rights guaranteed by the Constitution. We must set the balance right between all of our citizens, not just those accused of crime.Although it has taken somewhat longer than I hoped it would to bring this motion before the House, I am very confident the package of measures being put here today are not extreme or imbalanced, but are necessary. The fight against crime is increasingly difficult in a complex world, and the sophistication of many offenders has grown enormously. We now record every Garda interview, but it should be noted that people may not make any statement for hours on end. We have problems and must have rights to take samples such as DNA samples, rights to preserve scenes and carry out searches and rights to detain people for questioning which are commensurate to the threat posed to our society.In those circumstances I commend this motion to the House.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	303	I am usually concerned about the very long delay in getting very necessary changes to criminal law on the Statute Book. The way in which the Minister has dealt with this Bill has contributed substantially to that delay.It is another aspect of the Minister's approach to the crime problem. He has told us today that our crime rate is very low, he has it under control and that it is falling. Last week he produced a survey from his Department which showed that 85% of the respondents were concerned about crime. They were right to be concerned, as more serious crimes are now being committed by more criminals under this Government. More of these criminals are getting away with their actions.It is important the Minister does not ignore that since the first full year of the coalition Government of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, crime levels have risen 19%. This is a fact. Since the same year, the detection rate of crimes has fallen from 44% to 35%. This is also a fact. Even worse, and more worrying for people, is that the type of crime being committed is more violent, resulting in a far greater concern and anxiety for people. I am referring in particular to the increase in the murder rate, which is up 42%, and rape, sexual assault and firearms offences. Firearms offences reached a new level with the shooting gallery on the M50 on Sunday. Considering the issue, one could think of the innocent people who would have been on that highway at the time and could have been caught in a crossfire.We have a crime problem. Rather than trading statistics that do not really apply, I wish the Minister would accept that we have that serious problem. We should deal with this on two levels, the first being to fill in any loopholes in the law, and more importantly, the provision of proper enforcement. Today we are mainly discussing the question of law, but if I have time I will return to the need for enforcement and proper resourcing of the Garda Síochána, and the provision of the 2,000 extra gardaí which should now be in place, not in two or three years time. Proper equipment should also be provided.The way in which the Minister has handled this Bill means that necessary changes proposed nearly two years ago are still in legislative limbo. On Second Stage, the Minister spoke of updating our law to ensure criminal offences can be investigated and prosecuted in a way that is efficient, fair and which meets the needs of modern society. Those provisions in the original Bill are still in legislative limbo. Even on Second Stage, the Minister discussed a range of amendments. I looked for such amendments last May, but the first time I saw even a draft of the amendments was last week.The approach adopted by the Minister was wrong. If the Bill is cleared before the general election, we will end up with a massive piece of legislation. In between we have lost much ground in the battle against crime. Important provisions which I supported in the original Criminal Justice Bill are still not in effect. This important armoury, which would have been available to the forces of the State in the battle against crime, is still not there and will not be there until this Bill goes through all Stages with all amendments. Even at this late stage, two years on, the Minister is telling us he is considering more amendments. It would have been far more sensible to break up this Bill, perhaps putting the original Bill through. Firearms offences clearly need to be dealt with separately.I have another concern over the approach adopted by the Minister. Perhaps he wants this Bill, if passed into law, to be his legacy, his magnum opus which he can speak of in his declining years. We had two groups before the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women’s Rights making submissions on the Bill. One of them raised concerns regarding the constitutionality of some of these new proposals. I have not studied the 300 pages of proposals in enough detail to lend any credence to this, but the issue has been raised.I am concerned we will end up with a Bill of 200 or 300 sections and that there could be a referral to the Supreme Court. If there is a referral, my understanding is that any decision on the part of the Supreme Court under Article 26 of a provision being unconstitutional would lead to the Bill falling. This is another danger in the process being followed by the Minister as any single aspect found to be unconstitutional could bring the entire Bill down.I have another major concern, mentioned in the Minister's presentation and his frequent press statements, concerning mandatory minimum sentences. The Minister highlighted the matter in his speech. It is not realistic to refer to minimum mandatory sentences because they do not exist. As I understand it, and the Minister may clarify this, they will not exist when this Bill becomes law. A minimum mandatory sentence is a sentence which a person who commits a certain offence must be given and must serve. At present, exceptional circumstances can be taken into account by judges exercising judicial discretion. They have exercised that discretion in 96% of the cases that have come before them. How can we call those "minimum mandatory sentences"?We are following the same course with firearms. I raised the issue at today's meeting of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights and was told that the same situation will apply — the judges will have discretion. The Minister will table amendments which require judges to bear certain circumstances in mind when passing sentence. If that is so, sentences will not be minimum mandatory sentences but ones which judges will pass using their judicial discretion. Is that the best way to nail hardened criminals? Are there not other ways to ensure those who commit serious crime do the time?I worry that a fixation with an approach that is misnamed will lead us to fail to deal with hardened criminals effectively. A serious debate on sentencing is necessary, though we will not have time today, to examine how we can ensure that those who commit serious violent crime are imprisoned and kept in prison, while those convicted for non-payment of fines are kept out. The Minister's approach to this Bill will not achieve that outcome, despite the reference to minimum mandatory sentences. Why do we not have proper guidance, in the form of a database, or follow the approach in other countries where judges are required to explain in open court why they stray from set tariffs? A range of possibilities is available but the Minister has put all his eggs into one minimum mandatory sentence basket that is leaking all over the place.I will touch on a number of other issues. The Minister said a year ago he would not provide for a DNA database in the Bill. Despite 300 pages of new amendments this Bill continues not to provide for such a database, which is an essential tool.

The Minister seems to be shovelling everything into this Bill, making another Bill unlikely during his term as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. If there is to be another Bill I call for it to be brought forward quickly because the database is an essential tool in the fight against crime.The Minister refers to anti-social behaviour orders as if they alone were the answer to anti-social behaviour. I do not object to ASBOs. I have reviewed their operation in other countries and believe they have a minor role in dealing with the problem. I am concerned that the Minister, having made the case for and introduced ASBOs, will sit back and consider his job done. That would be the wrong approach. I have always believed that we need a comprehensive approach to anti-social behaviour, which has become a worrying phenomenon in our towns, cities and estates today. I referred to the increased crime rate since Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats came to power in 1998 but the enormous increase in anti-social behaviour has not been recorded. I do not have figures, but anecdotal evidence from every town and estate makes it clear that there has been an enormous increase. That is why the comprehensive approach, advocated by Fine Gael in its 30-point programme, is needed to confront anti-social behaviour.I and my colleague, Deputy Kenny, the leader of Fine Gael, have recommended dealing with the issues separately, such as by the introduction of a separate firearms Bill, which I proposed a year ago. The existing Firearms Bill goes back to 1925 and needs to be updated but the changes proposed in that area are a mere add-on to the Criminal Justice Bill. It would have been far more sensible to address it separately. Another opportunity was missed in the amendments to the Explosives Act, which goes back even further, to 1875.As I said at the outset, Fine Gael has always been associated with law and order and I am happy to continue that association as spokesperson for the party. However, I put more emphasis on order than law. We must fill legal loopholes and we will approach this Bill at its relevant stages constructively. We will try to ensure that necessary amendments are made but I am worried that the Bill contains such a hotchpotch of measures that it will not receive the detailed treatment it needs. There is no point enacting provisions unless they have been carefully examined and we can be sure they will constitute the most effective way to deal with the issues under discussion. Given the vast number of amendments we are confronted with, that may not be allowed to happen. At the very minimum we must ensure that adequate time is allowed to tease out the proposals on Committee and Report Stages. It is very important that there is no guillotine to aspects of the Bill. I invite the Minister to give a commitment in that regard, because if he does so he will get constructive co-operation from my party to ensure we have legislation that is as effective as possible.There is a danger that, even if we are able so to do, the Minister will lapse into his self-congratulatory mode, believing his own rhetoric and refusing to accept that closing loopholes in the law is only a minor part of the fight against crime. The shootings and murders we have witnessed in the past year or two will not be dealt with merely by changes in the law. A clear message must be sent to hardened criminals that there is a good chance they will be prevented from breaking the law and committing violent crime, and if they do, there is a good chance they will be caught and there is every chance they will end up in jail. Unless this fear exists I do not see such people taking any notice of arcane debates in this House or in committee meetings or changes to the law. The only way to confront these people is to ensure the Garda Síochána is properly resourced and equipped with manpower and equipment to pursue these criminals day and night. Unfortunately, that is not happening at present and that is what concerns me about this motion.This concern was accentuated by the Minister's opening remarks in which he congratulated himself on the low crime rate and the fact that it is falling. Crime is not low here and it is not falling. The Garda Síochána does not have the resources to properly confront crime. I wish to see the necessary resources made available and I will support any changes to eradicate loopholes in the law but not at the cost of ignoring the basic problems outlined above. Resources and equipment should be made available and used to maximum effect through proper rostering, intelligence-led policing and ensuring a police presence at the right time and place. That has not been addressed sufficiently.I do not oppose the motion and am pleased these provisions will be debated in committee. The Opposition will constructively table amendments and ensure the proposals are adequately debated. The Minister has chosen to put one gargantuan Bill on the Statute Book and he must accept that it will take considerable time to ensure it is in proper shape. The Opposition will give adequate time to ensure the Bill is on the Statute Book during the lifetime of this Government. If it is not, the Minister will have to bear the responsibility.

I expected to discuss this Bill much earlier and with fewer amendments. I previously articulated my disappointment with the manner in which the Minister produces legislation. He does not seem to have learned his lesson and does not listen to us despite his experience as Attorney General, senior counsel and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.It is almost two years since the heads of this legislation were presented — I remember attending the press conference in Government Buildings. The heads of the Bill were presented in April, the Bill was published in July 2004 and it was debated in the Dáil in January 2005 and the autumn of the same year. Now, 15 months after we last spoke on this legislation, the Minister has produced approximately 200 new amendments and the Bill has expanded by a multiple of five or six times its original size. This is a legislative shambles.As well as the delay and the stop-start approach, the Minister has put the cart before the horse, resulting in Members debating the original legislative offering from July 2004 on Second Stage. There is no opportunity to debate the meat of this legislation, the new amendments. Two years and 200 amendments later the Minister is considering tabling further amendments to prolong the issue further. One cannot emphasise how unsatisfactory that is, given the co-operation by the Opposition in agreeing to take Committee Stage next week, when the Minister wishes to deal with a large part of the Bill. We received these amendments last week — and they are still not properly printed — and it is ridiculous that we must put forward our amendments in the space of a couple of days, given the disparity in the availability of resources to the Minister and the Opposition. We do not have the resources to respond in this fashion, yet we have agreed to co-operate with the Minister because we are keen to see the legislative process expedited. Given the two-year timespan since publication of the heads of the Bill, the Opposition should be given a decent opportunity to prepare amendments.The amendments contain provisions for major new offences, including anti-social behaviour orders, firearms offences and firearms amnesties, organised crime and drug trafficking. While most of these are welcome, many of them are controversial and the Minister's actions have prevented a full Dáil debate on them. Despite the plethora of amendments produced, many important areas have been omitted. One of the most glaring omissions is the failure to address interviews with suspects in Garda custody. The Criminal Justice Bill 2004 confers extensive new powers on the Garda Síochána and extends the period of detention for questioning from six hours, as provided for in the 1984 legislation, to 24 hours, with an eight-hour break, amounting to 32 hours in Garda custody without judicial supervision or guaranteed access to a lawyer.The Morris tribunal revealed shocking admissions of serious abuse of two women suspects in Garda custody in Donegal, the bugging of the interview rooms and unauthorised obtaining of telephone records. It is over 25 years since Mr. Justice Barra Ó Briain recommended to the government of the day that all interviews of suspects in custody should be taped. The Minister should consider a statutory provision in this legislation to make audio and video recording of Garda interviews mandatory. Given the technology available, such a measure should not pose a problem. This would prevent abuse of those held in custody and would protect gardaí from false or spurious allegations made against them. Dundalk Garda station, one of the largest in the country, still has no audio-visual equipment in its interview rooms. The two reports of the Morris tribunal influenced the formulation of the Garda Síochána legislation we passed last year, particularly on the ombudsman commission, the inspectorate and the improvement of management structures. All these were highlighted by Mr. Justice Frederick Morris and that was important in the legislation the Minister introduced. Now Mr. Justice Morris has again presented a serious situation as illustrated by yesterday's revelations. I do not know what has emerged today. Today's edition of The Irish Times reports what Detective Sergeant John White said when he withdrew his original statement to the Morris tribunal. He admitted to abusive, excessive and inappropriate language during the interrogation, acknowledged that the spirit and the letter of Garda custody regulations were breached, accepted his conduct fell below acceptable standards and agreed with many claims made by the two women. He said graphic photographs of the body of Mr. Richie Barron were shown to the women and crude accusations of infidelity by Ms McConnell’s husband, Mr. Mark McConnell, were made to her and Ms Brolly. Ms Brolly was denied access to her husband and a chair was roughly skidded across the room during Ms McConnell’s interview. The lights were switched on and off during the interview and information was kept out of the interview notes. Detective Sergeant White said:The mood in the Garda station was one of high excitement and anticipation at the prospect of solving the murder. It was made clear to me that my role was to "break" the persons to be interviewed for the purpose of corroborating the suspicions of An Garda Síochána.He said he has always believed the interview rooms at Letterkenny Garda station are bugged and claims he was supplied with the telephone records of Ms Brolly's husband but was warned not to include them in interview notes because they had been obtained in an unauthorised manner.This is a litany of breaches of proper procedures and law, and is not a report but one day's revelations of the Morris tribunal. We must take those into consideration and one way to do so is to make a statutory provision that all interviews of suspects are audio-visually recorded. While the Minister has done much good work on installing this equipment throughout the country, when an important station such as Dundalk does not have it, there are obviously major gaps. I mention this as one of the glaring omissions because this legislation gives enormous power to the Garda in many areas including detention and search and we must ensure that safeguards are in place.There are other important areas of omission. When the Ferns Report was published the Minister made a commitment to bring forward appropriate amendments to the Criminal Justice Bill to deal with the failure to alleviate the risk of the sexual abuse of a child when somebody knows about such abuse but neglects to bring that information to the authorities. While I understood this was to be one of the major amendments, and that the Minister may make a further amendment to that effect, it should be among the amendments before us because the Minister promised it during the Ferns Report debate. There is no mention of indexation of fines, which could easily have been brought forward in this legislation. It would be useful when we wait for such long periods of time.

There is no provision for something like restorative justice, which would have been good. While we have had to wait a long time, many items are not included.We can examine the legislation only in the context of what is happening in society. The situation regarding criminal activity is unattractive. While the Minister says headline offences, when looked at in a general context, have not substantially increased over a period, some of them have increased dramatically. In the past 12 months murders have increased by 47%, firearm offences by 20% and aggravated rape by 33% while drugs seizures increased by 20%. The drugs seizure increase is alarming because drug crime is out of control and the junior Minister with responsibility for it is unable to provide proper leadership, show commitment and provide the resources to get the national drugs strategy up and running again. It has lost its morale and is going nowhere. The situation is going from bad to worse.The increase in gangland killings has been enormous since the Minister's infamous remark about "the last sting of a dying wasp" in October 2004 when we thought everything was under control. Since then gangland murders have increased to an inordinate degree. With what happened on the M50, the tragic killing of Donna Cleary, the explosive devices that have been deployed and the availability and use of firearms, including automatic and semi-automatic weapons, it is only a matter of time before some terrible tragedy takes place in the community. With the settling of minor scores through the use of firearms, Ireland will become something like we have seen in Hollywood mobster films. This is a real concern and it is important we be seen to take substantial action on it.The detection rate does not encourage. As Deputy O'Keeffe said, the overall crime detection rate has decreased. Last year it was down 1% from 35% to 34%. We do not want it to go in that direction. I got some statistics from the Minister on the detection rate of serious crimes in my constituency and they make unhappy reading. Burglary is one of the major crimes that is increasing while the detection rate is decreasing. Only when one examines such statistics and sees the broader picture does one realise how bad the situation is in certain areas. Meanwhile the Garda is up in arms over the introduction of the volunteer Garda force and claims it is not properly resourced. The Garda does not have proper telecommunications, the promised 2,000 gardaí, stab vests or cars in proper condition, as we saw in today's newspaper reports on the recent tragedy. I hope many of the provisions will be useful — they are certainly logical and overdue.It is time we had a firearms amnesty and sought to acquire all illegal weapons in the community. It should be made clear that those in possession of illegal weapons after such an amnesty will be hit very strongly with tough custodial sentences. I hope this will be the case.I do not expect the amendment of the Explosives Act 1875 to have any effect on the possession of fireworks for sale because fireworks are readily available in Northern Ireland, where their sale does not constitute an offence. We have made no attempt to create a common policy for the two jurisdictions. Unless this happens, amending the legislation will not have any effect. Perhaps progress will be made when European standards are co-ordinated, as I understand is being proposed.I am happy enough with the proposal to deal with organised crime in terms of conspiracy, matters pertaining to domestic law and the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime. It will be interesting to see how the provisions dealing with offences in terms of contributing or participating in criminal activity or criminal organisation and benefiting from a criminal organisation will operate in practice. It is time we began to target gangland criminal activity in a more focused fashion than is possible at present. I certainly hope the legislation will work.I am not so sure about the amendments regarding the misuse of drugs and whether they will result in much progress. It certainly seems ill-advised not to alter the value of drugs that will warrant a minimum sentence of ten years, which value was set at €13,000 on the enactment of the 1997 legislation ten years ago. It seems it is necessary to distinguish, in the first instance, between hard and soft drugs, and also to have a threshold of value that would encourage judges not to find loopholes, as they seem to be able to do at present. That mandatory sentences have been imposed in only 4% of cases where they could have and perhaps should have been imposed under the legislation is not very satisfactory.I fail to understand the argument for having a maximum sentence of seven years for the supply of drugs to prisons, irrespective of the quantity, given that there is a minimum sentence of ten years for possessing drugs to the value of €13,000. There is no logic behind the penalties for those two offences.I am in favour of the establishment of a register of drug offenders. I like the idea of notifying victims on the release of an offender.I welcome the provisions to have a statutory basis for the imposition of fines and to defer sentences subject to good behaviour. I am not sure how the restrictions on movement will work out in terms of electronic tagging. This has not been provided for sufficiently.I do not have time to discuss anti-social behaviour orders, but it is very clear the Government has failed drastically to resource the implementation of the Children Act 2001. Having failed to do so, it must introduce a short, sharp solution, namely, the criminalisation of young people through the imposition of anti-social behaviour orders.We need a package of legislation and resources that includes leadership and commitment. We have had very little in this regard to deal with crime in recent years. I hope we expedite the legislation in the House and that the Minister will take on board some of my suggestions and those of other Members in respect of providing the necessary gardaí, resourcing the Garda sufficiently, providing the necessary back-up and equipment and instigating real action in the not-too-distant future.

The last time I did so was rather eventful and I hope, for my sake and that of the Minister, that today will be less exciting.We are critical of the hotchpotch approach of the Criminal Justice Bill 2004, which throws everything into the mix. It attempts to legislate for a broad range of issues, from the use of fireworks and drug trafficking offences to torture, anti-social behaviour and the Children Act 2001. It is wholly inappropriate that such a wide range of issues be dealt with under one Bill. My colleague, Deputy Cuffe, is critical of the undemocratic manner in which the Minister is forcing this legislation through the House without allowing Members to digest fully the 255 pages of draft amendments he has tabled. Deputy Cuffe believes this to be unacceptable.Let me comment on a number of aspects of the Minister's speech. He quite rightly spoke of the need for enhanced powers for the Garda Síochána to combat crime. I had occasion recently to meet representatives of the Garda Representative Association and noted that their real complaint concerned the lack of resources. Deputy Jim O'Keeffe was to allude to this but did not do so in the body of his speech. When one reads some of the complaints of members of the force, one will realise they are quite shocking. I find it difficult to believe they do not have batteries for their torches and have to purchase them themselves. During the recent riots in Dublin, their radios did not work, and this is one reason they want an independent inquiry into those riots. They claim they were left in the lurch on the day and that Garda management and the Minister should be held accountable. Many members of the Garda ended up in hospital and it was a terrible, traumatic day for so many of them. They want accountability and in this regard Members, at least all those on this side of the House, would welcome an independent inquiry into the riots. It is very important that we get to the bottom of what happened and understand why certain decisions were made.Some of the Minister's claims have been rebutted. On the issue of crime statistics, 85% of burglaries, 65% of thefts and 62% of robberies go undetected. I know from my constituency that people have given up going to the gardaí. There have been repeated burglaries in the constituency and many of those living there are at the end of their tether. We now have fewer gardaí per head of population than we did some years ago — this fact has been confirmed in the response to a parliamentary question to the Minister tabled by my colleague, Deputy Cuffe. It is up to the Minister to resource the Garda. To do so we require extra gardaí on the beat, which the Green Party has repeatedly requested.Deputy Jim O'Keeffe spoke about minimum sentencing to which the Minister referred. Deputy Gregory has often spoken about this matter. Judges are now adopting minimum sentences as the rule rather than the exception. While people are now getting ten-year sentences, they have become the maximum sentences in many cases.I very much welcome the introduction of a gun amnesty, for which my colleague, Deputy Cuffe, has repeatedly called. It makes sense when one considers what is happening in our city at the moment. It would be a first step in trying to deal with serious gun related crime.I refer briefly to anti-social behaviour orders, ASBOs. We already have a wide range of measures to combat anti-social behaviour, which are being starved of the resources to allow them work. Rather than introducing new and conflicting solutions to problems, such as ASBOs, let us implement the Children Act 2001 in full and give it a chance to work. ASBOs are also in direct contravention of the Children Act 2001 which contains a plethora of measures designed to deal with the problem of anti-social behaviour perpetrated by young people. Why would the Minister not implement the Act in full rather than introduce irrelevant legislation which will serve to stigmatise and marginalise troubled youngsters further?Many measures are available to combat anti-social behaviour. I have referred to the Children Act 2001. We should give the juvenile liaison officers sufficient resources, provide more community gardaí, fill the vacant posts on the National Educational Welfare Board and invest in proper facilities in disadvantaged areas as was promised under the RAPID programme. Let us be tough on crime, but certainly let us be tough on the causes of crime. We know that many people involved in drug gangs come from disadvantaged areas.One of the main causes of anti-social behaviour is alcohol. While I welcome the Minister's miscellaneous proposals to protect staff in accident and emergency departments, one of the main causes of these attacks and problems in accident and emergency units is alcohol. We spend €6.6 billion each year on alcohol and yet the cost of alcohol related problems is €2.4 billion, including anti-social behaviour, absenteeism etc., which represents an enormous cost on society. I would like to see more joined-up thinking from the Government on alcohol. It is our biggest drug problem and yet the Government chooses to ignore it. The alcohol products Bill was shelved by the Government, which was kowtowing to the vested interest of the very strong alcohol industry.I agree with the comments made about the Morris tribunal. We need to introduce mandatory audio and video recording. The frontline staff dealing with problems in these areas need to be funded properly.
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	316	The Government is inserting more than 200 amendments into a Bill with just 38 sections. The time allowed to comment on the new sections and even to digest them has been grossly inadequate. The Minister's war on fundamental rights is at the heart of this overwhelmingly regressive Bill and at the heart of the process surrounding its introduction. The Bill should be withdrawn. If the Minister is hell bent on introducing the wide-ranging provisions contained in this legislation, he should submit a number of focused Bills allowing full Oireachtas scrutiny and debate on each one.Over the course of the debate on this motion my colleagues will highlight the threats it poses to the most basic and fundamental civil liberties. Deputy Ó Caoláin will outline our concerns relating to the Minister's efforts to roll back on child protection by lowering the age of criminal responsibility, failing to address the plethora of grave problems in St. Patrick's Institution, removing responsibility for the detention of children from the Minister for Education and Science, and lifting restrictions on the identification of children in criminal proceedings.Deputies Ó Snodaigh and Ferris will examine the motives behind and the potential effectiveness of new sections relating to gangland crimes, conspiracy, drugs, sentencing and electronic tagging. They will focus on the human rights compliance of the proposed legislation or rather the non-compliance of same.I wish to focus on the provisions for anti-social behaviour orders contained in the new sections, Parts 11 and 13, of the Bill. ASBOs are flawed in that they are contrary to fundamental human rights and they do not work. Sinn Féin opposed the introduction of ASBOs to the Six Counties and will continue to oppose their introduction here. The Irish Youth Justice Alliance, a coalition of organisations and individuals who work towards reforming the juvenile justice system, has outlined many of the problems with ASBOs. Among these are the fact that as ASBOs involve the imposition of penal sanctions for the breach of an order made in civil proceedings, they are inconsistent with the European Convention on Human Rights. Furthermore, the conditions imposed by an ASBO may involve a disproportionate interference with personal and private rights, and civil liberties.Breach of an ASBO is a criminal offence but because ASBOs are civil orders, the rules of evidence are reduced and the burden of proof is on the balance of probabilities rather than beyond reasonable doubt, which undermines and denies the right to a fair trial. In cases involving criminal proceedings against children in particular, the normal safeguards should be augmented and not diminished. ASBOs run contrary to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and to international standards and guidelines on youth justice.In particular, the Government's proposals run counter to the central logic of the Children Act 2001 which, by the admission of the Minister of State with responsibility for children, is an Act that "is regarded as setting a framework for a modern and progressive youth justice system [and] reflects best international practice". The Children Act 2001 was 30 years in the drafting. In the past five years, the Government has failed to put into operation and resource the Children Act.While the definition of anti-social behaviour employed by the Minister is a marginal improvement on that used by the British, it is still too vague and the core problems I have outlined still stand. In addition, the stages prior to the application for an ASBO on a child suffer from an unfettered assumption of Garda infallibility. This is neither in the interests of the child nor in the interests of the Garda Síochána. Of equal importance is that it is not in the interests of public confidence in it.In Tallaght today before coming to the House I met a single mother of one child who told me of her family having been petrol bombed. The Garda was investigating the incident. Her house was petrol bombed because young thugs from the area called to the house looking for money for cigarettes and when she told them to get away from the door, a petrol bomb was thrown at the house. Another woman to whom I spoke in recent days had her garden wall knocked down and every night young thugs sit on bollards beside her house shouting, roaring and basically terrorising her in her home.The Government is attempting to legislate away complex problems that, by contrast, Sinn Féin recognises require the resourcing and implementation of existing laws and investment in communities. The Bill, old and new, amounts to a grave and disproportionate assault on fundamental human rights.

When the members of Cabinet were announced, I warmly welcomed the appointment of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. However, since then, to put it mildly, I have become disillusioned. Public confidence in the rule of law and the ability of the justice system to deal with the current lawlessness is at an all-time low. When mob rule is rampant, society demands and expects to receive leadership. That should come from Government and specifically from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It is very disappointing, therefore, that the Minister's recent utterances did not address the current lawlessness enveloping our country. His recent hysterical, over the top, inappropriate and irresponsible comments did not relate to crime but to statistics concerning the number of gardaí in the Dublin region.

It was embarrassing, to put it mildly, to see our Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform making a fool of himself in a bullying manner on national television and, in the process, letting himself and all of us down. I say "our" Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform because he is this country's Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. He should act accordingly, rather than like some local tribal warlord whom one dares not cross, question or disagree with. Our citizens are entitled to be represented by Ministers who have a capacity for balance, understanding and leadership. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has not displayed any of those qualities in recent times, unfortunately. He has shown himself to be self-centred, dictatorial and intolerant of views that are contrary to his own. As Ireland is a democracy, people are entitled to make up their own minds on issues and express their views without fear. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should take the lead in protecting the rights of our citizens and ensuring that freedom of expression is guaranteed. The protection of the rights of citizens should come without any qualification, should be unequivocal and should not be accompanied by any side-swipes unbecoming of a Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.When the Criminal Justice Bill 2004 was published, it comprised 38 pages. The amendments to the Bill which have been published by the Minister comprise a further 326 pages, which means they are 8.5 times the size of the original Bill. The House has been asked to take this legislation seriously, but how can it do so? How can Members be confident that the Minister knows what he is doing when he has made such a monumental cock-up when introducing legislation to this House? His mistake has been highlighted by the need for him to issue bizarre instructions to the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights telling it that it has the power to make provisions in the Criminal Justice Bill 2004 in respect of 13 separate matters. It is unacceptable that legislation is being put through the House in such an incompetent manner.

It has been estimated that the annual turnover of what is known as "organised crime" is €1,200 billion. Organised crime, which has become transnational as criminals have taken advantage of the globalisation of the world's economies, is part of criminal behaviour known as "group delinquency", which is a complex phenomenon that is difficult to distinguish from the operations of organised gangs and mafias. Contrary to common perception, organised crime is not a modern phenomenon. It evolved in the 17th and 18th centuries, when crime gangs engaged in illegal group activities across central Europe. The Sicilian Mafia was the linchpin of organised crime in the New World, particularly after the prohibition of alcohol in the United States, which allowed crime families to dominate the alcohol market and various other trades which generate enormous profits.Ireland has not escaped the phenomenon of transnational organised crime — organised crime that is carried out across borders — which is an aspect of organised criminal activity that has flourished over the past decade. The secret and illegal trafficking of human beings for involuntary servitude in places like Ireland is the world's second most profitable enterprise, after drug trafficking. We all remember that the bodies of eight people, who had suffocated over a period of time, were found in a freight container in County Wexford five years ago.It is natural that eliminating the trafficking of human beings should be a priority, but we should not lose sight of our obligations to genuine asylum seekers who are fleeing persecution. There is an urgent need to impose stiff penalties on those involved in the recruitment, transportation and harbouring of people for the purposes of exploitation. I consider the proposed fine of €13,000 in cases of drug trafficking to be somewhat conservative, when one considers the massive profits that can be made from this insidious trade. If a criminal knows he will get 15 years in prison for firing a gun, he might think twice before he pulls the trigger. I know we have heard about people who were off their heads when they pulled the trigger, but we should not forget that many of the people to whom I refer are not off their heads when they use firearms.I agree with the proposed imposition of mandatory fines and penalties for firearms offences. I suggest that a minimum sentence of five years be imposed on those who use guns in criminal activities. Such a term of imprisonment would be in addition to any sentence imposed for the crime itself. I propose that the five-year term be increased to ten years if a gun is fired and to 15 years if someone is shot. Such penalties would make people think twice. That illegally obtained automatic handguns are the weapons of first choice for most criminals was shown graphically last weekend on the M50. I think all Deputies know about the dangerous situation that arose on that occasion. Increased penalties like those I have proposed should also apply to serious offences committed with any weapon — not just a gun.

A project team was established in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to review the delivery of youth justice services and to make recommendations on how the structures could be improved. The project team examined the system in place, consulted widely in the statutory and non-statutory sectors and compared our structures with best international practice. The team's findings indicated that the Children Act 2001 provides a sound legislative basis for a modern and progressive youth justice system that compares favourably with international practice. Most Deputies will agree with that. However, the team also found that the structures in place for the delivery of services under the Act and throughout the youth justice system are fragmented and involve a wide range of Departments and agencies that do not always work together in an effective manner.The report of the youth justice review suggested that a single body was needed to provide clear and effective leadership across all youth justice services and to bring a coherent and co-ordinated approach to the delivery of services to young offenders. It recommended that a new youth justice service be established to provide this leadership and to develop a national strategy for youth justice. The review further recommended that the new service should assume responsibility for managing services across all areas of youth justice, including detention, community sanctions, restorative justice and the implementation of the outstanding provisions of the Children Act 2001. I brought some proposals to the Government last December on foot of the review. The Government agreed a number of major reforms to the youth justice system, including the establishment of an overall youth justice service with responsibility for all youth justice services. The Government also agreed to the drafting of legislative amendments to give effect to the proposals.The fundamental decision to establish a youth justice service with responsibility for all youth justice matters was taken by the Government. For the first time since the foundation of the State, a single youth justice service will exist within a Government office — the office of the Minister for children — to administer these services. This is a remarkable development. I take considerable pride in the Government's decision to put in place a single youth justice service, which is fundamental to making progress. Taking responsibility for the implementation of the youth justice provisions of the Children Act 2001 was ducked when the Act was passed. It was ducked in the sense that it was not clearly or coherently stated that an agency or service was put in charge of the implementation of the Act.The new youth justice service, which has been established as an executive office of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, will be located with a number of other services for children in the office of the Minister for children. The office, for which I will have responsibility, will place the interests of children at the heart of government and will build on what was achieved under the national children's strategy. I have outlined the responsibilities of the new office. I remind the House that the office will be responsible for policy and legislative work on child welfare and protection under the Department of Health and Children. It is essential that such work should be located with the youth justice work that will be devolved to me from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Departments in question will retain responsibility for these areas, but the innovative approach being pursued will provide for a more integrated and strategic approach to this issue. I attend Government meetings on these matters on a regular basis.On the proposed amendments to the Children Act 2001 to be made in the Criminal Justice Bill 2004, the first set of amendments about which I will speak provides for the transfer of responsibility for children's detention schools from the Department of Education and Science to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in which the youth justice service will be located. This will bring the schools in question under the same administrative structure that will develop the youth justice strategy, manage the delivery and development of non-custodial sanctions and co-ordinate youth justice services at national and local levels. It has the added benefit of bringing detention services under the strategic direction of the office of the Minister for children to ensure that detention is addressed within the wider context of children's services generally. The amendment to the definition of "Minister" provides for the transfer of these responsibilities. A number of other amendments follow consequentially from the transfer.Education, not detention, is the core business of the Department of Education and Science. Transferring responsibility for detention to the youth justice service will allow the Department to concentrate on delivering educational services to young offenders, both in custody and within the community. The new section 159A of the Act of 2001 provides for the vocational education committees to assume responsibility for the delivery of educational services within the children detention schools. The VECs are best placed to deliver the continuity of education and training services in detention and the community that these children need. The Department is also developing an education strategy to address the wide range of educational needs of offending children.The second matter, consequential on the first I have outlined to the House, is the abolition of children detention centres. As a consequence of the transfer of responsibility for detention for those under 16 years, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, through the youth justice service, will have responsibility for the detention of children up to the age of 18. Responsibility for 16 and 17 year olds will transfer to the youth justice service from the Prison Service. Under the Children Act 2001, children aged 16 and 17 years were to be accommodated in detention centres, separate from adult offenders, under the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. While the centres were separate from those in which adult offenders were incarcerated, they could be built and constructed as integral parts of prison complexes, with a simple physical separation. This group of 16 and 17 year olds were necessarily separated from children under 16 because such children were the responsibility of another Department. Under the new arrangements, with one Department responsible for the detention of all children up to the age of 18 years, the separation at age 16 becomes redundant.A series of amendments remove references to "children detention centres" from the Act, leaving a streamlined system based on a child detention school model for all children detention services. This model is focused on addressing the underlying needs of the offending child or youth and rehabilitating him or her. Children detention schools combine care staff with a secure setting which offers facilities and programmes specifically tailored to meet the needs of children. Under these new structures, no child will be detained within the prison system. Neither will any child be detained in an annex to the prison system. What was envisaged in the 2001 Act was that 16 and 17 year olds would be detained in what were dedicated annexes to the prison system. That is no longer provided for under this legislation. Provision is contained in the legislation to ensure St. Patrick's Institution can continue to be used on an interim basis, pending the development of the new detention schools that will be required. The underlying legislative provisions, however, can be commenced with alacrity. The new structures provided for in the amendments focus on addressing the needs of offending children within the wider strategic environment of children's services and create a single cohesive system for youth detention services.I turn to the subject of the age of criminal responsibility. The age of criminal responsibility provided for in the Children Act 2001 is 12 years. I am anxious to ensure this aspect of the Act is commenced within three months from the enactment of this Bill. In my consideration of this issue several practical problems have arisen. There is a need to secure effective control of all prosecutions of children under the age of 14 years. Accordingly, it is proposed to require the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions before proceedings can be taken against a child aged under 14 years. I have consulted the Director of Public Prosecutions as regards this proposal and he is agreeable to it. The current position is that the Garda Síochána can prosecute a child under the age of 14 years without the leave of the Director of Public Prosecutions.It is essential that there be a measure of control. Children aged 10 or 11 years who engage in criminal behaviour should be accountable under the juvenile diversion programme for their behaviour. One of the effects of the original provisions of the 2001 Act was that a juvenile liaison officer could not have any dealings with a child aged 10 or 11 years who engaged in criminal behaviour. This is not a reasonable position and the provisions in the 2001 Act are to be modified to permit children, aged 10 or 11 years, to be admitted into the Garda diversion programme. Admission into the programme does not involve any conviction or culpability or reference to the character of the person concerned. The very low number of ten and 11 year olds who engage in serious criminal behaviour such as manslaughter or rape may be charged for their behaviour under another modification I am introducing to the 2001 Act. That said, the intention, subject to these reasonable amendments, is to commence the entire provision with three months of the Bill's enactment.I turn to the subject of anti-social behaviour orders, which were subject to considerable discussion in the course of preparation of these amendments. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, asked me to look at this issue and devise a scheme which would be consistent with what was envisaged by the Oireachtas in the Children Act 2001. Despite this, the suggestion has constantly been made by many in the public debate that the Minister is introducing the same type of order for those under 18 years as for those over that age. That is not the case. The amendments will entail the insertion of a new Part into the Children Act to provide for anti-social behaviour orders for children aged between 12 and 18 years. The Minister in his contribution to this debate has pointed out that the proposal for anti-social behaviour orders in the case of children is framed in the context of the overall philosophy and policy that underpins the Children Act. Every effort is made to provide an opportunity for the child and his or her parents or guardians to address the behavioural problems in a way that minimises contact with the criminal justice system. These proposals will also ensure there will be full parental involvement at all relevant stages.Before outlining in more detail how the arrangements will work, I want to say a few words about the definition being used for anti-social behaviour. Anti-social behaviour will arise where a child causes or is likely to cause harassment or where significant or persistent alarm, distress, fear or intimidation is caused or is likely to be caused to anther person. It will also arise where there is significant or persistent impairment in the use and enjoyment of their property by the other person as a result of anti-social activity. I am ensuring a series of checks and balances is included because I do not want a situation where unreasonable complaints by, for example, some householders would result in an order being issued. While it is true that the effect of the behaviour as experienced by the householder must be a critical factor, it will, in the first instance, be a matter for the Garda to determine if, in all the circumstances, a complaint is well founded. Ultimately, it will be a matter for the court to decide. I am keen to ensure young people should not feel harassed and victimised by the new procedures but I am equally determined that we must put in place effective remedies that will address the serious problems in many neighbourhoods and town centres.Turning to how the procedure will operate, the first step will entail a garda issuing a "behaviour warning" to the child. A warning may arise from a complaint or the direct observation by the garda of the activity in question. The warning will remain in place for three months. In cases where, subsequent to the warning being breached, an order is sought from the court, the warning will remain in place until the court reaches a decision. After a warning has issued, the local Garda superintendent may convene a meeting to discuss the child's behaviour. The meeting will be attended by the child, his or her parents or guardian, the garda who issued the warning and, as appropriate, the juvenile liaison officer and any other person whom the superintendent thinks may assist the child. The meeting may result in a "good behaviour contract". The superintendent will also have the option of referring the child to the diversion programme. This can happen at any time after the behaviour warning has issued. Where the superintendent believes a placement on the diversion programme would not be appropriate, he or she may apply to the Children's Court for an anti-social behaviour order. The parents or guardians will be required to attend any court hearings. The court will apply the civil standard in the proceedings, thus ensuring the child will not acquire a criminal record in the event of an order being granted. The court may grant the application if it considers an order is a reasonable and proportionate remedy. A child who breaches an order will be liable to a fine of up to €800 or €1,500, if costs also arise. Full rights to appeal against an order or have it varied are being provided. Special arrangements are being included to ensure legal aid is available when necessary.I have outlined the main aspects of the new procedure. I expect we will have a further opportunity to consider the details of the proposals when the committee examines these amendments. However, it will be clear that the local superintendent will have a key role to play. I am sure we will be able to rely on the good judgment and experience of the Garda when it comes to operating the new arrangements. It is also very clear that an application for an order will arise as a last resort, after several other options have been considered and found not to be suitable. It is also worth saying that if the activity in question is sufficiently serious, the option of bringing criminal charges will remain unaffected by the introduction of anti-social behaviour orders.

#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	325	Fine Gael introduces this Bill to ban the use of hand-held mobile phones because of the evidence that their use is a major driver distraction and, consequently, a direct cause or contributory factor in a significant number of accidents. We have poor accident information in Ireland. Much relevant information is not collected and much of what is collected is not collated and, therefore, not available in a useful and useable form. Nevertheless, we know enough and there is enough international evidence to merit urgent and decisive action to terminate the practice of using hand-held mobile phones with all possible speed. Even without research evidence, the evidence of our own eyes can tell us that not only is the practice of using hand-held mobile phones widespread, but that potentially dangerous use, particularly by van and truck drivers, is commonplace and becoming more so. It is hardly necessary to highlight the potential damage a heavy vehicle can do when a driver is distracted by a call and not in full control of the vehicle by virtue of the necessity to remove one hand from the steering wheel to hold the phone.This is a short uncomplicated Bill that deliberately sets out to do one simple thing; to ban the use or holding of a mobile phone while driving a car. The purpose of the Bill is to make the holding of a phone an offence. We do not propose to include a requirement to prove the phone is actually being used. Neither is there an attempt, as in previous efforts to legislate, to ban having the phone on or about the person, on the seat, in the boot, or anywhere else. Proof of an offence will be provided either by way of the evidence of a garda who witnessed the event or a photographic record to support the charge. There is also provision for an on-the-spot fine of €80, subject to two penalty points on acceptance of the fine. Exemptions and defences are also created in the Bill to overcome problems encountered in previous legislative attempts. For instance, the emergency services and the Garda would be exempt from its provisions and drivers could also call emergency services on a hand-held mobile phone in circumstances that constituted a genuine emergency.The Bill will merely prohibit the use of hand-held mobile phones by drivers of vehicles. The legislation will not apply to use by passengers, save in one situation — where a passenger is the full licence-holding supervisor of a learner driver. In this circumstance it is reasonable to expect the passenger to have the full use of both hands in case of an emergency or loss of control by the learner driver. However, the legislation requiring a supervising driver for learners is almost completely ignored. In addition, an official blind eye is turned to this breach of the law. This is inevitable and, in practical terms, unavoidable in a situation where learner drivers can wait over a year for a test. I recognise that including a mobile phone ban for supervisory passengers is probably irrelevant and redundant for the moment, but I include it because I hope some day we will be able to enforce it and the many other provisions of the road safety regime currently on hold pending the introduction of an efficient testing system.The Bill does not seek to ban the use of hands-free mobile phones, bluetooth or even earpieces. Such use, if made an offence, would be impossible to detect. I also believe it would be impossible to engender any level of popular support for such a measure. I am told that for businesses the savings in petrol costs are enormous by virtue of drivers having access to a mobile phone because it eliminates many previously wasted journeys, thus saving time and money. However, recent research suggests that even hands-free mobile phones are a driver distraction, and I believe this to be the case. Most of us would be conscious of the distraction of a telephone call when dealing with a difficult motoring manoeuvre, changing lanes in fast traffic, doing a three-point turn and so on. Such a conversation can be a distraction in the way that a conversation with a passenger is not, simply because the passenger is aware of the level of attention required by the driver and the general context of the conversation and so can moderate discussion accordingly. In the case of a mobile phone call the caller may not even be aware the recipient is driving a car. At least, with a hands-free mobile phone, the driver has better control of the vehicle.I stress that careless driving, where loss of control is due to the use of any kind of phone, including a hands-free phone, will remain a separate offence, as will loss of control due to texting with a hands-free phone, a particularly risky undertaking. Other categories of careless driving include shaving, drinking coffee, putting on make-up, changing CDs, reading the newspaper, doing crosswords and the myriad other potential driver distractions in the modern car. A more serious offence occurs when such careless driving leads to death, however innocent the activity may appear to be. A driver education campaign about such activities is urgently required, particularly as people are spending more and more time in their cars. In addition, we spend more time talking on mobile phones than people in any other European country. Therefore, we are at risk on all levels.Texting on hand-held mobile phones is particularly risky because one takes one's eyes off the road for a prolonged period, in addition to removing one hand off the steering wheel. As texting is more prevalent among young people, one cannot help wondering whether it plays a contributory role in at least some of the many single car accidents with no obvious cause involving young people.There are a number of reasons for bringing forward the Bill now. First, the number of cars on the roads is growing. Second, the number of deaths is increasing, as is the number of serious accidents. Simultaneously, the number and usage of mobile phones are growing. Ireland leads the world in this respect. Significantly, the use of mobile phones in cars is growing. What is equally significant is that their use is open and blatant. There is no attempt to hide or limit talking time by drivers, even by drivers of very large vehicles. This overt use of mobile phones indicates that for growing numbers, there is no sense of the need for furtiveness, or any anti-social stigma attached to what they are doing, or that the practice is either unacceptable or dangerous. Against this culture, advertisements, driver education, entreaties or the use of any moral suasion to desist are useless and will do nothing to bring the quantum change in attitude we need, to bring home the message of the risks associated with mobile phone use. A legislative ban backed by strict effective enforcement is the only way to change attitudes and ultimately bring about sustained behavioural change. If this is done, the benefit will be a reduction in accidents which will be far reaching. Raising road safety awareness through strict enforcement of any reasonable rule goes beyond the specific deterrent of a mobile phone ban to act as a general deterrent in respect of other road safety offences. This is a widely acknowledged phenomenon. A serious and visible enforcement of one offence creates an improvement in the overall observance of the Road Traffic Acts.Unfortunately, the converse is also true. The Government introduced legislation to ban the use of hand held mobile phones which it then withdrew and failed to replace. This is a mandate for their flagrant, overt and widespread use. It sends another signal that official Ireland does not rate road safety or observance of the Road Traffic Acts and that legislation, implementation, administration and enforcement in this area does not have Government attention and is not a priority.This Bill is Fine Gael's effort to improve road safety, albeit tackling just one aspect of a much broader agenda. The Minister has promised a new Road Traffic Act to deal with a number of issues such as the outsourcing of speed cameras, breath testing and so on. He has suggested he might be able to include the long-promised ban on mobile phones in that Bill but he subsequently backtracked on the commitment to introduce it in the Road Traffic Bill. He has agreed not to oppose this Private Members' Bill which is to be welcomed. However, one must question the Government's resolve on this issue.Last week was four years to the day in March 2002 when the then Minister, Bobby Molloy, introduced the regulations. Four years ago on 19 March 2002, the newspapers reported, "Mobile phones by drivers will be outlawed within 48 hours. Road Safety Minister Bobby Molloy is to sign regulations this week, effective immediately." Many 48-hour periods have elapsed since then and we have not seen anything. Four years of inaction on a road safety issue such as this is unacceptable. It may be that the fear of reaping the kind of ridicule that was heaped on the Minister at that time is the inhibiting factor, but it is not a good enough excuse. The result of failure to introduce a ban only postpones further the prospect of a change in driver attitude to mobile phone use which is more important than possible Government embarrassment.The same lack of focus, the same inability to concentrate on delivery, the same failure to sustain ministerial or Government interest beyond the press conference is evident in the pathetic attempts to reform the driver testing system. I raised this issue on many occasions. I raised it at the weekend with the Minister for Finance to request renegotiation of the partnership talks and it was raised by my party leader today. I plead with the Minister to deal effectively with this issue which is nothing short of a national crisis and a scandal. Even Gay Byrne, with all his undoubted talents, will not be able to reform the system while there is a backlog of 140,000 awaiting driving tests. There has been a decrease in productivity among the driving testers and there will be no hope of clearing that backlog unless outsourcing is allowed.On mobile phones, on speeding, on breath testing, on driver testing, on road safety in general, the public has lost faith in the Minister. It is irrelevant whether it is a general lack of will on the part of the Government or the lack of ability to deliver. The end result is the same; the road safety strategy is in tatters. The public regards the administration of road safety legislation as so chaotic that they believe it is safe to simply disregard its provisions. Who could blame them? If there is no political focus on an issue, if there is no leadership from Government, if the Government does not take this problem seriously and take responsibility for cross-departmental issues such as penalty points, if the Government fails to introduce necessary legislation and put in place the necessary IT systems to implement legislation, and if the Garda and others charged with administration or enforcement are not resourced, then the clear message to the public is one of official indifference.No amount of hand-wringing at the rising death toll can be an alternative to focused legislation, implementation and enforcement. Rules and regulations are in place to govern behaviour. Left to ourselves, we would not behave in the public interest. We have endless examples of how legislation can change, first attitudes, then behaviour and finally change the entire culture. The shame of being caught breaking the law and fear of legal consequences, fines or jail sentences, the loss of public standing, all operate as deterrents to what society regards as unacceptable behaviour and successfully changes our behaviour. Over time, with sustained enforcement the modified behaviour becomes embedded in our culture and changes what we regard as acceptable behaviour.In Ireland, using hand held mobile phones while driving is regarded as acceptable; speeding is regarded as acceptable; drink driving is regarding as acceptable; truck drivers exceeding the safe and legally permitted driving hours is regarded as acceptable; and never getting a full driving licence is regarded as acceptable.The message is clear. People behave like this because they can. The Government not only allows it through failure to enforce the laws we have, but encourages and fosters that behaviour through official indifference and ineptitude.Fine Gael introduces this Bill to offer the opportunity to deal with just one of the outstanding road safety issues. If the Government had rejected this Bill it would have been regarded as dog in the manger behaviour, an admission that because it failed to introduce a mobile phone ban, it would not allow anyone else do so either. I am pleased the Minister has taken the responsible attitude, has decided not to oppose the Bill and accepts that it is a genuine attempt to eliminate at least one cause of accidents and road deaths and take it out of the equation. I warn the Minister that Fine Gael's agenda is to see the enactment of this Bill and it will be pressed to the very end because we are determined to ensure that it is passed as quickly as possible.
#PaulConnaughton	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	326	I thank Deputy Olivia Mitchell for putting this Bill before the House tonight. It is designed to achieve just one vital objective, to prevent drivers from using or holding hand held mobile handsets while driving.It makes absolute sense to stop drivers trying to negotiate the normal impediments, obstacles and risks associated with driving any vehicle on any road in Ireland at any time, day or night. This Bill is aimed at all drivers, whether they are car drivers, van drivers or lorry drivers. They should not be allowed to take or make mobile calls on a hand held mobile phone. A total of 95% of the population use mobile phones and with the mobile phone culture now deeply embedded in the Irish psyche, it is time this madness was stopped.A hand held mobile phone used while driving a car is no better or worse than driving with one hand but with the added complication that the mind is torn between the activities on the road and the news coming in on the mobile phone. It is worse when a driver uses the mobile phone to make a call. At times this exercise means that both hands are in use while the car is expected to drive on autopilot.It may be argued that this Bill does not cover all eventualities and shortcomings but the principle of the Bill is correct, reasonable, necessary and enforceable.Can a motorist driving at 100 km/h who takes a call or tries to ring somebody on a hand held phone also exercise the necessary care and attention required to drive and still be eagle-eyed for that upcoming emergency that happens to everybody at some stage in their driving lives? Now that texting has become a national pastime, one can only shudder at the thought of it being practised at 120 km/h on the new dual carriageway.The Government may table suitable amendments if required. I am delighted the Government has accepted this Bill. It does not ban the use of hands-free mobile phones, bluetooth or ear pieces. While these might be a minor distraction, as some research has shown, if this Bill can stop the hand held mobile phone being used while driving, we will have gone a long way towards closing off a significant loophole. The use of hand held mobile phones is a contributing factor in accidents and should be stopped as a matter of good sense.I welcome the appointment of Gay Byrne as chairman of the Road Safety Authority. On Committee Stage of the relevant Bill at the Select Committee on Transport I urged the Minister to provide for annual achievements in order that after each year of the new road safety plan it could be clearly seen if all the stakeholders were acting in concert with each other, which they never were. They are still out of step with each other. If we get an integrated plan that is properly researched and financed, we will stop the spiral of unnecessary deaths on the roads. This will not come cheap but taxpayers will not mind if it costs more, provided the money is well spent and they can see they are getting a return on their investment, which in this case will be the greatest return imaginable, the saving of lives on the roads.I do not have time to cover all aspects but I hope Gay Byrne will succeed in his role. I have watched developments on this issue closely in recent years and the Minister and his predecessor in action. For some strange reason, a flash announcement on what will happen is made whether any research has been done. If research was done, there would be a follow-up. I have heard the banning of the use of mobile phones in cars heralded on several occasions as something that could and should be done but it has never been done. With regard to enforcement, many could drive to the four corners of the country without seeing a garda on transport duty. I hope Gay Byrne will do what the Minister could not or would not do. Many, including me, hope he will be successful.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	327	I support the Bill and compliment Deputy Olivia Mitchell on her effective use of Private Members' time. I urge the Minister to accept the Bill. It is a reasonable proposal which gets over the problem relating to the emergency services and the Garda raised by the Attorney General in 2003 when a similar proposal was mooted.The Bill has never been more important. The number of cars on the roads is growing and more people now use their cars as sub-offices. Due to the length of time they are spending driving, they work on their way to and from the workplace. It is common to see half of car users using a mobile phone, which is distracting and leads to accidents.One of my reasons for supporting the Bill is that I have personal knowledge of a very serious accident that occurred due to the use of a mobile phone. The other car involved contained a family of five who could have been wiped out because of actions of the offender who was using a mobile phone as he drove around a bend with no control of his car.The number of cars on the roads is growing — the January sales figure rose by 26% — as is the number of serious accidents and road deaths, with 90 deaths already this year. As Deputy Mitchell stated, there is also an increase in the level of mobile phone use in cars. In the United Kingdom fixed penalties are in place for the use of hand-held mobile phones while driving. We are simply standardising the law north and south of the Border. People will accept this law, as they accepted the smoking ban. They are beginning to realise that it is irresponsible to use a mobile phone while driving.Deputy Mitchell pointed to the poor record of Government with regard to the issue of penalty points. Despite their initial impact, drivers are no longer concerned about them. They are rarely a subject of discussion and do not affect or in any way moderate speed on the roads. I occasionally drive from Kerry to Dublin and see very few road checks.It seems there is no urgency to implement the penalty points system. In 2002, for example, a promise was made to implement 69 penalty point offences by the end of 2003. To date, despite the promise of the Minister, which I hope he will fulfil, only four penalty points offences have been enacted. There were 376 road fatalities in 2002, whereas 399 people were killed in 2005. The Bill is a positive step and I am glad the Minister is accepting Deputy Mitchell's proposal. Others should follow. I agree with Deputy Mitchell that we need an education campaign on the use of mobile phones and other activities in cars that distract drivers and cause accidents, sometimes fatal.

Any measure introduced in the House and enacted which will save lives on the road is to be welcomed by all. As one who travels regularly through another jurisdiction on this island, I am amazed to see the difference there. One seldom sees anyone in Northern Ireland with a mobile phone to his or her ear but one sees it when one crosses the Border into this State. I cannot understand why it was possible to enact legislation in Northern Ireland without any legal difficulties while we are still contemplating it here. I welcome the Minister's positive response to the Bill. The sooner it is introduced, the better for us all.What has been allowed to develop in recent years with regard to road safety and road deaths is nothing less than criminal negligence. The figures are stark and devastating. In 2003, 335 people lost their lives on Irish roads. In 2004, that figure increased to 378 and last year it was just one short of 400. At a time when the number of road fatalities in other European countries is decreasing, the figure here is on an upward spiral, against the European trend, yet we seem paralysed and unable to do anything about it.Best practice tells us that the number of road deaths in this country should be 240. I am not for one moment justifying that figure as we would be better off if there were no road deaths. However, the European average is six deaths per 100,000 of population — 60 deaths per million or 240 deaths for our population of 4 million. In other words, 160 people above the European average are unnecessarily killed on Irish roads every year.Can anyone imagine the devastation, hurt and suffering inflicted on the families who are bereaved or have members injured? It seems no one is willing to accept responsibility and no one is accountable. Is it any wonder that the former chairman of the National Safety Council, Mr. Eddie Shaw, resigned his position in sheer frustration at the Government's failure to provide the necessary resources to implement the national road strategy 2004-06? It is a terrible indictment of any Government that this unnecessary slaughter is allowed to continue and increase. That is the national picture.I wish to devote some of the limited time available to me to the shocking number of accidents and deaths on the roads in my own county of Donegal. The people of Donegal tragically have become accustomed to waking up on Saturday and Sunday mornings to news reports of serious and often fatal accidents in different parts of the county involving young people. A look back at last year reveals a litany of devastating accidents. On the morning of 18 February last, there was a tragic accident near Buncrana where five non-nationals were killed in a two car crash. The circumstances leading up to that accident shocked not alone the people of Donegal but people elsewhere in the country. On the weekend of 8 and 9 October 2005, three months prior to the tragedy in Buncrana last month, five young people, mostly teenagers, were tragically killed in a car crash again in the Buncrana area. In September 2005, three more people lost their lives in a road accident near Ballintra in the south of the county. During 2004, 30 people lost their lives on the roads in Donegal, probably the highest per capita of any county. Unfortunately, the death rate was as bad last year when the number killed on the roads in the county again reached 30. How can one explain that almost 10% of road fatalities here occur on the roads in one county? The gardaí in the county are doing the best they can with the limited resources at their disposal but they alone cannot counteract the culture of living dangerously which seems to have convinced many young people that they are invincible.We must seriously tackle this problem. A new road strategy committee is being set up and I hope it will not be made up of policemen and policewoman but rather of people with a genuine ability. I also hope it will have the support of the Government, that the necessary resources will be made available to tackle this problem and that we will not wake up every weekend to hear of such tragedies having occurred in some part of the country. The current position is unacceptable and a Government that tolerates it should not be in government.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	329	I am delighted to have this opportunity to speak on this significant Bill. I compliment my colleague, Deputy Olivia Mitchell, on introducing this Bill and on her unwavering commitment to road safety.The horrendous road accident statistics here have reached such levels that we are willing to try any mechanism to reduce the carnage on our roads and the heartache and trauma that it brings in its wake. Watching the news on television every evening, particularly at weekends, I am profoundly shocked by the huge loss of life that occurs on our roads. Recently in my constituency a horrific accident resulted in the loss of two school-going first-year students returning from study from Killenaule to their home along a stretch of road that is known to be very dangerous.Clearly, we are failing to address the root causes of road accidents if casualties continue to mount. That the number of fatalities has climbed each year is evidence of a great failure on the part of the Government to tackle this problem. More than 5,000 people have died on our roads during the past decade and already this year 90 people have lost their lives on our roads. A multi-pronged strategy is needed to address a complex issue such as road deaths. The first issue that needs to be addressed is the number of gardaí dedicated to traffic duties. The Garda traffic corps must be allocated its full complement of staff immediately.Anyone will comment on the likelihood of being caught for driving slightly over the speed limit in the 50 or 60 kph zone while virtually having a free reign on an open road. One can argue that if a law exists, people should uphold it but that it not human nature. People need incentives to uphold the law. They need to know that if they drink and drive, break the speed limit or commit another such offence they will not get away with it. I commend Mr. Gay Byrne on his attitude this morning when he said in the case of people caught driving a few kilometres over the speed limit, good policing should prevail and they should be given a warning rather being penalised.While driving up to Dublin today I was struck by the farcical state of the Dublin to Cork road, with dual carriageways in some places and single lanes in others where the speed limit is routinely broken. On approaching Dublin, traffic grinds to a halt in roads works and then because of the never-ending rush hour. It is no wonder people are tempted to break the speed limit when they reach a stretch of good road. The frustrations they encounter in traffic that barely moves makes speeding very tempting when the opportunity arises. For this reason speed cameras must be located at frequent intervals and people must be aware of their existence. The purpose of speed cameras must not be to catch people out and extract a fine from them but to encourage them to drive within the legal limit. That is most important. Speed cameras are needed on major roads and in rural areas. There are many roads where the speed limit is not observed. Narrow rural roads, where straight stretches are few and far between, become incredibly dangerous when motorists drive vehicles at speed.It is high time a programme was introduced to teach transition year students about driving. I have raised this issue on several occasions. I implore the Minister, Deputy Cullen, who is forward-thinking, to encourage the inclusion of such a course as part of our education system.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	330	Like my colleague, Deputy Hayes, I commend Deputy Olivia Mitchell on introducing this Bill. It is an appropriate week to do so when a chairman of the calibre of Mr. Gay Byrne has been appointed to the Road Safety Authority. It is appropriate that our attention should focus on one critical aspect of road safety, namely, the use of mobile phones while driving. I welcome the appointment of Mr. Byrne to this position. The Minister has a mixed record in various portfolios but, in the appointment of somebody with the energy and independence of Mr. Byrne, he has undoubtedly made a wise decision which we all hope will pay dividends when it comes to reducing the carnage on our roads. I note Mr. Byrne has made it a priority to curtail the practice of provisional licence holders driving alone on our roads; the principle of a provisional driver being accompanied by a passenger with a full licence needs to be affirmed. It is with this in mind that this Bill has been introduced. It makes it equally an offence for a passenger to use a hand-held mobile phone when the passenger is the full licence holder. This may be viewed in some quarters as overly harsh, but it must be this way as otherwise it would make nonsense of the principle that provisional driving licence holders must be accompanied by a full driving licence holder.On the critical issue of drivers using mobile phones, it was with a sense of astonishment that people learnt in recent months that there were no specific plans to introduce mobile phone use while driving as a penalty point offence. In January, the extension of the penalty point system fell short of the Government's promise in 2002 to introduce 69 penalty point breaches of the Road Traffic Act. There will be 35 penalty point breaches under the new regime which will come into effect from Saturday next but the imposition of penalty points for the use of a mobile phone was ignored. In this context, it has been proposed that two penalty points will be imposed on the offender if a person is convicted of the offence. In addition, it provides for a stiff penalty, with the imposition of a maximum fine of €5,000 and a prison sentence of up to two years for the offence.Like much road safety there is a curious double think at work among many motorists when it comes to using mobile phones. Although motorists, in theory, can be prosecuted for careless driving if observed using a phone by a garda, there is a prevailing attitude to the effect that "this does not apply to me, I am a safe driver". Irrespective of being found over the drink driving limit, over-tired or making a call while on the move, the attitude prevails that "it is safe and that the law applies to others and not to me". We have all seen such drivers and the only way to impress on them the seriousness of what they are doing is to have a firm policy on the use of hand-held mobile phones.I refer the Minister to a recent British Medical Journal study which found that people using mobile phones while driving were four times more likely to be involved in a serious crash and that it slowed down the reaction times for younger drivers considerably. This has been well known from the evidence of other surveys and studies. In this instance researchers looked at 456 drivers aged 17 and over who had been involved in a crash and who required hospital treatment over a two year period. They found that a mobile telephone used in the ten minutes before the crash was associated with a four-fold increase in likelihood of crashing.This is a pressing issue. Lives could be saved if the Government acted immediately on this issue. It demands a sense of urgency from this Government. A sense of urgency has been sadly lacking in this Government over the past while because it thinks this is an unpopular measure with the public. On this specific issue, as long ago as 2002, three quarters of the people polled by irishhealth.com supported a ban on the use of hand-held mobile telephones by drivers. This message resulted in this legislation and I am delighted the Minister has supported Deputy Olivia Mitchell’s Bill.Before I finish I will relate a story about a family I know quite well. My neighbour, his wife and their young child were coming home one evening from visiting the family home in another county, when a driver using a mobile telephone came round a bend and crashed into them. Sadly, their only child died in that crash.I urge the Minister to treat this as a priority. We all are driving and see motorists, even lorry drivers, using mobile telephones.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	331	I wish to share time with Deputy O'Connor.I congratulate Deputy Olivia Mitchell on her work in producing this Bill and for focusing on the problem of irresponsible mobile telephone use by drivers of motor vehicles. It is well known that I am in favour of a prohibition on the use of hand-held mobile telephones while driving and I therefore welcome the spirit behind the Bill. As I signalled on 8 March last at an NRA road safety conference, it is reckless to drive and hold a telephone simultaneously. Some drivers seem to feel they have more arms while driving than an octopus has tentacles. Missing a call will not kill a person, but an accident could. Therefore, just like the NRA's conference, anything that gives Members the opportunity to debate this most important issue is welcome.While I have serious reservations concerning certain provisions of the Bill and its drafting, I will not oppose the Bill on this Stage. The sight of a driver with a mobile telephone to his or her ear, held there by hand or by some strained shoulder manoeuvring, is all too common. In taking any journey or in just observing passing traffic from the pavement, one will witness numerous instances of appalling and dangerous driving associated with inappropriate mobile telephone use. This irresponsible behaviour is not confined to drivers of particular vehicles. One will see it from drivers of articulated vehicles, HGVs, LGVs, and cars. Neither is it a gender matter; both men and women are equally at fault.Mobile telephone use by drivers is dangerous because it distracts them. In the case of a hand-held mobile telephone, the distraction occurs in two ways: physical distraction and cognitive distraction. Attempting to simultaneously operate and hold the mobile telephone while driving the vehicle is dangerous and wrong. Diverting one's attention from driving to concentrate on the telephone conversation is dangerous and wrong.While intuitively everyone knows it is dangerous to use a hand-held mobile telephone while driving, significant numbers of people engage in the activity regardless. It is no longer necessary to rely on instincts as it has been clearly shown in solid international research and studies that it is dangerous. From these studies it has been suggested that the use of a mobile telephone while driving could increase the risk of involvement in a road collision by up to four times.Survey results in other countries have found that 60% to 70% of drivers use their mobile telephone at least once a day. It is also estimated that at any given moment of the day 1% to 4% of drivers are using a mobile telephone. Mobile telephone ownership in Ireland has reached saturation point with almost every citizen now owning a mobile. With these levels of activity, the potential for collisions is significant.The mobile telephone is now an integral part of modern living and is here to stay. The challenge for those charged with responsibility for road safety is to ensure that this worthwhile technology is used in a manner that does not compromise road safety. Mobile telephone communication and motor vehicles are not mutually exclusive and a harmonious co-existence is possible provided the ground rules are clearly understood and respected. The advice is clear: one should stop and park the vehicle before engaging in a mobile telephone conversation. However, despite the singular and unambiguous research findings to prove that mobile telephone use while driving poses a significant road safety risk and the unanimous advice from safety bodies not to do so, the fact remains that many people ignore the advice.Given the risk, the obvious question is why do significant numbers of drivers regularly engage in an activity with potentially serious consequences for road safety? There is no one answer to this question. Is some form of dual personality at play which affects certain drivers in road and vehicle safety? If one was to compare the outlook to safety of a motorist as a purchaser of a new vehicle and as a driver of that vehicle there can be a serious gulf. It is now the case that prospective purchasers view a vehicle's safety specification to be as important as, if not more important than, the traditional selling points of performance, style and luxury. This is right and proper and I wish it to be the way with all buyers. One has only to look at any advertisement for motor cars to appreciate this heightened interest in vehicle safety by the public. A high safety rating, such as a Euro N-CAP accolade, is now a sufficient and worthwhile basis for motor manufacturers to promote and market their vehicles. This reasonable and responsible approach to vehicle safety compared to the casual attitude to road safety of certain drivers is difficult to comprehend.I suggest that in many cases it is due to a misguided belief that one's driving skills are a cut above those of everyone else and that the Rules of the Road are for ordinary mortals and of little relevance to such drivers. This misplaced confidence is not only foolish; it is deadly foolish, as it can only result in tragedy and loss of life on the road.The sanction of law is therefore necessary to deal with drivers not prepared to act responsibly. Under existing road traffic regulations, persons charged with careless or dangerous driving leave themselves open to severe penalties. Improper use of a mobile telephone could result in careless or dangerous driving and prosecution for such offences. A conviction for careless driving carries penalties consisting of a fine of up to €1,500 and five penalty points. A person convicted of dangerous driving causing death or serious bodily harm can be liable for a prison term of up to ten years or, at the discretion of the court, a fine of up to €15,000, or both. In any other case of dangerous driving, a fine of up to €2,500 can be imposed or, at the discretion of the court, imprisonment of up to six months, or both. A person convicted for dangerous driving is also disqualified from driving.The Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2002 prohibit the use of a hand-held mobile telephone by a person while driving a motor vehicle. However, following advice from the Attorney General — as has been alluded to by other Deputies — that the regulations are open to challenge in the courts on the grounds that they may be ultra vires, the regulations have not been enforced. The Road Safety Strategy 2004-2006 commits the Government to provide a legal basis for control of the use of mobile telephones by drivers. The approach adopted in other countries on the regulation of mobile telephone use, in so far as my Department is aware, was to ban the use of hand-held telephones. While the evidence from studies does not show that hands-free mobile telephone use has a significant safety advantage over hand-held mobile telephone use, the regulation of hands-free equipment would be extremely challenging, particularly in enforcement. It is for that reason I will propose that the regulation of mobile telephone use here will be in respect of hand-held telephones.My Department has been considering how best to frame appropriate primary legislation to address the mobile telephone issue. I want to set out for the benefit of Deputies Olivia Mitchell and Shortall, in particular, the approach I will take. Given the proliferation of vehicle-based information and communication systems and the pace of innovation with these technologies, it is important that any legislation would not act as a brake on genuine worthwhile technologies but would have the scope to be able to deal with any road safety issues that may arise from irresponsible use of these technologies. In-vehicle navigation aids, just in time vehicle tracking for logistic companies and active cruise control are just three examples of desirable and beneficial systems based on applications of mobile telephone technologies.The proposals that I am finalising will provide for a broad-based legislative framework and will address the overall regulatory questions arising from the development of in-vehicle information and communications technologies with a potential to be a road safety hazard if not used responsibly by occupants of motor vehicles. The approach will involve both primary and secondary legislation. The primary legislation will be of an enabling type giving the Minister general power to make regulations to govern the use of in-vehicle technologies by occupants of motor vehicles. The regulation of a particular technology would be done through secondary legislation. It is by means of such secondary legislation that I will prohibit the use of hand-held mobile telephones by drivers of motor vehicles, as I promised some time ago.The next Road Traffic Bill to be brought forward will contain the enabling provisions. The general scheme of that proposed Bill will be brought to Government for approval in the coming weeks. That Bill will also provide for random breath testing and the outsourcing of the operation of speed cameras, as has been referred to by other Deputies tonight. As soon as the proposed Bill is enacted, I intend to make regulations prohibiting the use of a hand-held mobile phone while driving a motor vehicle. l also intend to apply penalty points to the offence, although I am aware that Deputy Mitchell is making similar provisions in her Bill.I would like to describe the wider road safety agenda being pursued by the Government in terms of its dedicated national road safety strategy. For the first time, road safety planning and initiatives have been placed within a distinct policy framework featuring a set of specific unified goals based on the delivery of progress across a range of areas. The adoption of this strategic approach was pursued against the realisation that the persistent growth in vehicle numbers and negative trends in road casualties required a concerted and integrated response. The primary target of the existing road safety strategy is to reduce the number of road deaths to no more than 300 by the end of this year. This is a serious challenge which we must face collectively. Our focus, therefore, is to continue to implement the key initiatives outlined in the strategy aimed at achieving reductions in the numbers of deaths and injuries.The penalty points system will be extended next week from the existing five offences to a total of 35. The new offences will focus on driver behaviour, the greatest cause of road collisions. Furthermore, a dedicated traffic corps has been established by the Government which will comprise 1,200 traffic corps officers by 2008. This will represent more than double the number of gardaí involved in traffic duties prior to the establishment of the corps and result in a significantly increased deterrent effect.We introduced a revised speed limit structure expressed in metric values in January 2005 which has resulted in a reduction of speed limits on over 90% of the country's roads. The changeover went smoothly and represents a good example of both national and local authorities working together with a common aim.Shortly I will bring a new road safety Bill to Cabinet. Among the key initiatives to be contained in it are the engagement of private sector interests in the operation of speed cameras; random breath testing for drink driving; and the banning of driving while using a hand-held mobile phone, the details of which I have outlined.The current road safety strategy commits the Government to the engagement of private sector interests in the deployment and operation of speed cameras. Safety cameras are not about collecting money. Their only purpose is to save lives and reduce the number of casualties at accident black spots. A working group, established to examine the general framework within which this proposal can be pursued, acknowledged that it would be necessary to engage private sector interests if we were to reach the critical mass required to establish a level of enforcement to support the achievement of the enforcement targets in the road safety strategy. The report of the working group which will inform our pursuit of this initiative presents a template for its operation that is clearly grounded in road safety. The Garda will have a general supervisory role in the management of the initiative and, with the assistance of the National Roads Authority, will be responsible for choosing sites for the placement of cameras. The basis on which sites will be selected will relate directly to collision history and prevalence of speeding incidents. The group has recommended that there can be no connection between the revenue collected from detections by privately operated cameras and the funding of the operation.The road safety strategy provides that random breath testing provisions should be in place before the end of this year. There is little doubt that random breath testing is seen as a particularly successful element of road safety policy in many states. Against the background of that commitment, I have pursued a very detailed examination of the possible approaches that could be adopted to allow for the introduction of a scheme of random breath testing. That examination was pursued in close consultation with the Attorney General in order that random breath testing provisions could be introduced which would establish a balance between legitimate expectations that the numbers of road deaths and injuries would be radically reduced and the rights of citizens generally. I will bring forward legislation during the current Dáil session on this issue.A significant aspect of advancing the road safety agenda is the establishment of the Road Safety Authority. The Road Safety Authority Bill 2004, formerly the Driver Testing and Standards Authority Bill 2004, is the legislative basis for establishing the authority and has completed Committee Stage in the Dáil. When the Bill was introduced, its principal purpose was to establish a driver testing and standards authority, the primary responsibility of which would have been the delivery of the driver testing service and the regulation of driving instructors. It would also have had a statutory duty to promote the development and improvement of driving standards. However, the functions to be assigned to the authority were reviewed and the Government decided that the establishment of a separate public sector body to deliver the driver testing service and take responsibility for other functions pertaining to the testing and control of drivers offered an opportunity to assign other road safety functions to the authority. Consequently, the Government decided to amend the Driver Testing and Standards Authority Bill 2004 to enable the authority to play an important role in the process of improving road safety in general.The Road Safety Authority will be a single statutory agency with responsibility for a wide range of functions bearing on road safety and will be in a unique position to co-ordinate and advance the road safety agenda through the delivery of road safety programmes such as testing of drivers and vehicles, driver education and the promotion of awareness of road safety. The authority will have a significant advisory role to the Minister in the development of road safety policies. In order to facilitate the authority in carrying out its role, additional functions will be transferred to it, including the functions of the National Safety Council with regard to the promotion of education and awareness of road safety. The authority will have a general duty to promote the development and improvement of driving standards. It is appropriate that the educational brief of the NSC, together with its function in the promotion of road safety, should be transferred to the authority.In the road haulage sector the authority will take responsibility for the functions currently exercised by my Department with regard to drivers' hours and rest periods, including tachographs, the working time directive for mobile workers in the road transport sector and the implementation of EU requirements in respect of bus and lorry driver vocational training. In addition, the authority will be able to enforce the relevant regulations in these areas and conditions applying to licensed road haulage operators. Responsibility for implementing new requirements under EU directives in respect of professional driver training in this area will also be assigned to the authority.It is proposed to transfer further functions relating to the standards applied to vehicles sold or used in Ireland, as required by EU directives, and all related matters. Work in this area includes EU vehicle type approval law, standards for in-service vehicles, commercial vehicle testing, oversight of the NCT and random roadside testing. The activities of the authority as originally envisaged all have a bearing on road safety and the addition of these functions will enhance the effectiveness of the authority in contributing to an improvement in road safety. While the authority will have a significant input into road safety through driver training and testing and vehicle testing, it will also take responsibility for the road research element of the NRA. This will enable it to analyse the causes of road accidents andmake appropriate recommendations where necessary.The authority will be funded from revenue generated from its operations and funding from the Exchequer to support road safety programmes. The detailed arrangements for its funding are being considered in the context of the process of its establishment. The chief executive officer will be responsible for the propriety of its accounts and the economic and efficient use of its resources and accountable to any committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas set up to examine its affairs.In addition to the basic testing and educational functions, the Bill gives responsibility to the authority for the regulation of driving instruction. This will require those involved in the industry to meet predetermined standards which will cover not only their own ability to drive but also ensure that those meeting the standard will have the necessary instructional skills to deliver the message to the novice driver. Persons taking lessons will have greater confidence in the quality of instruction given, leading to better and safer drivers.Yesterday, I announced the appointment of Gay Byrne as chairperson of the new Road Safety Authority. I am delighted he has taken on the task of working with us on road safety because he is a serious person for a serious job and has earned the recognition and respect of the Irish people. He is hard working and committed and always gives 100% in everything he does. His career has been characterised by courageousness and professionalism, skills which will be needed to bring about a sea change in driver behaviour. The team we are putting together in the authority, with Mr. Byrne as chairman and Mr. Noel Brett as CEO, is dynamic, focused and determined and underlines the seriousness with which the Government regards road safety and the carnage on the roads. I welcome the warm response from all sides of the House to Mr. Byrne's appointment and we all wish him success with the authority. He has not taken on this onerous task lightly but is a man with an independent mind who does not fear making his views known. I am determined to work with him and the new CEO to end the carnage we have witnessed on the roads.I have made every effort to resolve the driving test backlog problem. I have put proposals to the unions and been brought through the legitimate processes of the industrial relations machinery. We have an arbitration result based on a technical outcome. However, it is not possible to clear the backlog using all the proposals made and the existing resources available to the State. There must be an outsourcing for a fixed time and number of tests. I appeal to the unions, to which I have spoken since the arbitration result, to agree a way forward with me in the next few days in order that we can build even more confidence in the public mind that collectively we are all serious about tackling the issue of road safety. I acknowledge that this is a collective effort, although my position and that of the Government is important. We will leave no stone unturned in attempting to secure a dramatically improved position.I thank Deputy Mitchell for bringing up this issue and hope she accepts my point. I will deal with the matter and perhaps address one or two of the extra issues raised in the Bill in framing the new road safety legislation which I hope to present to the House in the near future.
#CharlieOConnorFF	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-party	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-dob	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	332	I thank the Minister for allowing me to use some of his time. I congratulate the Minister on his efforts, and like the Minister I compliment my colleague, Deputy Olivia Mitchell. I have known the Deputy for some time and I served with her on the county council. I admire her work and wish her well in this regard. I am a former colleague of Deputy Shortall on a health board. It is good to hear the Minister applauding his colleagues in discussing this legislation.As legislators we face many challenges, and one of the biggest is the perception that road collisions are inevitable. Like the Minister, Deputy Cullen, I do not share this view. The statistics continue to show that speeding, drink-driving and the non-wearing of seat belts are the killers. The real killer is that this should not be the case.I have listened carefully to all the contributions. While I do not wish to single out one over the other, the contribution of Deputy McGinley struck a chord with all of us. He spoke of the people who have died on the roads in his constituency. My parish priest is from the Deputy's constituency in Donegal and I was aware of these deaths. Deputy McGinley's contribution struck a chord with me and, I am sure, with the Minister. It is right to remember in a debate like this that people have died, and much hurt has been caused.Improved driver behaviour, acceptance of traffic rules, tougher enforcement, greater personal responsibility and an appreciation of other road users are the goals we must achieve. Through tough laws, visible enforcement, enhanced road building, targeted education and focused public awareness, we can meet the challenge in a real way. I congratulate the Minister on his personal commitment and energy in ensuring all the agencies and bodies involved in the various areas of road safety, including education, testing and standards, will be the responsibility of the Road Safety Authority, for which legislation will be before the House next week.I support the choice of Mr. Gay Byrne as chairman, as has been noted by the Minister and other colleagues. I am a long-time admirer of Mr. Byrne's work since he came on the scene all those years ago when I was quite young. We have all been impressed by the manner in which he responded to the appointment and the statements he made. This shows he is clear in what he wants to achieve.Considering the data for the years since the introduction of the first road safety strategy in 1998, it is clear there has been a measurable decrease in road deaths compared with preceding years. However, having reached a 40-year low in the level of road deaths in 2003, there is now unfortunately an increasing death rate. There were 399 road deaths in 2005 and 90 lives have been lost already this year. These figures bring home the stark reality that things are not improving and that the tragic loss of life continues on a daily basis.The adoption of a more strategic approach to road safety strategies has underpinned the realisation that the persistent growth in vehicle numbers and negative trends in road casualties required a concentrated and integrated response. Penalty points have worked. The number of road deaths fell to a 40-year low on their introduction and people responded by slowing down and obeying the rules. However, the dramatic impact waned. The primary glitch in the system, an administrative issue, was identified, a remedy was brought forward and a new system is now in place. Penalty points have clearly made a positive contribution to road safety. I therefore support the expansion of the number of penalty point offences from next Monday.The introduction of the Garda traffic corps is also to be welcomed and supported. This dedicated unit, headed by an assistant commissioner and focusing solely on road traffic matters, has had a great impact. By the end of 2008, 1,200 gardaí will be deployed to the traffic corps, over twice the number engaged in traffic duties prior to the roll-out of the corps. The growing presence on our roads of a dedicated and highly visible corps of officers will promote a greater level of general deterrence against the type of behaviour which leads to road collisions.Like the Minister and my party leader and Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, it is my firm view that the waiting time for driving tests is too long. I am glad the matter was raised today. The Minister's proposal will see the average waiting time for tests reduced to six weeks. The proposal needs the support of all sides of the House. When the backlog is resolved we will get an improved customer service for test applicants, improved road safety and reduced insurance premia, particularly for young drivers.I also support the Minister's plans on safety camera usage. Contrary to media comments, safety cameras are not about collecting money. Their sole purpose is to save lives. I welcome that the Garda Síochána will have a general supervisory role in the management of the initiative and will, with the assistance of the National Roads Authority, be responsible for choosing sites for the placement of cameras. The basis on which sites should be selected will relate directly to collision history and known areas of speeding incidence.Drinking and driving is recognised as one of the most serious contributory factors in road collisions in this and all other countries. Despite the use of a powerful publicity campaign to encourage greater responsibility among drivers and the commitment of the Garda Síochána to tackle the issue, many drivers are still not prepared to change their behaviour. I support the Minister in his actions to deal with this complicated and vital matter.This leads directly to the issue of mobile phone usage while driving. The time for discussion has ended. It is reckless to drive and hold a phone simultaneously. As the Minister noted, some drivers feel they have more arms than an octopus. He also noted that missing a call will not kill a person, but a traffic accident could. The excuse that we are leading busy lives is difficult to swallow when we consider the lives lost and the families which have been ruined. That is why the Minister has publicly stated he intends to ban driving with a hand-held phone, making it a penalty point offence.I commend Deputy Olivia Mitchell on bringing this Bill to the House. I wonder why she could not have waited a short period while the broader Government Bill, which will include the matter, is being finalised.

It will be a single agency with responsibility for a wide range of functions which have a bearing on road safety. It will have the legislative and financial muscle to co-ordinate and advance the road safety agenda through delivery of road safety programmes, such as testing of drivers and vehicles, road safety research and data collection, driver education and the promotion of awareness of road safety in general. The authority will have a significant policy advisory role to the Minister for Transport in the development of road safety policy. In particular, the new authority will have the statutory function of formulating future national road safety strategies, having taken inputs from all the relevant stakeholders. It will submit such strategies to the Minister for formal Government approval.I previously mentioned the challenges we face. These challenges, improved driver behaviour, acceptance of traffic rules, tougher enforcement, greater personal responsibility and appreciation of other road users, are at the heart of road safety. We all have a role to play and must all take responsibility. I fully support the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, in his efforts to finally establish an organisation that will result in the road safety agenda being addressed and I believe he will have wide support for that.

I commend Deputy Olivia Mitchell on her initiative in drafting it and bringing it forward. We welcome the opportunity to debate the issue of mobile telephone use while driving because the practice has become increasingly pervasive and is a major contributory factor to collisions on the roads.The Bill is presented to us in the context of a raft of promised road safety measures that have been delayed for one reason or other. Mobile telephone use, random breath testing and North-South recognition of penalty points are issues which have been tied up in the Office of the Attorney General for a considerable number of years, without resolution. The problems associated with the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2002 were identified in 2002. Since then the issue has gone back and forth between the Attorney General and the Department of Transport with little or no progress in producing a new law. The Department seems to be so afraid of getting it wrong again that it would rather do nothing. That was the attitude taken to random roadside breath testing and it resulted in a situation where gardaí did not enforce the law properly for a number of years when, as it turned out, they could have done so. I welcome the Attorney General's recent clarification on that and wonder why the Minister has not also welcomed it and encouraged the gardaí to enforce the law they have at their disposal. The Minister is still talking about changing the law.

The same cannot be allowed to happen with mobile telephone use and Fine Gael is taking the right course of action in presenting this Bill. The delay in delivering on the promise to ban the use of mobile telephones has been incredible. On 9 October 2002 the then Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, told the Dáil that his Department was urgently examining the implications of legal advice from the Attorney General, yet seven months later the urgency was so great he gave the exact same reply to me when I raised the issue with him.In March 2004, the then Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy McDaid, said he was working on a legislative framework to address the overall regulatory questions arising from the development of in-car technologies, which he hoped to deal with in the next road traffic Bill.In September 2004, the road safety strategy was published with a clear commitment to provide a legal basis for the control of mobile telephone use while driving. However, the following February, the then Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Callely, could only give the same information to the House as Deputy McDaid had the previous year. We are still waiting for that Bill.There was hope in February of this year when the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, indicated that the necessary preparations had been made to provide for the regulation of in-vehicle information and communications technologies. However, at the last Question Time he drew back, saying that he would provide such legislation in the road traffic Bill but only if the question of how to legislate effectively and appropriately for mobile telephones had been finalised within that timeframe.

Their use while driving was banned in New York in 2002, and they were also banned in the Netherlands in that year. Belgium, France and Germany have bans of one kind or other. If that is possible in other countries, why has it not been possible in this country?There is a growing body of evidence that suggests the effect of mobile telephone use while driving is dangerous and presents a significant risk factor in collisions. A lot of the research suggests a correlation between high risk road user groups and mobile telephone use. For instance, a Finnish study which has been tracking mobile telephone use by motorists since the late 1990s found that young male drivers, the category that shows up most frequently in our road fatality statistics, are more likely to use telephones than older or female drivers. In general, just under one half of mobile telephone-using drivers admitted having experienced hazardous situations while using a mobile telephone in the previous six months. The study also shows a growing trend in mobile telephone use suggesting that 81% of drivers now use their telephone in their car at least sometimes. Indeed, a recent survey carried out in Navan, County Meath, and published in the  Irish Medical Times showed that 3.6% of motorists driving through the town over a one-hour period were using their mobiles, figures that are consistent with similar surveys.A Japanese study in 1996 assessed the frequency of mobile telephone use prior to a car crash and found that, of the 129 crashes studied, 79% related to handling the telephone before the crash, with the greatest category reaching over to answer the call while driving. Again, most of the drivers were in their 20s and most were men.Probably the best study was carried out in Canada where the researchers tested the effect of mobile telephone use on the driving of nearly 700 Canadian drivers. The authors found that drivers who used their telephones, whether hand held or hands free, were four times more at risk of a collision than those who did not. This risk factor was similarly found in an Australian study last year where the authors concluded that drivers using a mobile telephone when driving were four times more at risk of having a road crash resulting in hospitalisation. All the data are there, begging the question as to why it has taken us so long to take action.A change in the law is useless without enforcement. As we saw with the introduction of penalty points in 2003, people will change their behaviour but only if they think there is a strong chance that they will be caught. I mention this because we are very weak in many areas of enforcement on road safety. A Europe-wide survey, reported in January, indicated that apart from Italy we have the worst record of breathalyser tests of the 25 EU countries. One must ask why in two Garda divisions last year not a single breathalyser was used. One of the Garda divisions, Dublin south, covers part of the Minister's constituency. The other was the Dublin north-central division.

I ask the Minister to investigate as this is quite significant and should be explained.A reply to one of my parliamentary questions from last week shows that despite the introduction of a Garda traffic corps, the number of speeding fines issued last year was the second lowest in the past six years. This amounts to less than half the number of fines issued in 2001. A similar trend exists for safety belt fines but I do not accept the level of compliance has changed so dramatically.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	365	It has improved but not that dramatically.

In 2001 there were 272,000 fixed charge fines for speeding. This dropped to 143,000 last year. Experience suggests there is a major problem with speeding. If one is driving at the speed limit, one is invariably passed out by umpteen other drivers. Why has there been a dramatic reduction in the enforcement of the law in this regard?
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	367	According to the most recent figures available, the use of safety belts in the back seat is currently at 40%.

Why did the number of fines last year drop to half the total for 2001? There is a correlation between that and the rising fatalities and serious injuries on our roads. This imbalance must be examined in conjunction with the Garda Síochána and there must be some measurement of Garda activity in this regard.Surely we have learned the lesson that changing the law will not suffice. Curtailing mobile phone use requires a properly resourced, adequately trained and committed Garda force driven by the philosophy that enforcement saves lives. For too long the political and policing culture of this State has placed popularity above resolute law enforcement. It is time these priorities changed.While we must encourage drivers to respect the law, there is little provision for lay-bys on our national routes. Such stopping points are standard across the United Kingdom, a country that is increasingly taking road safety seriously. The Minister should request the National Roads Authority to produce proposals and costings for additional lay-bys and appropriate signage so that motorists can stop when they need to use their phone. I cannot understand the policy pursued by the NRA which does not make provision for service stations along motorways.

The M1 is a terrific new road but there was no place to stop between Whitehall and Newry.

Some wish to stop, have a cup of coffee and make a few telephone calls, but there is no way of doing this.

People need to make telephone calls while on a long journey and we should facilitate them in doing so safely.The Labour Party supports this initiative but the absence of data in this area poses a problem. We do not know how many collisions or fatalities are caused by mobile telephone use while driving. If the Garda cannot provide data on enforcement levels, we will never be able to evaluate the effect of this provision.I note that the Government is not opposing this Bill.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	381	I congratulate the Fine Gael Party and Deputy Olivia Mitchell for introducing legislation to address the most glaring omission in road safety in Ireland. I recently drove from Cork to Belfast and back and noticed that our roads are very dangerous. As the Minister does not live in Dublin, I am sure he drives home twice per week. I do not understand how we saw only one speed trap during the journey. While travelling at the speed limit, 70 mph, a bus carrying schoolgirls at the younger end of the secondary cycle passed us out with ease. The driver was travelling at speeds of at least 80 mph.Evidence suggests that mobile telephones are dangerous. Recently I was stopped in traffic in the middle lane of three lanes, two of which go south, one north. A truck that dwarfed me turned a tight corner on an old street in Cork. The driver held the mobile telephone to his left ear with his right hand while turning the truck. One could not calculate the damage that might have been done had the driver miscalculated the turn or the wheel slipped. Professor Robert Winston, not a man to overstate or exaggerate the facts, deals with development and human behaviour. He recently carried out a fascinating experiment in which a policeman who was an expert driver, just like the drivers outside the door here, in an ordinary saloon car, did a chicane in 11.3 seconds. Mr. Winston asked the policeman to repeat it while he tried to distract him. Anyone would lose concentration while doing that. He distracted the driver by asking him to subtract 11 from 1,000 cumulatively. He got half way through the chicane before he lost control of the car. One cannot take in visual information and think at the same time. That is why the Minister should ban mobile phone use in cars as a matter of urgency.
#PaulConnaughton	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	382	I intend to share time with Deputy Ring.I am delighted to have this opportunity. I spoke on Second Stage of the Criminal Justice Bill many months ago and little did I know what the Bill heralded. The Minister said it was a far-reaching, all-embracing Bill badly needed to combat the vicious crimes taking place. On that occasion he convinced us the matters he was taking in hand were extremely important for the country and we believed him. He also said it was a comprehensive Bill and would stand the test of time. I do not know what time it has stood. I have been in this House a good while and I have never seen such a situation in which the amendments are seven or eight times greater in bulk than the Bill. One of two things happened: either the Minister did not know what he was doing when he introduced the Bill, or it is only in more recent months that he caught on to what was happening in the country.Scenes such as those on the M50 last Saturday night remind one of Tombstone City with Davy Crockett shooting his way out of trouble. As long as that kind of thing happens in a democracy, there is something wrong with the Government, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the way we enforce the law. Regardless of who is involved, criminals or not, unless we cut this racket ordinary, decent people will one day be caught in the crossfire. It is the worst type of rot that has ever come into society. I do not engage in character assassination, however when the irrational Deputy McDowell jumped out of the car on to the sidewalk of a Dublin street he attacked a colleague of mine in a way one would not expect of a Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I sincerely hope other more important matters and crises that will arise every day in his Department do not invoke the same reaction from Deputy McDowell. If they do, God help this country. It was irrational and out of all proportion. I have said this to his face and I am sorry I did not get the opportunity to do so again tonight as he is not here. It is one thing to be dictatorial but another to be irrational. That showed last week for everybody to see.I have no trouble with most of what has been put before us except that Fine Gael will take many aspects of this seriously on Committee Stage. Given that I have only four or five minutes it is difficult to get involved in something as involved as this raft of 326 amendments. Suffice it to say that one of the things many people want, if it can be done, is mandatory sentencing. I am not a lawyer or a senior counsel but I know right from wrong. People who commit heinous crimes should not be out among the ordinary, working-class people without serving prison time. I hope a minimum mandatory sentence to which the Minister refers, be it five or ten years, will mean what most ordinary people think it means when the judge hands it down. Cases can be made for good conduct and co-operation with the court and the Garda. However, if the crime is as bad as recent vicious murders, all drugs and drink-related, and if this House decides that a minimum mandatory sentence of ten years should be imposed for that crime, I expect that person to serve ten years. People can argue in another forum that there are extenuating circumstances, but for this sort of crime the sentences should be served in full. This did not happen in drugs crimes where what was deemed to be a mandatory sentence was heavily reduced by the courts in certain cases. I hope we are not heading down this line in this instance.I do not wish to deprive Deputy Ring of time, and I have much to say so I must hurry. I like the amnesty for surrendered weapons. Although nobody in this House knows how well it will work, it obviously makes good sense. Those guns should not be there. The problem is the arms will be forensically tested when they are received. The Minister included this so people who committed terrible crimes could be linked to the crime. People who commit such crimes will not hand in the guns. If "ordinary" criminals hand in their guns, that in itself will be good.I do not have time to speak about firearms in general. Suffice it to say I hope none of those who have bona fide access to firearms, including sportspersons, will be criminalised. I do not believe that is the Minister's intention in this legislation.The Minister went out of his way to state the crime rate is falling but I do not know where he got his statistics. A scientific survey carried out in my constituency recently began as a survey of anti-social behaviour in which some 1,400 people in Galway East saw fit to answer 38 questions. It is not often a survey questions so many people in an area, bearing in mind that the MRBI poll surveyed 1,050 people nationwide. The high number of respondents indicates how seriously the issue was taken.A number of questions were asked and I do not have time to refer to them all. The first question asked whether County Galway needs extra gardaí, in response to which 93% said it did.

Some 6% replied it was "very good", 25% said it was "satisfactory", 31% said it was "unsatisfactory" and 37% said it was "non-existent".The next question sought to determine whether respondents had confidence in the ability of the courts to combat crime. It is a pity the Minister is not present to hear how they answered. Some 26% said they had confidence in the courts to combat crime and 74% said they did not.The problem with the Minister and his colleagues in Government is that they do not believe these statistics. The responses reflect what ordinary people from every constituency are saying. The Government can make what it likes of the results, but when so many people decide to put their names to such a survey one can take it they are not satisfied. Regardless of any bluster on the part the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in front of the cameras on the streets of Dublin, and regardless of how rational he might become, the people who answered the questions in the survey do not believe him.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	390	I am glad to be able to speak to this motion. It was very interesting to hear Deputy Connaughton and I am sorry he was not able to put all the results of the survey on the record. The survey pertained to Galway but the results would be the same in every constituency. People are worried about crime and the absence of law and order.As was stated, the events of last weekend were like events from the wild west — this is not funny but very serious. I use the road on which the shootings took place and thousands of commuters use it every day. We were very lucky that ten or 20 people were not killed. The people involved were wearing protective clothing on the basis that they were going to shoot one another from cars. One would not have seen this in New York or Chicago in the time of Al Capone.People are asking me what is going on, whether we have any Minister responsible for justice and whether we have any gardaí and law and order. They also ask what we are to do about crime. If events like the ones to which I referred continue, they will happen in every corner of the country. It is a bit like Northern Ireland in that there was a time in which nobody could go into south Armagh. Parts of Dublin are the same. I heard the Garda, Minister and Taoiseach state there are parts of Dublin that the Garda cannot enter and man. We have a very good, trained Army and if there is a problem in any part of the country that requires people who can use weapons, it should be used.We have enough powers and Acts — we need to give the Garda enough money, resources and manpower to deal with the terrible crimes that are being committed. It is time we used the Army in this regard. I know people in the media will say we cannot have this but we can. There was a riot in this city two or three weeks ago not too far from this House. Our Army should have been used that evening to clear the thugs from the streets such that they would have been shown, once and for all, that there is law and order in this country.The power is with the criminal all the time. The daughter of a constituent of mine, a young Leneghan girl, was murdered savagely in Britain a few months ago and last week the police in England were able to bring six individuals before the courts and have them charged with murder. In this country, however, there are two very serious cases involving two housewives and mothers who were murdered in their own homes, yet nobody has been charged to this day. Evidence points towards certain individuals, yet they cannot be brought before the courts. The time has come to give power to the ordinary citizens of this State who believe in law and order.I have said previously in this House that the Garda and resources of the State sometimes do not target the right people but target the simple people who commit minor crimes. These crimes have to be dealt with because big crimes follow on from small ones, but we must take on the thugs who are running this city and shooting one another with guns. There is no longer respect for life or law and order. The thugs seem to believe they can enter anybody's house.In this regard, consider poor Donna Cleary, an innocent woman who was killed at a party by a guy who shot her through the window. How many other people have been shot like this? I heard a Member refer to people who were shot in this State for owing €500 for drugs. Something must be done once and for all to deal with these thugs.There was a time in this country when there was respect for life and law and order. The gangsters and criminals have taken over part of the country and we must take them on. We have enough powers and I hope whatever legislation is necessary is used. If the Criminal Justice Bill 2004 is to be the last Bill to deal with these people, that is fine — let us deal with them, take them on and get rid of them once and for all.It is sad when the US Government is warning US tourists that Ireland is no longer a safe place. This is very serious given that the direct opposite was the case ten years ago. At that time, we were telling our citizens that the US was not safe to enter. It is now safer to walk the streets of New York than those of Dublin at any hour of the night. It is time we reversed this trend, returned power to the police and the people and cleaned up the places being taken over by criminals. If the Garda Síochána does not have the resources, it is time to bring in the Army and use it for back-up to ensure we can protect our citizens from guys who are playing with guns and want to take on the State with them. I never want to see another citizen put at risk by people who have become reckless and have gone out of control. They have no respect for their own lives, those of others or those of the police. It is time we gave the Garda the back-up and necessary resources to get these criminals off our streets.We have not dealt with anti-social behaviour over the years. As a practising politician, I believe there is not a politician in this House who does not have people from housing estates in his or her clinic stating the problem of residents not behaving themselves is getting out of hand. Neither local authorities nor the Garda Síochána is prepared to take on these people. The local authority and Garda will claim that a neighbour will be required to give evidence in court. The neighbours are afraid to go to court. I know of one case in my town where the neighbours were forced to leave the house and not those creating the anti-social behaviour. They did not get the back-up of the State or the resources.I met a woman in my office recently. Her daughter had been savagely beaten on the street and a file was sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions. Although I am advised that I should not write to the DPP, I will do so and express my view as a Member of the Oireachtas. I do not care if he brings me before any court in the State. I went to the local superintendent and set up a meeting for that mother. A person hopped out of a car and hit her child with a wheel brace. The child is now to be dealt with through some juvenile provision. The woman felt let down by the Garda and the State. She was certainly let down by the DPP. She told me that nobody came or wrote to her to inform her why the case was thrown out. Nobody told her what was contained in the file that was sent to the DPP.She had to take the photographs and give them to the Garda Síochána. She said she was sick and tired of the country as there is no law or order. She tried to teach her family to stay within the law and she now feels she may need to take the law into her hands as the State and its prosecutor let her down. Neither she nor any member of her family ever broke the law. As there was a dispute in the school, the perpetrator, who was high on drugs, hopped out of the car and hit the child with a wheel brace. If any Member of the House got a puncture, would they even know where the wheel brace was? The act was premeditated and was wrong.This case will need to go back to the DPP and the perpetrator will need to come before the courts. While the person who had committed the crime got social workers to talk to and free legal aid, my poor client was not contacted by anybody until I contacted the superintendent. I hope the superintendent will meet the family next week and explain to them what went wrong and whether the Garda will raise the case with the DPP again. If we are going to have the law for the criminals and not for the law-abiding citizens, we live in a sad country.While we can make all the legislation we like in this House, if we do not allocate the resources and money, do not give the back-up to the police and do not have the courts deal with such criminals, we are wasting our time. In the coming years, this will not be a nice country in which to live.

#SeanArdagh	unknown-#SeanArdagh-party	unknown-#SeanArdagh-dob	unknown-#SeanArdagh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	394	By comparison with most western democracies, Ireland has a very low crime rate. Crime remains a problem. We have recently seen a proliferation of crime among drug gangs, especially in parts of the south west of the country and in the west of Dublin. As Deputies Connaughton and Ring said, the use of guns on the M50 last weekend would remind one of Tombstone city, which is utterly intolerable. We have significant problems with drugs and with anti-social behaviour. Very few Deputies hold clinics without somebody coming to complain about harassment and the way that some young people are treating them and getting away with it.The Garda Síochána Act and the Criminal Justice Bill, especially the amendments which have now been tabled, are designed to focus on four items. Deputy Connaughton mentioned mandatory sentencing. If the Legislature defines a minimum sentence of five or ten years, that must apply. There is the question of the separation of powers between the Judiciary and the Legislature. The people elect the Legislature to do a job. If the representatives of the people decide there should be a minimum mandatory sentence, the court, which is independent, should take on board fully what is decided by the Dáil, as representative of the people, and should ensure that those minimum mandatory sentences are given. In one of the amendments before us, the Minister has set out that the public interest is to be taken into account by judges when considering sentencing, particularly for offences to which a minimum mandatory sentence applies.The question of firearms is a major issue and is current, especially in light of what happened last weekend. The constituency I represent, which includes Ballyfermot and Inchicore, has not been without its problems. Families in my constituency are still grieving and suffering as a result of the death of a loved one through the use of guns. Having one person involved in drugs or any crime should not mean that his or her family should suffer to the extent they do because of the use of guns.I laud a number of the amendments before us, particularly the restriction on firearms with a certain muzzle power or velocity which will need a licence from the Garda Commissioner rather than normal guns which need a licence from a superintendent. A new offence for sawing off shotguns is to be introduced. Sawing off shotguns is especially cruel as it is done in the knowledge that the shotgun will be used with criminal intent. Minimum mandatory sentences are proposed for the intent to use guns for criminal activities.A large number of guns are in circulation and to get them out of commission, a gun amnesty is to be introduced, which is a very good idea. It will mean that those with guns, who would feel much safer without them, will have the opportunity to give them up. At the same time those guns can be forensically tested and the results of those tests can be used in criminal prosecutions if needed. The implementation of the penalty for holding these types of guns with special power and design will be delayed until the end of the amnesty period so that it will not be an offence for people to hold such guns during the amnesty period.We are all concerned about fireworks when it comes to Hallowe'en. It is a particular problem in Dublin and I am sure the same is true throughout the country. Many elderly people, in particular, are frightened and totally inconvenienced by the noise of bangers and the danger of rockets and other fireworks. I am delighted that an amendment will be proposed to make it an offence to possess fireworks with the intention of selling them. I do not know how this legislation will affect people who possess fireworks for domestic use. We need to examine the phenomenon of private or residential fireworks displays, which are increasingly being organised in estates and back gardens. Many people enjoy this form of entertainment, which is proliferating at present. There is something to be said for organising fireworks displays in a safe manner that protects young children, for example. We need to consider how the new measures in this regard can tie in with other measures.I would like to speak about the question of organised crime, which needs to be examined. We all know about the gangs in west Dublin and Limerick, for example. Other criminal gangs which are not connected with political parties have emerged from paramilitary organisations in recent years. We are examining this issue in the proposed amendments, which will make it an offence to be a member of or participate in a gang with the intention of going out to commit an offence. The question of terrorism on the global stage increased in importance in the aftermath of the events of 11 September 2001. I am delighted that it has been proposed to make it an offence for a gang to conspire to commit offences abroad. That is welcome. It is often suggested that people should be prosecuted for committing offences if they gain personally from those offences. The amended Bill will also make it a specific offence to commit a crime for the benefit of an organisation as a whole.Not only has there been a proliferation in the use of guns by gangs, but there has also been a significant increase in the use of drugs by gangs. Sentencing provisions are being examined in that context. As I mentioned earlier, the issue of mandatory sentencing is being considered in this regard. We should discuss the extent to which we should permit other factors to be taken into account. At present, judges take previous convictions etc. into account. It is proposed to allow other matters, such as public interest, to be taken into account as well.I welcome the fact that the amended legislation will create a new offence of importing drugs worth more than €13,000. The issue of drug-free prisons, which are desirable, has been debated for a long time. In that regard, the supplying of drugs to a prisoner will become an offence under this Bill. It is important that we have good intelligence and that we are able to investigate this country's drug culture and the people involved in it in an effective manner. To that end, the Bill will provide for the establishment of a drug offenders' register. Any person who is convicted of drug offences to which a sentence of imprisonment of more than a year applies will be placed on the register. Such people will have to notify the Garda of any changes of address. The Garda will be able to build up a better picture of who is involved in supplying drugs, keep up to date with where such people are found and target them in a more effective manner. It is a very welcome provision.Sentencing is another matter that is being addressed in the proposed amendments. That is welcome because we have moved well beyond the old approach of locking people up and ignoring them before letting them out after five years or more. We have to provide for alternative penalties such as suspended sentences, fines and the deferral of custody. Such penalties will be put on a statutory basis so that judges will be able to impose conditions on the suspended sentences they hand down to people who have been convicted of crimes. People might be required to perform certain remedial actions, such as attending courses, which might help to reduce the likelihood of reoffending. It will also be open to judges to impose restrictions on the movements of offenders. People might be obliged to stay close to a certain area or to stay away from a certain area. I understand that it is intended to use electronic tagging in this regard. While it may not be used in the immediate future, the legislation will allow it to be used at some future time.Deputy Ring spoke about anti-social behaviour, which is giving us all great headaches in our local electoral bases. Every politician in this House receives representations on a regular basis about the effects of the behaviour of certain individuals on the quality of life of others. We need to put in place a system whereby people are asked and encouraged to desist from anti-social behaviour and given warnings about that behaviour. If they do not take heed of such warnings, meetings should be arranged with Garda superintendents. If young people are involved in anti-social behaviour, parents should accompany their children to such meetings. If, having followed the many steps involved in the system, the Garda superintendent feels it would be helpful to impose an anti-social behaviour order on an individual, he or she should be able to ask the District Court to take such action. It should be a civil matter rather than a criminal matter so that no criminal record will attach to the person involved until the point at which an anti-social behaviour order is imposed on him or her.Many of us have children or know children in our neighbourhoods, and we know it is easy for young people from any social background to get into trouble, regardless of the amount of money or education they have. We should try to ensure they do not have a criminal record on foot of the process I have outlined, if at all possible, so that their ability to visit other countries such as the United States is not affected and they will not be stopped at borders. The proposed amendments to the Bill, as it stands, will help to ensure that due process is observed over a suitably long period of time in a fair, reasonable and well thought-out manner that is based on annoyance and damage to the quality of life of the community. That is a good response to the type of anti-social behaviour that is to be found all over the place.People describe the anti-social behaviour order as a middle class response to working class people and problems. That is not the reality. Every location, regardless of the housing value or whether the homes are middle class or working class, experiences problems with anti-social behaviour. Probably there are more in those areas that are less economically endowed. Deputy Crowe, for example, listed a number of problems that he has encountered in his constituency which could be mitigated or reduced if the anti-social behaviour order procedure was in place. It is very important that the facility is in place.It is something I hope will not be abused. The calibre of the Garda, certainly in the district in which I operate in Dublin South-Central, is exemplary. I am thinking of the community inspector, sergeant and all the gardaí who work with them. They have a marvellous team and work very well with the residents and public representatives. They have the young people who might otherwise be offenders very much at heart. I am sure they will not abuse this power.The codification of the criminal law has been in question for a long time. I am glad the Minister took the opportunity of effectively accepting the proposals of the expert group. Professor Finbarr McAuley was the chairman of that group. He has now accepted the position as chairman of the codification of the criminal law group. It will be a long drawn-out process but it is very important that all the criminal law be codified into one volume. I know that a great deal of research is involved and I want to wish Professor McAuley and his team well in their endeavours for the future.In so far as the Criminal Justice Bill is concerned, as chairman of the committee to which all the amendments are coming, I know that the members will work hard to ensure that the best Bill will emerge from their deliberations. I hope that all Members of the House and the people will be proud of the end result.

I very much welcome the Criminal Justice Bill to the House. It is unfortunate that it is too little, too late, however, based on what we have seen in the recent past. Matters have got out of control.I am very disappointed that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is not in the House. I know he cannot be in the Chamber all the time. Nonetheless, there are Ministers of State and I am disappointed they are not here, which is no reflection on the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O'Malley. The Minister or Ministers of State in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform should be here to listen to the contributions from Members. That would give them a flavour of what is happening locally. I know the Minister has had his officials in the House but it is a disgrace that no political representative of the Department is present. There are enough of them.Nonetheless, I very much welcome the Bill and the measures that will seek to address the problems which we are experiencing in upholding law and order. The events of last Saturday night and Sunday morning are just another example of the frightening disregard that gangland criminals appear to have for law and order within civil society. These people are absolute scumbags and no jail sentence is good enough for them. I say that deliberately because the people involved in that shooting on Saturday night and Sunday morning are the lowest of the low, the scum of the earth. It maddens me to think they would not give any statement when brought into the Garda barracks. They are cowards, as well as being scumbags in that they are covering up for each other as part of the whole drug culture.We saw the shooting of that innocent woman a few weeks ago. What happened then and the events at the weekend are examples of what is occurring in this city every night of the week, except that it is not being seen because the gardaí are not in place. People are being threatened with gunfire and all the other types of criminal activity occurring within the city relating to drugs.The drugs problem has got out of control. While reluctant to blame anyone in particular, I believe this Government is largely responsible. I recall being interested in politics in the years 1994 to 1997. The then Minister for Justice, Deputy Nora Owen could not do anything without Deputy O'Donoghue jumping up and down like a Jack-in-a-box. It is all right for Deputy O'Donoghue, now in Cabinet, to see what is happening, with matters today ten times or even 100 times worse than when Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left were in Government from 1994 to 1997. He was in every newspaper and on every radio and television station blaming Deputy Owen for what was happening. That is a far cry from what we see today. I hope the measures in this Bill will be effective in the fight against organised crime. However, I cannot help wondering whether it is too little too late. I strongly believe that the Minister should have taken serious action before this.On the issue of firearms, there is no doubt that their ready availability is the major contributory factor to the increase in gun related crimes. Increases in fines and penalties as well as minimum sentences for certain types of offences should be forthcoming. I am convinced the regulation of the guns in circulation is vital following two unfortunate and regrettable domestic situations in my town in the past two weeks, where guns were at the centre of both incidents. There is a need for much more stringent controls on the possession and ownership of guns.Guns are readily available. I know the X-ray screens are operating at Dublin Airport, but they are not just coming in through the airports, but also the ports. Where are people at the centre of the drugs culture getting their guns from? They are getting them from across the water and bringing them into Ireland. The power and control allegedly being exercised by organised crime and its bosses is frightening. What is even more frightening is the notion that they can extend their fields of influence beyond their own areas and widen their net. In my constituency, especially in the Gorey area, the drug culture has increased greatly in recent years because of the massive population build-up. I blame the lack of gardaí locally for this.I received figures this evening from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform concerning the numbers of gardaí in my constituency. The rise in the population does not correspond proportionately to the increase in the numbers of gardaí. There is a significant population, especially in the Gorey area, and five or six extra gardaí since 1997 is nothing for the Government to gloat about. Thousands of people have moved into the Gorey and Enniscorthy areas. Two extra gardaí have been allocated to the latter area since 1997.I tabled a further question to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on how many extra gardaí we will receive in County Wexford from the promised extra 2,000 gardaí. He replied the Garda authorities are happy with the Garda figures in Enniscorthy, Wexford, Gorey and New Ross. When I spoke to the superintendent he told me he was not happy and that he is constantly seeking extra gardaí but he cannot get them. The lack of gardaí is a major contributory factor to the increase in drugs, gun crime and so on. The situation has gone completely out of control.I welcome the moves to tackle anti-social behaviour. I held a public meeting on this subject in the summer of 2005 at which I heard horror stories from the people who attended. I wholeheartedly agree with Deputy Ardagh. People in upper class housing estates blame people from local authority housing estates for problems that occur but this is not always the case. In many cases people from upper class housing estates go to other housing estates to congregate and get involved in anti-social behaviour, be it in regard to drugs, underage drinking or whatever else.Fine Gael has made some radical proposals on anti-social behaviour and the Government should take on board some of them which are based on consultation with the public. Fine Gael's public representatives organised meetings on anti-social behaviour right across the country. It was not afraid to listen to people's concerns. The Minister has not listened to the genuine concerns of people on the ground, be it in regard to anti-social behaviour, crime, drugs, robbery and so on.I received some additional figures on crime this evening. It has been stated that the number of detections are up. In 2000, 335 headline offences were recorded in the Enniscorthy area and detections followed in 160 cases. In 2005, there were 575 recorded headline crimes and 251 of these were detected. How can the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform state the number of headline crimes is down and the number of detections is up? He is not telling the truth. The same is true of the Gorey area where 486 headline crimes were recorded in 2000, of which 229 were detected. In 2005, 902 headline crimes were recorded there, of which 411 were detected. Less than half the crimes were detected in both years. The Minister can blab about what he is doing and not doing but it would be more in his line to address the problem.I am delighted to have been able to contribute to this debate. I hope the second part of the Bill will go some way towards decreasing the rise in the drugs culture and the number of shootings.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	396	I am pleased to have an opportunity to comment on the Bill. Like previous speakers I am concerned the Bill will not be properly discussed in this House. I understand the amendments run to something like 300 pages. These amendments are ten times the size of a regular Bill. I cannot see how the Bill will be properly discussed in the House in the time provided for Second and Committee Stages. This is the wrong way to do business and it is the reason flawed legislation passes through the House. I am convinced flaws will also subsequently be discovered in this Bill.Fine Gael has consistently put pressure on the Minister to bring forward this legislation. We have no intention of obstructing it and we will try to be as helpful as possible. In Deputy Jim O'Keeffe we have one of the most positive politicians in this House. The question must be asked why the Minister delayed so long and is now doing his best to rush this Bill through the Dáil. As a former Attorney General and well known barrister he should realise this is not the best way to do business.As previous speakers stated, the Bill creates a number of new offences but some of these, such as the gun and explosives measures, belong in a dedicated Bill rather than making this Bill enormous and cumbersome. The Minister is obviously trying to lump in all of the actions that, in his opinion, will make a contribution. I accept he is sincere about the effectiveness of the provisions but he is wrong in trying to put them all into one Bill. He has been four years in office and he has run out of time. He has lectured us and told us he knows more about law than anybody else in this country. We saw his response to Deputy Bruton last week. The Minister is obviously very confident in his ability but after four years he has achieved very little.When people look back on his record they will see how the crime problem has escalated, the drugs problem is out of control and young people from all backgrounds are indulging in anti-social behaviour on the streets at night. It appears this problem is becoming more widespread and the gardaí cannot control it. I will refer later to some local examples of this problem.I welcome some of the Bill's provisions such as the new drug offenders register, which is very important. The Minister should expand more on it. The sex offenders register is proving to be very effective. I recently saw it in operation. A drug offenders list could also prove to be effective.Our party welcomes the two-step process outlined in the Government amendments in regard to anti-social behaviour orders. It is intended that a behaviour warning will first be issued and this will be followed by a civil order. The Minister should address people's concerns about these orders and how they will operate. There may be room for abuse or the introduction of child criminality by the back door. I accept the Minister of State will refer further to this provision later. These matters must be clarified. Sentencing policy is in dire need of an overhaul and the provisions outlined by the Minister in the Bill fall far short of the mark. The Minister has referred to the codification of criminal law for some time and this appears to be something he wants to push through.Most Deputies refer to what is happening in their local areas in regard to anti-social behaviour. There is a totally inadequate Garda station in Castleisland, County Kerry. In fairness to the Minister he has been promoting the case for Castleisland. Last weekend a female garda had her nose broken and her companions were attacked while people stood idly by. Members of the public did not help them. Were it not for the fact that other gardaí came to their assistance, they could have been seriously injured. On the same weekend, three off duty gardaí were attacked in Tralee and savagely beaten by a crowd who picked on them. These are examples of what is happening in County Kerry, but similar attacks are taking place all over the country. Control has been lost.There is a world of difference between Members of this House speaking about legislation and sentencing policy and what is happening on the street. How many of us are on the street between the hours of midnight and 3 a.m. to see what is happening? I advise most politicians that it would be unsafe because politicians are not the most popular with people at that hour of the morning. We do not have a knowledge of what is happening on the street. The Minister is very good on the law but he does not have a full grasp of its application. I agree with the proposal for a reserve police force but the Minister's idea of the practicalities of its operation is in conflict with the thinking of the rank and file gardaí. He should listen more to their opinions rather than lecturing them, which they resent. They are dealing with more sophisticated, violent criminals who are under the influence of drugs most of the time, who have no respect for a garda or for law and order.The area of law and order requires far more resources, which will cost more. The House will need to decide on an all-party basis that the Garda Síochána should be given more resources. That is the only way to combat crime. Drugs are pouring into the country. Shannon Airport has no screening policy in place and drugs can come freely through that airport. An article in yesterday's newspaper reported there is no one there to stop them. This is also the case in other airports. I use Kerry Airport and I know that it does not have sniffer dogs except on an occasional basis and people just walk through. There may be the odd big haul of drugs but 90% of the time people are getting away with such crimes. It is a serious and challenging situation.Law and order is collapsing despite what the Minister may say. Crimes are not being reported and we lack the full knowledge of what is happening. People do not report crimes that were reported ten years ago because they do not receive a response. The situation is serious. Legislation alone will not resolve the problem. More enforcement and a presence on the ground is required.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	397	I support this motion which heralds major amendments to the Criminal Justice Bill 2004, which will be considered shortly by the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights. The select committee will spend many hours debating these amendments. I hope they can be agreed and put in place in the shortest possible timeframe.The Minister has stated that these amendments will address a wide range of important issues. The existing provisions of the Bill, together with these new amendments, will ensure that the criminal law will be updated and strengthened in several key areas. The Garda Síochána will be given powers to deal with firearms offences.The public are seriously concerned about the scourge of gun crime and organised crime which is fuelled by the prevalence of drugs in our society. The callous murder of Donna Cleary, a young mother from Coolock, on Sunday morning, 5 March 2006, shocked the ordinary, decent people of this country. Donna Cleary was an innocent person who was shot by a drug-crazed thug while she was attending a birthday party. Her murder was a watershed, a landmark, which brought home to us all the brutal reality of gangland crime on our streets.Donna Cleary was a popular person. Her friends admired her because of the way she dealt with the difficulties of life. Her family is held in high regard in her local community and is actively engaged in many voluntary and community organisations. With her father, she was heavily involved in the Northside and District Racing Pigeon Club.Her family is understandably heartbroken as a result of her murder. Nevertheless, they have contacted their local Deputies to see if anything positive can come out of this awful tragedy. They wish to actively promote and support the proposed gun amnesty that is being debated in the House this evening. I congratulate them on their courage in standing up for this measure. I hope that this proposal will be successful and that it will play a significant role in ridding our cities of indiscriminate and random shootings and killings. The gun amnesty will be forever linked with the name of Donna Cleary and this will be of some consolation to her family at this very difficult time.The Minister is proposing to introduce on a statutory basis a gun amnesty during which firearms may be surrendered to the Garda Síochána before new penalties and minimum mandatory sentences are introduced. I wholeheartedly welcome this proposal. The idea of an amnesty first gained prominence in May last year, following the murder of Joseph Rafferty. Unfortunately there are no reliable estimates from the Garda Síochána or the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform as to the exact number of unlicensed firearms in the State but the figure is believed to be in the thousands. The majority of unlicensed firearms are believed to be disused weapons, shotguns, hunting rifles and even antiques. The chief concern must be that these could be stolen and used in armed crime. Between 2002 and 2004, a total of 1,330 weapons were stolen. It is believed that a number of gangs involved in the robbery of weapons are renting them to other criminals.The Minister has stated the amnesty will not apply to weapons used in crime. The guns handed over will be forensically tested to identify whether they have been used in a previous crime. I am not sure whether this would be a discouragement and I would welcome the Minister's views.There have been a number of successful examples of gun amnesties. National amnesties were introduced in the UK in 1996 following the Dunblane tragedy and in 2003 following the murder of two girls at a new year's eve party in Birmingham. Gun amnesties were also introduced in South Africa and Ottawa. The 1996 and 2003 UK amnesties saw over 40,000 weapons surrendered to the authorities. I suggest that the period of the amnesty should be sufficiently long and that thought should be given to it. The amnesty in South Africa was extended to six months and there were calls to extend the 2003 UK amnesty from one month to two.Youth leaders in Birmingham at the time highlighted another problem in that criminals with guns did not want to go to a police station to hand in weapons. Neutral, anonymous venues were sought. Perhaps the Minister could let us know his thoughts on this issue.All of these issues can be thrashed out on Committee and Report Stages. I am confident that as a result of this legislative process, we can get it right.During the Second Stage debate on the Bill, I raised the concerns of legitimate gun clubs involved in the sport of game shooting and clay pigeon shooting. I hope it will be possible to cater for their concerns as we introduce this tough new legislation.Gun crime was extremely rare in this country. However, guns are increasingly being used to settle even minor disputes within and between criminal gangs. The shoot-out on the M50 last Sunday, 26 March, is the latest evidence of this. Those who commit gangland killings are seldom apprehended. Much gun crime is in response to previous incidents. If gardaí were more successful in dealing with preliminary incidents, reprisals could be prevented and the spiral stopped. The new measures announced in the motion will help gardaí to achieve this.Gun crime is no longer confined to certain groups and minor criminals are increasingly becoming involved. There is a mistaken view among sections of our society that it is okay for gangland criminals to shoot themselves — some even see it as positive. That is a dangerous road to take because innocent people will get caught in the crossfire, which has happened. That is the challenge which faces us all.Operation Anvil was launched by the Garda Síochána on 17 May 2005. This is an intensive special policing operation which is intelligence driven and focuses on those involved in gun crime of any kind in the Dublin region. This operation must continue and must be fully backed up with increased resources. Operation Anvil has had some success to date. Between 17 May 2005 and 28 March 2006 there were 1,792 arrests, 31 linked to murders, 440 for serious assaults, 414 for robbery and 907 for burglary. There were 8,347 drug searches, 873 theft related searches and 776 firearms searches, with 374 firearms recovered. Some 3,934 vehicles were seized and the value of property recovered was over €6 million. In addition a total of 4,400 firearms were seized between 1999 and 2004, according to Garda figures. The number seized has fluctuated between 700 and 800 in most years and 822 were seized in 2004, the last year for which figures are available. Airguns, rifles and shotguns account for approximately 80% of the firearms seized every year and machine guns and pistols are becoming slightly more prevalent.There is no doubt our communities want to see more gardaí on the beat. The view is that burglaries and robberies by drug users could be prevented if the gardaí were more visible. As a Deputy it is heartbreaking to call to the home of an old age pensioner living alone to hear the tale of how his or her house was broken into and ransacked, with perhaps €300 or €400 stolen, which happens regularly. It would go a long way towards reassuring the public if gardaí were seen on the beat.Some €1.29 billion is being provided to the Garda Síochána this year, a 13% increase on last year. There are 1,500 more gardaí now than in 1997, making a total of 12,300 gardaí. This will increase to 14,000 next year. These extra gardaí should be seen; they should be out and about and involved in our communities, in particular through the community policing programme. Local communities would get a great boost if and when this happens.I regularly get reports from local residents to the effect that drug dealing is taking place in a certain house on a certain road. I often report such information to the Garda. It is discouraging when several months later nothing appears to have happened. I would like to know what is happening with regard to such cases. It may be that gardaí have the house under surveillance and are trying to catch the bigger fish but the public need to be reassured that if reports are made in regard to drug dealing in a house, they will be dealt with effectively by the Garda.I welcome the new measures being introduced in regard to participation in criminal gangs. This is a complex legal issue but one which must be dealt with. There is a view that judges are imposing sentences that are too lenient and that they try to circumvent mandatory minimum sentences if at all possible. It seems many professional criminals are at large as a result. In addition, there is clear evidence that some judges have become remote and out of touch with the reality on the ground. The new amendments before us will bring into existence new legislation to try to deal with these problems. Once again, the Legislature is making its views on these issues abundantly clear.The Minister proposes amendments to the Explosives Act 1875. These include the introduction of a new offence of possession of fireworks for sale without a licence. In addition, he proposes increases in the fines and penalties generally under the 1875 Act. I propose that the Minister goes a little further in this regard. Fireworks are prevalent in Dublin and throughout the country at Hallowe'en. I suggest that community groups, local residents' associations and so on should be in a position to apply to their local authority for a licence to conduct fireworks displays. It is obvious we need tough laws but we also need to encourage community involvement. In that regard, if fireworks are part of a community activity, a licence could be sought from the local authority. We should facilitate this development.My final point concerns the demand for drugs. Most of my contribution dealt with the supply of drugs and how we deal with that issue. The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs administers the national drugs strategy 2001-08, which incorporates the work of the local and regional drugs task forces and the young people's facilities and services fund. Through these initiatives a broad range of community and voluntary groups are funded to tackle drug misuse. We cannot underestimate the importance of this effort. It goes hand in hand with the measures we debate in this motion.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	400	I share the concerns expressed by Deputy Costello about this Bill given the 200 amendments to it which run to 300 pages. It is beyond me that such important legislation should have the sheep-like consent of the members of the Government parties. They, particularly those representing the greater Dublin area, must surely be as concerned as the Opposition about this issue. This is not a question of opposition merely for the sake of opposition. This is important legislation not only for the greater Dublin area. One would imagine, as I am sure would the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, that the only part of Ireland where there is crime is the greater Dublin area. It is as if the only thing that happens in Ireland happens in Dublin, if something does not happen in Dublin it does not happen at all and in that case there is no need to address it.I attended a meeting recently the full proceedings of which focused on what was reported in The Irish Times. I am reluctant to give free publicity to anyone who does not give me free publicity. One of the good aspects of living in Cork is that we are not as fixated with The Irish Times as are people in Dublin. Not alone are they fixated with that newspaper, they are fixated with anything that happens in the region.I listened to Deputy Haughey's contribution and his basic point was that judges are out of touch with what is happening on the ground. We all know that judges come from a particular elite. They must have knowledge of the law, a certain standard and practice. That is an acknowledged code and we accept that, but a fact we must never accept is that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is out of touch. The reason he is out of touch is that he comes from the same elite. How could he possibly know about crime on the north side of Cork and in other inner cities? The man would not recognise crime in such a place if it jumped up and bit him. He would not have a notion what it feels like to be mugged, to have one's purse snatched or to have to put up with a group of people who are making one's life a misery through engaging in anti-social behaviour every night of the week. Such crime occurs in other parts of the country as well as in Dublin. This legislation is not only about Dublin but also about the rest of the country and we need to ensure that it serves that need.I will advise Members of the position in Cork North-Central which, as they will have gathered, is the constituency I represent — I would not be talking about it otherwise. After 10 p.m. any night the Garda force operating in Cork North-Central virtually shuts down. That happens not because the gardaí have gone home or because they like to work from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. or from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. but because they do not have sufficient numbers. There are two Garda stations in Cork North-Central, which anyone who has canvassed there will know is a fairly sprawling constituency. The stations in Watercourse Road and Mallow Road close and the station in MacCurtain Street is closed for good. The members of the force operating in my constituency have only one patrol car. If anyone is of the view that two gardaí in one patrol car can deal with crimes let alone crime prevention, they are fooling themselves. If my son was a garda and he had to go to an estate where he might have to face 20 young fellows, who are not aged 13 or 14 but whose ages range up to 25, one could not expect him or any young garda to leave a patrol car and walk into the middle of such a hostile group to confront them.There is a lack of gardaí on the beat in communities, who know the area they police and who know the people involved in crime. Gardaí have become almost invisible because there are not sufficient numbers. Yet we have to continue to listen to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform telling us what we should do. He is the great lecturer of all time. There is a major case to be made for not appointing a person who practises a certain profession as Minister with responsibility for that profession. The same applies to the education portfolio, of that I am convinced.The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been arguing both sides of a case for so long that he cannot make a decision. He could defend me tomorrow and prosecute me the next day and he would not have a problem with that because that is what he is trained to do. It is that type of thinking, whereby one does not know which side of the fence one is on, that has led us to the position where the man concerned cannot make a decision. His lack of decision-making has left us in a position where people no longer report crime or feel safe in their homes, and anti-social behaviour is the crime of the day in Ireland and elsewhere.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	401	The first point I wish to make was made by our party spokesperson, Deputy Costello, and by others, namely, how an Opposition spokesperson is supposed to consider this Bill is beyond me. That any legislature would make a good job of addressing this legislation is also beyond me. On Committee Stage Members will have to deal with amending the following list of legislation: the Firearms Act 1925, the Explosives Act 1875, the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977, the Children Act 2001, section 19 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994, the Criminal Justice (United Nations Convention Against Torture) Act 2000 and the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act 1961 as well as the Criminal Justice Act with which they will be presented in the first instance.I do not know how the Oireachtas will properly adjudicate on and end up with decent legislation after its deliberations. I do not believe it will be able to properly correlate what is in this legislation with the other legislation to which I referred. We could well end up with a legislative mess. We could discover that we have made serious mistakes with regard to criminal justice because of the way in which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform aims to do business in this regard. I strongly make that point. It is crazy what the Oireachtas is being asked to do in dealing with this huge swathe of amendments on top of the original legislation and trying to relate it to the other relevant legislation. I would not like to be an Opposition spokesperson dealing with this legislation and I do not believe that anybody will be able to properly deal with it. It is our duty as legislators to properly deal with legislation and to properly amend it as necessary.The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform thinks he is better than everybody else and that the rest of us are not even knee high to him. I do not know how he can be Minister with responsibility for equality with that attitude. He obviously thinks that this is a sensible thing to do and that it can be done, but he is misleading the public. He constantly does that and bamboozles the public that by introducing all this legislation somehow or other he will address the problem of crime. He will not do so in that way, certainly not by this type of legislation nor by what he does in general. He keeps telling people that he is introducing legislation to address this, that and the other issue, while members of the public know that what they really need is Garda resources and the implementation of legislation that is already on the Statute Book. I do not object to some of the measures the Minister proposes to introduce in this Bill but if he does not allocate the necessary resources, he is wasting his time.There are issues in regard to firearms, explosives, drug trafficking and so on, but if the Garda does not have the resources to implement that legislation it is going nowhere. If the Garda capacity in the communities that are beset by crime — I know about this as much as anybody else in the constituency from which I come — is not sufficient to deal with the criminals in its midst, we are going nowhere, and the Minister knows that. If the capacity of groups such as probation and welfare officers is insufficient, it will not be possible to deal with the young people when they initially become involved in crime and when something can be done for them. They will go on to become hardened criminals like their older brothers, whatever about their sisters.There are much broader issues involved than simply the introduction of legislation dealing with crime. At night-time, for example, when people really need protection, the Garda does not have the resources to look after people in my own community. Deputy Lynch is correct. There are estates in my constituency where people feel bereft of support at night-time. It is no wonder that people are afraid to give evidence and that courts have difficulty in getting people to make statements against hardened criminals. Such witnesses have their windows, their cars threatened and, at times, their lives threatened because there is not adequate protection for them. It is all very well to state that people do not always carry through with making complaints, but one must give them and their communities the protection necessary to be able to stand up properly, in conjunction with the Garda, to the criminals in their midst.The issue of community policing is one that my party has raised repeatedly and it has been a firm policy of ours for a long time that we need proper community policing. We also need proper local liaison committees that will liaise between communities and the police. Such committees still have not been put in place in any real way by the current Government. In the area where I live, we have set up regular consultation meetings between a representative group of residents in the different areas within the broader area and the Garda, and we meet two, three or four times a year. That is effective but we have had to do that ourselves. There is no structure through which local communities can directly involve themselves with the Garda unless they initiate it themselves.The communities most beset by criminals are often the ones that do not possess the strength to set up such meetings because much of the time those who become the community leaders involved in setting up these effective liaison meetings are setting themselves up as targets. I agree with Deputy Lynch that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, has no clue about what it is like to live in a community beset by criminals and about how much courage a person not properly protected must have in those communities to live any kind of normal life and be able to stand up to them.There are a number of other issues. I want to refer, for example, to the misuse of drugs and strengthening the existing sentencing provisions for drug trafficking offences. Recently we had reason to raise an issue relating to two of our airports, Cork and Shannon, where there are no customs officials rostered at certain times at night when international flights arrive. I fail to understand how, on the one hand, the Government is not even putting customs officials in place while, on the other, the Minister is trying to strengthen the legislation against drug trafficking.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	402	In the short time available I will refer to a number of points in the Bill rather than attempt to address the entire range of matters concerned. During a debate in the Dáil on the care of the elderly, I spoke about concerns expressed to me by someone in the community sector who has a particular commitment to the elderly. He spoke of a party held for elderly people in Waterford city last Christmas. Virtually all those who attended were elderly ladies and most of them were widows. Many of these ladies used go out to play bridge and bingo but they have stopped doing so for fear of their personal security. It is terrible that this should be the case and that, obviously, Ireland is no longer as pleasant a place in which to grow old as it used be.Following last Hallowe'en, I had reason to raise in this House my concerns regarding serious anti-social behaviour which took place in Tramore, County Waterford, the town in which I live, that night and in the period prior to it. What used be over the years an evening of great fun for the community at large, but especially for the children, proved to be an occasion of fear, intimidation and upset for many.When considering the amendments which were presented to the House today by the Minister, I asked myself what impact, if any, their enactment will have on situations such as the two I have described. The amendments the Minister is proposing to the Explosives Act 1875, which include the introduction of a new offence of possession of fireworks for sale without a licence, are to be welcomed in the context of my concerns surrounding Hallowe'en. That amendment is fine as far as it goes, but what measures is the Minister proposing in connection with those who buy fireworks in Northern Ireland for their own use and for the use of their relations and friends — in other words, where they are lawfully purchased in Northern Ireland and are not for resale? I put it to the Minister that what he proposes, while welcome, will be of limited effect.The introduction of anti-social behaviour orders for adults could have a beneficial effect for older people, particularly when they are out at night. It seems that this proposal is close to the present practice of binding people to the peace. The fact that it is to be a last resort after other options have been tried and have failed makes it more acceptable. The granting of the order by civil means on the application of a senior Garda so that a criminal record is not acquired is welcome. The committing of a criminal offence by the breach of an order gives space to the person against whom the order was granted to get his or her act together.The concept of the anti-social behaviour order has an uncomfortable feel about it and, obviously, such orders should be used sparingly when all other approaches have failed and in the face of ongoing chronic anti-social behaviour by an individual or individuals. The application for and granting of anti-social behaviour orders must be closely monitored and kept under constant review in terms of their efficacy and fairness. The Minister should consider providing for this in the legislation.I also raised recently in the House the activities, both criminal and anti-social, of some individuals which can create a hell on earth for individuals, families and neighbourhoods. They can assume the status of untouchables because of the fear and intimidation they engender in prospective witnesses. The fear of reprisals, as my colleague, Deputy O'Sullivan, stated, is a significant factor in urban areas. Without appropriate evidence, there are no convictions. Anti-social behaviour orders should have a limited use but could have a beneficial effect. I say this on behalf of the elderly and vulnerable in our society.One of the miscellaneous proposals which I welcome is the measure to protect staff in accident and emergency departments in hospitals and other emergency workers from attacks and assaults. Such assaults and attacks are doubly outrageous in that they interfere with the delivery of vital services and this can have serious outcomes in some circumstances, quite apart from the harm caused to the deliverers of essential services. These workers deserve every possible support and protection that the State and society can offer.I look forward to reading and, I hope, agreeing with the reckless endangerment of children Report Stage amendments which the Minister has promised arising from the Ferns Inquiry. This is an area which requires urgent, comprehensive and effective attention.The introduction of a gun amnesty is welcome, especially if the result is worthwhile, but one fears that its success could be quite limited bearing in mind the kind of individuals who hold the most dangerous armouries.The strengthening of the law on participation in a criminal gang, conspiracy to commit a serious offence and committing an offence for the benefit of a criminal organisation all appear to be movements in the right direction, but for criminal law to be effective, the Garda, which enforces the law, must be given the optimum level of assistance to effectively apprehend criminals, particularly serious criminals, and bring them to justice. A fundamental aspect of the effectiveness of our legal system is that the punishment follows quickly on the committing of the crime. Reform of administrative procedures within the Garda in preparing cases, more rapid processing of cases within the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and greater speed within the courts system will be required and will require in most instances additional resources, but there is no alternative but to provide these resources.
#JohnMcGuinness	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-party	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-dob	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	403	I welcome the opportunity to debate this motion. On Second Stage of this Bill, Members had opportunities to raise local issues such as the numbers of gardaí and crime rates in various constituencies. During that debate, I raised the need for more time and expressed my concerns on the operation of ASBOs. The debate on this motion provides the Opposition and Government backbenchers with an opportunity to discuss the 200 or more amendments proposed. However, I did not hear any specific mention of the amendments, except for general criticisms of the Bill. Reference was made to a lack of time, despite the allocation of double time in terms of Second Stage and this motion. If the Opposition has lost time on this matter, it is its own fault for addressing the amendments to the Bill in the manner it did.I appreciate it is a wide-ranging Bill and time will be required on Committee Stage to tease out the problems involved and I commend the Minister for bringing the Bill and the amendments before the House for debate. In his speech, the Minister proposed a number of changes. For example, he referred to the need for legislation to ensure stability and order in society and rehearsed other measures to support the Garda Síochána. I will not now join the debate on the numbers of gardaí on the streets.I welcome the provisions in this Bill on firearms and explosives and the mandatory minimum sentences of between five and ten years for offences in this area. That is essential if the legislation is to be brought up to date and to ensure sentences reflect the serious crimes currently being committed in society. The amendment of the Explosives Act 1875 is also welcome because the number of fireworks set off at Hallowe'en and other festive occasions can lead one to believe they are legal rather than illegal.An offence of importing drugs is provided for in amendments and is to be welcomed because of the amount of drugs that already exist in society. I am glad to see proposals on a drug offenders register, which will be administered by the Garda.Anti-social behaviour orders are being spelled out in the context of how they will affect children between the ages of 12 and 18 and, thereafter, others. These will be implemented by senior gardaí.I have rehearsed the elements of the Minister's proposals which I consider relevant and which will take up a considerable proportion of Garda time. I am particularly interested in the proposals for protecting accident and emergency staff and other emergency service workers.Having listened carefully to all arguments, when one relates the legislation to what is going on in Garda stations throughout the country, I am reminded of the Minister and his statistics because the reality is quite different. A body of legislation will be passed and given to the gardaí to implement. It could be said with regard to the recent debate on the Minister and his statistics that there are lies, damn lies and statistics. I was impressed with the way the Minister reconciled himself with Deputy Bruton but that may have been a case of general election courtship, in that he was looking beyond the next general election campaign. When one looks beyond the statistics, however, our Garda stations tell a different story.I am inclined to agree that the Minister should take more note of what is said in this House and, in particular, the comments from the party of the batch loaf. He described Fianna Fáil as a batch loaf, whereas he considers himself the meat in the sandwich. I do not know what sort of meat he would consider himself to be but maybe he should be constantly reminded that his party appeals to 4% of the electorate. He is in partnership with Fianna Fáil and, if we are the batch loaf, he should listen carefully to what we have to say because our experience is drawn from every constituency. Our public representatives are informed by a broad organisation with representation in every parish.Rapidly growing communities have no Garda presence because their local stations have been closed. In Kilkenny, which has an expanding population, a Garda station is located on one side of the city but there is no outreach centre for the other side. In the context of the location of stations and the support that communities receive, there is a significant deficit, as well as insufficient funding and numbers of gardaí.I do not care what statistics the Minister may care to quote because I deal with the reality on the ground and that is significantly different. In the Kilkenny parish in which I live, crime and the abuse of drugs and drink are completely out of hand. Businesses in my constituency have been robbed at knife point or by means of the threatened use of firearms. Business families have been terrorised. Elderly women have been threatened and traumatised in their own homes. Turf wars have taken place, not only over the control of low key drugs but over heroin, ecstasy and cocaine. Families have been devastated because of drug use and elderly people have had to leave their homes at weekends because of threats.No one takes responsibility for addressing these issues. The HSE has placed families in private rented accommodation, including known drug dealers who cause havoc — one family in my constituency is being terrorised by a number of drug dealers who call to a certain house. There are insufficient local gardaí to investigate these matters and local government is not joined-up in terms of co-operation among county councils, the HSE and gardaí in addressing the issue. It is nobody's problem. One is sent to the landlord, the HSE or the Garda station, yet no action is taken. Decent and honest to God people are being terrorised in their homes. That is what we are confronted with. The city has changed considerably over the years, moving from its difficulties with unemployment to difficulties with drugs and those who peddle them. I have seen little or no response to this, bar a devastated community.Taking into account all the legislation coming from the proposals before us, even more pressure will be heaped on the Garda Síochána. There will be a sex offenders list, a drugs users list, a list of shotguns and licences, and gardaí will have to man their stations. It is time for the reform package promised for the Garda Síochána, not merely the reserve force, to be brought forward.I wish to see much more money spent on recruiting gardaí, and to see gardaí back on the beat. This is not to criticise currently serving gardaí, rather I make this call by way of support for them. These gardaí are stretched. In Kilkenny, for example, there are sometimes one or two gardaí in the Garda station, and these gardaí must patrol the whole county. I have received complaints from north Kilkenny, towns such as Johnstown, Urlingford and Ballyragget, with regard to anti-social behaviour and the lack of a response or a presence from the Garda. I recently attended a meeting in Inistioge where I heard that a family had to travel to the Garda station in Thomastown to have forms signed. However, the family was sent back because the forms had to be signed in the local station. The local Garda station in Inistioge is operated by a button alerting a garda, and there was no response.We need more gardaí in Garda stations and administrative staff to support what these gardaí do. The administrative staff do not need to be fully-trained gardaí but they need to have administrative skills. Such personnel would allow gardaí to go back on the beat. We need more gardaí in every station and we must examine the technology in those stations which are closed down, in order to give some comfort to the communities they are supposed to serve. Without trying to raise the expectation in any of those communities, there is a need to look at re-opening, even on a part-time basis, Garda stations where there has been a significant increase of population in an urban location within counties. This would give the type of wide-ranging services now being demanded from the police force.If we do not proceed with these measures now, we will create a further deficit as we move out into the next five years. Arresting the decline must begin now and the funding must be provided. We can no longer hide behind statistics. I listened to the debate between Deputy Bruton and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, and most of the country would have felt that it was bogus. The reality is significantly different and needs to be dealt with.I have never seen the level of heroin as is currently available in Kilkenny. I have seen families devastated by the use of the drug, and I have also seen a complete neglect within the Health Service Executive to deal with the issue by providing places for treatment in counties or within regions. As a result, the people who smoke or inject the drug in their homes are being supported by their families. When the occasion arises, these people vanish to locations where they can obtain and use the drug.I cannot understand why people who have an established network within communities get away with selling the drug and pushing its use. Their names are known to community leaders, and their names are probably known within the Garda Síochána. Whether it is a weakness in the legislation or a lack of numbers within the Garda, I cannot understand why they are not arrested, brought to court and imprisoned. The devastation being caused by them is immeasurable.I have seen young people begin using that drug and as a result entering a cycle of having to steal to feed the habit. Sometimes such youths may be given a softer drug to peddle in order to get the money to buy heroin or cocaine. That is unacceptable. The longer we keep our heads in the sand and quote statistics, the worse the problem is getting. The fact will remain that the problem was not dealt with in the course of this Government's term.I read with interest the description a close friend, Councillor Pat Fitzpatrick, made of how he was held at gunpoint in a hotel which was being robbed in Dublin. I have watched him since as he is traumatised by the event. I compare this to an elderly person, whom I met in her home, but who cannot stay in the house as a result of anti-social behaviour. This is the kind of society we currently live in. If we are going to legislate for this society, which is what we are doing with this Bill, we must be prepared to put up the money to provide the force to police that society.We must end anti-social behaviour and I would like to believe that ASBOs will do the trick. However, given the level of anti-social behaviour, the number of gardaí involved and what we are asking them to do, we are ignoring the real problem. The local authorities in these areas are not creating a platform where all the agencies can engage with one another in trying to solve the problem. Such a platform would involve the Garda, the HSE, local authorities, local communities, etc. It is not happening the way it should. If we want such a process, we must fund the development of numbers within the Garda Síochána.I would like to see technology applied within the stations, with gardaí being confident of the technology they use. If this requires investment and extra squad cars on the street, it must be done. It is pointless debating this in the House and putting legislation in place if we do not put our money where our mouth is. The Minister, Deputy McDowell, must do this sooner rather than later. I am a great believer in community policing and I have seen it work in Kilkenny. I have also seen community police being put elsewhere at the drop of a hat, simply because people are under pressure.I wish to mention the issue of missing people. I am extremely disappointed that the Minister has not met with representatives of affected families. He has delegated that responsibility to his officials. With no disrespect intended towards these officials, it is incumbent on the Minister to understand the problems of those who face crime and to understand the problems of those families who have a member missing. It is only through direct engagement with these people that one can understand the real problems.Every Member of this House must experience at their clinics the type of situations I have described. While I respect what is being done in legislation, I would have more respect for a greater engagement by the Minister in an attempt to understand what is occurring, and not just in Dublin. The debate has recently centred on Dublin, but the problems in Dublin have spilled over to the rest of the country. The markets for drugs, guns and crime have simply widened. When did we think we would see a gun fight on the M50? The Minister must listen to what is said, look at the options for funding and demand that the type of funding required be made available in the short term so that this, at least, can be stopped. Legislation will not do it on its own,nor will debate. I urge the Minister to take action.

#JerryCowleyIND	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-party	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-dob	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	405	I am grateful for the opportunity to raise an important matter on the Adjournment, namely the jobs crisis in Ballina, County Mayo, where the unemployment rate at 11% is twice the national average, and where 1,000 jobs have been lost in the past nine years, with the closure of Asahi, Heneghans, Oasis and other factories, as well as the loss of spin-off industries.The fact that the IDA still has no site, premises or business park to market, sell or exhibit to potential investors is a terrible scandal and a mark of the its failure to deliver. We have lost 1,340 jobs in the past nine years and have created only 400 in replacement, a net loss of nearly 1,000 jobs. We have been dealt a mortal blow and the IDA seems incapable of delivering what we need.There has not been one week in the Dáil in recent times when I have not brought up the neglect of the Ballina and north Mayo area and the need for infrastructure in the BMW region. The Government has failed miserably to act. No town can sustain the loss of 1,000 jobs in nine years. Something must be done. The IDA and Enterprise Ireland must work harder for north Mayo. Ballina is now an unemployment blackspot and needs urgent attention from Government. The time for talk is long past — we need action. Neither the Government nor the IDA has any excuse.Having had discussions with the IDA and with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I am as convinced as they that the problems boil down to a lack of infrastructure. The IDA has told me it has great difficulty securing jobs in north Mayo. It states that manufacturers want to go to an area such as Dublin, yet Dublin still receives IDA grants despite already being overpopulated. We need those jobs in Mayo but our people must leave the area to get employment.The IDA also states that manufacturers need larger centres with the scale, infrastructure and services capable of sustaining their investment. That is why we need roads and rail links such as the western rail corridor. We need broadband and technology parks — all the things that will give us a level playing field and balanced regional development. The west is not a competitive area because we do not have such infrastructure. Industrialists and the IDA complain bitterly that, for example, the poor state of the N5 militates against an industrialist settling in Mayo. We have long been promised the 27-acre industrial park on the Sligo road to Ballina and we can do very little without it. It needs to be fast tracked and I ask the Minister personally to intervene. We need the N26 Ballina-Bohola bypass and the Government must put pressure on the NRA to ensure this essential infrastructure is delivered. I again ask the Minister to intervene.The fundamental problem is the failure of Government to provide balanced regional development and the necessary infrastructure. With €3.9 billion NDP underspend, is it any wonder we are not a competitive area for industry to locate? A surplus of €2 billion has already been generated in the first two months of 2006. Why can this money not be put toward providing us with the infrastructure we need? The national development plan has not been fulfilled and the national spatial strategy has not been implemented. Ballina is a hub town which is crying out for support from Government. The time for talking has passed and now is the time for action.The numbers on the live register in Ballina exceed those for the whole county of Roscommon, which speaks for itself. People talk about development for Mayo and the Government has paid much lip service recently on the need to develop Mayo and the work it is doing. As an example, it wants to bring ashore gas from the Corrib field but when did the Government last see the state of the Castlebar to Belmullet road? It is a dangerous dirt track, yet in one spot where peat is brought from one end of a bog to another there is a virtual highway built for Shell. I wish the Government would give the same commitment to the people of Mayo as to Shell. It is a pity that the commitment and generosity shown to Shell does not spill over for the long-suffering people of Ballina and north Mayo. I ask the Minister personally to intervene to ensure that the IDA and Enterprise Ireland work harder to ensure that the Ballina technology park becomes a reality, that adequate broadband technology is rolled out and that the NRA will fast track the N26 Ballina-Bohola bypass to give us a future. It is our right as citizens. At a time when the Government is boasting about full employment, it is a clear indication of their lack of commitment to Ballina that a town should have such a high unemployment rate. I urge action now.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	406	As I said on the Adjournment some weeks ago, I am very concerned that Oasis in Ballina has decided to reduce its workforce to approximately 12 people within a period of two months. I am very conscious of the effect these job losses will have on the workers involved and their families, as weIl as the community in the surrounding area. I wish to assure the people concerned that the State agencies will provide every support they can.The priority will be to find alternative employment for those involved at the earliest possible opportunity. The industrial development agencies will be making every effort to secure alternative investment and employment for Ballina and north Mayo. A central goal for the agencies is the achievement of balanced regional development. The national spatial strategy provides a framework for achievement of this goal through the prioritisation of development and investment in the gateway and hub locations.IDA Ireland recognises the need to provide high-value employment opportunities in Mayo, including Ballina, which provide sustainable long-term jobs. On this basis, IDA Ireland seeks to attract foreign direct investment into the linked hub of Ballina and Castlebar, as well as a small number of additional locations throughout County Mayo. The agency is actively promoting Ballina for new foreign investment, as well as working with the existing base of overseas companies in Ballina to encourage them to grow and expand. Since January 2003, there have been five first-time site visits to Ballina. IDA Ireland's sectoral emphasis is on attracting new knowledge-intensive projects in the medical technologies, life sciences, information communications and technology and international services sectors.The agency is investing significantly in the provision of planned and focused property solutions. Specifically, IDA Ireland is developing world-class business and technology parks at a number of towns throughout County Mayo. The goal is to ensure that these locations have the appropriate property solutions, tailored to specific key sectoral targets, to attract inward investments. This also means undertaking long-term planning with the local authority so that the area is seen by investors as having the appropriate locational solutions, such as property, infrastructure, business and lifestyle services etc. for key strategic investments of national importance. IDA has been in discussions with Mayo County Council regarding the acquisition of a site in local authority ownership in Ballina and the agency informs me that it is awaiting contract documentation and copy of unburdened title from the council.The activity of Enterprise Ireland is focused on the creation of new jobs through supporting entrepreneurs setting up new high potential start-up companies, the retention and creation of new jobs in existing companies and in enhancing the innovation capability of Irish companies at a national and regional level. Enterprise Ireland provides preferential funding for companies with detailed export plans which are expanding or establishing a business in County Mayo. Enterprise Ireland has approved funding support of almost €1 million to client companies in the Ballina-Killala area in the period 2003 to 2005. A new Enterprise Ireland-supported high potential start-up company, Heatsolve Limited, commenced operations in Ballina last year. Enterprise Ireland has committed funding of over €750,000 to IRD North Mayo-West Sligo Limited for the development of enterprise space in Ballina, which centre the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, officially opened during his visit to Ballina last January. According to provisional figures from the Forfás employment survey 2005, the total number of people employed in Enterprise lreland client companies in County Mayo in 2005 was 3,054, an increase of 468 on the number employed ten years earlier. In the past 12 months a number of new businesses have been set up in the Castlebar area, all in the retail sector, creating approximately 150-200 jobs.The role of FÁS is of particular importance in assisting those who are to lose their jobs. FÁS made contact with the company immediately after the closure was announced and the agency has indicated that the full range of its services will be made available to employees if they wish to avail of them. Specifically FÁS provides a range of programmes to assist jobseekers to improve their skills and obtain employment. These include specific skills training in a range of areas. Bridging foundation training is provided for those requiring additional assistance while the one step up programme, introduced last year, provides placement and career guidance services. There are special programmes for the long-term unemployed and a variety of courses available through FÁS e-coIlege. FÁS labour market activities provide experience and development through programmes such as community employment and job initiative schemes, job clubs, workplace and special services for those with disabilities or for early school leavers.In addition, FÁS provides integrated redundancy support services and is working to extend these to all workers made redundant. The process typically involves agreement with the company on responsibilities and actions, intensive interviews with affected workers, preparation of a skills analysis report based on identified workers' needs and local opportunities and referral of redundant workers to jobs, training courses or other options, including customised courses where necessary. On-going support is provided to keep redundant workers in touch with the labour market. Progress is being made in prioritising expenditure under the national development plan in the BMW region and the indications are that the under-spend on a number of key infrastructure measures under both the economic and social infrastructure operation programme and the BMW regional operational programme is being addressed.Evidence suggests good progress is being made in achieving the objectives of the current national development plan in the west region. Data published by the CSO indicates that the levels of total income per person in the west region increased from €14,420 to €18,487 between the years 1999 and 2002. This is an increase from 89.1% to 90.3% of the average State level over those years.I am confident that the State development agencies will strengthen their marketing and promotion efforts in Ballina and north Mayo and will make every effort to secure alternative employment for the area. This will be done in partnership with other key players to maximise the flow of potential investors for the area and to convert these into investment and job opportunities for both Ballina and County Mayo in general.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	407	I wish to speak on the imminent closure of the Irish Sugar plant in Mallow, County Cork. The issue is important to me not only because I represent 300 full-time and part-time workers whose jobs are to be lost but because I was an employee at the factory for 18 years. The Mallow plant has been in operation for generations, yet the closure is part of an emerging pattern in the Irish employment market whereby the Government is giving up on traditional industries that have sustained communities for many years.Mere sentiment and nostalgia are not my motivation in calling on the Minister for Agriculture and Food to account for her role in the closure of the plant. Rather, the Government failed the employees of Irish Sugar and the people of Mallow by failing to argue the case for the Irish sugar industry at the meeting of the EU Agriculture Ministers in Brussels last December, when the future of the EU sugar regime was decided. Since that meeting and before and after the announcement of the closure of the plant there has been a conspiracy of silence on the Minister's negotiating position in Brussels. The Minister for Agriculture and Food agreed to cut the price of Irish sugar by 36% but the Finnish Government, representing a country with a similar demographic structure to Ireland, was able to retain the beet industry, guarantee a higher price and arrange a special deal with Brussels.It appears Ireland negotiated for an enhanced compensation package without considering the viability of the industry. If the Finns could retain the industry in their country, why could the Irish not do likewise? The Minister has failed to answer this and has offered no explanation for the negotiating stance adopted at the meeting. From December the closure of the plant appeared inevitable and the outcome of the EU Agriculture Council allowed Greencore to blame the closure on the Irish Government when it made the announcement a few weeks ago. After the announcement and the platitudes and crocodile tears that followed, the emphasis has been on providing for growers, Greencore and contractors during the restructuring phase rather than on saving the jobs. Very little has been done for employees.The Taoiseach and the Government have a duty to account for the Government's position last December that led to the demise of the industry. Some 3,700 beet growers, mainly in the Mallow area, believe the issue was badly handled by the Government. Greencore seems more obsessed with its own shareholders than concerned with the soon to be redundant workforce. I hope to receive an explanation for the sake of the workers but given the way the matter has been handled to date I expect more evasion.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	408	The political agreement on reform of the EU sugar regime reached by the Council of Agriculture Ministers in November 2005 was the culmination of protracted and difficult negotiations. For some time past there was general acceptance that reform of the EU sugar regime, which had remained largely unchanged for almost 40 years, was inevitable. It became acutely urgent last year due mainly to international pressures arising from the WTO panel finding on the complaint from Brazil, Thailand and Australia on subsidised sugar exports, as well as obligations under the everything but arms, EBA, agreement. To comply with these obligations, the EU had no option but to curb production substantially.Impact studies by the EU Commission had shown that in four member states, Italy, Greece, Portugal and Ireland, sugar production was likely to be drastically reduced or phased out as a consequence of reform. However, most member states are affected in varying degrees and already factory closures have been announced in 11 member states and more are expected.Throughout the negotiations my primary objective was to seek to have the Commission's reform proposals modified to ensure the continuation of an efficient sugar processing sector in Ireland. I had several meetings with the Commissioner in that regard and Ireland played an active role in a group of 11 member states who had common cause in seeking to modify the proposals. The group remained steadfast in its opposition to the reform proposals from the time they were first mooted in July 2004 right up to the final Council meeting in November 2005. During the course of the negotiations I also engaged regularly with Irish stakeholders and had full support for my negotiating stance.When it became evident at the final Council meeting that there was not sufficient political support to adapt the proposals to the extent necessary, I focused my efforts on securing the best possible compensation package for Irish stakeholders. I also succeeded in having the reform arrangements phased in in a manner that opened up the possibility of sugar processing being continued in Ireland for a further two campaigns. Unfortunately, the recent deterioration in the sugar market was the decisive factor for Greencore and on 15 March the company announced its decision to cease sugar production. I learnt of the company's decision the same day.The success of my negotiating strategy in these difficult negotiations was reflected in the final compensation package worth over €310 million,which was higher than the most optimistic expectations. There are three elements to the package, including compensation to beet growers of up to 64% of the reduction in the minimum price for beet. This compensation will be incorporated in the existing single payment scheme and is worth approximately €123 million to Irish beet growers over the next seven years.Compensation by way of a restructuring fund covering the economic, social and environmental costs of restructuring of the sugar industry involves factory closure and renunciation of quota. In Ireland's case this will be worth up to €145 million. The fund is subject to the submission of a detailed restructuring plan for the industry following consultations between the processor and the beet growers. The reform agreement provides that at least 10% of the restructuring fund shall be reserved for sugar beet growers and machinery contractors. That proportion may be increased by member states after consultation with interested parties provided that an economically sound balance between the elements of the restructuring plan is secured.The reform agreement provides for the introduction of aid for diversification measures where sugar beet production completely ceases. This aid, worth almost €44 million to Irish growers, would be drawn down in the framework of a national restructuring programme to be elaborated when the Commission's implementing regulation has been adopted.The decision taken by Greencore marks the end of an era and is obviously difficult for everyone concerned including workers, beet growers and all those who have depended on the sector in one way or another over the years. The compensation arrangements will be finalised when the Commission's implementing regulations are adopted in the coming months and I will endeavour to ensure that they are implemented in a fair and equitable manner in accordance with the regulations.

Not every primary school has a tricolour and I urge Deputy Hanafin to present each national school with a flag. Fianna Fáil's founder and Ireland's former Taoiseach and President, Mr. Éamon de Valera, gave the tricolour constitutional status in 1937 but the flag's history stretches back to the 1916 Rising, when it was flown from the General Post Office in Dublin, and before. Although the flag was not the actual flag of the 1916 Rising, which was a green flag with a harp and the words "Irish Republic", the tricolour became the emblem of Irish nationalism and, later, our official flag. The 90th anniversary of the 1916 Rising is a unique opportunity to give each of our primary schools a tricolour to celebrate our shared history and the achievement of our forefathers.The tricolour is a deeply symbolic flag. Its colours capture our nation's past and the prospect of a lasting peace forged by the Good Friday Agreement. Our younger generation should be constantly reminded of Ireland's national identity and take pride in our history. As convener of the Joint Committee on Education and Science I believe civic education should be a staple of the primary school curriculum where children can learn how politics and people have shaped our country. I ask the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, to present a tricolour and flagpole to each principal so that it can fly above primary schools countrywide.The Irish tricolour is intended to symbolise the inclusion and hopeful union of the people of different traditions on the island of Ireland. It was flown during the 1916 Rising and, capturing the national imagination as the banner of the new revolutionary Ireland, the tricolour came to be acclaimed throughout the country as the national flag. It continued to be used officially during the period 1923 to 1937 when its position as national flag was formally confirmed by our new Constitution, Article 7 of which states: "The national flag is the tricolour of green, white and orange."The national flag is flown on St. Patrick's Day, our national holiday, on Easter Sunday and Monday in commemoration of the 1916 Rising and the national day of commemoration on the Sunday closest to 11 July. It would give an opportunity for school children to learn about the history of the flag, the guidelines for its use, its design, significance and the display placing and precedents of the flag, hoisting and lowering the flag, saluting and learning to respect it and to learn about the special occasions on which the national flag is flown. A booklet on the national flag should be sent to each national school and it should be included in the curriculum. The European flag, a blue flag with gold stars, was given to each national school in Ireland, so why not our own national flag?It is important to honour and have respect for the flag. As Irish people it is part of our identity, and is our symbol and our national flag. We should teach school children about it. It is more important than ever with peace in Northern Ireland. As a former teacher I believe it would be great to have the flag in all schools. The Irish flag is a symbol of our nation and instils pride in our people. Every Irish person's heart swelled with pride when the Irish flag was raised at the last Olympics.Our children need to learn its history and the meaning of its three colours — green, white and orange. As schools are now multicultural it is even more important that Irish people learn about their own flag. We must retain our Irishness as well as embracing other cultures. Symbols form an important part of learning and are particularly relevant for young children. Children need to know their history and one's national flag is part of this history. Knowledge is power and informed children can inform others about their flag whereas uninformed children cannot. Schools are State buildings and if they had the flag they could raise it or fly it at half mast to show solidarity with the rest of the country in times of joy as well as times of sadness or national disaster. While the 1916 commemoration takes place in Dublin, every parish, if its school had the flag, could take part in the ceremony by having the flag at its school on that day. It would help to add a local element to the national commemoration ceremony.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	410	Ar son an Aire Oideachais agus Eolaíochta, tá mé buíoch as seans cur in iúl don Teach cad atá á dhéanamh ag an Rialtas agus go mórmhór ag an Roinn Oideachais agus Eolaíochta faoi Cháisc i mbliana.It is the Government's intention to mark, in the most inclusive manner possible, both the achievements and deep wounds associated with our transition to political independence. We will honour the 1916 leaders and in particular the seven signatories of the Proclamation of Independence, a visionary document which became the charter for Irish freedom. We should and will also honour both the statesmen who founded the Free State, as well as those who stood by the Republic, recognising that they were all patriots, who shared the same ultimate objective of full national freedom by one route or the other. We will also recall the suffering and loss of that time and emphasise the imperative of building a just and peaceful future for everyone on this island.A number of events to commemorate the 90th anniversary of the 1916 Rising are planned. One of these is the restoration of the military parade at the GPO by Óglaigh na hÉireann, the Defence Forces, which has been in abeyance since the early 1970s. The parade will reflect the evolved role of the Defence Forces and include significant representation of their peacekeeping service abroad with the United Nations.The military parade is just one part of this year's commemorations. A number of other events for Easter week and throughout the year are being planned. On the education side, one of the initiatives will include a special supplement for schools in The Irish Times, including a map of the 1916 locations around Dublin sponsored by the Department of Education and Science. The Department also operates an annual Easter week 1916 commemoration scholarship scheme. The Easter week scholarships reward students for their exceptional performance in the leaving certificate examination and provides support to these students to continue their studies in higher education and in so doing to develop their potential and embrace their talent. These are highly prestigious and coveted awards, each of which is given in the name of one of the signatories of the 1916 Proclamation of Independence. The emphasis in the Department of Education and Science’s plans to commemorate the Rising will be on providing educational material to schools and encouraging debate and reflection on the events of Easter week on that period of our history. There are no plans to provide a tricolour or flagpole to all schools, rather the focus will be on sending out educational materials.On educational initiatives by other State bodies, the Deputy may be interested to know that the National Museum will hold a special exhibition. The National Library is also preparing interactive web resources of various aspects of the Rising including a display of its extensive range of photos from 1916. I would like to stress, as the Taoiseach has on several occasions, that in our reflections on 1916 we will be sensitive also to other traditions that share this island. We want the 90th anniversary of the Rising to be seen in a broad and inclusive context. The Taoiseach has said that he believes the only way to build a shared future is by understanding our shared past, not just the past of political leaders but of the ordinary men and women who shaped this island. To that end, commemorating 1916 is not intended to bolster a particular reading of history, but rather to advance a greater understanding of the period as a whole.In 1966, the then Taoiseach, Mr. Seán Lemass, spoke of the contribution and highly motivated purpose of so many heroic young Irish people who gave their lives in the First World War. We cannot ignore that essential part of our history. We must be conscious of the trauma caused by the Great War throughout the length and breadth of this island. In July 2006, we will commemorate the Irish who fell at the Somme 90 years ago. Five thousand men of the 36th Ulster Division fell in the first two days of the battle in July 1916. They fought alongside 200,000 Irishmen from every county and their bravery was no less than that shown by the insurgents of Easter Week.The loss to war of Irish people, whether they are Catholic, Protestant, Nationalist or Unionist, or whether they are lost on the streets of Dublin or the fields of Flanders, is a tragedy for us all. There are no hierarchies of sacrifice, suffering or loss, only grieving families and lost potential. We will be mindful of this and of the need to be inclusive when we commemorate both the Easter Rising and the Battle of the Somme this year.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	411	I thank the office of the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me raise this issue and the Minister for attending to respond.Yesterday, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, visited Youghal in Cork. I am not sure if the Minister for Agriculture and Food has ever been there but, if she has, she will know it is a lovely town. Unfortunately, as with her own county, it has been devastated in recent times by the loss of traditional manufacturing employment, so much so that it has been designated under the RAPID programme. I will not elaborate on what this means as I am sure the Minister knows the town has disadvantaged status. As such, it should be afforded special recognition under many programmes.To this end, it is puzzling why one of the largest primary schools in the town has not been given special status under the DEIS initiative variables. Bunscoil Mhuire, O'Brien's Place, has 462 pupils. Of these, 127, or more than a quarter, are from families in which the main income earner is unemployed. One hundred and fifty-three live with families with medical cards, 141 live in local authority accommodation, 159 live with lone-parent families, and the parent or guardian of at least 102 left school before taking the junior, intermediate or group certificate examination or their equivalent. Under the variables of the DEIS programme, the school scores very highly.I ask that the review of the application be considered very seriously. When the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment visited Youghal yesterday, reference was made to the high level of unemployment in the town. The Minister for Agriculture and Food will know that one way out of unemployment and poverty is education. The town is outside the area to which the NEPS applies. The service stops within six or seven miles of the town and this is another reason the school is disadvantaged.I am a little concerned because I understand the review will take quite a number of months and it may be next May or June, during the holidays, when the results are made known. If the answer is "No", it will be very difficult for those involved and there may be no means of appeal. I ask the Department to consider this matter seriously. It is very important for the future of the 462 pupils in the school.Class sizes in the school are quite high, ranging from a maximum of 34 to 24. Most of the classes have numbers of pupils in the high 20s or 30s. When one considers the difficulties that exist and the lack of supports and services in the school, one will realise the pressures the teachers are under and the problems that will be generated for the future. Now is the time to put in place services and supports to prevent these problems and help the students achieve their potential.I ask the Department, through the Minister, to do everything possible, as soon as possible, to make the necessary resources available under what I believe is quite a good programme, the DEIS programme.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	412	I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the House on developments regarding Bunscoil Mhuire. The school support programme under DEIS, the new action plan for educational inclusion, will bring together and build upon a number of existing interventions in schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage. The new action plan is being introduced on a phased basis, starting during the current school year. It will involve an additional annual investment of €40 million on full implementation. In addition, supports will continue to be provided for schools where the level of disadvantage is more dispersed.As one may already be aware, the process of identifying primary and second level schools for participation in the new school support programme has now been completed. This process was managed by the Educational Research Centre on behalf of the Department of Education and Science and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department's regional offices and the inspectorate. In the primary sector, the identification process was based on a survey of all mainstream primary schools. An excellent response rate of more than 97% was achieved from this survey.As a result of the identification process, 840 schools have been invited to participate in the new school support programme. These comprise 640 primary schools — 320 urban/town schools and 320 rural schools — and 200 second level schools. Letters of invitation were issued to all 840 schools in late February with a request to complete and return an acceptance form by 10 March 2006.The school to which the Deputy refers is not among the primary schools selected for participation in the school support programme and is not participating in any of the pre-existing schemes for addressing concentrated disadvantage. However, in addition to the provision being made under the new school support programme for schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage, financial support will also continue to be provided for other primary schools where the level of disadvantage is most dispersed. This support will be based on the results of the new identification process and the arrangements which will apply in this regard will be notified to schools early in the autumn.A review mechanism has been put in place to address the concerns of schools that did not qualify for inclusion in the school support programme but regard themselves as having a level of disadvantage of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the programme. This mechanism will operate under the direction of an independent person, charged with ensuring that all relevant identification processes and procedures are properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review. The school to which the Deputy refers has requested a review and a review form was issued to the school on 6 March 2006. The closing date for receipt of review applications is Friday, 31 March 2006. I hope this clarifies the position on the school to which the Deputy referred.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	413	I propose to take Questions Nos. 43, 59, 74, 88, 115 and 119 together.During the period 28 February 2006 to 2 March 2006 I took the opportunity to pay a short visit to Liberia where I met the Irish personnel of 94th infantry battalion, United Nations Mission in Liberia, UNMIL. The primary purpose of my visit was to see at first hand the work of the Defence Forces personnel serving with UNMIL and to convey to them, on behalf of the Government and the people, the deep appreciation felt regarding the outstanding manner in which they perform their duties in this challenging mission. On my visit, I was accompanied by the Secretary General of the Department, the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces and Ireland's ambassador to Nigeria, who is accredited to Liberia.During the course of my visit, I also met the newly elected President of Liberia, EllenJohnson-Sirleaf, and the UN Special Representative of the Secretary General, SRSG, AlanDoss. I also paid a courtesy call to the DeputyForce Commander UNMIL, Major GeneralMuhammad Tahir.Sadly, Ireland's first contingent to UNMIL suffered one fatality, Sergeant Derek Mooney, who died in a motor accident in Liberia in November 2003. During the course of my visit to Camp Clara, I laid a wreath at the UN memorial for Irish troops killed in peacekeeping action. A number of humanitarian projects are currently being assisted by the Irish battalion with funding from Irish Aid. While in Liberia I visited St. Michael's Hospice, which is one of the projects being supported.During my meeting with President Johnson-Sirleaf, who was accompanied by her Minister for Foreign Affairs, George Wallace, and her special security adviser, the President expressed her gratitude to the Irish Government for the Defence Forces contribution to peace in Liberia and the vital role played by them in maintaining the peace, which she stated has been exceptional. She said that while the UN had brought peace to Liberia, the danger of violence has not gone away. She hoped that Ireland would continue its strong support for Liberia to ensure stability and encourage economic growth. In this regard, the President raised the question of extending the stay of the Irish contingent into 2007. I informed her that the Irish Government has extended the contingent's stay until the end of this year. However, I indicated that if security matters changed dramatically, the Government might look at the situation again.Special Representative Doss thanked the Government for the vital assistance provided by the Irish personnel serving with UNMIL and also raised the question of extending the stay of the Irish contingent into 2007. In his recent report on the UNMIL mission to the UN Security Council, the UN Secretary General, Kofu Annan, has recommended that, following an initial reduction in force levels by one infantry battalion in mid-2006 and another in early 2007, a downsizing of the mission begin in early 2007, subject to the political and security situation in Liberia at that time.From the outset the Government has signalled its intention that Defence Forces involvement in UNMIL would not exceed two to three years in duration and the United Nations has been advised accordingly. We have reiterated and confirmed the position regarding our withdrawal to the UN on many occasions since then. The Irish commitment to UNMIL is until November 2006, when we are due to withdraw from the mission together with our Swedish partners. It is intended to commence downsizing in June 2006.In a letter to the Taoiseach on 3 March 2006, the UN Secretary General has requested Ireland to consider postponing the withdrawal of its troops from UNMIL for a period of at least six months in order to give the UN time to find a suitable replacement for the quick reaction force, QRF, capability. This request is currently under consideration. The UN has made a similar request to the Swedish authorities.For the moment our clear focus is on withdrawal towards the end of this year. However, if the situation in Liberia deteriorated significantly later this year, we would obviously look again at the situation. We would not abandon the mission. Our current assessment is that the situation, while continuing to be fragile, is stable and progressing positively and the remaining forces should be well capable of handling the ongoing security situation.That said, I assure Deputies that Ireland remains committed to peace support operations in Africa under a UN flag. We will obviously consider the request of the UN Secretary General in detail. It may be the case that further consultations with the UN could help elaborate the specific issues which are concerning the Secretary General and that we could consider the matter further in that context.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	414	I propose to take Questions Nos. 44, 62, 70 and 96 together.On 28 October 2005, I appointed Mr. Sean Hurley to carry out an independent review of the interaction between the Department of Defence-Defence Forces and parents and family of Private Kevin Barrett in the aftermath of his tragic death on 18 February 1999 while serving with the 84th infantry battalion in Lebanon.I received Mr. Hurley's report on 2 February 2006. Mr. Hurley has conducted a very thorough inquiry and has provided a detailed and frank report. It is clear and concise and covers the issues raised with me by Private Barrett's family. Mr. Hurley has looked in detail at how the Department and the Defence Forces interacted with the Barrett family after Kevin's death and has identified some clear failings and shortcomings. Important lessons have been learned for the future and errors that have occurred in the handling of this tragic case, outlined by Mr. Hurley, must never be repeated. Mr. Hurley acknowledges that some of these have since been addressed in the new guidelines for dealing with bereaved families introduced by the Defence Forces in 2001.Since the publication of Mr. Hurley's report, the recommendations and conclusions in relation to procedural and operational issues have been considered by the Defence Forces to see how they might best be implemented. The military authorities have undertaken a review of the guidelines for dealing with bereaved families in the light of Mr. Hurley's recommendations. I am advised that while there is no proposal to further amend the current arrangements, which were introduced in 2001 following a comprehensive review, the guidelines are being kept under continuous review.In addition, Defence Forces standard operating procedures in relation to the investigation, reporting and handling of such incidents are also being reviewed to take account of the various other recommendations in the report and any changes deemed necessary will be incorporated into Defence Forces administrative instructions and directives. Finally, the role of the attending medical officer in relation to the conduct of autopsies conducted outside the jurisdiction is also being reviewed to see how this might be implemented, having regard to the fact that the medical officer may have no standing in the foreign jurisdiction.Separate from these issues, on receipt of Mr. Hurley's report, I contacted the Garda Commissioner and asked him to provide me with his early views in relation to any possible assistance that the Garda Síochána might be in a position to provide. A Garda officer has since been assigned to the case and is currently examining my Department's and the Defence Forces files in the case with a view to determining whether the gardaí can provide any assistance in the matter. Liaison arrangements have been set up between the gardaí and the Defence Forces.On 8 March 2006, my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Defence, Deputy Kitt, at my request, met the parents of the late Private Barrett. This meeting had been arranged with the family after they had sufficient time to consider Mr. Hurley's report and to outline to them the actions I had taken to date. The Minister of State took the opportunity to personally thank the parents and family, on my behalf and on his own behalf, for their patience and co-operation in the preparation of the review. The Minister of State repeated my apology to the Barrett family for the pain and suffering they endured following Kevin's tragic death. He updated the parents on the status of my request to the Garda Commissioner. He promised that my Department would co-operate fully with the gardaí and facilitate them in whatever way it could in their examination. It was agreed that a further meeting would be held with the family when I have further information. In the meantime, the family will be kept informed of any developments.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	415	I propose to take Questions Nos. 45, 65 and 113 together.The White Paper on Defence outlines the blue print for a new Reserve Defence Force. An implementation plan has been developed that will ensure the realisation of the White Paper vision. This will be rolled out over the period to end 2009. The new reserve will have a clearly defined role, an enhanced relationship with the PDF, better equipment and training and opportunities to serve on overseas peace support missions.The reserve has already seen significant improvements in terms of clothing, equipment, training and resourcing. It is now organised along similar lines to the PDF and the introduction of the integrated element of the reserve is currently being addressed. All of these changes will enhance the capabilities of the reserve as well as improving interoperability with the PDF. These factors are significant enablers in facilitating any future participation by reserve personnel in overseas missions.While there are no immediate plans for participation by members of the reserve in overseas missions, policies to support the selection of suitably qualified personnel for overseas duties will be developed over the lifetime of the implementation plan, that is, over the period to end 2009. In other countries, service by reservists on overseas peace support missions is quite common, although as specified in the plan, any such participation by members of the reserve is likely to be in specialised areas such as medical, transport, engineering and communications and information services. This will also be subject to personnel having suitable qualifications, their personal availability and appropriate advance training.Development of policies to support the selection of suitably qualified reserve personnel for overseas duties will include consideration of the impact of overseas duties on the employment of reserve personnel. The question of legislation will also be considered in this context.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	416	Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel, is the principal base of the Air Corps. With the withdrawal of aircraft from Gormanston and the relocation of Air Corps headquarters to Baldonnel, the Air Corps has the basis for better management of its resources. Baldonnel will continue to be the centre of military aviation in Ireland.Periodic interest by the private sector has been expressed during the past decade or so in relation to the use of Casement Aerodrome for civil aviation purposes. No recent approaches, however, have been made to my Department in this regard. The establishment of facilities for civil aviation purposes is primarily a matter for the Minister for Transport. Under the Irish Aviation Authority Act 1993, however, aerodromes under my authority are precluded from regulation by the Irish Aviation Authority. Only the regulation of military aviation activities at military aerodromes comes within my remit.Before any consideration could be given to having commercial aviation at Baldonnel, it would be necessary to bring Casement Aerodrome within the licensing and regulatory control of the Irish Aviation Authority, which would require an amendment to section 3 of the Irish Aviation Authority Act 1993. This is a matter for consideration in the first instance by the Minister for Transport.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	417	The individual soldier is now required to carry an array of equipment on operational duties. In that regard, one of the essential ongoing equipment acquisition projects relates to the provision of a modern integrated protection and load carrying system for members of the Defence Forces on operational duties. This involves,  inter alia, the personal protective equipment consisting of body armour and helmet.The requirement for new helmets and body armour was driven by the need to provide members of the Defence Forces with the best available protection conducive to their operational deployments both at home and overseas. The critical factors in determining such a requirement were that new helmets and body armour must provide a significant improvement in protection and comfort over the old helmet and body armour, be compatible for operational deployments and, where possible, make savings in weight without compromising protection.In that regard, a tender competition was held in 2005 for the provision of body armour for the individual soldier. An order has now been placed for 6,000 units for delivery this year. The new body armour provides significantly greater protection, comfort and coverage than the old model as well as a doubling of the range of sizes available. In addition, a separate tender competition for helmets was also held in 2005 for the acquisition of 12,000 helmets. An order has now been placed for the helmets, which will also be delivered this year. The new helmet was selected after an extensive evaluation process. This helmet provides a significant increase in protection, comfort and coverage over the previous model.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	418	I propose to take Questions Nos. 48, 64, 83 and 100 together.Following on from a request from the UN, the EU is currently examining the question of providing a supporting operation, under an EU flag, for MONUC, the UN Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Various options for the mission are currently being considered within the EU, which has indicated that it is positively disposed towards supporting MONUC. Fact-finding missions to the DRC and also to the UN in New York have been undertaken.The main purpose of the mission is to be available to support MONUC during the upcoming election process. The EU will not be substituting for MONUC but rather providing a supporting role in the event of unrest during the election period. The current plan is that a protection force — possibly up to 400 — will be located on the ground, probably in Kinshasa. Outside of this, there will be an Over the Horizon force, either in Europe or possibly in a neighbouring state, ready to deploy, should it be required. Total numbers could be around 1,500. Germany will provide the operational headquarters for the mission which will be based in Potsdam. The force headquarters, which will be supplied by France, will be based in Kinshasa. Together Germany and France will provide approximately two thirds of the force. The mission is currently in the initial planning stages. The specific structure, organisation, tasks and roles of the force and the contributors to it have yet to be fully elaborated. This should happen over the next few weeks.Ireland is positively disposed towards the proposed mission and supports a positive response from the EU to the UN. In this regard, Ireland wrote to the chairman of the EU military staff confirming that Ireland was prepared to offer up to ten headquarters personnel for the mission subject to national decision making procedures. Our proposed contribution is well in line with that of other contributing member states and has to be looked at in the context of our existing major commitments to peacekeeping operations in Africa and in the Balkans.I assure the Deputy that any contribution will satisfy the requirements of the Defence Acts in relation to participation. Discussions are ongoing in the UN in relation to an appropriate mandate for the mission. As the proposed offer involves fewer than ten troops, Dáil approval is not required in this instance. I cannot state specifically when the UN Security Council resolution will be passed or when Government decision will be made at this time. However, I would expect this to be in the next few weeks, given that the elections in the DRC are due in June. I also understand that Germany, which will lead the force, expects to deploy at the end of May or the beginning of June.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	419	The number of applications received for general service enlistment to the Permanent Defence Force in 2004 and 2005 was 1,943 and 1,125, respectively. A total of 579 general service recruits enlisted in the Permanent Defence Force in 2004 and a further 384 recruits enlisted in 2005.The number of applications received for cadetships in 2004 and 2005 was 916 and 1,004, respectively. In 2004 a total of 67 cadets were enlisted of which two cadets were Naval Service cadets from the 2003 cadet competition who transferred from the Naval Service to the Army cadet class of 2004. From the 2005 cadetship competition 55 cadets were enlisted.It is my intention to maintain the established Government policy of ongoing recruitment to the Defence Forces. Recruitment into the Permanent Defence Force will continue to maintain the strength at a level required to meet military needs an as set out in the White Paper, that is, 10,500 Permanent Defence Force all ranks.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	420	I propose to take Questions Nos. 50, 57, 92, 97, 103, 107, 512 and 521 together.Ireland is currently contributing approximately 764 Defence Forces personnel to 19 different missions throughout the world. Full details of all personnel currently serving overseas are listed in the following tabular statement.The main commitments are to the United Nations Mission in Liberia, UNMIL, with 427 personnel, to the NATO-led international security presence, KFOR, in Kosovo, with 211 personnel and to EUFOR, the EU-led operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with 57 personnel. Other personnel are serving as monitors and observers with the United Nations, the European Union and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE. Staff are also deployed at the organisational headquarters of the UN, the EU and NATO.Ireland has participated in UNMIL since December 2003. Ireland, together with an infantry company group from Sweden, provides the quick reaction force, QRF, to the UNMIL force commander. The Irish contingent currently comprises 427 personnel. The QRF acts as the rapid response element within UNMIL, responding to any crises that arise within the area of operations and supporting deployed contingents through long range patrols into the countryside. While it has been a difficult mission, particularly in terms of the operating environment, it is working very well for the Defence Forces.In September 2005 the mandate for UNMIL was expanded to include responsibility for the security of the special court for Sierra Leone in Freetown. Ireland and Sweden agreed to expand the area of operations of QRF from 1 December 2005, thus allowing Irish and Swedish troops to be made available for extraction operations should there be a requirement to evacuate the staff and detainees from the special court.On 11 November 2005, the UN Security Council further extended UNMIL's mandate to include the apprehension, detention and transfer to the special court for Sierra Leone of the former Liberian President, Charles Taylor, in the event of his return to Liberia.In his recent report on the UNMIL mission to the UN Security Council, the UN Secretary General has recommended that, following an initial reduction in force levels by one infantry battalion in mid-2006 and another in early 2007, a downsizing of the mission begin in early 2007, depending on the political and security situation in Liberia at that time. The Irish commitment to UNMIL is until November 2006 when we are due to withdraw from the mission together with our Swedish partners. It is intended to commence downsizing in June 2006. The UN has been advised accordingly.The Irish infantry group in KFOR operates as part of a multinational grouping, within the Czech-led multi-national task force — centre. It comprises a Mowag APC mounted company together with support and logistic elements. The main tasks of the Irish infantry group include the following; provision of general security to all ethnic groups, institutions and cultural sites; provision of support to UNMIK police and other agencies with security tasks; identification of and reporting on extremist groups and activities; vehicle and foot patrols; vehicle checkpoints and operation of observation posts.The role of the Defence Forces personnel serving in EUFOR within the task force — north — is to provide personnel for the headquarters, the military police unit, verification teams and a national support element. Ireland currently acts as the framework nation for the military police unit and verification teams.Seven members of the Permanent Defence Force are serving with the international security assistance force, ISAF, in Afghanistan. Three of these personnel hold appointments at the force headquarters in Kabul. The remaining four personnel are based at the multi-national brigade headquarters in Kabul, where they serve as members of liaison teams with the Afghan national directorate of security.Ireland's commitment under the United Nations stand-by arrangements system, UNSAS, is 850, which represents 10% of the total Army strength. This is the figure set in the White Paper on Defence and is the maximum sustainable commitment that Ireland can make to overseas operations. There are no plans at this time to increase the level of our commitment to UNSAS and any contribution to EU or UN missions will be met within the context of the 850 ceiling.Ireland receives requests from time to time in relation to participation in various missions and these are considered on a case-by-case basis. To date in 2006, no such requests have been received from the United Nations. In reply to an earlier question, I informed the House that last week Ireland indicated that it would make available up to ten Defence Forces personnel for the headquarters of a supporting operation, under a EU flag, for MONUC, the UN Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the planning for which mission is currently in the initial stages.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	421	The role of the Defence Forces is set out in the White Paper on Defence. The Naval Service provides the maritime element of the Defence Forces and has a general responsibility to meet contingent and actual maritime defence requirements. Arising from the White Paper, the primary role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the EU. Fishery protection accounts for over 90% of operations.There are no plans to expand the role of the Naval Service or for the involvement of Naval Service assets in overseas missions, although individual members of the Naval Service may be deployed on overseas peace support operations, as they have been in the past, within the ceiling of 850 personnel serving overseas at any one time.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	422	I propose to take Questions Nos. 52, 55, 111 and 121 together.The Government task force on emergency planning has worked since it was set up in 2001 to co-ordinate emergency planning and response arrangements across those Departments that lead and support the State's response in an emergency. The task force met on eight occasions in 2005 and on two occasions to date this year. The task force met most recently on Thursday, 9 March 2006.The interdepartmental working group on emergency planning supports the work of the task force. The working group is a forum for developing strategic guidance for all those involved in emergency planning and for sharing information on emergency planning. The interdepartmental working group met on seven occasions in 2005 and on two occasions to date this year, most recently on Wednesday, 1 March 2006.The most recent meetings of the task force and the interdepartmental working group were specifically convened to provide the various Department representatives with updated briefings from the Department of Agriculture and Food with regard to avian flu and from the Department of Health and Children with regard to a possible human influenza pandemic.The Department of Agriculture and Food is represented on both the task force and the interdepartmental working group and has provided regular briefings on avian flu developments at these meetings over the past number of months. The situation with regard to avian flu will continue to be monitored and reviewed by that Department in close co-operation with the Department of Health and Children.My colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, has introduced a range of measures aimed at minimising the risk of the virus being introduced to Ireland. The Minister and her Department are keeping their contingency arrangements under constant review and refining them as necessary. Her Department's approach is being informed by the most up to date scientific and veterinary advice available and the Minister appointed an expert advisory group to advise her as to the adequacy of the control measures in place.The task force and interdepartmental working group meetings this month were also briefed by the Department of Health and Children representatives in relation to the preparations and plans which are being put in place to deal with any possible human influenza pandemic. My colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, who has lead responsibility in this area, is addressing the various issues that may arise if such a situation occurs.Avian flu or H5N1 is primarily a disease of birds. To date, there have been a very small number of human cases of H5N1 infection documented, in situations where there has been very close contact with infected birds. There is no evidence of human-to-human transmission.A detailed plan for response to an influenza pandemic was prepared in 2004. This plan is currently being refined to reflect the most up to date advice of the influenza pandemic expert group and the World Health Organisation.An inter-departmental standing committee chaired by the Department of Health and Children also met on the 27 February. This committee will support the Department of Health and Children in planning for and responding to a public health emergency focusing initially on pandemic flu planning. Both the task force and the inter-departmental working group will continue to be briefed and updated on these matters and related emergency planning issues on a regular and ongoing basis.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	423	I propose to take Questions Nos. 53, 89, 110 and 507 together.The European Defence Agency, EDA, steering board met in Defence Ministers formation in Innsbruck, Austria, on 7 March 2006 and one of the items discussed was the need for a new mechanism for joint investment in research and technology projects. The EDA is proposing to establish a category A or opt-out programme, with an associated budget. The first area of joint work being considered is force protection, which is the detection and neutralisation of a range of threats to military personnel, vehicles and installations in the context of ESDP missions.The agenda item was premised on the view that category A or opt-out programmes would enable more member states to contribute to the overall research and technology effort; would allow each member state to take its own decision on whether to contribute to such a programme; and would leave control firmly in the hands of those member states which choose to contribute.While discussions took place at the meeting on the outline concept of such a programme, significant further elaboration and refinement is required before decisions can be taken, probably at the next steering board meeting in May. Participation in any EDA programme is a matter for each member state on a case by case basis and the EDA does not have the authority to force states to contribute to, or to participate in, any particular programme.The main focus of the EDA is on obtaining better value for existing spending levels and securing improvements and greater efficiency, particularly in the area of research, technology, manufacturing and procurement. Ireland has advocated that the EU should prioritise the development of qualitative aspects of capability development. I am aware that this view, and a recognition of the need for greater efficiency and effectiveness in defence expenditure, is shared by many of my ministerial colleagues at EU level, at a time when the majority of member states, including Ireland, have no plans to increase their defence spending.The EDA is an important forum through which the EU can seek to improve competitiveness and efficiency in the defence equipment sector, which has been notable for fragmentation and duplication. While Ireland is not a major consumer of defence equipment in relative terms, we should encourage developments which improve market efficiencies or which may yield some economies of scale for equipment procurement for the Defence Forces.At the steering board meeting Ministers also received a progress report from the chief executive of the EDA dealing with capabilities, research and technology, long-term vision and the code of conduct on defence procurement.

The report has been referred to the Garda Síochána for its consideration.The sum of €66,213 was received by my Department on 27 March in respect of amounts improperly claimed by the unit in question under the arrangements whereby units of the Reserve are reimbursed by the Department for the cost of meals provided to reservists in civilian establishments during attendance at field days, etc.

In this connection, I would particularly mention the introduction of the DPM dress package and the service dress package. The term "package" refers to the provision of a full outfit of matching clothing for the individual soldier. The introduction of these new uniforms have proved both economical and practical and has been an asset to the Defence Forces in their many operations.

Preparations for the parade, as announced by the Taoiseach last October, are being made by the Defence Forces. Approximately 2,500 personnel representing all branches of the forces together with representatives of ex-service personnel and veterans of UN service will be included. The parade will also include members of the Garda Síochána, representing their service abroad with the United Nations. A fly past by the Air Corps is also envisaged.There are a total of 60 military vehicles scheduled to participate in the parade. The vehicles selected are drawn from all corps and formations and are representative of the equipment currently in use in the Defence Forces. The Defence Forces record of service with the United Nations will be marked by the carrying of flags of all nations in which Defence Force Personnel have served on UN duty. The unit colours of all military units of the Defence Forces which deployed overseas will also be carried. A representative group of approximately 150 personnel from the Irish United Nations Veterans Association will march in the parade.It is not envisaged that volunteers from Civil Defence will take part in this year's parade which is primarily focused on the Defence Forces, ex-servicemen, United Nations veterans and members of the police in recognition of their service abroad. However, consideration will be given to participation by Civil Defence in the centenary celebrations in 2016.The parade will depart from Dublin Castle, passing through Dame Street, College Green and O'Connell Street. There will be a reading of the Proclamation outside the GPO and appropriate military honours will be rendered. The event will be televised live and it will be possible to view the parade along the route from Dublin Castle to O'Connell Street. This 90th anniversary of the Rising will also be marked by a wreath laying ceremony in Kilmainham Gaol earlier that morning and by a Government reception at Dublin Castle that evening.Officials of my Department and officers of the Defence Forces are represented on an inter-departmental working group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, which is overseeing all the logistical arrangements for the parade and associated events. This group meets regularly and includes, inter alia, representatives from the Garda Síochána, Dublin City Council, the fire services, and the Office of Public Works. As the Deputies will appreciate many logistical issues such as the parade route, road closures, health and safety regulations, publicity, etc., have to be addressed as well as the security arrangements for the event and this group is dealing with these issues.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	428	I propose to take Questions Nos. 61, 68, 71, 85, 86, 91, 117, 118, 520 and 523 together.The ambition of the EU to be able to respond rapidly to emerging crises has, and continues to be, a key objective of the development of the European Security and Defence Policy, ESDP. The tasks to be carried out under ESDP, the so-called Petersberg Tasks, are defined in the Amsterdam treaty as "humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping tasks and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peacemaking". Our participation in ESDP and in the Petersberg Tasks has been endorsed and supported directly by the people in the referendum on the Treaty on European Union, TEU, and the subsequent referenda on the Amsterdam and Nice treaties. Our participation in ESDP is also fully in accordance with our traditional support for the UN and our obligations as members of the international community, to respond to crises, events and humanitarian disasters, wherever they may occur.The European Union has the potential to play an increasing role in responding to emergency crises, in providing humanitarian relief and in supporting the maintenance of international peace and security in furtherance of the aims of the United Nations and the UN charter. Accepting this role is not just an EU ambition, it is an EU obligation and an obligation for Ireland as a member of both the EU and of the UN.Ireland favours the development of the EU's rapid response capability in support of UN authorised missions and is positively disposed towards participation in battlegroups in this regard. To this end, I established the interdepartmental group to examine all issues relating to Ireland's potential participation in an EU-led rapid response capability. The group reported in November 2005 and, since then, its report has been considered by the Cabinet sub-committee on European affairs and, informally, by the Government.Following on from the report of the interdepartmental group and consideration of its report, discussions with other like-minded nations on a potential contribution by Ireland to a battlegroup have now commenced. A delegation consisting of representatives from the Departments of Defence and Foreign Affairs and the Defence Forces met their Swedish counterparts in Stockholm on 9 to 10 March to discuss possible participation by the Defence Forces in the Nordic battlegroup. Our representatives outlined Ireland's position in relation to battlegroup participation and international peacekeeping generally and gave a presentation on the capabilities which Ireland can make available to a battlegroup. These range from smaller niche capabilities up to an APC mounted light infantry company group of approximately 200 personnel plus support elements.This is now being considered by Sweden, which is the framework nation for the Nordic battlegroup. Further consultations between the Defence Forces and the Swedish Armed Forces and between officials of the respective Ministries are planned. I would expect these discussions to conclude within the next few months. Any decision on a specific contribution to a battlegroup will be subject to formal Government approval. I expect that there will be ongoing discussion with other member states over the coming months, in particular, with Finland and Austria with whom we have also had some initial informal exploratory discussions. While not conclusive, the study raised possible questions as to whether Defence Forces can be sent on such overseas training. It is important to the development of capabilities and the ongoing training of the Defence Forces that they can undertake training overseas and learn from best practice in other countries. This training is essential to the development and maintenance of high standards in the military and our existing peace support operations, where we work alongside many other armies. I intend to introduce amending legislation to put this issue beyond doubt amongst a number of other issues about which I have previously informed the House.There are no plans for the involvement of Naval or Air Corps assets, although individual members of the Naval Service or Air Corps may be deployed on overseas peace support operations as they have been in the past. Any commitment to a battlegroup will be met within the context of the overall ceiling of 850 personnel serving overseas at any one time set in the White Paper on Defence.Participation by the Defence Forces in EU battlegroups raises no policy issues in terms of Ireland's commitment and approach to the maintenance of international peace and security, which is, and will remain, grounded in the framework of the UN charter. There is no conflict between Ireland's participation in regional arrangements including EU battlegroups and our traditional policy of support for the UN. Participation in any EU operation remains a national sovereign decision and our current policy on the triple lock will not be compromised by participating in battlegroups.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	429	I am advised by the military authorities that on 15 September 1961, Trooper Patrick Mullins and Corporal Michael Nolan were killed in action in the Congo when their armoured vehicle was hit by anti-tank fire from armed elements. While the remains of Corporal Nolan were recovered, those of Trooper Mullins were not. An investigation into Trooper Mullins's death by the military authorities at the time concluded on 29 January 1962, that he was killed in action at Ave Du Cuivre, Lubumbashi, Elisabethville, Katanga in the Republic of the Congo as a result of the hostile action. Trooper Mullins was posthumously awarded An Réalt Mileata, the military star.Given the remove of 45 years since the incident, it is difficult to anticipate whether a re-opening of the case would yield any information not already known. However, I will ask the military authorities to further consider the matter and provide me with a report.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	430	I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 and 90 together.I was aware of the Deputy's previous questions in this area. As previously outlined in replies to the Deputy, Defence Forces training syllabi reflect the full range of contemporary developments in international humanitarian law, human rights law and the various specific humanitarian issues that may arise in theatre specific circumstances. These high level courses are directed at the role of national armed forces in the sphere of international peacekeeping duties under the direct auspices of the United Nations or with UN — mandated multinational missions. Ireland has a well deserved and quite outstanding international reputation in this area of international peacekeeping operations.As the Deputy will be aware, countries which are NATO members participate in UN peacekeeping operations and it is in that capacity, as UN peacekeepers, current or potential, that Defence Forces training courses are provided. It is a notable tribute to the international standing of the Defence Forces, and the great esteem in which they are held abroad, that Defence Forces courses are selected for these personnel.It is also a fact that Irish military contingents with a United Nations mission must work closely on a day to day basis with all the other military contingents of those sovereign states which are participating in that UN mission. It is hardly sensible or consistent to raise political objections about our Defence Forces interacting with individual members of the armed forces of such states because they participate in a Defence Forces training course here in Ireland, particularly where course content is focused on international peacekeeping and human rights concerns.The course modules and content covering standards of international law and human rights standards and criteria are set out in common for all participants, regardless of their state of origin, as described. The Defence Forces are happy to be in a position to provide this exemplary professional training.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	431	The military has advised that the numbers of military personnel attending education courses at third level, ranging from certificate to masters degree level in 2004 included 129 commissioned personnel and 26 non-commissioned personnel. In 2005, the numbers attending such courses included 143 commissioned personnel and 44 non-commissioned personnel. The fees incurred in relation to such courses amounted to €663,188 in 2004 and to €578,130 in 2005.The number of applications received from military personnel for refunds of course fees, in respect of third level education in the individual's own time, was 35 in 2004. The figure for 2005 was 51. All applications made were granted. The level of funding available for the refunds of fees scheme for military personnel for third level courses was €70,000 in 2004 and €72,000 in 2005.In addition, a number of military personnel attend certain specialised, career specific, third level education courses, on local assignment from their home corps. However, statistics in relation to these courses are not readily available centrally. The relevant data will be collated and provided to the Deputy as soon as possible.

The arrangements for Easter Sunday to mark the ninetieth anniversary of the Easter Rising were outlined and the group discussed these. Preliminary discussions were also held in relation to the framework for the centenary programme. I envisage that the next meeting of this group will be after Easter to progress the development of the centenary programme. The group will then meet as necessary to continue this work.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	433	The Government task force on emergency planning has worked since it was set up in 2001 to co-ordinate emergency planning and response arrangements across those Departments that lead and support the State's response in an emergency. The interdepartmental working group on emergency planning supports the work of the task force. The working group is a forum for developing strategic guidance for all those involved in emergency planning and for sharing information on emergency planning.A meeting of the task force was held on Thursday, 9 March 2006 and of the interdepartmental working group met on Wednesday, 1 March 2006.Both of these meetings were specifically convened to provide the various Department representatives with updated briefings from the Department of Agriculture and Food with regard to avian flu and from the Department of Health and Children with regard to a possible human flu pandemic.The Department of Agriculture and Food is represented on both the task force and the interdepartmental working group and has been providing regular briefings on avian flu developments at these meetings over the past number of months. The situation with regard to avian flu will continue to be monitored and reviewed by that Department in close co-operation with the Department of Health and Children. The recent task force and interdepartmental working group meetings were also briefed by the Department of Health and Children representatives in relation to the preparations and plans which are being put in place to deal with any possible human influenza pandemic. My colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, who has lead responsibility in this area, is addressing the various issues that may arise if such a situation occurs.As the Deputy will be aware, it is standard practice for the Government and the Garda Síochána to be made aware of visits by heads of state and this practice was adhered to with regard to President Bush's recent stopover. Specific operational arrangements with regard to such visits would be a matter for the Garda Síochána. It is not policy to discuss specific matters of security in relation to the protection of visiting heads of state to Ireland.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	434	I propose to take Questions Nos. 78 and 101 together.An Informal meeting of EU Defence Ministers was held in Innsbruck, Austria, on 6 March 2006. At the meeting, Ministers discussed civil-military co-ordination, CMCO, which was an initiative begun under the UK Presidency to improve the management of operations involving EU civil and military elements in a manner which would support greater coherence across the range of EU instruments and actors by bringing together the different tools available to the EU in a co-ordinated manner. The Austrian Presidency prepared a paper on CMCO management of operations which set a range of questions to facilitate an exchange of views on the issue.Also discussed at the meeting were operations in Africa, in particular the proposed EU support mission to the UN MONUC operation and operations in the western Balkans. As the meeting was informal, and not a decision-making forum, no formal conclusions were drawn. A meeting of the European Defence Agency steering board followed the informal meeting.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	435	No recruits of the Army, the Air Corps or the Naval Service have been discharged from the Defence Forces on the grounds of hearing difficulties from 2000 to the present date.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	436	The military authorities advise that at present the staff strength of the military archives is three, comprising a commissioned officer, a non-commissioned officer and a private. Approval has been granted to source two additional officers. One such graduate officer has been identified and it is planned to have this individual undergo postgraduate archival studies in UCD in September 2006.The military archives is a statutory place of deposit under section 14 of the National Archives Act 1986 for the records of the Defence Forces, the Department of Defence and the Army Pensions Board. The archive holds in excess of 35,000 linear feet-boxes of records in five storage areas, four areas in Cathal Brugha Barracks, Rathmines, Dublin 6, and one area in the Defence Forces training centre at the Curragh. The records of the bureau of military history and in excess of 950 private paper collections gathered from serving and retired members of the Defence Forces, their families and friends are also held by the military archives.The function of the archive is to collect, to preserve and to make available material relating to the history of the development of the Defence Forces from the formation of the Irish Volunteers in November 1913 up to the present day, inclusive of Defence Forces overseas service with the United Nations from 1958.Members of the public may arrange access to the archives by a system of prior appointment. This is necessary due to limitations on available space. In order to make an appointment, interested members of the public should contact the officer commanding military archives, Cathal Brugha Barracks, Rathmines, Dublin 6, Telephone 01 8046457. These details are also available on the Defence Forces website at www.defenceforces.ie.The question of identifying a new suitable permanent location for the military archives, ideally within the National Museum of Ireland facility at the former Collins Barracks, Benburb Street, remains an option for the future. The matter has been considered in some detail by an inter-departmental committee in recent years. However, the location and historic nature of the Collins Barracks site raises critical issues around environmental planning, conservation considerations and realistic cost parameters.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	437	The presence on this website of a range of items for sale bearing the title "Óglaigh na hÉireann" came to the attention of my Department and the Defence Forces late last year. Section 16 of the Defence Acts 1954 to 1998 provides that: "It shall be lawful for the Government to raise train, equip, arm and maintain Defence Forces to be called and known as Óglaigh na hÉireann or (in English) the Defence Forces." Accordingly, only the Defence Forces properly established are entitled to use the nomenclature "Óglaigh na hÉireann". No permission for use of the title "Óglaigh na hÉireann" on the items featured on the website has been sought from the Department of Defence, nor could such permission be given.I first wrote to the leadership of the political party whose name appears on this website on 3 November 2005 requesting that the material in question be removed for sale from the site. I wrote again on 21 December 2005 and on 24 February last and while the first two letters have been acknowledged, I have still not received a substantive response to the issue raised.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	438	The Defence Forces have available to them equipment for monitoring and protecting their members in dealing with nuclear, biological or chemical, NBC, threats identified from time to time. They hold an extensive range of modern NBC equipment that meets their current requirements. This range includes approximately 9,500 NBC suits, of which 800 were delivered in January 2006. The suits are allocated to all brigades and the Defence Forces training centre as required for training purposes.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	439	It is customary for all contingents on United Nations service to host functions to mark their national day. Defence Forces personnel, when serving overseas have traditionally celebrated St. Patrick's Day as Ireland's national day. This year a small number of officers and pipers visited Defence Force missions in Liberia, Damascus, Brussels and Sarajevo and participated in St. Patrick's Day functions and parades hosted by the Defence Forces in those locations. The 28th infantry battalion pipe band travelled to New York at its own expense to take part in a range of events from 15 to 20 March. The Air Corps pipe band travelled to Boston and participated in events from 10 to 20 March.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	440	Copies of an explanatory leaflet, which contains a map of the Glen of Imaal and includes details of "dos and don'ts" are available at the range warden service advice centre at Seskin school and are distributed locally. Notices of intent to fire are posted in advance on notice boards at the Army information and advice centre in Seskin, the post office at Knockanarrigan and at local youth hostels. In addition, in the period prior to bank holiday weekends, advertisements are placed in newspapers warning of the dangers that may be encountered in the area. The safety of individuals visiting the Glen of Imaal is of paramount importance to the Department of Defence and the design and location of warning notices is kept under review in order to achieve that objective.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	441	There are currently 16 fitter mechanics serving with the 94th infantry battalion in the United Nations Mission in Liberia, UNMIL, of whom ten are apprentice mechanics. Fitter mechanics undergo a four-year apprenticeship involving seven phases. On-the-job experience is gained in the third, fifth and seventh phases of the course. Apprentices can volunteer to avail of on-the-job experience on overseas missions at the fifth and seventh phases only. The normal practice is to have a ratio of one fitter mechanic to every four or five apprentices.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	442	I propose to take Questions Nos. 99 and 515 together.An annual contribution of €2.86 million has been paid by the banks to my Department in respect of the provision of cash escorts since 1995. This figure was set by the Department of Finance in the 1995 budget and had not been altered since. The contribution from the banks was designed to part-cover the total costs to the State of providing cash escorts. At that time, the contribution covered approximately 72% of the total cost arising to the Defence Forces. Based on annual costings by the Department, the relative level of the contribution had fallen in real terms over the years to the situation where it was only covering 43% of the total costs.The total cost in respect of the provision by the Defence Forces of assistance to the Garda Síochána in protecting movements of cash for the years 2000 to 2004 — the figures for 2005 are currently being collated — was as follows:Year20002001200220032004Total number of escorts2,2852,4882,5162,3352,425Cost of Escorts€5.7m€6.57m€6.87m€6.5m€7.5mPay accounts for about 54% of the total costs of providing cash escorts. The non-pay costs include security duty allowance, 7%, subsistence, 8%, transport, 28%, and aerial surveillance, 3%.As the Deputy may be aware, I had a number of discussions with the Irish Bankers Federation, IBF, in relation to this matter last year, with a view to increasing the level of contribution by the banks in respect of the costs incurred by the Department in the provision of cash escorts. Following detailed and intensive discussions between officials of the IBF, the member banks and the Department, a detailed formal agreement was signed on 11 May 2005.This agreement, which is for a five year period, provides that the banks will pay the total actual costs incurred by the Defence Forces in the provision of cash escorts. Costs in respect of each 12 month period to end-December will be paid the following year on or before 1 June. This is to allow for the compilation of returns from the brigades and allocation of costs following the year end. The first payment under the new system — costs for 2005 — are currently being collated and are due to be paid in June 2006. At the banks' request, I agreed to defer the first payment to that date to meet the banks budgeting and accounting timeframe. In return for my agreement to this deferral, a transitional payment of €1 million, payable before the end of 2005, was negotiated as part of the overall agreement. Therefore, in 2005 the banks made their annual payment of €2.86 million plus the additional €1 million making a total contribution of €3.86 million. The amount to be paid in 2007 — costs for 2006 — will not be available until early 2007.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	443	The position is that legal advice has been sought by my Department as to the performance of the specialist medical recruitment agency engaged to provide suitably qualified doctors for service with the Irish contingent of the United Nations Mission in Liberia. This advice is still awaited.As the first priority was the welfare of the troops who were attended to by Dr. Lieberthal, the director of the medical corps contacted each person who had served in Liberia during the period in question alerting them to the situation and advising them of the measures the medical corps were putting in place to deal with any concerns they may have.As a result any Defence Force member treated by the person concerned and who wished to discuss any aspect of his or her treatment with a medical officer was invited to consult their local military medical officer or alternatively to contact the special medical hotline established by the Army medical corps. To date, there have been nine calls to this number.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	444	The response to the recent riots in Dublin were discussed in detail in the House on 28 February 2006 during the debate on public order offences, which included detailed statements by my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.The Government task force on emergency planning last met on 9 March 2006. This was a specifically convened meeting of the task force for the sole purpose of receiving updated briefings from the Department of Agriculture and Food with regard to avian flu and from the Department of Health and Children with regard to preparations for a possible human influenza pandemic. The response to the recent riots was not discussed at this meeting.The maintenance of public order is a matter for the Garda authorities and the Government task force on emergency planning is not involved in such operational matters. I would, however, as chairman of the Government task force, condemn the behaviour of those involved in the rioting on the day in question and, on behalf of the Government and this House, commend the bravery of the members of the Garda Síochána in exercising its public order duties.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	445	The military authorities advise that the military police investigation is still ongoing into the alleged larceny of diesel oil from military vehicles in Donegal. It would be inappropriate to comment on the details of the investigation but it can be confirmed that a member of the Defence Forces has been interviewed in the course of the investigation. As the investigation is continuing and several lines of inquiry remain to be completed, it is not possible to determine when the investigation will be concluded.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	446	The Garda Síochána has the primary responsibility for law and order, including the protection of the internal security of the State. Among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces is the provision of aid to the civil power, meaning in practice to assist, when requested, the Garda Síochána, which duties include the protection and guarding of vital installations, the provision of certain security escorts, etc. As the Deputy will appreciate, it would not be appropriate for me, for reasons of security, to comment on the exact nature of the deployment to Shannon Airport on 1 and 5 March last. The estimated additional cost to the Defence Forces was approximately €60,000 in respect of security duty allowance, food, fuel and hire of equipment.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	447	The Government's legislative programme for the current Dáil session, which commenced on 25 January 2006, as announced by my colleague, Deputy Kitt, Chief Whip and Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, lists in section A my intention to publish a Bill amending Part V, discipline, of the Defence Act 1954, as amended, and certain other provisions of the Act.Since its enactment over 50 years ago, Part V, discipline, of the Defence Act 1954 has been subject to relatively minor revisions, including the establishment in 1983 of the Courts-Martial Appeals Court, CMAC, the introduction of a special legal aid scheme and some subsequent updating of the punishments available for breaches of military law.There have been relevant developments in the intervening period. The military legal authorities have had regard to various decisions of the Courts-Martial Appeals Court since 1983, to developments in the ordinary criminal courts of the State and to developments in the administration of military law in other common law jurisdictions. They have been especially aware of the need for the Irish military legal system to be fully compliant with all of the requirements of the European Convention on Human Rights which was incorporated into Irish law through the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003. In this regard, the military authorities are entirely cognisant of recent decisions of the European Court of Human Rights in the area of military law.In July, 2001 the deputy chief of staff, support, convened a military law review board to review the current provisions of the Defence Act 1954, as amended, to ensure that the military law justice system is both expeditious and fair to the individual and contributes significantly to the maintenance of discipline within the Defence Forces and complies with the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights. The board report, together with legal advice from the Attorney General's office, have been considered within my Department with a view to deciding upon the most suitable approach to be taken to the recommendations, in light of the general legislative programme of the Government.Accordingly, in June 2005 the Government approved the urgent drafting of the Defence (Amendment) Bill which is currently being drafted by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel, in consultation with officials from my Department, for enactment by mid-2006.The legislative programme also lists in section C my intention to publish a Curragh of Kildare Bill which will provide for the establishment of a statutory body to manage the Curragh with the exception of the military establishment at the Defence Forces training centre and to update the existing Curragh of Kildare Act. This Bill is being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and is expected to be published in mid-2006.As I have previously advised the House, the interdepartmental group on battlegroups, as part of its study, recommended changes to current legislation on overseas deployments in light of the increasing range of operations where military forces can play a role and the need for increased interoperability and training so we can be more effective and more efficient once deployed.It is important to the development of capabilities and the ongoing training of the Defence Forces that they can undertake training overseas and learn from best practice in other countries. While not conclusive, the study raised possible questions as to whether Defence Forces can be sent on such overseas training. This training is essential to the development and maintenance of high standards in the military and our existing peace support operations, where we work alongside many other armies.I intend to introduce amending legislation to put this issue beyond doubt. Moreover, in light of developments since the Defence Act was amended in 1960 to provide for participation in UN peace support operations, for the avoidance of doubt, I also intend to update the wording in the Act to more closely reflect current practice in the formulation of UN Security Council resolutions endorsing peace support operations. The triple lock requirement of UN, Government and Dáil approval will stand.I also propose to provide for the participation by Defence Forces personnel in humanitarian operations in response to natural and man-made disasters such as the tsunami in south east Asia or the earthquake in Pakistan. Currently personnel must volunteer for service with a civil undertaking, in the same manner as any ordinary citizens and cannot be deployed at the behest of the Government.These issues are important and must be addressed. The requirement for this amending legislation arises irrespective of our participation in battlegroups. With the co-operation of the Oireachtas which I expect will be readily forthcoming, I hope to have the necessary legislation enacted before the summer recess.

Over the years the Department has received approaches regarding the disposal of its interest in the property. It is not the practice to divulge the identity of such interested parties. The Department's property portfolio is kept under continual review and any properties deemed surplus to military requirements will be disposed of to fund much needed investment, to meet the equipment and infrastructure needs of the Defence Forces.

It is my intention to maintain the established Government policy of ongoing recruitment to the Defence Forces. Recruitment into the Permanent Defence Force will continue to maintain the strength at the level set out in the White Paper as required to meet military needs. The Defence Forces continue to have a proactive approach to all aspects of recruiting.The strength of the Permanent Defence Force and the Reserve Defence Force, as advised by the military authorities, is provided in the following tabular statement. The figures provided are as at 28 February 2006.

The number of staff to be relocated to Newbridge is 200. While the Office of Public Works has identified a suitable site in Newbridge for the Department's new headquarters, negotiations on the acquisition of the site have not yet been completed. A total of 385 personnel, of whom 65 are currently serving in the Department, have volunteered to relocate to Newbridge.

The requirement is for up to 1,400 new pistols. The tender competition is still in train but it is likely that a contract for the acquisition of the pistols will be placed in the near future. It is expected that the new pistols will be delivered by the end of this year. The Deputy will appreciate that as the tender competition is ongoing, I cannot disclose any further information in the matter at this stage.

The Chief of Staff has appointed a senior officer to examine all aspects of the Niemba ambush in the Congo in November 1960. The senior officer will also examine all records in military archives, interview former Army Privates Kenny and Fitzpatrick and other survivors of the unit who may be in a position to contribute and also the authors of any books or articles related to the ambush. I will contact the Deputy when this process has been completed.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	453	The exact information requested by the Deputy is not available. The average earnings per hour for industrial workers, excluding clerical and managerial workers, in the manufacturing sector was €13.92 in September 2005. The quarterly survey from which these figures are produced does not enable the compilation of tables on the distribution of earnings.However, the CSO has introduced a new survey, the national employment survey, for this purpose. The survey was first conducted in 2003 and it is being repeated this year. Preliminary figures from 2003 show that average hourly earnings for industrial workers in the manufacturing sector was €12.78. Approximately 48% of all employees, excluding agriculture, forestry and fishing employees, had earnings per hour below this figure. A detailed report on the 2003 national employment survey is currently being prepared.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	454	On the occasion of the St. Patrick's Day celebrations, I fulfilled a number of engagements in San Jose, California, and in Washington. In the course of my various engagements, I focused on three key themes — the progress made in the peace process in the past year and our clear determination to resolve the outstanding issues this year, the plight of the undocumented Irish and the positive story of the success of modern Ireland. I spoke of what we believe is the "Irish Advantage", a theme which was also articulated by Ministers in many other engagements throughout the world during the St. Patrick's Day period.I met Mr. Mark Hurd, CEO, Hewlett-Packard, at the company headquarters in Palo Alto. Hewlett Packard is a significant multinational company and a major investor and employer in Ireland. I met Enterprise Ireland clients and IDA guests when I attended the Enterprise Ireland reception in San Jose. A number of announcements were made, including Lotus Automation acquisitions, Scandata partnership with O'Neil Software, Innerworkings and the Interactive Services deal with Comcast. I also attended the Spirit of Ireland dinner in San Jose. My speech focused on the sister city relationship between San Jose and Dublin and the links between San Jose and Ireland. Ireland's contribution to Silicon Valley and the continued strength of the Irish economy were topics that were also mentioned.I attended the Irish ambassador's St. Patrick's Day reception in Washington on 15 March. I met the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, ILIR, on the margins of the reception. We discussed our mutual desire to see a successful resolution to the situation for all the undocumented Irish currently living in the United States.During my visit to Capitol Hill on 16 March, I met a number of Senators, including John McCain, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Edward Kennedy, Chris Dodd and Patrick Leahy. I also met a delegation from the Friends of Ireland, led by Congressman Jim Walsh.At all of these meetings, we discussed the significant progress made in the peace process since March 2005. I also outlined the Government's views on the proposed immigration reform and the need to address the issues of the undocumented Irish in the US. I also raised the Pat Finucane case. On the same day, I attended the Speaker's lunch, which was hosted by Speaker Denis Hastert and was also attended by President Bush.While I was in Washington I had the opportunity to meet the Ireland-US Economic Advisory Board. We discussed the Northern Ireland situation, the continuing success of the Irish economy, the future opportunities and challenges for Ireland and business prospects in the United States and internationally. I attended the American-Ireland Fund, AIF, national gala on 16 March in the National Building Museum, Washington, where I was the guest speaker.On 17 March, I attended the traditional St. Patrick's Day ceremony at the White House and presented the bowl of shamrock to President Bush. This traditional ceremony marks the strong relationship between the US and Ireland. I also had a bilateral meeting with President Bush in the Oval Office. We discussed the peace process, the Pat Finucane case, Irish-US relations, immigration reform and the undocumented Irish and a range of international issues. In the course of various functions in Washington, I had the opportunity to meet the Northern Ireland Secretary of State and Northern political leaders.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	455	The Central Statistics Office began a consultation process in November 2003 to consider topics to be included in the 2006 census which will be taken on 23 April. Notices were placed in the national press and on the CSO website inviting public submissions on the suggested content of the 2006 census questionnaire.A broadly-based consultative group was set up in December 2003 to assist the CSO in assessing the merits of the various submissions received. The group agreed the content of the test questionnaire which was used in a census pilot survey. The survey was carried out in April 2004 and covered approximately 8,000 households in selected areas throughout the country. The results of the census pilot survey were discussed with the consultative group following which the director general of CSO submitted a list of proposed topics to Government for its approval. The Government decided on the final content of the census 2006 questionnaire in January 2005.Among the new questions included in the 2006 census form is question no.14 on ethnicity or cultural background. The layout of the question was agreed with the consultative committee on racism and interculturalism, the Equality Authority and Pavee Point. The question wording is as follows:
14. What is your ethnic or cultural background?

Choose ONE section from A to D, then
the appropriate box.

A White
1 Irish2 Irish Traveller3 Any other White background
B Black or Black Irish
4 African5 Any other Black background
C Asian or Asian Irish
6 Chinese7 Any other Asian background
D Other, including mixed background
8 Other, write in descriptionWhile a specific box is not provided for members of the Roma community, it will be possible for them, should they wish, to indicate an affiliation to the Roma community, to write in the appropriate description in section 8 of question no. 14. These descriptions can then be separately coded and depending on the number of respondents it may be possible to identify the Roma community as a separate publication category.With a view to maximising public awareness, the CSO is conducting an intensive publicity campaign commencing with the census launch on 29 March. The campaign will run for eight weeks and will make use of radio, TV, press and outdoor media. The emphasis will be on the comprehensive and inclusive nature of the census which is summed up in the census 2006 copy line "BE PART OF THE BIGGER PICTURE". CSO's independence and the confidentiality of the information supplied will also be stressed. Particular attention is being paid to the enumeration of minority population groups.The 2006 census form has been translated into 11 foreign languages to assist anyone who is not familiar with English or Irish. Romanian is included among these languages and this should be of particular assistance to members of the Roma community. As part of the fieldwork preparations CSO staff have made contact with immigrant groups both at national and local levels to explain the importance of ensuring that everyone is enumerated on census day. As recently as 21 March a seminar on census 2006 was organised as part of national day against racism. The attendance at the seminar included members of the Roma community.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	456	I am aware of the recently published survey referred to by the Deputy. Officials from this Department have invited Alcohol Action Ireland to submit a copy. A strategic task force on alcohol was established in January 2002 and given a remit to recommend specific evidence-based measures to Government to prevent and reduce alcohol related harm. It has published two reports which together provide approximately 100 recommendations across a wide range of sectors. Significant progress has been made across Departments in implementing the task force's recommendations.Legislative measures which have been adopted include the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003 which assists in regulating availability. "Happy hours" have been abolished and restrictions on the access of children to licensed premises have been introduced. The Road Traffic Act 2003 extended the grounds for requesting a breath test to detect alcohol and the Minister for Transport has indicated his commitment to the introduction of random breath testing.A voluntary code of practice on alcohol advertising has been agreed between the Department of Health and Children and the drinks, media and advertising industries. This addresses many of the concerns over alcohol advertising. The Tánaiste has indicated her intention to introduce legislation if there is insufficient adherence to the voluntary code.Significant progress has also been made in terms of research projects, the delivery of responsible server training, awareness-raising campaigns, etc. Community mobilisation projects have been identified internationally as one of the most effective measures at reducing alcohol related harm. Resources have been allocated to the Health Service Executive to support such projects in this country. As the Deputy will be aware, the executive functions of this Department have transferred to the Health Service Executive, which will now have responsibility for progressing many of the task force's recommendations.A working group on alcohol was established under the special initiative on tackling alcohol and drug misuse in Sustaining Progress to help mobilise the stakeholders through social partnership to achieve a targeted and measurable reduction in alcohol misuse. Its remit was to examine the areas of high risk drinking, under age drinking and drink driving and to identify actions which member organisations could adopt to address these issues with a view to developing a programme of action. The group's report was submitted to the Tánaiste last week and future action is now being considered by my Department.

Parties to the convention are encouraged not to experiment on animals except where there is no alternative and to encourage research into alternative methods. Animals to be experimented on should be selected on the basis of clearly established quantitative criteria and must be well cared for and spared avoidable suffering whenever possible.In Ireland, these outcomes are achieved in practice by the European Communities (Amendment to the Cruelty to Animals Act 1876) Regulations 2002 which give effect to Council Directive 86/609/EEC regarding the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes. However, ratification of the convention would require primary legislation and, as there would be no additional protection of experimental animals, I could not justify allocating resources for this purpose. Accordingly, there are no proposals to proceed with ratifying the convention.

The question of Ireland signing the convention with formal reservations in respect of those articles with which difficulties have been identified has been kept under review.These, and other issues, were examined by the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction, the report of which was published in May 2005. The Government has referred the report to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children to allow for further political consideration of the complex issues involved. Once concluded, the deliberations of the joint committee will provide a basis for further public debate prior to the finalisation of any policy proposals. The question of ratifying the convention will be examined in the light of the outcome of this debate.

The State contracts with GPs for the provision of services under a number of schemes, the most significant of which is the general medical services scheme, GMS. The State funds GPs' vocational training, which is conducted under the auspices of the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, with funding from the Health Service Executive, HSE.In 2004 my Department agreed with the ICGP to fund an increase in the number of GP vocational training places from 84 to 150 over a three-year period, commencing in 2005. This was viewed as a short-term to medium-term measure in order to address immediate concerns in this area.To date, an additional €4 million has been provided for the HSE to provide additional GP vocational training places. The HSE has indicated that due to capacity difficulties with the existing GP training programmes, of 22 additional posts funded in 2005, 17 were filled and, in 2006, 17 of a further 22 posts are expected to be filled. The HSE and the ICGP are jointly working on a plan to bring a total of 66 training places on stream by 2008.My Department is considering the most appropriate way in which to address the longer-term GP manpower and training needs, in the context of such factors as the projected growth of the population, the demographic profile of the GP workforce, the changing nature of general practice and primary care and future service requirements generally.

The group's report, A Vision for Change, was published on 24 January 2006. The report sets out how positive mental health can be promoted generally in our society, and how specialist mental health services can be delivered efficiently to persons with eating disorders who need them.A Vision for Change acknowledges gaps in the current provision of mental health services for persons with eating disorders and makes several recommendations for the further improvement of these services. Recommendations include support for health promotion initiatives that encourage greater community and family awareness of eating disorders, the further development of primary and community care services and the provision of a full multidisciplinary team in a national centre for eating disorders. It is recommended that this national centre be located in one of the national children's hospitals for complex cases that cannot be managed by local child and adolescent community mental health teams. The Government has accepted the expert group's report as the basis for the future development of the mental health services. In this connection an additional €25 million was made available this year to the HSE for the further development of our mental health services.The Health Service Executive, which has primary responsibility for implementing the recommendations of A Vision for Change is in the process of establishing an implementation group to ensure that the recommendations are realised in a timely and co-ordinated manner. I have also recently appointed an independent monitoring group, as recommended in the report, to oversee the implementation of A Vision for Change. This group will hold its inaugural meeting shortly.

The use of sunbeds leads to damage from ultraviolet radiation in the same way as sunlight exposure. Exposure in childhood is associated with even greater risks of subsequent melanoma.The national cancer forum has considered measures to reduce exposure to ultraviolet radiation in the context of the development of the new national cancer control strategy. The forum submitted the strategy to me in January and the Department of Health and Children is considering the document prior to submission to Government.

However, it is recognised that an integrated approach is required for effective implementation. The Department has led on the establishment of a strategic task force on alcohol and a working group on alcohol and the three reports of these groups form the basis for current alcohol policy. Since the restructuring of the Department, the Health Service Executive has assumed responsibility for the implementation of many of the recommendations outlined in these reports. It is a matter for the HSE to decide on the structural requirements and levels of expertise needed in this regard.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	487	I propose to take Questions Nos. 160 to 162, inclusive, and 167 together.The working group on alcohol was established under the special initiative on tackling alcohol and drug misuse in Sustaining Progress to help mobilise the stakeholders through social partnership to achieve a targeted and measurable reduction in alcohol misuse. Its remit was to examine the areas of high risk drinking, under-age drinking and drink driving and to identify actions which member organisations could adopt to address these issues with a view to developing a programme of action. The group's report was submitted to the Tánaiste last week and future action is now being considered by the Department of Health and Children. The issues of labelling and the groceries order were discussed by the working group and its report makes a number of recommendations with regard to these. I have no plans to establish an office of alcohol control at this stage. However, the Department will keep the matter under review.

The aims of the project are to describe the prevalence and patterns of alcohol and nicotine use in a sample of pregnant women in Ireland between 1986 and 2004; to examine the association between a set of pregnancy outcome indicators — birth weight — Apgar score — and the consumption patterns; and to examine how alcohol consumption in Ireland, in a sample of pregnant women, relates to use in a similar population in other countries. The results are expected to be available later this year and will inform any future action required.

Accordingly, the Department of Health and Children has requested the parliamentary affairs division of the executive to arrange to have to have these matters investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.The legal position regarding charging is asfollows: the Health (Out-Patient Charges)(Amendment) Regulations 2005 provide for a statutory charge of €60 for attendance at accident and emergency departments. This charge is levied only on persons who attend at accident and emergency departments without a referral note from their doctor and applies only for the first visit of any episode of care. The Health (In-Patient Charges)(Amendment) Regulations 2005 impose a charge of €60 per night up to a maximum of €600 in any 12 consecutive months, during which an individual is maintained as an inpatient in a public hospital. As well as those with full eligibility, categories exempted from the charges include children up to the age of six weeks, women receiving services in respect of motherhood and children suffering from specified diseases.

Under the Act, experiments on live animals can be performed by persons licensed by the Minister for Health and Children. In addition, animals must be properly anaesthetised for the duration of an experiment, unless a certificate has been given in advance certifying that anaesthesia is considered to be more traumatic to the animal than the experiment, or anaesthesia is incompatible with the object of the experiment and the required certificate or certificates have been given in advance certifying that insensibility cannot be produced without necessarily frustrating the object of the proposed experiment. Applicants must complete an official application form that requires full disclosure of relevant information about the proposed experiments. Applications and certificates must be endorsed by two qualified persons of professorial standing, as specified in the Act, from a relevant scientific, medical or veterinary discipline before submission for licence appraisal.Under the Act, any case of non-compliance must be notified to the authority, which is the Minister for Health and Children. The Department has not received any such notifications in the period referred to by the Deputy. Statistics on the use of animals for experimental and other scientific purposes are compiled and made available every third year as required by the European Commission under directive 86/609/EEC, which relates to the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes. The latest published statistics relate to 2002. The Department is compiling the 2005 statistics, which will be made available by the end of June on the Department's website, www.dohc.ie.

The 2006 Estimates for the health services specifically allocated additional funding of €3 million for the further development of neurology and neurophysiology services. This funding was provided to allow the Health Service Executive to progress further the implementation of the recommendations of the former Comhairle nan-Ospidéal in respect of the services. The Comhairle report recommended a significant enhancement of services, including the appointment of additional consultants. While it will take some time to reach the full complement of consultant posts as recommended, major improvements in patient care can be achieved in the short term through a combination of additional consultant posts and the appointment of a number of clinical nurse specialists and allied health professionals. The Department of Health and Children has been advised by the HSE that the development of three new neurology units — in the mid west, the north west and the south east — will commence in 2006 with the appointment of multidisciplinary teams comprising consultant neurologists and support staff. The Department has asked the HSE's parliamentary affairs division to arrange to have the Deputy's specific queries about myasthenia gravis examined and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy about these matters.

The team includes: Ms Angela Fitzgerald, who is the acute hospitals network manager of the HSE and the chairperson of the dedicated team; Mr. Jim Breslin, who is the assistant director of primary, community and continuing care in the HSE; Mr. Gerard McCarthy, who is an accident and emergency consultant at Cork University Hospital; Mr. GerryLane who is an accident and emergency consultant at Letterkenny General Hospital; Dr. Conor Burke, who is a respiratory physician at James Connolly Memorial Hospital in Blanchardstown; Dr. Dermot Power, who is a consultant geriatrician at Mater Misericordiae Hospital; Ms Mary McHugh, who is the director of nursing at University College Hospital, Galway; Mr. Ian Carter, who is the chief executive officer of St. James's Hospital; and Dr. Emer Feely, who is a specialist in public health medicine with the HSE.The proposed approach of the accident and emergency framework is to focus on hospitals which have persistent challenges in accident and emergency departments, to establish clear targets for performance improvement and to develop practical and focussed ways of delivering sustained improvement in accident and emergency services. The key objectives of the framework are to reduce the numbers waiting in accident and emergency departments, to reduce the length of time patients spend waiting and to improve the overall patient experience. Every available action that can be taken will be taken to improve patients' experience of care.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	513	Methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, is a bacteria and a resistant form of staphylococcus aureus. MRSA can exist without affecting people's health. Information on the incidence of such asymptomatic carriage is not routinely reported. For the purpose of the surveillance, prevention and control of this infection, the Health Protection Surveillance Centre collects data on MRSA bacteraemia as part of the European antimicrobial resistance surveillance system, which collects data on the first episode of blood stream infection per patient per quarter and was designed to allow comparison of antimicrobial resistance data between countries and possibly between regions.Since 1 January 2004, MRSA bacteraemia has been included in the list of notifiable diseases under the Infectious Diseases Regulations 1981, as amended. The reporting process is done on a quarterly basis from laboratories to the Health Protection Surveillance Centre via the European antimicrobial resistance surveillance system. The cases reported by the centre refer to hospitalised cases and are not representative of the general population. MRSA infections occur almost exclusively in hospital practice in Ireland, among hospital inpatients or patients who have frequent contact with hospitals. Community-acquired MRSA infections are generally caused by strains of MRSA bacteria which are different to strains associated with hospitals. The national MRSA reference laboratory carried out a preliminary study in 2005 to look for evidence of community-acquired strains of MRSA in Ireland. It identified five patients with such strains, four of whom appear to have acquired the infection outside Ireland. Current evidence suggests that MRSA is still confined to hospitals in Ireland.

I highlighted the need to identify the necessary structures and processes which are required to control the emergence and spread of health care associated infections, including MRSA. The publication of the revised SARI guidelines on the control and prevention of MRSA in hospitals and the community, the clean hands campaign, the national hygiene audits and the development of national standards on infection control and hospital hygiene are some of the measures aimed at bringing about change in the hospital system.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	520	Most services provided by Government Departments and other public service agencies are best provided directly by the staff of the Departments and agencies. There is, however, a variety of situations where work can be carried out or services delivered more effectively or efficiently by contracting out of work. There are various instances across the public service where work is contracted out at present.The current driver testing backlog is unacceptable and must be eliminated as quickly as possible. My colleague, the Minister for Transport, has gone to exceptional lengths to maximise the contribution that can be made to reducing this problem from within the existing system. As well as additional recruitment and redeployment of existing civil servants the measures proposed included bonus payments for the existing staff. These measures, however, would still not be sufficient to clear the backlog quickly enough. It is for this reason that the temporary contracting out of some of the work was proposed.Agreement could not be reached with the relevant unions either directly or through the services of the Labour Relations Commission, despite the special incentive arrangements that had been put in place for the driver testers. It is disappointing that such agreement could not be reached particularly given what should be the normal partnership approach to addressing pressing issues of public interest. In the absence of agreement the matter was referred to the Civil Service arbitration board, acting in an ad hoc capacity. The finding of the arbitration board turned in particular on the interpretation of paragraph 21.9 of Sustaining Progress. It was the clear intention and understanding of the public service employers when Sustaining Progress was negotiated that the effect of this paragraph, which forms part of the section of the agreement that deals with modernisation and flexibility, was to provide greater rather than less scope for contracting out of work where it made sense to do so. The arbitration board has interpreted this paragraph more narrowly.The arbitration board's finding was concerned solely with the strict interpretation of the relevant paragraph in Sustaining Progress. The board in its adjudication pointed out repeatedly that it was not concerned with the merits of the dispute as to how the backlog of driving tests should be solved. However, it felt its continuance represents a potential threat to road safety. The board urged a resumption of discussions at which all options — and they emphasised all options — should be considered, with a view to ensuring that such a solution is implemented without delay. I understand that there have since been discussions between the Minister for Transport and the main union concerned. I hope a satisfactory outcome will emerge.One of the central themes of the ongoing agenda for modernisation of the public service is the need to increase flexibility in working arrangements and to eliminate rigidities and restrictive practices, with a view to enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the services being delivered. In appropriate circumstances contracting out of work is one of the tools which can make an important contribution in this regard. This issue will have to be addressed again in discussions on the arrangements to follow Sustaining Progress, which expires at the end of June 2006 in the public service, in order to ensure that barriers to best practice in the delivery of public services are eliminated.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	521	An inter-agency procurement group, chaired by my Department, was established in late 2004 and began working in 2005 to determine an approach for digital radio services for the entire Irish public service, with particular emphasis on the emergency and security services.The group decided to procure digital radio services provision rather than a system based on any particular technology. It also decided, following legal advice, to use the restricted procurement procedure for the exercise. The first phase of the procedure was advertised in January 2006 and closed in mid-February. Following evaluation of the responses received, five candidates were shortlisted to be invited to the second phase of the procurement in which they will receive the full tender documentation, subject to confidentiality and non-disclosure conditions. That second phase is expected to commence in the near future and the ensuing tendering and evaluation process will take at least four months to complete. The inter-agency procurement group has decided that a service performance evaluation will be required to ensure the appropriateness, performance and robustness of the preferred solution, before a contract can be awarded. It is estimated that such an evaluation could take approximately six months.

Revenue advise, however, that in the recent bulk issue of over 2.2 million tax credit certificates, reflecting the budget changes, some widowed persons were not allocated their full entitlements. I am assured by Revenue that these cases were speedily identified and corrected certificates were immediately issued both to the appropriate employer and to the person concerned. The revised and corrected entitlements took effect from the start of the tax year.

A certificate of tax credits issued on 8 February. Unfortunately, the person's pension from the UK was wrongly described as trading profit. However, the certificate is otherwise correct. A revised certificate with the correct description will issue shortly. The person's tax liability for 2006 cannot be finally determined until after 31 December 2006 when exact details of her income from all sources will be available but, based on the information available, she will pay the correct amount of tax this year.The person's Revenue district has written to her requesting full details of her income for 2005 so that her liability can be reviewed for that year in order to establish whether any refund is due.

A review of his tax liability for 2005, to include home carers credit, has been dealt with and a PAYE balancing statement will issue shortly. Tax relief for mortgage payments is deducted at source by the mortgage lender and this would appear to be in effect in this particular case already. There is no tax relief available for expenses incurred in travel to or from one's workplace or for personal expenditure such as electricity, etc.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	528	There are no circumstances whereby PAYE taxpayers can recover child care fees. However, as the Deputy may be aware, the tax code provides a tax exemption from benefit-in-kind where employees receive free or subsidised child care from their employers. The exemption applies whether the employer provides the facilities in-house or in premises made available by the employer in another location. The exemption also applies if an employer provides child care facilities jointly with others for example, with other employers. The exemption was extended in Finance Act 2001 to cover situations where an employer does not wish to get involved in the day-to-day running of the facility but makes a contribution to the capital costs of an independent supplier of child care facilities. The exemption does not apply if the employer simply pays or subsidises the cost to an employee of an independent child care facility.This Government acknowledges the continuing cost pressures on parents, particularly those with young children. Child care is probably the single biggest issue facing working parents today. That is why the Government introduced a suite of measures in this year's budget, including the early child care supplement of €1,000 in a full year for each child up to his or her sixth birthday, increased child benefit payments, extended paid and unpaid maternity leave and a new national child care investment programme which aims to fund an additional 50,000 child care places over the next five years. In total, over €2.5 billion extra will be invested in this area over the next five years.I am satisfied that these measures will play a significant role in addressing the issue of child care and the welfare of children.

The tax implications for those investing in a pyramid selling scheme will depend on the precise details of the particular scheme. However, the general position for income tax purposes is that section 18(2) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, which is one of the main income tax charging provisions, provides for a charge to tax on any profits or gains which are not otherwise subject to an income tax charge. Depending, therefore, on the facts and the detail available with regard to any particular scheme, this provision may be applied to tax financial gains accruing to members of a pyramid selling scheme. I have no proposals to facilitate pyramid schemes in any way and I would repeat the cautionary advice given by other Government colleagues on participating in these schemes.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	530	The changes I announced in the budget — a halving of the excise rates for kerosene and LPG — were undertaken in order that consumers would benefit directly from such a move. In addition, I announced in advance that these excise rates will be reduced to zero in next year's budget.The excise tax reductions should ensure that the price of kerosene is approximately €16 per 1,000 litres cheaper than would be the case without the excise reduction. In the case of LPG the appropriate reduction is €10 per 1,000 litres. Of course, prices can fluctuate due to a range of non-tax factors, and this is particularly the case in respect of oil products given the day-to-day movements in price arising from supply issues. In addition, as is the case with motor fuels, prices can vary between suppliers. Notwithstanding this, my Department has made contact with the relevant industry body stressing that the excise tax reductions should be passed on to consumers.

The 90th anniversary of the Easter Rising of 1916 will, therefore, be commemorated by a parade in Dublin on Sunday, 16 April 2006.

I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are not aware of any significant abuses of the so-called section 50 scheme of relief for the construction of student accommodation. However, Revenue has noted the newspaper report of a claim made at last week's Union of Students in Ireland Congress that some section 50 apartments are being let to non-students during college terms. Revenue will follow up on this with the person who made the claim and I am assured that appropriate action will be taken, if warranted.

The National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission is independent of Government in the exercise of its functions. Under the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000, it controls and manages the fund with discretionary authority to determine and implement the fund's investment strategy. This investment strategy is based on a commercial investment mandate with the objective of securing the optimal return over the long term subject to prudent risk management.The independence of the commission is a cornerstone of the legislation which ensures that the commission will invest in a manner that maximises returns. Essentially, it is similar to the trustee arrangements that apply to private pension funds and places an obligation on the commission to act commercially and in the best interests of the fund.With regard to commercial investment in public sector projects in this country, the annual report of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission for 2004 states that the commission made an initial allocation of €200 million for investment in public private partnerships in Ireland and will increase this allocation should suitable opportunities arise. The report also states that the commission will make equity and/or debt finance available to the winning bidder in the tender process for public private partnership projects, provided it is satisfied with the prospective rate of return.On a more general note, development of the public private partnership process is not dependent on investment in PPPs by the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission.

In 2003 the council submitted a proposal for an extension to the existing pier, dredging and reclamation works at an estimated total cost of €2.5 million. The question of providing funding for the works in question will depend on the amount of funding available for works at fishery harbours generally and overall national priorities.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	543	I am aware of varying energy costs within the European Union. I do not have any function in regard to the domestic pricing of electricity and gas, as this falls within the remit of the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, the independent regulator for electricity and gas.The conditions for competition are being created through progressive liberalisation of the electricity and gas markets. In regard to the opening of the electricity market, the position is that liberalisation of the electricity market has proceeded on a phased basis since February 2000 under the regulatory oversight of the CER.In accordance with the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 (Eligible Customer) (Consumption of Electricity) Order 2003, on 19 February 2005, the market opened fully to competition. From that date, all customers have been eligible to source their electricity from any licensed supplier and the entire market became contestable. Scope now exists for all customers, household and non-household alike, to seek out keener prices in the competitive market. This is well in advance of the July 2007 deadline set down in Electricity Directive 2003/54/EC. The opening of the market has benefited customers by broadening customer choice and already some 42% of the market by volume is supplied by independent suppliers.Since full market opening the CER has ensured that the support systems and processes are in place to enable new entrant electricity suppliers to serve any customer in Ireland. To date, suppliers have focused on larger customers because this was the first segment of the market to open to competition — a pattern that is very common in other newly liberalising markets. Over time, as suppliers target the domestic market, the CER expect to see those benefits extended to the domestic customer.In regard to unbundling of electricity utilities, the Department is working to conclude outstanding matters to ensure that EirGrid plc becomes fully operational as a licensed transmission system operator, TSO, in the coming months. The gas market is at an advanced stage of opening. EU Directive 2003/55/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning common rules for the Internal Market in natural gas provides for the opening of the market on a phased basis. The directive required market opening for all non-household customers from 1 July 2004 and this was done. Overall market opening by volume currently stands at 86%, comprising all industrial and commercial consumers. Provisions for the final stage of market opening — to all domestic consumers — are contained in the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2006, as published. Again, this is in advance of the deadline of July 2007 set down in the directive.A statutory instrument, European Communities (Internal Market in Natural Gas) (BGÉ) Regulations 2005, S.I. No. 760 of 2005, was signed into law last December. The regulations impose a legal obligation on Bord Gáis Éireann to unbundle its transmission and distribution system operators. Bord Gáis is currently taking measures to comply with this through the establishment of an independent system operator subsidiary.In regard to both the electricity and gas markets, any company, regardless of the nationality of its parent company and which meets the requirements of Irish law may apply to CER for a supply, or, also in the case of electricity, generation, licence.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	544	I propose to take Questions Nos. 229 to 232, inclusive, together.The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, the independent regulator.Broadband is currently available in Tuam. My Department's sponsored website, www.broadband.gov.ie, which facilitates consumers trying to locate broadband service providers in their area, lists 12 Internet service providers offering broadband on digital subscriber line, DSL, one company offering it via wireless and eleven satellite broadband providers.It has been clear for some time that the sector has failed to invest at the level necessary to keep pace with the demand for broadband, so my Department's regional broadband programme is addressing the infrastructure deficit by building high speed open access broadband networks, in association with the local and regional authorities, in the major towns and cities. These metropolitan area networks, MANs, will allow the private sector to offer world class broadband services at competitive costs.A total of 27 MANs have been completed on time and under budget under phase one of this programme. These completed networks are being managed independently for the State by e-net, the management services entity, and offer wholesale open access to all service providers.In planning the next phase of the MANs programme, a review of the availability of DSL broadband in the regions showed that over 90 towns with a population of 1,500 and above that were not being offered a broadband option by the private sector. These towns were selected for investment under phase two of the MANs programme. A number of regional towns, including Tuam, already had DSL broadband on offer from the service providers, so priority was given to the provision of essential broadband infrastructure in those towns where none existed.Five towns in County Galway will have MANs constructed under this phase. They are, Athenry, Ballinasloe, Clifden, Gort and Loughrea. The detailed design stage is already under way. Project managers have been appointed and construction is expected to start over the coming months. The total cost of the projects in Galway is over €7 million and my Department will be providing grant aid of over €6 million. These networks should be completed within 12 to 18 months thereafter. Tuam is not part of the current rollout but may be included in further phases subject to the necessary approvals and Exchequer funding being made available. Galway County Council has submitted a strong case for a MAN to be built in Tuam and this is being kept under review.The Department also offers funding assistance for smaller towns and rural communities through the county and group broadband scheme. The scheme is technology neutral, allowing the community to select the most suitable broadband delivery platform for the area. To date, a total capital investment of €2.19 million has been made in GBS projects in Galway involving a total of €533,000 in grant aid to implement these projects.A joint industry-Government fund of €18 million has been established for the broadband for schools programme, which will provide schools across the country, including Galway, with broadband during 2006. This is a crucial strand in the strategy of integrating ICT into teaching and learning, and the Department's wider vision of promoting the use of broadband technologies in local communities around the country. The construction-installation phase is now under way, and the project is on target for completion within the set timeframe.

In doing so I reaffirmed the Government's intention to introduce measures to fully align the management of the fishery with the scientific advice for 2007.I recognise the considerable efforts made by the commercial fishing industry in recent years to build a sustainable fishery and that it has endured large cuts in the quotas available to it. I realise that these reductions have caused difficulty for the fishing industry and that full alignment with the scientific advice will likely compound these problems. For these reasons, I have decided to appoint an independent group to examine the implications of the new regulations for the commercial sector in 2007 and beyond and to make recommendations on the options available to address any financial hardship that may arise for individuals involved in commercial salmon fishing.The group will comprise Padraic White, former chief executive of the Industrial Development Agency and author of the decommissioning report on the Irish whitefish fleet, Professor Tom Collins, chair of the national rural water monitoring committee, and John Malone, a former Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture and Food. The specific remit of the group will include: to advise the Government of the implications of fully aligning with the scientific advice and in particular the hardship that may arise for individuals in coastal communities; to determine the scale of financial loss which will be experienced as a result of measures imposed on the commercial salmon fishery; to make recommendations, if appropriate, to address any financial hardship experienced; to consider the extent to which those stakeholders, who would be the main economic beneficiaries of more salmon being returned to the rivers, should contribute to any scheme, whether in cash or in kind including improved tourist access and; to determine the implications for the angling sector.The group will be expected to draw on the reports already generated through the National Salmon Commission, by the National Fisheries Managers Executive and the standing scientific committee and engage in appropriate consultation with relevant stakeholders. The independent group will report to me within a five-month timeframe.

On 17 March, I accompanied the Taoiseach to the White House for the traditional presentation of shamrock, followed by a meeting with President Bush in the Oval Office. Our discussions with the President covered Northern Ireland, immigration reform and other, including current international, issues. The Taoiseach and I also had a series of valuable meetings with key members of Congress, including Senators Biden, Clinton, Dodd, Kennedy, Leahy and McCain. We also met with Congressman Jim Walsh and members of the Friends of Ireland Group in Congress. The focus of these meetings was Northern Ireland and immigration reform. This special opportunity, unique to Ireland, for direct and detailed dialogue with the President of the United States and his Administration, and also key players on Capitol Hill, is exceptionally valued by the Government.My programme in Washington also included attendance at the American-Ireland Fund national gala dinner, the lunch hosted by Speaker Hastert, and the ambassador's St. Patrick's Day reception. In addition, the Taoiseach and I had a very valuable meeting on immigration reform with Niall O'Dowd and Grant Lally of the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform. I also accompanied the Taoiseach to a meeting with the Ireland-America Economic Advisory Board. Discussions with the board focused on the successes of the Irish economy, business prospects in the US and developments in Northern Ireland.In Dallas, my programme included attendance at the Irish-American Society dinner, the downtown parade and a breakfast hosted by the American-Ireland Fund. I also had a briefing session with the editorial board of the Dallas Morning News, and addressed a lunch hosted by the Dallas Chamber of Commerce. My address to the business lunch focused on the success of the Irish economy, highlighting the theme of the Irish advantage, which was also articulated by the Taoiseach and Ministers at a wide variety of events throughout the world over the St. Patrick's Day period. The importance of the Irish-American relationship, the peace process and immigration reform also featured in my remarks and discussions in Dallas.

The conditions in which Roma families are living in northern Kosovo, including the effect on their health of emissions from a toxic waste dump in the area, are particularly poor. The Special Representative of the UN Secretary General in Kosovo and Head of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo, UNMIK, Mr. Soren Jessen-Petersen, stated that €1.3 million is required to enable the relocation of these displaced families.As the Deputy will be aware, the Government, through Irish Aid, has pledged €250,000 to this project to date, and approximately €1.8 million in overall bilateral assistance to Kosovo over the past two years. My Department continues to follow this matter closely and will consider additional funding, if the UN authorities indicate that it is required.Talks on the Kosovo status process are currently under way. In this context, together with EU colleagues, we have urged the provisional institutions of self-government to intensify efforts to achieve, in parallel with the status process, concrete and rapid progress on standards implementation, particularly regarding the protection of minority communities.

In this regard, it was first necessary to complete the development and installation of the new passport system before full consideration of the project. In the circumstances, no funding has been required or spent to date on the project. It is hoped that significant progress in advancing this project will be made in 2006. However, at the same time, I should make the point that the particular priority this year will be to deliver on the biometric e-passport project in order, among other things, to ensure that Ireland remains within the US visa waiver system.

This is particularly so in view of the large rise in the number of Irish citizens travelling to the United States, and also given the current security climate in relation to international air travel. The present system of pre-clearance at Dublin and Shannon Airports is widely appreciated by our citizens and, in principle, I would be very pleased to see it developed further.While primary ministerial responsibility for the issue lies with the Minister for Transport, I can confirm that the US authorities have raised their wish to extend the pre-clearance facilities at Dublin Airport with officials of my Department.

National guidelines for the scheme were launched at the end of 2004. This Department has awarded major capital grants to 61 projects in the arts and culture area, including the arts culture capital enhancement support scheme, ACCESS, in respect of each of which a requirement to observe the per cent for arts scheme was imposed.The application of the scheme to any projects being funded under the local authority swimming pool programme commenced in January 2006. Since then the scheme has applied to the three pool projects approved for funding. The per cent for arts scheme was complied with in the National Aquatic Centre project. The extension of the scheme to major projects being developed by local authorities and which receive funding from my Department under the sport capital programme is being considered in the context of allocations under the 2006 sport capital programme.

The court found that the use of such incentives was a violation of Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. However, the court did not consider that the absence under UK law of an obligation on employers to enter into collective bargaining gave rise, in itself, to a violation of Article 11 of the convention. Accordingly, I do not consider that there are any new implications for trade union recognition in Ireland as a result of the findings of the European Court of Human Rights in this case.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	567	I propose to take Questions Nos. 257 and 258 together.There is already legislation in the area of self-employed commercial agents. In 1986 the European Community adopted Council Directive 86/653 EEC of 18/12/86 obliging member states to give legal protection to self-employed commercial agents. This directive was transposed into Irish law by two statutory instruments, SI No. 33 of 1994 and SI No.31 of 1997. Under the legislation a commercial agent is a self-employed intermediary who has continuing authority to negotiate the sale or purchase of goods on behalf of another person, the principal. The directive and the two statutory instruments contain a wide variety of requirements dealing with the regulation and protection of commercial agents and their principals and their respective rights and obligations. The legislation primarily governs the remuneration structure and contains details of commission calculations as well as minimum notice requirements to terminate the contract between the agent and the principal.My officials have checked with the various relevant enforcement agencies of my Department and they have not received complaints in the nature described by the Deputy. However, if the Deputy has additional information that he can supply we can consider the matter further. The Deputy will be aware that commercial agents are not employees and, as such, are not covered by employment rights legislation.

Following the increase in the national minimum wage in 2005, new updated foreign language information booklets, containing accurate information, were placed on the website on 11 May 2005. However, due to an administrative oversight, some web links to the out-of-date foreign language booklets were not reset to point to the new material and, instead, remained on the website unaltered. When the problem was highlighted I had the matter investigated and it was rectified within 24 hours. Procedures are now in place to ensure that this type of administrative error does not recur.

#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	571	The employment rights compliance section of the Department consists of three units: employment rights information, ERIU, labour inspectorate, LI and prosecution and enforcement unit, PE. The overall complement of staff across the three units is 57, broken down as follows: ERIU 13, LI 38 and PE six. The assignment of previously announced additional labour inspectors was completed in November 2005. That brought the complement of serving inspectors to 31 officers. That increase in staffing represents almost a doubling of the number of labour inspectors in the last 18 months. It should be noted that in addition to the employment rights compliance section, there is a wide range of employment rights bodies and services. These include the Employment Appeals Tribunal, the redundancy and insolvency sections of this Department, the rights commissioner services provided by the Labour Relations Commission and the services provided by the Labour Court. Between them, these various services have a complement of staff in excess of 150 people.

A separate registered employment agreement in the construction sector provides for the establishment of statutory rates of pay and related working conditions of employment. The terms of both agreements apply to a range of categories of workers in the industry.Compliance with CFOPS has been an issue of concern for some time and it prompted the Pensions Board to engage Mercer Consultants to carry out a review. Mercer's report sets out a range of recommendations that have policy and operational implications for various Departments that are being examined at present.At present, enforcement of compliance with the CFOPS is a matter primarily for the Labour Court. In pursuing the matter the Labour Court can be assisted by the labour inspectorate. Acting on specific information from the court, the employment records of an employer will be examined by an inspector and any relevant information gathered is communicated back to the court subsequently. The inspectorate has no other function in the matter.The current social partnership talks have a focus on the broad spectrum of employment standards and, in this context, are considering a range of issues in regard to compliance and enforcement of the obligations, rights and entitlements provided for in the existing comprehensive corpus of employment rights legislation. Compliance with the two registered employment agreements that cover the construction industry will feature in those deliberations and are likely to take cognisance of the Mercer report.

The union was concerned that only work-related fatalities that occur due to injuries-accidents inside in the workplace are counted in official statistics and was of the view that there are other examples of work-related deaths that occur but are not counted as such.Arising from SIPTU's request, the Health and Safety Authority has approved the payment of a grant to the school of public health and population science at University College Dublin, to carry out a project examining the official data sources and collection methods used to capture work-related death statistics in the Republic of Ireland. The project is expected to be completed in about six months.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	574	I propose to take Questions Nos. 265 and 266 together.The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, carried out a national survey on the incidence of workplace bullying over the period October 2000 to February 2001, which was commissioned by the task force on the prevention of workplace bullying. The results of the survey show that in aggregate terms, 7% of the workforce at that time were either experiencing bullying currently or had done so in the past six months. In absolute terms, this equated to about 115,000 persons who said that they were being bullied at work.In order to implement one of the main recommendations of the expert advisory group's report on workplace bullying, which I published in August last year, the Department is evaluating tenders to update the ESRI survey and submit a study of the new survey findings for consideration by the Department. Present indications are that this new study will not be available until about next October.While the expert advisory group set out a role which it considered for existing State agencies, there was not full agreement within the group on its recommendations. One example of this is the recommendation that either the Employment Appeals Tribunal or the Labour Court should be the final decision maker on bullying appeals and that the decision of whichever body was given statutory responsibility should be enforceable through the civil courts.The Department has received the preliminary views of the social partners, other interested bodies and some members of the public on the recommendations of the group. I have already given a commitment to publish the results of the survey, which will be brought to Government along with the report and the views of the social partners and other interested parties, for decision on how best to implement the report's recommendations.

That document was the basis for further consideration by the employment rights compliance group, ERCG. The ERCG, which was made up of representatives of the social partners, including the CIF and SIPTU, together with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Finance, has completed its report. The report will inform the current national partnership discussions.Some of the key proposals in the report are: a streamlining of access to redress through the existing employment rights bodies, thus enabling individuals with the information and facility to more easily vindicate their employment rights and entitlements; greater emphasis on proper record keeping together with increased transparency regarding pay and the associated information provided to employees on payslips; organisational improvements in the service provided by the employment rights compliance section of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, including the labour inspectorate, which includes a regionalised structure; and major investment in education and information dissemination on employment rights obligations and entitlements for both employers and employees. The resourcing of the labour inspectorate and options to enhance the effectiveness of our employment rights compliance regime are being considered in the current round of social partnership discussions.

These campaigns included advertising on television, radio and in the national and regional newspapers. The campaigns also involved the distribution of thousands of information leaflets and booklets to citizen information centres and post offices around the country. The following table sets out the details. In addition, the employment rights information unit provides an information service to raise the awareness and understanding of both employers and employees regarding the wide range of employment legislation administered by my Department. It also produces a guide to each of the main pieces of relevant labour legislation within the Department's remit as well as an overall guide to labour law.The information service is delivered by the provision of: telephone service during normal business hours, including lunchtime; out of business hours answer phone service; personal callers — one to one interviews in privacy; written replies to correspondence; electronic mail service; attendance at exhibitions and seminars to explain entitlements and distribute explanatory materials on a range of employment legislation; and a series of explanatory information leaflets in ten languages.

It is hoped to publish this Bill in the second half of 2006.This Bill will, inter alia, propose a system of registration of employment agencies based in Ireland, supported by an industry regulatory code which will set out in detail, the practices and standards that employment agencies would be expected to follow. It may also be necessary to take account, first, of the potential impact of revised proposals from the European Commission on the draft EU services directive, which is expected to be published in April 2006, and, second, the free movement of persons, services and capital within the EU as laid down in the EU Treaty.

In the period 2002 to 2005 a total of 15 projects were approved for assistance by IDA Ireland. These projects had the potential to create over 1,900 jobs in both new and expanding enterprises. The following tabular statement shows the job figures on an annual basis. However, there is always a time lag, often stretching over many years, between the announcement of new jobs and their creation. That time is required for such activities as locating and acquiring a suitable site for the company's operations, constructing a facility and installing machinery and recruiting and training staff. The numbers eventually created may turn out to be higher or lower than originally envisaged by the investing company as a result of developments in their product markets, general economic conditions, investment decisions and overall corporate strategy.Also, in the period 2002 to 2005, a total of 1,950 jobs were created in IDA supported companies in the region. The job creation figures can not be directly related to the projects which were approved for grant aid in that period.

Shannon Development is also responsible for supporting indigenous enterprises in the mid-west region where it acts as agent for Enterprise Ireland. Responsibility for the provision of industrial property solutions within the mid-west region also lies with Shannon Development and IDA Ireland works closely with Shannon Development in the promotion and marketing of these tailored property solutions. In addition, Shannon Development in association with local authorities is also spearheading the drive to bring high-speed Internet access to the region.In the period from 2002 to date in 2006, there were 97 itineraries organised by IDA Ireland to the mid-west region, which for IDA purposes consists of counties Clare, Limerick, north Tipperary and north Kerry, while, in the same period, Shannon Development organized 84 visits to the Shannon free zone.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	582	IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment to Ireland and its regions. The marketing of individual areas, including Tuam, for new or expansion FDI investments and jobs is a day-to-day operational matter for the agency. While I may give general policy directives to the agency, I am precluded under the Acts from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others. I have been informed by IDA Ireland that in the period 2000 to 2005 there have been a total of 12 site visits to Tuam, three visits in 2001; two visits in each of the years 2000, 2002, 2003, and 2004; and one visit in 2005.A central goal for IDA Ireland is the achievement of balanced regional development. The national spatial strategy provides a framework for the achievement of this goal through the prioritisation of development and investment in the gateway and hub locations. On this basis, IDA Ireland seeks to attract foreign direct investment into the western region via the Galway gateway, the hub towns of Tuam and Ballina-Castlebar, and the towns of Westport and Ballinasloe. IDA Ireland's sectoral emphasis is on attracting new knowledge intensive projects in medical technologies, life sciences, information communications and technology and international services.IDA Ireland is committed to securing knowledge based, value added, FDI for Tuam and is actively marketing the town to potential investors. To this end the agency has invested upwards of €3.5 million on the acquisition of land and the development of a new business and technology park on the Dunmore Road in Tuam. In addition, the agency is actively working with its existing base of overseas companies in the county and the Tuam area to encourage them to grow and expand. Furthermore, the agency is working with local groups, utility providers and other agencies to ensure that the county secures the appropriate infrastructure to enable the existing companies grow and develop and to make the area sufficiently attractive for new projects.Despite increasing competition, Galway county continues to be very successful in winning foreign direct investment. There are now almost 10,000 permanent jobs in IDA supported companies in the county. I am confident the strategies and policies pursued by IDA Ireland in Tuam and in County Galway in general, together with the ongoing commitment by Government to regional development, will continue to bear fruit in terms of overseas investment and jobs for the people of Tuam and the county of Galway as a whole.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	583	IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment to Ireland and its regions. The marketing of individual areas, including Loughrea, for new or expansion foreign direct investment investments and jobs is a day-to-day operational matter for the agency. While I may give general policy directives to the agency, I am precluded under the Acts from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others. I have been informed by IDA Ireland that in the period 2000 to 2005 there have been a total of three site visits to Loughrea, one visit in each of the years 2001, 2002 and 2003.A central goal for IDA Ireland is the achievement of balanced regional development. The national spatial strategy provides a framework for the achievement of this goal through the prioritisation of development and investment in the gateway and hub locations. On this basis, IDA Ireland seeks to attract foreign direct investment into the gateways and hubs, as well as a small number of additional locations, throughout the west, namely, Galway, Tuam, the linked hub of Ballina and Castlebar, Westport and Ballinasloe. IDA Ireland's sectoral emphasis is on attracting new knowledge intensive projects in medical technologies, life sciences, information communications and technology and international services.With specific regard to Loughrea, IDA Ireland has informed me that it is actively working with the existing base of overseas companies in the county and in Loughrea to encourage them to grow and expand. Indeed, Loughrea has benefited very significantly from the Cigna Corporation, particularly from the company's 220-job expansion announced in 2003. These jobs are now coming on stream and, as a result, the company is now one of the largest IDA Ireland supported international services companies in the west.Despite increasing competition, County Galway continues to be very successful in winning foreign direct investment. IDA supported employment numbers in Galway are very strong, now accounting for almost 10,000 permanent jobs. I am confident, therefore, that the strategies and policies being pursued by IDA Ireland in Loughrea and in County Galway in general, together with the ongoing commitment by Government to regional development, will continue to bear fruit in terms of overseas investment and jobs for the people of Loughrea and the county of Galway as a whole.

In the meantime, labour inspectors have commenced inquiries with the contractor concerned in this case and have visited both the head office and the site in Moneypoint. Those inquiries are continuing and a further visit is planned. The inspectorate is examining documentation already obtained from the contractor, who has been fully co-operating with the investigation. Additional documentation has been sought and the contractor has undertaken to provide this material without delay.The inspectorate is aware that the ESB, its main contractor for the project, and the subcontractor are working to identify the details of any underpayments that may have occurred and it is understood that these will be rectified. A further audit, on behalf of the ESB, is to take place shortly to ensure that all matters have been corrected. The labour inspectorate will, however, pursue its own checks independently of that process.The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment circulated a discussion document, Mandate and Resourcing of the Labour Inspectorate, to the social partners in early 2005. That document was the basis for further consideration by the employment rights compliance group, ERCG. The ERCG, which was made up of representatives of the social partners, including the CIF and SIPTU, together with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Finance, has completed its report. The report will inform the current national partnership discussions.Some of the key proposals in the report are: a streamlining of access to redress through the existing employment rights bodies, thus enabling individuals with the information and facility to more easily vindicate their employment rights and entitlements; greater emphasis on proper record keeping together with increased transparency regarding pay and the associated information provided to employees on payslips; organisational improvements in the service provided by the employment rights compliance section of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, including the labour inspectorate, which includes a regionalised structure; and major investment in education and information dissemination on employment rights obligations and entitlements for both employers and employees. The resourcing of the labour inspectorate and options to enhance the effectiveness of our employment rights compliance regime are being considered in the current round of social partnership discussions.

CE helps unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and to assist them to enhance-develop both their technical and personal skills. The ring-fencing and prioritisation of places for health related services, including those for persons with disabilities, was introduced in order to maintain the delivery of essential services. As a result health-related service provision levels have been maintained at a constant level.CE remains as an active labour market programme with the emphasis on progression into employment. The programme is managed within this context and with consideration to the needs of participants and the community and the demand for CE resources from those organisations delivering services. Decisions regarding the provision of core funding for the health services generally are not a matter for this Department.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	586	I propose to take Questions Nos. 278 and 282 to 284, inclusive, together.The issue of job creation in Enterprise Ireland supported companies is a day-to-day matter for the agency itself, and not one in which I am directly involved. The Forfás annual employment survey is the indicator used to record jobs gained and lost in Enterprise Ireland in any one year. Figures are published for the previous year on a cumulative basis at the beginning of the following year. However, this survey collates data on employment at county level. There is no mechanism in place to identify employment statistics at a sub-county level. The Forfás employment survey for 2005, giving figures for the period 1996-2005, is now complete and will be published in the coming months.Figures indicate that the total number of full-time jobs created in client companies by Enterprise Ireland and its predecessors in County Wexford in the period 1996 to 2005 amounts to 3,475. On an annual basis, the figures are as follows: 1996: 302 new jobs; 1997: 366; 1998: 303; 1999: 346; 2000: 405; 2001: 371; 2002: 416; 2003: 523; 2004: 178; and 2005: 265. Enterprise Ireland's job creation activity is focused on the creation of new jobs through supporting entrepreneurs setting up new high potential start-up companies, the retention and creation of new jobs in existing companies and in enhancing the innovation capability of Ireland at a national and regional level through support of research in companies and third level institutions. Enterprise Ireland approved funding of over €5.4 million and made payments of over €4.9 million to client companies in County Wexford in the period 2003 to date to assist them with development projects.The development of community based enterprise centres is a crucial part of the drive to create new regional enterprise. Enterprise Ireland has paid in excess of €650,000 in support of the development of community enterprise centres in Tagoat, Wexford, Enniscorthy and New Ross in County Wexford. In addition almost €60,000 has been approved in support of management development in these centres.The centres in Wexford and Enniscorthy have been very successful and are fully occupied at present. I am informed that the centre at Tagoat was not commercially viable, and the centre at New Ross was sold by the local management committee. Feasibility funding of €6,350 was provided for Gorey. However, I understand that the decision of the community in Gorey, at the completion of the feasibility study, was to allow private investment drive the provision of incubation space in the area.As part of its regional development role, Enterprise Ireland works with other agencies in County Wexford to develop the local business infrastructure. During the month of April 2006, Enterprise Ireland, in association with Wexford County Enterprise Board and the South East Business Innovation Centre, will be hosting a First Steps event in Wexford. This programme aims to stimulate interest in entrepreneurship in the county. If there is sufficient interest in the First Steps programme, a 12-session programme called Enterprise Start will then be run in the county.Another Enterprise Ireland initiative to foster start-up companies includes support for the south-east enterprise platform programme run by Waterford Institute of Technology with expertise from Waterford Institute of Technology, Tipperary Institute and external consultants. Graduates are expected to go on to set up new businesses in the region following the programme. Four candidates from County Wexford are participating in the 2005-06 programme. The programme will continue to be promoted in all of the south-east during the coming year.

Where women have accrued the requisite number of contributions required to establish entitlement and they are certified by their employers as entitled to statutory maternity leave, maternity benefit is paid for 20 weeks of their absence from work.Maternity leave and benefit arrangements have been significantly improved in recent years. Most recently, budget 2006 provided for paid maternity leave — and thus maternity benefit payments — to be extended from 18 to 22 weeks. These additional four weeks of maternity leave became effective on 1 March 2006 and will assist some 10,800 women each week. The full year cost of this extension to the social insurance fund will be €32.5 million. A further four-week extension will be implemented in 2007, bringing the total period of paid maternity leave and benefit to 26 weeks. Taken together, the full year cost of the 2006 and 2007 extensions will be €64 million.The cost implications of extending the duration from 22 weeks to 52 weeks while also increasing the payment rate to 100% of reckonable earnings with the existing ceiling would depend on the spread of earnings of those who are claiming. This will require a data extraction of current claims to ensure the reply is based on firm calculations. I will, therefore, write to the Deputy over the next few days with the relevant information.Under the current arrangements maternity benefit is not taxable. The percentage figure of 80% was designed to give a payment corresponding to net pay less tax refunds. If maternity benefit payments were to be assessed at 100% of reckonable earnings, some consideration would have to be given to whether to current tax arrangements would be appropriate.

The effect of the condition is that a person whose habitual residence is deemed to be other than in this State or the common travel area has no entitlement to certain social welfare payments, including supplementary welfare allowance. The question of what is a person's habitual residence for social welfare purposes is decided in accordance with European Court of Justice case law. The condition is not determined on the basis of citizenship, nationality, immigration status or any other factors.The Health Service Executive was contacted regarding this case and has advised that the person concerned was previously refused a rent supplement on the grounds that he did not satisfy the habitual residency condition. The person concerned contacted the HSE and advised that his wife and children had joined him in the State. The HSE advised the person concerned to make a new application for rent supplement and the person concerned was provided with the appropriate application forms. The HSE has advised that the person concerned has not completed and returned these forms. A determination of possible entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance cannot be made until this is done. The HSE has further advised that the person concerned was awarded an exceptional needs payment of €150 to assist with his immediate accommodation costs.

There are 52 independent companies nationwide operating the service and support is provided by MABS National Development Limited, a support company for the service. MABS was established on a pilot basis in 1992 and it has now grown to a countrywide service with a budget of €16.41 million.The programme provides money advice to individuals and families who have problems with debt and who are on low income or in receipt of social welfare payments. It places an emphasis on practical budget-based measures that help people to move permanently from dependence on moneylenders and to access alternative sources of low cost credit, particularly in their local credit union. Many voluntary and statutory bodies such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the community welfare service, credit unions, citizens' information centres, centres for the unemployed, the clergy, Garda, and local authorities work closely with the programme.In November 2005 I informed the MABS national advisory committee that I intended to review the MABS Bill 2002 and invited each of the stakeholders to make submissions to me with a view to producing a more streamlined structure. I have already received a number of submissions. Consultation is continuing and I expect that it will conclude in the near future.The support structure which now exists has been invaluable for management and staff and has been very effective in the areas of community education, social policy and communications. A national system with support at the local level is the direction for the future. The service at present is highly regarded and respected and it is important that this continues to be the case. I intend to have legislation enacted as early as possible following the conclusion of the necessary consultation with the various stakeholders.

Neither I nor my Department has any function in determining entitlement in individual cases.Under section 190(1) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2001, people in full-time education are not eligible normally to receive assistance, including rent supplements, under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. However, there is provision for retention of rent supplement by qualifying social welfare scheme recipients, including people on one-parent family payment, in the specific situation where they resume full-time education after a defined period with the assistance of the back to education allowance scheme. People participating in approved courses under this facility receive a standard weekly rate of payment equivalent to the maximum rate of their relevant social welfare payment and may retain any secondary benefits, such as rent supplements, which may have been in payment prior to participating in the scheme.The Health Service Executive was contacted regarding this case and has advised that the person concerned is in receipt of the correct amount of rent supplement based on her current means and circumstances. If the person concerned wishes to apply for the back-to-education allowance or takes up other education or training opportunities, she should contact her local community welfare officer to clarify her continuing entitlement to rent supplement. It is not possible to establish her possible entitlement in advance of her contacting her local community welfare officer to discuss her particular circumstances.

It is a matter for each local authority to determine if, and where, such restrictions should apply in its area. The restriction does not apply where it is necessary for a vehicle to enter a road solely for the purpose of gaining access or egress from premises accessible only from that road.The offence of contravening article 17 is not scheduled in the Road Traffic Act 2002 to be a penalty point offence and I have no proposals to amend primary legislation to include this offence in the penalty point system. However, it is one of the offences that I am declaring to be a fixed charge offence enforceable by the Garda Síochána from 3 April 2006. A driver who contravenes article 17 will be liable to be issued with a fixed charge notice to pay €60 within a 28 day period or €90 within the following 28 day period in lieu of being prosecuted in court for the alleged offence.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	599	For the purposes of the Road Traffic Acts "public place" means any public road, and any street, road or other place to which the public have access with vehicles whether as of right or by permission and whether subject to or free of charge. Road traffic law does not extend to the use of mechanically propelled vehicles in private property.Section 41 of the 1994 Road Traffic Act and the Road Traffic Act (Section 41) Regulations 1995 set out the law relating to the detention of vehicles by the Garda Síochána in a public place. There are three grounds set out in these regulations and the second and third grounds expressly relate to vehicles that are registered in the State. These grounds are: if the person driving the vehicle refuses or fails to produce there and then a driving licence then having effect and licensing him or her to drive the vehicle and the garda is of opinion that the person by reason of his or her age is ineligible to hold a driving licence to drive the vehicle; the vehicle is registered in the State and the garda reasonably believes that a policy of insurance is not in place for the vehicle; and the vehicle is registered in the State and motor tax has not been paid in respect of a continuous period of three months or more immediately prior to use.The Road Traffic Act 2004 makes it an offence to supply a mechanically propelled vehicle to a person under 16 years of age. With effect from 24 January 2005, a person convicted of supplying a vehicle to a minor faces a fine of up to €3,000 or a term of imprisonment up to six months or to both. Mini-motorised scooters, micro-motorcycles and quadricycles come within the definition of a mechanically propelled vehicle for road traffic law purposes and that supply includes giving a gift. As a result, it is illegal to supply such a vehicle to a person under 16 years of age.A range of requirements must be satisfied in relation to both the vehicle and the driver in order to use a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place. A vehicle when in use in a public place must comply with the requirements of the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations 1963 to 2002 and the Road Traffic (Lighting of Vehicles) Regulations 1963 to 1996. These regulations prescribe the requirements in relation to essential matters such as — brakes, steering, mirrors, safety glass, wipers, headlamps, rear lighting, indicators, reflectors, etc. Some of these small vehicles do not comply with one or more of these requirements and are, therefore, not suitable for use in a public place.A driving licence is required in order to drive a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place. A person under 16 years may not hold a driving licence or a provisional licence. The minimum age for a driving licence for vehicles of category M, which covers mopeds and small motorcycles, is 16 years while for a category B licence, which includes quadricycles, the minimum age is 17 years. It is a further requirement of road traffic law that to use a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place the driver has third party insurance cover to meet personal injury and property damage caused by their negligent driving.The penalties for breaches of the road traffic law in respect of the above mentioned requirements are a fine not exceeding €800 in the case of a first offence, a fine not exceeding €1,500 in the case of a second or subsequent offence, and a fine of €1,500 or to a term of imprisonment not exceeding three months or both in the case of a third or subsequent offence in a period of 12 consecutive months. A person convicted of driving without insurance incurs five penalty points on his or her driving licence. The Garda Síochána can use section 20 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 to perform an examination of the roadworthiness of any vehicle being used in a public place.In addition to the requirements of road traffic law, a mechanically propelled vehicle for use in a public place is required to be registered and liable to motor tax, which are matters for the Revenue Commissioners and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, respectively.

As the Deputy will be aware, in its decision of 18 May 2005 the Government agreed to the State disposing of a majority shareholding in Aer Lingus and retaining a stake of at least 25% to protect strategic interests provided that both myself and the Minister for Finance are satisfied that this level of disposal is warranted on foot of the analysis prepared by the Departments' advisers for the transaction.The decision to dispose of a majority shareholding in Aer Lingus was made following detailed and comprehensive consideration of the issue by myself and my colleagues in Government. The Government agreed in its decision that the strategic development of the State airports and Aer Lingus was essential to underpin Ireland's competitiveness, industry and tourism. Furthermore, its consideration was based on an acknowledgement that the company had an immediate need for access to equity capital to enable it to compete effectively and to fund growth and that this investment could not, and should not, come from the Government. It is precisely because of the strategic importance to Ireland of a wide range of cost effective air services that a third party investment in the airline is being sought. The question of reviewing the Government's decision therefore does not arise

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	603	The Minister for Finance and I are currently considering the report prepared by our advisors on the nature, scale and timing of an investment transaction for Aer Lingus. The advisers report identifies issues that should be resolved in relation to the company's pension schemes. I understand that, on the basis of the most recent actuarial valuation, the Irish airlines superannuation — general employees — scheme is in deficit if provision is to be made for future increases in pensions to reflect growth in the consumer price index, CPI. I also understand that, under the rules of the scheme, there is no guarantee in relation to the granting of increases in pensions. Such increases are entirely at the discretion of the trustees of the scheme. If no such increases were to be paid then the scheme would in fact be in surplus. The scheme is a multi-employer scheme with the Dublin Airport Authority and SR Technics being employer members alongside Aer Lingus. The issue of funding is a matter for the participating employers and the members of the scheme.However, in light of the issues raised in the adviser's report on the Aer Lingus investment transaction, I asked the company to assess the options to deal with the issues. An increase in contributions by the company and employees would be an essential part of any solution. It may be possible, in the context of an overall solution to the pension issue, that the company may utilise some of the equity raised in a transaction for the purpose of meeting part of its commitment to resolving the funding requirements. Based on advice received to date, I do not anticipate any obstacles to implementing a solution along these lines. Recently I asked the company to engage intensively with the trade unions and their advisers in relation to their proposal on the pensions issue. I hope to revert to Government in the coming weeks in the light of the progress in that process.

As indicated in the Road Traffic Act 2002, Part 4, offence reference number 11, the offence concerned is contained in article 19 of the Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations 1997, SI 182 of 1997. A description of each of the five Garda signals involved and the duties of drivers in respect of these are set out in Table C in the Second Schedule to those 1997 regulations. Details of the signals are already set out in the current edition of the Rules of the Road and they will feature in the forthcoming revised edition also.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	605	I propose to take Questions Nos. 302 to 304, inclusive, 306, 309 and 310 together.The legislative framework for the provision of traffic signs is set out in section 95 of the Road Traffic Act 1961, as amended by the Road Traffic Act 1968 and section 37 of the Road Traffic Act 1994. Regulatory provisions underpinning the provision of specified traffic signs are set out in the Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations 1997-2005.The Road Traffic (Signs) Regulations 1997-2005 prescribe traffic signs, which include upright signs, road markings, traffic lights and other devices which may be provided on roads by road authorities, to indicate the existence of a road regulation, to implement such a regulation or to indicate the existence of a provision in an enactment relating to road traffic.Responsibility for the provision, positioning and maintenance of traffic signs on non-national roads is a matter for individual road authorities and, in the case of national roads and motorways, for the National Roads Authority.The Traffic Signs Manual sets out comprehensive directions given to road authorities by the Minister for Transport pursuant to section 95(16) of the Road Traffic Act 1961 regarding the provision and use of traffic signs. A copy of the manual is available in the Oireachtas Library.My Department is currently pursuing a detailed review of the present Traffic Signs Manual in association with the National Roads Authority and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to identify any additions or revisions necessary. It is intended that the use of the revised manual by road authorities will ensure a high quality of signposting in the State through uniformity of practice and the creation of a consistent approach to signing generally.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	607	The offence at reference number 5 relates to contraventions of article 11 of the Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations 1997, SI 182 of 1997, and relates to requirements for turning at junctions. The advice in the current Rules of the Road is that a driver should treat a roundabout as a normal junction which means he or she must yield right of way to traffic approaching on the roundabout. Provisions regarding the use of traffic signs, including roadway markings, are set out in the Traffic Signs Manual. The manual currently is being subjected to detailed examination with a view to having the provisions revised as necessary.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	608	Section 12 of the Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations 1997, SI 182 of 1997, provides the following provisions in relation to the reversing of a vehicle: before reversing, a driver shall ensure that to so reverse would not endanger other traffic or pedestrians; a driver shall not reverse onto a major road from another road; and (3) a driver shall not reverse from a place adjacent to a public road onto a public road save where it is clear to the driver that to so reverse would not endanger other traffic or pedestrians. The term "major" road is not defined in the regulations so the prohibition not to reverse from a side road on to a major road will depend on the prevailing circumstances at any given junction location.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	609	The following projects incorporated the percentage for arts scheme during the period in question: refurbishment of 59 Dawson Street for occupancy by Department of Transport staff; modernisation of seven coastal unit station houses; and 20 road project schemes. The percentage for arts scheme was not included in ten other roads projects, the CIE projects funded by my Department nor in the Luas red and green lines. Expenditure in respect of State and regional airports over the period in question did not provide an opportunity for the public display of artwork. However, the development of terminal two at Dublin Airport will facilitate the display of art work and consideration is also being given to the new facilities at Cork Airport.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	610	The provision of park and ride facilities is an important component in our strategy for attracting people out of private cars and onto public transport, so reducing congestion and improving the environment. Last year I approved the Dublin Transportation Office, DTO, strategy for rail-based park and ride, which envisages facilities at 22 locations on the existing and proposed rail network within the greater Dublin area, GDA. Financial provision for park and ride facilities has been included in Transport 21, and I have indicated that €5 million in capital funding is being made available for suitable park and ride projects in the GDA during 2006.Provided that they are a good fit with the DTO park and ride strategy, applications for funding for specific park and ride projects will be considered by my Department. They will be evaluated according to their business cases on a first come, first served basis, and against the strategic value they offer, as assessed against the DTO strategy. As the principal bodies with interests in the provision of park and ride facilities at the 22 identified locations are already aware of the position, I consider it not necessary to issue a public invitation to apply for funding at this time.

There are 33 qualified motorcycle instructors in place covering most, but not all, of the country. Motorcycle training is also provided by the Dublin local authorities.The necessary amendment to primary legislation to facilitate the introduction of compulsory initial practical training for motorcyclists will be introduced shortly. In the meantime, a working group comprising of motorcycle interests has been considering the appropriate standards that will apply in this area and the standards that instructors must comply with. Overseeing the introduction of such training will be the responsibility of the proposed road safety authority.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	613	Under section 54 of the Roads Act 1993, the National Roads Authority has responsibility for the provision of service and rest areas along motorways.At my request the NRA carried out a review of its policy on the placement of service and rest areas on the major interurban routes. The authority completed this review in January 2006 and has published a policy statement on its website, www.nra.ie. The statement envisages the provision of service and rest areas at regular intervals along both motorways and dual carriageways. These service and rest areas will contain facilities of benefit to both the road haulage sector and the private motorist.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	616	Following Irish Rail's application to me for a railway order for the Kildare route project in October last year, a public inquiry was held from 24 January to 2 February. I am now awaiting the inspector's report of the inquiry.I will make a decision as to the granting of the railway order when I have given due consideration to that report and to the submissions I received in respect of the project. Subject to the granting of the railway order, I understand from Irish Rail that construction will start by the end of this year.The decision to limit the geographic scope of the project to Hazlehatch is based on the view that service provision will be sufficient to meet capacity demands in the medium term beyond 2015. Commuters from the Straffan area will nonetheless be conveniently served by the Hazlehatch station and the park and ride facilities to be developed there as part of the Kildare route project.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	618	The bonus scheme which driver testers are currently availing of applies to additional tests conducted at lunchtimes, in the evenings and on Saturdays. As part of this scheme a target number of tests must be reached before a bonus is payable.A set target productivity level to be reached in normal hours, outside of the additional bonus scheme currently being offered has not been included. The number of driving tests scheduled to be conducted by a driver tester each day depends upon the time of year, the category of vehicle being tested, the test location and if the tester is working overtime. A driver tester's normal working hours are from 9.15 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. In the case of driving tests in cars, eight 50 minute tests per day are normally scheduled. Driving tests in higher category vehicles normally take two car test slots and motorcycle tests are scheduled for an hour. In addition, the schedule of tests is altered during the winter months when testers are scheduled for a test during their normal lunch time to compensate for tests lost due to shorter daylight hours. Tests actually conducted by individual testers are affected by a range of factors which include late cancellations or applicants failing to attend, time allowances for staff to travel to test centres, non-compliance with conditions and weather conditions.

I requested Clare County Council to commission the study and it, accordingly, engaged the consultants.My Department and Clare County Council are in ongoing discussions on the findings of the report and the preferred options therein. The Deputy will appreciate, however, that this, in itself, does not imply a commitment to fund any developments.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	621	The Deputy will be aware that disbursements from the dormant accounts fund are designed to assist three broad categories of persons: those who are socially or economically disadvantaged, those who are educationally disadvantaged and persons with a disability. The Government has approved the allocation of €60 million from the dormant accounts fund in 2006, of which €24 million will be allocated towards projects tackling economic and social disadvantage, €18 million will be allocated towards projects tackling educational disadvantage and €18 million will be allocated towards projects assisting persons with a disability.After consulting the appropriate Ministersand having obtained the approval of Government, I announced details on 4 January 2006 concerning the allocation of €24 million in 2006 for the purpose of supporting programmes and types of projects tackling economic and social disadvantage. Details of the announcement are available on the website of my Department at www.pobail.ie.The roll-out of these measures has commenced and applications are being invited for the specific programmes on a phased basis. On funding for the purchase of school buses, I should point out that no specific measure for this purpose is included in the proposals approved by Government under the economic and social disadvantage category.On the other two categories, educational disadvantage and persons with a disability, the consultation process required under the legislation has now been completed. Proposals which provide for funding of €18 million under each of these categories are in the process of being submitted to the Minister and will be brought to Government shortly for approval.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	623	The European Convention for the Protection of Animals during International Transport (Revised) was made under the auspices of the Council of Europe in November 2003 and was signed by the EU in June 2004.In December 2004 the Council of Agricultural Ministers adopted Council Regulation 1 of 2005 on the protection of animals during transport and related operations. The purpose of this legislation is to set improved standards for welfare of animals during transport.My Department is currently preparing legislation that will give the Council regulation legal effect in Ireland, in the implementation of penalties and provide for the authorisation of Department officers, when it is due to come into operation in January 2007. The provisions of the European Convention for the Protection of Animals during International Transport (Revised) will be taken into account in the context of the proposed new national legislation.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	624	To date, this convention, which was agreed in 1977, has not been signed or ratified by any Irish Government. Nevertheless, the Government approves the general provisions in the convention and continues to ensure through national and EU legislation that, as far as possible, farmers, members of their families and, if relevant, paid employees enjoy social protection comparable to that enjoyed by other population groups.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	625	My Department's statutory responsibility for the welfare and protection of animals refers only to animals kept for farming purposes and does not include animals kept as pets. I will make inquiries on the specific matter raised and will get in touch with the Deputy about it as soon as possible.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	626	I presume the Deputy is referring to the by-product of anaerobic digestion of livestock manures.As part of the arrangements to assist farmers meet the additional requirements of the Nitrates Directive, I have announced my intention to introduce a scheme to support the demonstration of new technologies in reducing the volume of livestock manures or their nutrient content. Under the proposed scheme, financial support will be provided for up to ten projects throughout the State for the installation of such systems, including fluidised bed combustion or treatment plants comprising of anaerobic/aerobic digestion systems.The maximum eligible investment ceiling per project will be €1 million and the total State contribution, at a grant rate of 40%, will therefore be up to €4 million. The scheme will be introduced as soon as the required EU approval has been received.

This application has been successfully processed and the entitlements have been transferred.The person named submitted an application under the 2005 single payment scheme on 16 May 2005. Payment for the amount of €16,515.64 which represented 43.3 entitlements issued on 1 December. A further 9.89 entitlements were transferred on 20 March 2005 as outlined above. A supplementary payment in the amount of €1,474.58 has been processed in respect of the 9.89 entitlements and will issue in the coming days.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	628	Where a person's participation in the early retirement scheme has ceased, because he or she has either completed ten years in the scheme or has reached the maximum age to which the early retirement pension can be paid, it is open to that person to lease his or her land to any party he or she wishes irrespective of whether that party is an eligible farming transferee or not. If the term of the lease extends beyond the date a person's participation in the scheme ends, my Department no longer has any involvement in the matter at that stage and the revocation of such a lease would be a private matter between the lessor and lessee.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	629	The agreement on reform of the EU sugar regime which comes into effect on 1 July 2006 provides for a restructuring fund in respect of the economic, social and environmental costs of restructuring of the sugar industry, involving factory closure and renunciation of quota. In Ireland's case, this fund would be worth up to €145 million. The agreement provides that at least 10% of the restructuring fund shall be reserved for sugar beet growers and machinery contractors. That proportion may be increased by member states after consultation of interested parties provided that an economically sound balance between the elements of the restructuring plan is ensured.Where restructuring takes place in the first year of the new regime, following consultations between the processor and the beet growers an application for restructuring aid, including a detailed restructuring plan for the industry, must be made by 31 July 2006 and a decision on the granting of the aid must be made by the member state by 30 September 2006. Where aid is awarded in respect of restructuring in the first year, payment must be made in two instalments: the first instalment of 60% by 31 March 2007 and the balance by 30 November 2007.The EU Commission is working on detailed rules for the implementation of the restructuring scheme. It is anticipated that the relevant Commission regulation will be adopted in May.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	630	An application under the single payment scheme/disadvantaged area compensatory allowance scheme was received from the person named on 16 May 2005. The application was randomly selected for an on the spot inspection covering area.During the course of the inspection the total area of forage found was less than the area claimed. As the over-declaration was more than two hectares, the area found was reduced for payment purposes by twice the difference between the area found and the area claimed. The area was subsequently reduced for payment purposes to 18.63 hectares.Payment of the reduced amount issued on 13 January 2006. If the person named is not satisfied with the result of the inspection she may seek a review by contacting the local office of my Department. She also has the right to appeal the outcome of any such review.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	631	The following table sets out the number of farmers in each county whose payments under the 2005 single payment scheme had issued by 21 March 2006. The number of applications with outstanding problems, which must be solved prior to payment, is also set out. Payments are continuing to issue to farmers as their applications are processed to completion, in accordance with the EU legislation governing the single payment scheme.It is not possible at this stage to establish the value of entitlements for farmers, who are awaiting payment or a further supplementary payment. This is due to the fact that my Department is processing applications to transfer entitlements by way of inheritance or private contract clause which in many cases were only recently received. In some instances, farmers are still submitting such applications.For the same reasons it is not possible to establish the value of the entitlements not claimed in 2005. My Department wrote to over 10,000 persons, who held entitlements but where no application for the single payment scheme was received by the final deadline of 10 June 2005. However, the receipt of the letter, which was issued to the persons in question by registered post, has resulted in many situations being clarified. In some cases, existing applicants have contacted my Department indicating that they inherited, purchased or leased the lands owned by the farmers who were allocated the entitlements. In other cases the entitlements were associated with a herd number for farmers, who submitted applications under the 2005 single payment scheme using a different herd number or where the details of the herd number were altered by a deletion or addition of a name. It will not be possible to establish the value of entitlements which were not applied on until all the applications for the measures referred to above are received and processed by the Department.On the processing of applications under the single payment scheme, member states may commence payment on 1 December of the year of application, with payments being fully processed by the following 30 June. My priority in 2005, the first year of this new scheme, was to maximise the number of payments to eligible applicants by the earliest date possible of 1 December and I am satisfied that this was achieved. Since then, it has been my absolute priority to ensure that the issues that are holding up the remaining cases are resolved with the applicants concerned and that payments are made without undue delay. To this end, I have arranged that payments are issued on a regular basis as soon as the problems with the outstanding cases are resolved.CountyNo. of SPS applicants paid up to the 21/03/06No. of SPS applicants not yet cleared for paymentCarlow1,70524Cavan4,89973Clare6,122132Cork13,125288Donegal7,871109Dublin67315Galway12,163171Kerry7,668131Kildare2,13741Kilkenny3,56064Laois3,03452Leitrim3,41452Limerick5,30888Longford2,42736Louth1,57023Mayo11,571164Meath3,87059Monaghan4,05370Offaly3,08963Roscommon5,80681Sligo4,02253Tipperary7,144131Waterford2,45772Westmeath3,00934Wexford4,23186Wicklow2,13342Totals12,70612,154

Some 11% of the applications received are still under query with the farmers concerned as my Department has sought additional information in support of their applications. Processing of all applications is continuing and the intention is to make allocations to successful applicants within the next two weeks.The position is that Ireland's financial ceiling under the single payment scheme for 2005 was €1,260 million of which 3% —€37.8 million — had been provisionally set aside to fund the national reserve. The EU regulations require that where the sum of individual entitlements exceeds the financial ceiling, a percentage linear reduction must be applied in order to observe the ceiling. In Ireland's case, the cost of funding successful applicants under force majeure and new entrants during the reference period has meant that the sum of individual entitlements has exceeded our national ceiling by €15.1 million requiring a 1.18% linear reduction of all entitlements. This linear reduction will be accommodated within the 3% already deducted for the national reserve and the remaining 1.82% —€22.7 million — will be used to fund the national reserve.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	633	The person named and the joint owner of the herd number submitted a number of applications under different measures implemented under the single payment scheme in 2005, including applications to transfer entitlements by inheritance, to transfer entitlements from an associated herd number and to convert special condition entitlements to standard entitlements. Following the initial processing of these applications, payment amounting to €5,497.34 issued to the person named and the other joint owner of the herd number. In cases such as this where there are a variety of applications under separate measures, it is necessary to apply to transfer entitlements by inheritance at the end of the process. The inherited entitlements have now been transferred and a supplementary payment will be issued to the applicants by my Department shortly.

However, the applicant's now deceased mother established the remainder of the entitlements during the 2000 to 2002 reference period. As the person named did not submit an application form for the transfer of these entitlements into his name by way of inheritance, the appropriate application form has been sent to him. The case will be processed as quickly as possible when the completed form is submitted to my Department.

The person named recently submitted evidence to my Department to support a claim that the person had submitted an application under the scheme before the closing date for receipt of applications.

Investments can include purchase or long term lease of land, purchase of suckler and or ewe quota or other investments. I will make arrangements for this case to be examined also under this category. It should be noted however that the rules governing the single payment scheme stipulate that an applicant who is found to be eligible under more than one category in the reserve may only receive an allocation of entitlements under whichever category is most beneficial to him or her.More than 23,000 applications for an allocation of entitlements from the national reserve were received when account is taken of farmers who applied under more than one category. Processing of these applications is continuing and the intention is to make allocations to successful applicants at the earliest opportunity. My Department will be in touch with individual applicants as soon as their applications are fully processed. Formal letters setting out my Department's decision will be issued.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	639	This situation pertains to the implementation of the wild birds directive and, as such, is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The Owenduff and Nephin Beg complex, which includes the area in question, have been designated by that Department under both the wild birds and habitats directives.The European Commission secured a judgment against Ireland in the European Court of Justice in June 2002. The case, which was focused on the Owenduff and Nephin Beg area of County Mayo, was taken under the wild birds directive and was about the extent to which the habitat of the red grouse, an annexed species, was compromised by the overgrazing of sheep on commonage. The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government was the lead Department in responding to the court proceedings. Following the judgment against Ireland, a reassessment of the commonage took place, which indicated that the actions taken to deal with overgrazing, involving partial destocking in 2002 under the commonage framework plans, had not been enough to allow the habitat to regenerate. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is, therefore, required to take further steps if Ireland is to avoid a large fine.Destocking under the commonage framework plans was capped at 60% when it was first put into effect. It is now clear, however, that the destocking recommendations must be implemented in full. This will affect approximately 50% of the area in question, where the destocking requirement in the framework plans is greater than 60%. I understand that the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, following consultation with farming representatives, have also advised it will be necessary to have an annual period of total destocking if this area is to regenerate.That Department has notified the European Commission in February of Ireland's intention to implement the full recommended destocking in the commonage framework plans. It has also informed the Commission that it will require farmers to take all sheep off the commonage for a five month period each year, comprising the months of November and December and the period from mid-February to mid-May.Many farmers in this area are in REPS, a condition of which is that they must comply with the commonage framework plans. However, the complete removal of sheep for a five month period is additional to REPS requirements and the farmers are entitled to be compensated for it separately by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Farmers who are not in REPS may seek compensation both for the destocking and for the five month no grazing period from that Department under the national scheme operated by the National Parks and Wildlife Service.REPS is a voluntary scheme and will continue to make a positive contribution to specific environmental objectives. It will continue to complement the actions the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government are taking to deal with this serious situation. It is in the interests of all farmers to ensure that only environmentally sustainable farming practices are carried out on the site because, otherwise there is a risk that payments which are directly linked to environmental benefits will be brought into question.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	640	The implementation of the nitrates directive is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. In December, the Minister made regulations giving legal effect to Ireland's national action programme under the nitrates directive. These regulations were finalised following difficult negotiations between the European Commission and officials of the Departments of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Agriculture and Food. In these discussions, both Departments made use of the advice provided by Teagasc. It was the Commission, however, which determined the final content of the regulations.In January, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government announced a short de facto deferral of part 3 of the regulations, which covers nutrient management, to allow Teagasc to submit revised advice on phosphorus limits. This revised advice has been received and both the European Commission and the Departments are examining it. Officials from the Departments and Teagasc have had preliminary discussions with the Commission on the matter and, while the Commission’s agreement will be required for any amendments that may be proposed to the regulations, I am satisfied that the Commission is open to scientifically robust arguments.A central issue arising from the nitrates directive is the need to secure a derogation which will allow certain farmers to operate, under appropriate conditions and controls, up to a level of 250 kg of organic nitrogen per hectare. The proposal was given an initial presentation to the EU nitrates committee in December and further scientific data have been supplied to the Commission following bilateral discussions. The proposal will need to be discussed again at future meetings of the nitrates committee before approval can be obtained. Securing this derogation is vital for the most productive dairy farmers in particular and it is important that the position on the regulations is clarified at an early date so that the negotiations on the derogation can proceed. I am working with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to bring matters to a quick conclusion so that Ireland can meet its obligations under the nitrates directive while also safeguarding the future of commercial farming in Ireland and the interests of Irish farmers in general.Destocking of sheep from certain commonages has been necessary because of the damage done by overgrazing. Commonage framework plans recommending the appropriate level of stocking for each commonage were drawn up following an agreement in 1998 which allowed for the introduction of the measure A payment in REPS of up to €242 per hectare. A complementary state funded compensation scheme, to be administered by the National Parks and Wildlife Service, has recently been announced by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. In certain areas of the Owenduff and Nephin Beg complex in County Mayo, the failure of the vegetation to regenerate means that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is required to take further steps. I understand that full compensation is available to the farmers concerned.

Under the agreement on reform of the EU sugar regime, the single payment scheme is being extended to cover sugar beet. The sugar reform agreement also provides for the introduction of aid for diversification measures in the event that sugar beet production completely ceases. This aid, worth almost €44 million to Irish growers, will be drawn down in the framework of a national restructuring programme to be elaborated when the Commission's implementing regulation has been adopted.One option which could be considered by farmers is the cultivation of energy crops, such as oilseed rape, for biofuel purposes. The promotion of biofuels is receiving attention by the Government, led by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, in the context of renewable energy policies. The budget announcement of the extension of the excise duty relief scheme to cover, when the relief is fully operational, some 163 million litres of biofuels per year should stimulate the production of crops for the manufacture of liquid biofuels. Under the EU energy crops scheme administered by my Department, aid of €45 per hectare per annum is available for areas sown under energy crops intended for biofuel production. I am seeking to have this scheme made more attractive for producers in the context of discussions on the EU biofuels strategy.

This represents an increase of 1,743 or 16.3% in the personnel strength of the Garda Síochána during that period. I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that the number of Garda personnel, all ranks, attached to each Garda station in County Kildare as of 30 June 2002 and 23 March 2006 was as set out in the following tables.Station30 June 200223 March 2006Naas8085Celbridge1919Clane55Kill33Maynooth1415Kildare2926Robertstown33Kilcullen33Monasterevin32Newbridge2933Rathangan33Carbury22Athy1819Castledermot12Ballytore11Ballymore Eustace1—Leixlip1925Kilcock65Total239251Garda management states that on 18 April 2006 an additional five gardaí will be allocated to the Carlow-Kildare division by way of permanent divisional transfer. In addition, the division's resources are further augmented by a number of Garda national units such as the Garda national immigration bureau, the Criminal Assets Bureau and other specialised units. It is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel throughout and within divisions on a priority basis in accordance with the requirements of different areas. The allocation of such resources is determined by a number of factors including demographics, administrative functions, crime trends and other operational policing needs.Garda management further states that Garda personnel assignments throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed. Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources and that the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public.The timescale for achieving the target strength of 14,000 members of the Garda Síochána in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government remains as when I announced the Government approval in October 2004 for my proposals to achieve this objective. The phased increase in the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 will lead to a combined strength of both attested gardaí and recruits in training of 14,000 by the end of this year. This project is fully on target and will be achieved.As part of the accelerated recruitment campaign to facilitate this record expansion, 1,125 Garda recruits were inducted to the Garda college during 2005. The college will induct a further 1,100 recruits this year and again in 2007 by way of intakes of approximately 275 recruits every quarter. The first incremental increase of newly attested gardaí under the programme of accelerated recruitment took place on 15 March 2006. The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources and, in this context, the needs of the stations referred to by the Deputy will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda stations throughout the country.

The strategy provides for an expansion of the GCVU's vetting service to all organisations which recruit persons having substantial, unsupervised access to children and vulnerable adults. The implementation of the strategy is being overseen by an implementation group on Garda vetting comprising key stakeholders. Preparations are at an advanced stage for the extension of vetting services and, to facilitate this, an additional 17 staff have been provided to the GCVU to more than double its numbers from 13 to 30.In this regard, I am pleased that the GCVU has been successfully decentralised to new, custom-designed office accommodation in Thurles, County Tipperary, from where it will soon commence expansion of its vetting service. Vetting of persons whose country of origin is other than Ireland or who provide an address outside Ireland is dependent upon the timely co-operation of the relevant non-national authorities. Every effort is made by the vetting unit to get this information as quickly as possible.

C visas are granted for visits of less than 90 days. As a consequence, it is not the general policy to extend permission to remain to persons who are admitted initially for a period of 90 days or less on a C visa save in very exceptional and unforeseen circumstances. It would appear that the mother of the individual concerned is seeking an extension of their permission to remain in the State.A wrap-around information sheet accompanies every visa application form. That sheet makes it clear to the applicant that, in general, persons granted visas for particular purposes are not permitted to remain in the State for any purpose other than that for which the visa was granted. Every visa applicant is required to state on the application form the dates on which he or she proposes to enter and leave Ireland. He or she is also required to declare that the information supplied is correct and complete.An application for permission to remain on behalf of the persons who are the subject of this question is being processed by the immigration division of my Department. A decision on this matter will issue to the applicant shortly.

Such applications, which take 24 months to process, are granted at the absolute discretion of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and to qualify to make such an application the applicant must be of full age; be of good character; be married to the Irish citizen for at least three years; be in a marriage recognised under the laws of the State as subsisting; be living together as husband and wife with the Irish spouse; have had a period of one year's continuous residency in the island of Ireland immediately before the date of the application and, during the four years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the island of Ireland amounting to two years; intend in good faith to continue to reside in the island of Ireland after naturalisation; and have made, either before a judge of the District Court in open court or in such a manner as the Minister, for special reasons allows, a declaration in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State.The process of making a declaration of Irish citizenship by a non-national who was married to an Irish citizen — post-nuptial citizenship — was repealed in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 2001 which came into effect on 30 November 2002. A transition provision in that Act, enabling those persons who married before 30 November 2002 to make a declaration, ended on 29 November 2005. On the basis of the information supplied by the Deputy, it would have been open to the person in question to have made such a declaration at any time between 1956 and 29 November 2005. However, this option is no longer available to her.

I initiated the review against a background of a considerable level of public concern about specific selling practices in the property industry, apparent deficiencies in regulatory and supervisory arrangements in respect of service providers and the need to take account of new forms of property services.I published the resulting report in October 2005 and at the same time, I announced that the Government had approved one of its key recommendations, the establishment of the national property services regulatory authority to assume responsibility for the licensing and regulation of all trading entities providing auctioneering, estate agency, property letting and property management services. The formal establishment of the new authority will have to await the enactment of the necessary legislation, which is in preparation at present. However, an implementation group is in place and working to assist and advise on preparations for the new authority including the recruitment of a director, advertised recently in national newspapers; the establishment of a headquarters in Navan; identification of staffing and training requirements; and advance planning of operational matters.A number of the review group's recommendations related to enhancing transparency in property transactions, such as the recording of offers made by prospective buyers, improved record keeping by auctioneers with regard to property transactions, powers of inspection of such records by the regulatory authority, and powers of sanction if appropriate. The new authority will also promote better understanding by the public of the respective roles and responsibilities of the various players in the property market — vendor, buyer, auctioneer etc. — in the interest of enhanced consumer protection.No hard evidence will be available to measure improvements or otherwise in the auctioneering business until the new regulatory authority has been established. However, I was heartened and pleased by the willingness of the relevant representative bodies to engage with the work of the review group, and I am aware that some of its recommendations have already been adopted as best practice in advance of the enactment of the legislation.

One of the specific conditions of the scheme was that persons granted residency on its basis had no entitlement to be joined in the State by other family members. The statutory declaration signed by applicants, including the person who is the subject of this question, stated their acceptance,  inter alia, that the granting of permission to remain does not confer any entitlements or legitimate expectation on any other person, whether related or not, to enter the State. In these circumstances, the application for family reunification by the person concerned cannot be granted.

This represents an increase of 1,743, or 16.3%, in the personnel strength of the Garda Síochána during that period.The number of gardaí serving in Tallaght Garda station in 1997 under the rainbow coalition Government was 136. Furthermore, when I took up office, the number of gardaí serving in Tallaght Garda station was 159. I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that the personnel strength, all ranks, of Tallaght Garda station as at 31 December 2001 to 2005, inclusively, and as at 28 March 2006 was as set out in the table hereunder:YearStrength2001159200215920031662004173200516720/03/06173The station's resources are further augmented by a number of Garda national units, such as the Garda national immigration bureau, GNIB, the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, and other specialised units.It is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel among and within divisions on a priority basis in accordance with the requirements of different areas. The allocation of such resources is determined by a number of factors, including demographics, administrative functions, crime trends and other operational policing needs. The Garda authorities state that personnel assignments throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed. Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.The timescale for achieving the target strength of 14,000 members of the Garda Síochána in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government remains as when I announced the Government approval in October 2004 for my proposals to achieve this objective. The phased increase in the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 will lead to a combined strength, of both attested gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year. This project is fully on target and will be achieved.As part of the accelerated recruitment campaign to facilitate this record expansion, 1,125 Garda recruits were inducted to the Garda College during 2005. The college will induct a further 1,100 recruits this year and again in 2007 by way of intakes to the Garda College of approximately 275 recruits every quarter. The first incremental increase of newly attested gardaí under the programme of accelerated recruitment took place on 15 March 2006. The Garda Commissioner will now draw up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources, and in this context the needs of Tallaght Garda station will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda stations throughout the country.

However, considerable investment is being made, in terms of money, time and effort, to improve the working conditions for all gardaí in stations across the country.The prioritisation of works is dependent on a large number of factors which means priorities are constantly reviewed and updated as circumstances dictate. There are a large number of projects, large and small, which require to be undertaken to address overall Garda accommodation needs. In addition to regular maintenance works, emergency repairs etc., which are addressed as required, works are not always undertaken in order of agreed priority. For instance, the commencement of a project may first be dependent on the successful acquisition of a suitable site for the proposed development, and this militates against the compilation of any static list. Decisions on priorities are taken by Garda headquarters taking into account the merits of the case made by local Garda management and associated reports supplied by the Office of Public Works. Moreover, as part of the Garda building programme process, the agreement of the main Garda representative associations is also sought and obtained.

It is proposed to roll out the new Garda digital radio system this year.As is appropriate in any major technological project, a risk analysis and management strategy is being developed by the Garda Síochána as part of its overall implementation plans to support the system implementation and service migration for when a service provider has been selected. This risk analysis and management strategy, which forms part of the migration and roll-out planning is intended to ensure the minimum of disruption to the service and, as the new technology is implemented, these plans will be kept under review and updated accordingly.I am advised by the Garda authorities that there are a wide range of advantages of digital radio systems over the older analogue systems. Chief among these are the additional security features inherent in digital systems when compared with analogue systems which are prone to be scanned by commercially available scanning devices. In addition, digital radio has a number of key functions relating to improving the safety of officers on operational duties, such as single button emergency calls.The provision of a nationwide system also opens the opportunity for improved communications between groups of officers as required, regardless of their geographical location. It also affords the opportunity for improved efficiency and effectiveness by enabling the number of command and control centres operated by the Garda to be rationalised. In addition, the system will enable cross-Border obligations, as well as international obligations under the Schengen Agreement in the area of improved telecommunications between police forces, to be met.As with any major system such as this, a major investment will require to be made. However, the approach adopted of using the outsourced service provision model is the best in ensuring value for money for the project. In addition, the approach allows for the participation of other blue light and State agencies. This should have the effect of spreading the cost across the Government organisations which will be using the system, as well as providing for cross-agency communication for major incidents.With regard to the specifics regarding security, the type of encryption that falls to be implemented will remain secret for operational reasons. I understand that modern digital radio networks have multiple levels of security which have been adopted internationally by other police forces, and it is planned that these or similar approaches will also be adopted in this jurisdiction to the level that meets with operational needs.

I am pleased to note that the statistics show a decrease of 5.5% in recorded crime when comparing 2004 with 2005, and a decrease of 19.4% when comparing 2002 with 2005.The introduction of the PULSE computer system by the Garda Síochána in 1999 has led to more complete and comprehensive recording of crimes reported than was previously the case. The figures provided for 2000 and 2001 are incomplete due to the phased implementation of PULSE. The first full year captured is 2002 and is a more accurate base year to use.It should be borne in mind that any interpretation of the crime figures should factor in the increase in our population in the past ten years. In 1995, with a population of almost 3.6 million people, there were 29 crimes per 1,000 of the population. In 2005, with a population of more than 4.1 million, there were 24.6 crimes per 1,000 of the population, a reduction of 4.4 crimes per 1,000 of the population. To put this in context, during the two full years of the rainbow coalition Government, with a population of 600,000 fewer than at present, the headline crime figures were 102,484 in 1995 and 100,785 in 1996.2006* (up to 28 February)2005*20042003200220012000RecDetRecDetRecDetRecDetRecDetRecDetRecDetHomicide00000022320055Assault1687051946491581088892814342Sexual Offences0026678562912665022162828Arson0082921431851711113Drugs55212118182927212122221515Theft8022583192624254571173666231370140340142Burglary661328665239592397529079231101215100Robbery00732252844422Fraud14105227543610490130102110898877Other21191316121472012131096Total1835910723801,1345031,0984491,330594881474756420* Figures provided are provisional, operational and liable to change.

It has been assigned reference number 68/1336/06. The file is due to be referred to me in the next few days and I will give consideration to the matters raised in the correspondence that accompanied the Deputy's earlier question. I will advise the Deputy and the person in question when I have made a decision in the matter.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	694	I propose to take Questions Nos. 400 to 403, inclusive, together.Ireland ratified the UNCERD Convention in 2000 and was one of the countries that opted for the Article 14 provision, which allows a right of individual petition to the United Nations, all local remedies having being exhausted. In terms of giving legal effect to the convention, I draw the Deputy's attention to sections 97 to 101 of Ireland's first and second report to the UNCERD committee on the implementation of the convention, which address the issue of international human rights law in the Irish legal framework.As expounded before the UNCERD committee, Ireland is satisfied that the rights and protections afforded by domestic legislation, and in particular the Employment Equality Act 1998, the Equal Status Act 2000, the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989 and the Offences against the State Act 1939 are in substance those rights and protections afforded by the convention and that accordingly, in substance, Irish citizens enjoy the protection of the convention.As the Government made clear in the course of its positive dialogue with the UNCERD committee in Geneva in March 2005, we are happy to co-operate with the UNCERD committee in ensuring that our obligations under the convention are met. Following that dialogue the UNCERD committee issued its concluding observations on Ireland's first and second report. The committee welcomed, in particular, the launch of our national action plan against racism; the establishment of several independent institutions with competence in the field of human rights and racial discrimination; Ireland's comprehensive legislative framework in the anti-discrimination area; the decision to include a question on ethnicity in the next census; the fact that the State has made a declaration under Article 14 of the UNCERD and specific initiatives taken with regard to the Traveller community, including the national strategy for Traveller accommodation and the Traveller health strategy.The Government notes the concerns and recommendations made by the committee and has given its assurance to the committee that it will work closely with its follow-up co-ordinator, Mr. Morten Kjaerum, on the issues raised by the committee. Many of the recommendations of the UNCERD committee are being addressed in the context of the national action plan against racism which forms the cornerstone of the Government's anti-racism and diversity policy.I have recently written to Mr. Kjaerum to inform him that I will be glad to facilitate his visiting Ireland as part of the follow-up process. I expect that such a visit will take place in the next few months. As part of the process my Department will prepare a short report addressing progress on the recommendations in the concluding observations which will be forwarded to the committee secretariat and subsequently made available publicly.With the support of the national action plan against racism, I have added to the Department's ongoing review of incitement to hatred legislation by commissioning research into racism and the criminal law which is being carried out by the law school in the University of Limerick and is due to be completed mid-2006. The research will look at issues around definition of hate crimes and aggravated sentencing. The internal laws of other states on the question of UNCERD are not matters on which I can advise Deputies.

He pleaded guilty to the charge and the case was adjourned until 27 April 2005 when the presiding judge found the facts of the case proved.Arising from the court's findings, the Garda Commissioner proceeded to dismiss the individual concerned from the force in accordance with the provisions of Regulation 40 of the Garda Síochána (Discipline) Regulations 1989.

As the findings of the tribunal were made in private in accordance with regulation 22, it is not Garda policy to disclose in public the specific breaches.I have been further informed that following the recommendation of the tribunal to the Garda Commissioner, the individual was dismissed from the force pursuant to the aforementioned regulations. This decision was appealed to a statutory appeals board, which upheld the dismissal decision.

This represents an increase of 1,743, or 16.3%, in the personnel strength of the Garda Síochána during that period.The personnel strength of all ranks of all ranks of the New Ross, Gorey, Wexford and Enniscorthy Garda districts as at 31 December 1997-2005, inclusive, was as set out in the following table hereunder:District199719981999200020012002200320042005New Ross374037424142414143Gorey636868697679787780Wexford768688818987898690Enniscorthy414340414444444545Garda management states that the provision of statistical information prior to December 1997 can only be given on a divisional basis as all statistics gathered prior to this date were taken from local returns provided on a divisional basis. Each district's resources are further augmented by a number of Garda national units such as the Garda national immigration bureau, GNIB, the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, and other specialised units.The timescale for achieving the target strength of 14,000 members of the Garda Síochána in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government remains as when I announced the Government approval in October 2004 for my proposals to achieve this objective. The phased increase in the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 will lead to a combined strength, of both attested gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year. This project is fully on target and will be achieved.As part of the accelerated recruitment campaign to facilitate this record expansion 1,125 Garda recruits were inducted to the Garda college during 2005. The college will induct a further 1,100 recruits this year and again in 2007, by way of intakes to the Garda college of approximately 275 recruits every quarter. The first incremental increase of newly attested gardaí under the programme of accelerated recruitment took place on 15 March 2006.The Garda Commissioner will now draw up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources, and in this context the needs of the districts referred to by the Deputy will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda districts throughout the country.

Instruction governing the use of firearms and practical tactical training is provided for each firearm on issue to the Garda Síochána. Members must achieve the necessary skills and standards to meet the aims and objectives for each firearms course. There is also an ongoing annual re-certification programme, which includes refresher training.Members of the Garda Síochána who successfully complete the relevant firearms training course are issued with a certificate of competency in the particular firearm. In order to carry a firearm on duty, the member's chief superintendent must issue the member with a firearm authorisation card. I am informed by the Garda authorities that the total number of firearms cards issued for the year ending 31 December 2005 was 3,631.Garda management states that for security and operational reasons it is not Garda policy to disclose the number of members of the Garda Síochána who are registered, trained and licensed to carry and use firearms at district level, as requested by the Deputy.

It should be borne in mind that any interpretation of the crime figures should factor in the increase in our population in the past ten years. In 1995, with a population of almost 3.6 million people, there were 29 crimes per 1,000 of the population. In 2005, with a population of more than 4.1 million, there were 24.6 crimes per 1,000 of the population, a reduction of 4.4 crimes per 1,000 of the population. To put this in context, during the two full years of the rainbow coalition government, with a population of 600,000 less than at present, the headline crime figures were as follows: 1995 — 102,484; 1996 — 100,785.The figures provided for 2000 and 2001 are incomplete due to the phased implementation of PULSE.

I am pleased to note that the table shows a reduction of 37.5% in offences recorded, where a firearm was used in the districts concerned, from 2004-05.The introduction of the PULSE computer system by the Garda Síochána in 1999 has led to more complete and comprehensive recording of crimes reported than was previously the case.

In 1995, with a population of almost 3.6 million people, there were 29 crimes per 1,000 of the population. In 2005, with a population of over 4.1 million, there were 24.6 crimes per 1,000 of the population, a reduction of 4.4 crimes per 1,000 of the population. To put this in context, during the two full years of the rainbow coalition government, with a population of 600,000 less than at present, the headline crime figures were as follows: 1995 — 102,484; 1996 — 100,785.I propose bringing forward a range of measures to strengthen the law governing the control of firearms in the Criminal Justice Bill 2004, which is currently before the House. These new measures include increases in fines and penalties generally for offences under the Firearms Acts and the creation of mandatory minimum sentences, of between five and ten years, for certain firearms offences, including possession of a firearm in suspicious circumstances, possession of firearm with criminal intent, possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life or cause serious injury to property, possession of a firearm while hijacking a vehicle, and use or production of a firearm to resist arrest.In this context I also propose to introduce a statutory basis for an amnesty during which firearms may be surrendered to the Garda Síochána before the proposed new penalties and minimum mandatory sentences are introduced. This will enable those in possession of firearms, who are not in compliance with the legal requirements, to regularise their position, and thus enable the Garda Síochána to concentrate on more serious offenders.Figures provided for 2005 are provisional, operational and liable to change.2005200420032002Garda districtRecDetRecDetRecDetRecDetGorey32521111Enniscorthy10100011Wexford00101100New Ross11102100Total53824322

The detection of one case in an area can lead to a number of cases being reported to the Garda authorities in respect of previous years. It is to be welcomed that victims are now more inclined to report matters to the Garda authorities than was previously the case.

I have further been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength, all ranks, of the Garda Síochána as at 31 December 2002 to 2005, inclusive, was as set out in the following table:YearStrength200211,895200312,017200412,209200512,264The strength of the force rose to a record 12,445 on 15 March 2006 on foot of the first incremental increase of newly attested gardaí under the current programme of accelerated recruitment. This represents an increase of 594 since I took up office in June 2002, when the personnel strength, all ranks, of the Garda Síochána stood at 11,851, all ranks. The timescale for achieving the target strength of 14,000 members of the Garda Síochána in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government remains as when I announced the Government approval in October 2004 for my proposals to achieve this objective. The phased increase in the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 will lead to a combined strength of both attested gardaí and recruits in training of 14,000 by the end of this year. This project is fully on target and will be achieved.As part of the accelerated recruitment campaign to facilitate this record expansion 1,125 Garda recruits were inducted to the Garda College during 2005. The college will induct a further 1,100 recruits this year and again in 2007 by way of intakes to the Garda College of approximately 275 recruits every quarter. The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources, and in this context the needs of all areas throughout the country will be fully considered.

A specific function of the NCSE, through its network of local special educational needs organisers, SENOs, is to identify appropriate educational placements for all children with special educational needs. The SENO is a focal point of contact for parents-guardians and schools. I am advised by the NCSE that the local SENO has not received any correspondence in relation to the child in question and I have arranged for this child's details to be forwarded. Contact with the relevant SENO can be made by contacting the NCSE, Mill Street, Trim, County Meath, telephone number 046-948 6400 or by accessing the NCSE website at www.ncse.ie.

These allocations are made in response to specific applications which are submitted by the relevant VEC in advance of the commencement of the school year to which they relate. The school referred to by the Deputy is in receipt of 1,350 co-operation hours per year to cater for the 59 pupils enrolled. It is open to County Louth VEC to seek additional hours if it is of the view that it cannot cater for the needs of the pupils enrolled from within its current allocation. My Department will give careful consideration to a proposal which demonstrates inadequacy of the allocation based on appropriate utilisation of the school's available resources.

This standardised system replaces all of the existing arrangements for targeting schools for participation in initiatives to address disadvantage. The process of identifying primary and second-level schools for participation in the new school support programme has been completed. As a result of the identification process, 840 schools, serving communities with the highest concentrations of disadvantage, have been invited to participate in the new programme. These comprise 640 primary schools, 320 urban or town schools and 320 rural schools, and 200 second-level schools. Letters of invitation were issued to all 840 schools in late February with a request to complete and return an acceptance form by 10 March 2006. Three primary schools in County Kilkenny, one urban or town school and two rural schools have been invited to participate in the new SSP. The school support programme will bring together, and build upon, a number of existing interventions in schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage.The new action plan is being introduced on a phased basis, starting during the current school year. It will involve an additional annual investment of €40 million on full implementation. In addition, supports will continue to be provided for schools where the level of disadvantage is more dispersed. The process of identifying primary and second-level schools for participation in the new school support was managed by the Educational Research Centre, ERC, on behalf of my Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department's regional offices and the inspectorate. In the primary sector, the identification process was based on a survey carried out by the ERC in May 2005, from which a response rate of more than 97% was achieved. The analysis of the survey returns from primary schools by the ERC identified the socioeconomic variables that collectively best predict achievement, and these variables were then used to identify schools for participation in the school support programme. The variables involved were percentages of unemployment, local authority accommodation, lone parenthood, Travellers, large families with five or more children and pupils eligible for free books.A review mechanism has been put in place to address the concerns of schools that did not qualify for inclusion in the school support programme but regard themselves as having a level of disadvantage which is of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the programme. This mechanism will operate under the direction of an independent person, charged with ensuring that all relevant identification processes and procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review. The closing date for receipt of review applications is 31 March 2006.

However, this school is among the schools receiving additional resources under pre-existing schemes and programmes for addressing concentrated disadvantage and will retain these supports for 2006-07. The efficacy of these supports will be kept under review.As well as the provision being made under the new school support programme for schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage, financial support will be provided for other primary schools where the level of disadvantage is more dispersed. This support will be based on the results of the new identification process and the arrangements which will apply in this regard will be notified to schools early in the autumn.A review mechanism has been put in place to address the concerns of schools that did not qualify for inclusion in the school support programme but regard themselves as having a level of disadvantage which is of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the programme.

The course programme is as follows: stage 1 — 36 weeks based in the NMCI; stage 2 — 15 months sea service training aboard ship; and stage 3 — 35 weeks based in NMCI. A candidate’s eligibility for financial assistance is assessed under the terms of my Department’s third level maintenance grant scheme for trainees, TLT, 2005.Officials in my Department have spoken to officials in Cork Institute of Technology and have been informed that there is a scheme that provides limited financial support for trainee engineering and officer cadets and for other junior officer training. The current scheme provides limited financial support to merchant marine trainees at the National Maritime College of Ireland and is funded by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. These grants cover the cost of mandatory courses and fees that are not covered by the Department of Education and Science and are needed to bring a trainee to his or her ‘Officer of the Watch' certificate of competency.There is also a training grant paid on behalf of the candidate when they are at sea during the course. The grant is paid under the Irish seafarers educational scheme, ISEAS. The administration of the scheme is conducted by the Irish Maritime Development Office, IMDO. The IMDO has confirmed that the financial assistance provided through the ISEAS is a Department of Transport grant for the training of merchant navy cadets, and is managed by the IMDO on behalf of the Department of Transport.Clause 2.1 of the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees, 2005 states as follows:The Vocational Education Committee shall award grants to eligible candidates in accordance with the terms of this scheme. A candidate shall not be eligible to hold a grant under this scheme if she or he holds another award payable from public funds in Ireland or from other EU member states. Such awards payable from public funds do not include awards to candidates under the student assistance fund, the millennium partnership fund and the fund for students with disabilities.As a result candidates on the sea service training aboard ship, stage 2 of the programme, as part of the bachelor of science in nautical science who are in receipt of funding under the Irish seafarers educational scheme, ISEAS, are ineligible to receive funding, for this period of the programme, under the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees 2005.

Each school management authority is required to organise its curriculum, teaching time-table and subject options having regard to pupils' needs within the limits of its approved teacher allocation. The rules for allocating teaching posts provide that where a school management authority is unable to meet essential curricular commitments, my Department will consider applications for additional short-term support.My Department received an application for concessionary hours from the school in question for the 2006-07 school year. This application includes a request for teaching hours to replace the teacher who has been appointed to the home school community liaison post. My Department has made contact with the school authorities regarding this application and a response is currently awaited.

The functions of the agency include, inter alia, the promotion of the Grangegorman site as a location for education, health and other facilities, co-ordinate the development or re-development of the site, engage in the planning process, decide on the appropriate procurement strategy, arrange an appropriate communication strategy and consult with stake holders and relevant interested third parties. My Department has always envisaged that the development of the Grangegorman site has the scope to help facilitate the long-term primary and post-primary needs of the area including those of Dublin 7 Educate Together. However, in tandem with proposed developments at Grangegorman, my Department continues to explore other options for the long-term accommodation of this school.Officials from the school planning section of my Department recently secured agreement from the owners of the premises where the school is currently located that it can remain in its current location for the school year 2006-07. My Department has agreed to carry out identified necessary and urgent improvement works at the building concerned.

These comprise 640 primary schools — 320 urban-town schools and 320 rural schools — and 200 second-level schools. Letters of invitation were issued to all 840 schools in late February with a request to complete and return an acceptance form by 10 March 2006.

The variables involved were unemployment, local authority accommodation, lone parenthood, Travellers, large families, five or more children, and pupils eligible for free books. In the case of second-level schools, the Department supplied the ERC with centrally-held data from the post-primary pupils and State examinations commission databases. Based on an analysis of these data, the variables used to determine eligibility for inclusion in the school support programme were as follows: medical card data for junior certificate candidates, including junior certificate school programme candidates; junior certificate retention rates by school; junior certificate examination results aggregated to school level, expressed as an OPS — overall performance scale — score, which was based on each student's performance in the seven subjects in which she or he performed best and leaving certificate retention rates by school.A review mechanism has been put in place to address the concerns of schools that did not qualify for inclusion in the school support programme but regard themselves as having a level of disadvantage which is of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the programme. This mechanism will operate under the direction of an independent person, charged with ensuring that all relevant identification processes and procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review.

One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of full-time secretaries and caretakers in primary schools, under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. This scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created.This scheme has been superseded by a more extensive grant scheme now referred to as the ancillary services grant. The ancillary services grant provides additional funding for primary schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. The scheme is flexible in nature, giving boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are provided. The standard rate of grant per pupil under the scheme, which was increased from €102 in 2002 to €127 in 2004, was increased by a further €6 to €133 in 2005. The rate is being increased by a further €6 this year, bringing the rate to €139.I have no plans to place school secretaries and caretakers on my Department's payroll.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	726	I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the national council for special education, NCSE, through the special education needs organiser, sanctioned a third teaching post to the school concerned on 21 March 2006 to facilitate the enrolment of specific named pupils pending further investigation into appropriate education provision for these pupils.My Department, in the first instance, is most anxious that all children, including children with autistic spectrum disorders receive an education appropriate to their needs. In this regard the preferred approach to the provision of appropriate education for all children, including children with autism, is through the primary and post primary school network, whether through placement in mainstream classes, in special classes or in special schools.My Department also supports an eclectic approach in regard to the education of children with autism where a range of teaching methods are available, for example, treatment and education of autistic and related communication handicapped children, TEACH, applied behavioural analysis, ABA, and picture exchange communication system, PECS. In this regard, it should be noted that none of the classes sanctioned to the school referred to by the Deputy to cater for pupils with autistic spectrum disorders is classified by my Department as dedicated ABA classes.I will continue to prioritise the issue of special needs education for children with autism and, in co-operation with the NCSE, ensure that all children with special needs are adequately resourced to enable them to meet their full potential.

Officers pursuing approved courses that are relevant to their Civil Service employment may have the appropriate course and examination fees refunded to them.The refund is usually made at the end of each completed academic year or corresponding course period, where it is established, normally by written statement from the institution providing the course, that the officer's attendance at the course was satisfactory, or participated satisfactorily in the course, if it is a correspondence course, during the academic year-period and underwent the relevant examinations or other prescribed tests. My Department has, to date, been in a position to recoup 100% of fees for approved courses. My Department recognises the importance of training and developing its staff and seeks to promote a learning and development culture within the organisation. The Department has a pilot scheme in place for the advance payment of fees for post graduate studies undertaken in the officer's own time and of particular relevance to the Department.Each officer to whom a payment is made is required to undertake, in writing, to refund the payment in the event of leaving the public service before completing one year's service in respect of each academic year or course period for which a payment has been made.

To this end, I am taking measures to ensure as far as possible that the additional accommodation scheme for future programmes can be announced at the earliest possible opportunity in the school year. The demand for additional accommodation in schools has risen significantly in recent years mainly due to the rapid expansion in teacher numbers particularly in the area of special needs, the growth in the school-going population in rapidly developing areas and the demands to cater for diversity.The current focus within my Department is to empower schools to resolve their accommodation needs, wherever possible by way of permanent accommodation. To reduce the amount of temporary accommodation at primary level. An initiative was launched in 2003. The purpose of this initiative is to allow primary schools to undertake a permanent solution to their classroom accommodation needs and to achieve the best value for money. The feedback from the 20 schools in that pilot initiative was very positive and the initiative was expanded considerably in subsequent years to the extent that 75 schools have been invited to participate in the 2006 scheme.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	737	For the purposes of determining grant eligibility under my Department's maintenance grants schemes, all investments must be declared, including deposit accounts, savings certificates, life assurance bonds and other financial instruments where the interest-profit is accumulated and paid out as a lump sum at the end of the investment period.The amount of income to be included in respect of special savings incentive accounts, SSIAs, is the Government grant earned on the savings in the relevant tax year plus in the case of savings accounts, the gross interest earned in the relevant tax year, and in the case of investment accounts, the investment profit earned in the relevant tax year. Investment losses sustained in the relevant tax year are deductible. Where income is paid out annually, as happens with a bank deposit account, the amount so paid is required to be included in reckonable income. Where income is not paid out annually but is "rolled-up" and paid out with the original investment at the end of a defined term, the annual amount required to be included in reckonable income is the "rolled-up" income divided by the number of years in the term of the investment. This procedure has been in place for the past ten years.Given its similarity with "roll-up" savings products, it was deemed appropriate to include, as reckonable income, income from SSIAs on an annual basis. The treatment of the SSIAs in this regard is consistent with the treatment of similar financial products such as post office savings certificates.

These grants are intended to contribute towards the general operating costs of national schools. The capitation grant has been increased substantially in recent years. Since 1997, the standard rate of capitation grant has been increased from €57.14 per pupil to €133.58 with effect from 1 January 2005 and has been further increased by €12 per pupil with effect from 1 January 2006, bringing the standard rate to €145.58. This represents an increase of almost 155% in the standard rate of capitation grant since 1997.Local authority service and other charges payable to the various local authorities do not come within the remit of my Department. It would be a matter for the local authorities to decide the way in which schools pay such charges. Where it is decided that schools are liable for such charges, the cost would form part of the normal running costs of schools and would fall to be met from the capitation funding which schools have received from my Department. It would not be feasible for my Department to introduce specific schemes whereby grant assistance would be provided to schools in respect of individual charges such as water charges.

The first key step for these schools is the appointment of the design team that will design and plan the works.Technical visits are currently being carried out on these projects as part of this process. As soon as that series of technical visits is completed, officials in my Department will be in a position to proceed with other technical assessments such as the case of the two school sites in Callan referred to by the Deputy. My Department will be in direct contact with the school authorities in question when it is in a position to schedule a technical inspection of the buildings concerned.

Retrospective funding was subsequently sought. Since the introduction of the school building and modernisation programme, it is not possible to consider applications for retrospective funding. Accordingly, the grant sought in this case was not approved.The management authority of the school to which the Deputy refers has recently been in contact with officials in school planning section and has agreed to complete an application form for major capital works, Form SLE, as a first step towards assessing the school's infrastructural needs.

This was approved by way of rental of two full sized classrooms, 76 sq.m, one of which was to be sub-divided into three smaller rooms of 16 sq.m each to accommodate the special education teachers.It subsequently transpired that the school proceeded, without sanction, to rent three full sized classrooms. Retrospective approval was sought for the third classroom and this was refused by my Department on the grounds that the school's accommodation requirements were adequately addressed within the original sanction. The school planning section of my Department did not sanction the rental of a third portacabin for September 2005. However, my Department has since approved the rental of two more mainstream classrooms for September 2006 to cater for the increasing enrolments at the school.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	743	My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services in primary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of full-time secretaries and caretakers in primary schools, under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. This scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created.This scheme has been superseded by a more extensive grant scheme now referred to as the ancillary services grant. The ancillary services grant provides additional funding for primary schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. The scheme is flexible in nature, giving boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are provided. The amount of grant paid to a particular school is determined by the enrolment in the school. The standard rate of grant per pupil under the scheme, which was increased from €102 in 2002 to €127 in 2004, was increased by a further €6 to €133 in 2005. The rate is being increased by a further €6 this year bringing the rate to €139.The school referred to by the Deputy has been invited to participate in the school support programme under DEIS, delivering equality of opportunity in schools, and will qualify for additional human and financial resources under this programme.

Funding from my Department is provided on an annual grant-in-aid basis to the national youth council of Ireland, NYCI, which administers both programmes.With regard to the national youth arts programme, the NYCI employs a youth arts co-ordinator to implement the programme. In 2005, my Department made additional funding available to this programme to expand its existing programmes and services as recommended in its strategic plan for 2003-06. Owing to the lack of office accommodation at the NYCI, some of the extra work load was sub-contracted to specialists within the sector as required.With regard to the national youth health programme, the NYCI currently employs two full-time and one part-time staff to operate this programme. In addition, five contracted trainers are engaged to deliver aspects of the programme. Additional funding was provided by my Department in 2005 towards the cost of additional staffing and the development of this programme. The additional work in 2005 was carried out on a contract basis.I emphasise that the work of these programmes is being carried out as planned and that it is the intention of the NYCI to employ additional staff to be housed within the NYCI to carry out some elements of the work which is currently sub-contracted, as and when space permits.

Before committing significant capital resources at the school a review of the long-term projected enrolment on which the extent of accommodation is determined is under way. As part of this review factors considered are current and projected pupil numbers at the school, the likely impact of housing developments and existing provision in the general area. A decision will then be taken on how best to provide for current and emerging needs. My officials will be in correspondence with the school authority in this regard.The Deputy will be pleased to know that school's application for grant aid under the summer works scheme 2006 for the upgrade of the home economics room was successful.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	750	The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued to all primary schools each year.According to data submitted to my Department by the board of management of the school referred to by the Deputy, the enrolment in the school on 30 September 2005 was 77 pupils. In accordance with the staffing schedule, circular 0023/2006, which has issued to all primary schools and is also available on my Department's website at www.education.ie, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2006-07 school year will be a principal and two mainstream class teachers. The school will also have a shared learning support-resource teacher based in the school.Within the terms of the current staffing arrangements for primary schools, there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year. Under these arrangements, a developing school post may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30 September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure. If the specified figure is not achieved on 30 September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.It is open to the board of management to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent appeal board which was established to adjudicate on appeals on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools. Details of the criteria and application dates for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule. They are also available in circular 0024/2006, appeal board for mainstream staffing in primary schools, which is available on my Department's website. Hard copies of this circular have issued to primary schools.It is proposed that the first meeting of the appeal board be held in May 2006. Further meetings will be held in July and October 2006. The closing dates for receipt of appeals are 12 May, 24 June and 18 October, respectively. Appeals must be submitted to primary payments section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, on the standard application form, clearly stating the criterion under which the appeal is being made. The standard application form is available from the primary payments section or on my Department's website. The appeal board operates independently of the Minister and the Department and its decision is final. I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in the operation of the independent appeal board.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	751	I propose to take Questions Nos. 487 and 488 together.The information as sought by the Deputy is not readily available in this format within my Department. However, if the Deputy wishes to obtain details in respect of a specific school, I will be happy to provide them.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	752	The Education Act 1998 requires all schools to have in place an admissions policy, detailing admission to and participation in the school, and to ensure that as regards that policy, the principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents' choice are respected.In formulating its admissions policy, a school must ensure it is lawful. In particular, it must act in accordance with section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000 which, subject to very limited exceptions, prohibits schools from discriminating against people in respect of a number of matters, including the admission or the terms or conditions of admission of a person as a student to the school.My Department has issued an information booklet to schools entitled Schools and the Equal Status Acts. The booklet identifies ways in which the rights conferred and the duties imposed by this legislation, together with the education legislation, can be used as building blocks for the creation of an inclusive school.Currently, under section 29 of the Education Act 1998, parents of a student who has been refused enrolment in a school may appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department. Such appeals are dealt with within 30 days of their receipt and where an appeal is upheld, the Secretary General is empowered to direct the school to enrol the student.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	753	I propose to take Questions Nos. 490 to 494, inclusive, together.The Deputy's questions refer to the procedures for hearing and determining appeals under section 29 of the Education Act 1998 in respect of VEC Schools. Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 provides that an appeal may be made to the Secretary General of my Department against the decision of a board of management, or a person acting on behalf of the board, to permanently exclude a pupil, suspend a pupil for a period which would bring the cumulative period of suspension to 20 school days in any one school year or refuse to enrol a child.An appeal under section 29 of the Act is therefore, ultimately, an appeal to the Secretary General of my Department. Section 29(9) of the Act provides that in the case of a school which is established or maintained by a vocational education committee that the appeal shall lie, in the first instance, to the vocational education committee and thereafter to the Secretary General.In accordance with section 29(10)(a) of the Act, I have prescribed the procedures for appeals to vocational education committees. Paragraph 9 of the procedures provides that “a maximum period of 30 days from date of receipt of the appeal by the CEO is allowable in the vocational sector for conclusion of the appeal process”. Paragraph 29 of the procedures provides that the CEO “will, in writing, and within the 30 days allowed for conclusion of the appeals process, notify both parties of the determination of the appeal, the reasons therefore, and where necessary, will issue such directions as he/she considers to be expedient for the purpose of remedying the matter which was the subject of the appeal”. This paragraph further provides that “the CEO will, simultaneously advise the appellant of the right of, and timeframe for, further appeal to the Secretary General”. There are no circumstances under which the 30 days provided for determination of the appeal by the vocational education committee may be extended. Paragraph 31 of those procedures provides that “if the appellant remains unhappy with the outcome of this process he or she has an entitlement to make an appeal directly to the Secretary General”.As an appeal under section 29 is, ultimately, an appeal to the Secretary General of my Department, it is possible that my Department would have to consider the admissibility of an appeal even if that appeal had been deemed inadmissible by the CEO of a vocational education committee. If such an appeal was found to be admissible in accordance with the procedures then the appeal to the Secretary General would be admitted.Paragraph 15 of the procedures requires each vocational education committee to form an appeals sub-committee for the purposes of hearing and determining appeals. Under section 31(13)(d) of the Vocational Education (Amendment) Act 2001, the confirmation of an act of a sub-committee is a reserved function.Vocational education committees are not required to provide details to my Department on the number of cases in which the 30-day rule as set out in the procedures have not been complied with. However, in order to fully address the Deputy's question, my Department will write to each vocational education committee, requesting this data and the information will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.Completion of a review of the procedures was deferred pending the work of the task force on student behaviour in second level schools. I launched the final report of the task force, School Matters, on 14 March 2006. The report recommended that the section 29 legislation be amended to stress the rights of the compliant majority to learn, while at the same time protecting the rights of the persistently disruptive student to an education. It also recommends that the timeframe involved in these appeals be looked at. In launching the report, I indicated that I intend to review existing legislation in order to take account of the task force recommendations and I will bring forward amending legislation as soon as this review is complete.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	755	I propose to take Questions Nos. 497 and 500 together.My Department derives its information in regard to computer-pupil ratios at both primary and post-primary schools from censuses carried out by the National Centre for Technology in Education. Three such censuses have been completed, in 1998, 2000 and 2002.The latest statistical data available to my Department in respect of pupil-computer ratios is the autumn 2002 census. This found that the average pupil-computer ratio in primary and post-primary schools was 12:1, down from 37:1 in 1998, and 9:1, down from 16:1 in 1998, respectively. A county by county comparison was not taken at the time of the census and, therefore, is not available to me.A further census has been taken in 2005 and a report of the information gathered in this connection is being finalised by the National Centre for Technology in Education, in conjunction with the Education Research Centre. This will be submitted formally to me in the near future and will include a county by county comparison of pupil-computer ratios. I hope to be able to publish this report shortly thereafter.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	756	The objective of the ICT in schools programme is to ensure that all students have the opportunity to achieve computer literacy and to acquire the necessary skills for participation in the information society. The major focus for my Department under the programme at present is the roll out of broadband connectivity to all recognised schools. This project is being undertaken in partnership with industry, following the establishment of a three-year €18 million joint Government-IBEC-TIF, telecommunications and Internet federation, fund to fund local connectivity at school level.The broadband connectivity is being provided via a schools national broadband network, supported by HEAnet, in order to provide managed Internet access, e-mail, security controls and content filtering. A broadband support service is being managed by the National Centre for Technology in Education to assist schools with advice and information relating to the roll-out and ongoing use of their broadband connectivity within the schools network. The roll-out of broadband connectivity to 3,925 schools commenced last June and is due to be completed shortly. The overall costs of the schools broadband access programme, incorporating the local connectivity at school level, the national network and the service desk, are in the region of some €30 million over the initial set-up and ongoing costs over the three years.The schools broadband access programme builds on the investment by my Department in grant aiding schools to develop their internal networks. Since December 2004, over 3,700 schools have received grants to develop their networking facilities at a cost of €20 million. The development of internal networking facilities in schools is critical to supporting schools' full exploitation of the potential offered by broadband connectivity and the efficient use of computer software.In the area of curriculum development, the NCCA is currently developing an ICT framework to provide a structured approach to ICT in the curriculum and assessment for teachers of students during compulsory education. The framework will identify key learning experiences with ICT which all students should achieve by the end of the compulsory education. The new leaving certificate syllabi in technology and design and graphics are also coming on stream from the 2007-08 school year.My Department is examining the future priorities for the ICT in schools programme. This work is being complemented by a census of ICT infrastructure which was undertaken by the National Centre for Technology in Education and will complement the earlier studies undertaken in 1998, 2000 and 2002. The report of the census is being finalised and I hope to publish the results shortly. Furthermore, my Department's inspectorate is conducting an evaluation of the impact of ICT on teaching and learning in primary and post-primary schools. It is envisaged that the overall evaluation will be completed by mid-2006.

This project is being undertaken in partnership with industry, following the establishment of a three year €18 million joint Government-IBEC-TIF, telecommunications and Internet federation, fund. Following a competitive public procurement process, contracts were finalised with a number of service providers for the provision of local broadband access to 3,925 schools. A further 75 schools' broadband connectivity was being advanced separately under two pilot projects.The following table outlines the numbers of schools by county which have either had their basic connectivity service installed and their router installed, either under the contractual arrangements or under the two pilot projects. As can be seen, over 80% of schools have had their broadband connectivity installed to date. It is expected that vast majority of the difficulties encountered in the remaining schools, either as a result of the failure of the initial technology selected or having regard to other local issues, will be addressed over the coming weeks.County DistrictNo. SchoolsInstallation of Basic ConnectivityInstallation of RouterCarlow524745Cavan908379Clare137121119Cork455405388Donegal202179163Dublin646536512Galway284251238Kerry171136135Kildare127110100Kilkenny947877Laois775856Leitrim504545Limerick183163160Longford504746Louth907366Mayo210188180Meath12510690Monaghan766959Offaly806861Roscommon1037871Sligo866261Tipperary196163161Waterford967775Westmeath927054Wexford1248382Wicklow10493874,0003,3893,210

These grants are intended to contribute towards the general operating costs of schools which would include heating, lighting, cleaning, insurance, painting, teaching aids and other miscellaneous charges. It would not be feasible for my Department to interfere in the costing and billing of ordnance survey maps for schools.The capitation grant has been increased substantially in recent years. Since 1997 the standard rate of capitation grant has been increased from €57.14 per pupil to €133.58 with effect from 1 January, 2005 and has been further increased by €12 per pupil with effect from 1 January 2006, bringing the standard rate to €145.58. This represents an increase of almost 155% in the standard rate of capitation grant since 1997. The latest increase in the level of capitation grant is a clear demonstration of my commitment to improve the financial position of primary schools.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	760	The Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act was enacted in July 2004. On 14 July 2005, sections 1, 2, 14(1)(a), 14(1)(c), 14(2) to 14(4), 19 to 37, 40 to 44 and 50 to 53 of the Act were commenced. Separate establishment day orders were made in respect of the National Council for Special Education and the Special Education Appeals Board, setting their establishment dates as 1 October 2005 and 3 April 2006 respectively. A further commencement order was signed to commence sections 45 to 49 with effect from 1 October 2005 abolishing the council established under section 54 of the Education Act 1998 and replacing it with the council established under the 2004 Act. These sections could not come into effect prior to the establishment of the new council under section 19 of the 2004 Act.The remaining sections — 3 to 13, 14(1)(b), 14(1)(e), 14(1)(f), 15 to 18, 38 — relate mainly to the statutory assessment and education plan process for which the Act provides. These cannot come into effect without the council having an opportunity to present an implementation report to the Minister which it must do before 1 October 2006. On 21 October 2005, the National Council for Special Education published a call for submissions in the national media on the implementation of the Act. The closing date for submissions was 13 January 2006. The council is now in the process of drawing up its implementation report which it will submit to my Department by 1 October 2006. That report will provide a costed timetable for the implementation of the various provisions of the Act over a five-year period.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	761	The Deputy will be aware that, with effect from 1 January 2005, the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, has taken responsibility for processing applications for resources in respect of children with disabilities who have special educational needs at primary and post-primary levels. Under these arrangements, the NCSE, through local special educational needs organisers, SENOs, processes applications for resources from schools and informs the schools of the outcomes.My Department provides a range of supports to second level schools to enable them to cater for students with special educational needs transferring from primary level. The supports in question include remedial and resource teaching support, special needs assistant support and funding for the purchase of specialised equipment. The NCSE is not in a position to advise my Department as to the numbers of pupils in primary schools in receipt of supports nor the numbers transferring to second level schools in the coming years. However, I can say that there has been enormous progress made over the past number of years towards increasing the number of teachers in our schools who are specifically dedicated to providing education for children with special educational needs. At second level, approximately 1,653 whole time equivalent additional teachers are in place to support pupils with special educational needs. This compares to the approximately 200 teachers that were in place in 1998 for such pupils. In addition, there are 532 whole time equivalent learning support teachers and approximately 1,102 whole time equivalent special needs assistants, SNAs, in second level schools.The precise model of provision made available at second level will depend on the assessed needs of the pupils involved. Some students are capable of attending ordinary classes on an integrated basis with additional teacher and-or special needs assistant support. In other cases, placement in special dedicated classes or units attached to the school may be the more appropriate response. Such special classes operate at significantly reduced pupil-teacher ratios. Students availing of these special classes may be facilitated in attending ordinary subject classes on an integrated basis wherever possible.My Department will continue to ensure that the necessary resources are made available for the education of children with special needs. I am confident that the advent of the NCSE will prove of major benefit in ensuring that all children with special educational needs receive the support they require when and where they require it.

As I indicated in my statement on 29 September 2005 concerning this matter, it is my intention that the first bundle of schools under my Department's PPP programme will be offered to the market in the first half of 2006 and regularly thereafter in the period 2006 to 2009 to ensure a steady flow. The precise make-up of the bundles in terms of the number of schools in each, the geographical spread and the timing for delivery will be determined by my Department in consultation with the centre of expertise established within the NDFA.With regard to the preliminaries for the new school in Gorey, my Department is in discussion with the local authority on the identification of a suitable site for the school. At the appropriate time, my Department will be engaging with the relevant education partners as regards the process and arrangements that will be required to ensure a smooth transition from a one-school centre to a two-school centre. Part of this process will involve defining the enrolment policies and catchment areas that will underpin effective provision once Gorey becomes a two school centre and also the enrolment policy that should operate at the existing post-primary school during the transition period.

The Deputy will be aware that the Government, on 15 July 1998, approved a programme of evacuation and sale of six barracks considered surplus to military requirements. The barracks in question were located at Ballincollig, Fermoy, Castleblayney, Naas, Kildare and Islandbridge, Dublin.The sale of approximately 97 acres at Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig, was completed in 2003 for a total of €42 million. The bulk of the lands were purchased by O'Flynn Construction. The sale of a site comprising circa 2.7 acres to the HSE for €1.73 million was completed in December last. It was agreed at the time that an area comprising approximately 27 acres at Murphy Barracks would be transferred to Cork County Council for community use and the legal formalities in this regard are progressing. A site of half an acre has been set aside on foot of a request from the Office of Public Works, OPW, for a plot of ground to facilitate an extension of the existing Garda station located on Main Street, Ballincollig. A total of 19.218 acres at the former Fitzgerald Camp, Fermoy, were sold to Cork County Council in 2001 for €973,889 for development in conjunction with IDA Ireland. Castleblayney Military Post, County Monaghan, comprising circa ten acres, was sold to the former North Eastern Health Board for €761,843 in 2002.A total of seven acres at Devoy Barracks, Naas, was ceded free of charge to Naas Urban District Council, while a further 14 acres were sold to that authority for €8,888,167. The balance of the barracks lands — one acre — was sold to Kildare County Council for €380,921 in 2002. Clancy Barracks, Islandbridge, Dublin, comprising approximately 13.65 acres, was sold to Florence Properties Limited for €25.4 million in 2004.The Government decided on 1 July 2003 that Magee Barracks, Kildare, would be among the State lands released for inclusion in the Sustaining Progress affordable housing initiative. This initiative is being targeted at those who in the past would have expected to purchase a house from their own resources but find that they are unable to do so in the current market. There are no plans to close further barracks. The Department's property portfolio is, however, kept under continual review and any properties surplus to military requirements will be disposed of to fund much needed investment to meet the equipment and infrastructure needs of the Defence Forces.

He opted out of membership of the scheme on its introduction in 1978 and, when given a second opportunity to join the revised scheme in 1985, again chose not to do so. I understand that the person concerned is in receipt of a widow's contributory pension under the Social Welfare Acts.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	767	The Reserve Defence Force, RDF, is a volunteer force and, as such, the relationship between members of the reserve and the Department of Defence is not comparable to a normal employer-employee relationship. The reserve is currently undergoing major reorganisation. The White Paper on Defence outlines the blueprint for a new Reserve Defence Force and an implementation plan has been developed that will ensure the realisation of the White Paper vision. This is being rolled out over the period to end 2009.The RDF has already seen significant improvements in terms of clothing, equipment, training and resourcing. It is now organised along similar lines to the PDF and the introduction of the integrated element of the reserve is being addressed. All of these changes will enhance the capabilities of the RDF as well as improving interoperability with the PDF.One recommendation of the implementation plan is to give the reserve personnel operational experience and improve the integration with the PDF by the use of security duty. All aspects of the deployment of the RDF are being reviewed in the lifetime of the implementation plan. This includes the use of the RDF for security duty and other issues such as participation on overseas missions. The applicability of employment legislation in the case of volunteers will also be considered. At present, where reserve personnel perform security duties, they are paid the appropriate allowances as paid to their Permanent Defence Force counterparts. A table outlines the rates paid to members of the Reserve Defence Force in the rank of private, corporal and lieutenant who perform a 24-hour security duty.RankSecurity Duty PaymentPrivate€112.31 Monday-Saturday€136.93 Saturday€161.53 Sunday and Defence HolidaysCorporal€124.90 Monday-Saturday€149.52 Saturday€174.12 Sunday and Defence HolidaysLieutenant€157.51 Monday-Saturday€182.62 Saturday€207.65 Sunday and Defence Holidays
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	768	I propose to take Questions Nos. 513 and 514 together.I am very satisfied that military training techniques and equipment, operated by the Air Corps and the Naval Service are up to date in all respects. Air Corps and Naval Service training plans are structured to provide the capabilities needed to execute the roles assigned to them under the White Paper on Defence. Priority is given to operational tasks in Ireland. However, both services also keep abreast of developments at international level by regular attendance at training courses and seminars at home and abroad. This enables them to adjust their training schedules if necessary in order to maintain standards.The unprecedented level of expenditure for the Army, the Air Corps and the Naval Service was made possible by the Government's decision that pay savings arising from the reorganisation of the Defence Forces set out in the White Paper, with proceeds from the sale of surplus properties, would be reallocated for investment in modern facilities and equipment. Investment in new equipment for the Air Corps and Naval Service is provided for under certain subheads of the Department of Defence Vote relating to aircraft, ships and naval stores. Both services have benefited from the investment in new equipment.The Air Corps fleet has been augmented in recent years by the addition of the following aircraft: eight Pilatus PC9 aircraft for pilot training and two Eurocopter EC 135 light utility helicopters for pilot training, and an order was placed in 2004 for the purchase of four Augusta AB139 utility helicopters for troop transport. Two of these will be delivered in 2006 and the remaining two in 2007. The Naval Service operates a fleet of eight vessels for fishery protection purposes. As each vessel nears the end of its serviceable life, arrangements are made to replace it with a new vessel. This ensures that the Naval Service has the capability at all stages to perform its tasks. The equipment issued to the Air Corps and the Naval Service is in keeping with the most modern requirements and the highest international standards. The ongoing investment in the Defence Forces will ensure that this remains the case.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	769	I propose to take Questions Nos. 516 and 517 together.The Garda Siochána has primary responsibility for law and order, including the protection of the internal security of the State. The potential threats to the State arising from terrorism are continuously monitored by the Garda in co-operation with the Defence Forces. It is important that all prudent precautions are taken and that matters are kept under continuous review. The objective of the Government is to ensure that all State bodies can react quickly and efficiently to any large-scale emergency irrespective of whether it arises from an act of terrorism or from a man made or natural disaster. The key issue in respect of responding to any terrorist attack is to have in place appropriate and effective plans to respond to the impact of that attack and to protect the civilian population.The Government task force on emergency planning has worked since it was set up in 2001 to co-ordinate emergency planning and response arrangements across those Departments that lead and support the State's response in an emergency. The focus of this work continues to be on making the necessary arrangements to, at best, prevent or, at least, minimise the risks from terrorist activities, ensuring that the protection available to the Irish people is maximised, putting mechanisms in place to support the response agencies and providing coordination for maximum efficiency and effectiveness.The Defence Forces make contingency plans for a range of scenarios where the security of the State may be at risk. In addition, the Defence Forces have contingency plans in place regarding the provision of aid to the civil power, meaning in practice to assist, when requested, the Garda Siochána, and the provision of assistance to the civil authorities for a range of emergency situations. The Defence Forces have available to them equipment for monitoring and protecting their members in dealing with nuclear, biological or chemical, NBC, threats identified from time to time. They hold an extensive range of modern NBC equipment that meets their current requirements. This range includes approximately 9,500 NBC suits, of which 800 were delivered in January 2006. In addition, the Defence Forces has sufficient stock of respirators for each individual soldier. They also have 98 of the most technologically up to date chemical agent monitors and Defence Forces personnel have been trained on their operation. Other equipment on hands includes biological agent detector and screening kits, group decontamination equipment and personal decontamination equipment. The requirement for additional NBC equipment is kept under continuous review by the Defence Forces. A programme for the purchase of NBC equipment is ongoing and whatever equipment deemed necessary is purchased expeditiously to meet the changing requirements.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	770	The acquisition of new equipment for the Defence Forces continues to be a key focus for me. I am aware that significant investment has taken place in recent years and I intend to continue the good work in that regard. The unprecedented level of expenditure on equipment for the Army, the Air Corps and the Naval Service was made possible by the Government's decision that pay savings arising from the reorganisation of the Defence Forces set out in the White Paper of 2000, with proceeds from the sale of surplus properties, would be reallocated for investment in modern facilities and equipment.Investment in new equipment for the Defence Forces is provided for under various subheads of the Department of Defence Vote relating to defensive equipment, mechanical transport, aircraft, ships and naval stores, engineering, communications and information technology equipment, etc. All elements of the Defence Forces — the Army, the Air Corps, the Naval Service and the Reserve Defence Force — have benefited from the investment in new equipment. The equipment issued to the Defence Forces is in keeping with the most modern requirements and the highest international standards. The ongoing investment in the Defence Forces will ensure that this remains the case.

Discussions with other like-minded nations on a potential contribution by Ireland to a battle group have now commenced. A delegation consisting of representatives from my Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Defence Forces met their Swedish counterparts in Stockholm on 9-10 March to discuss possible participation by the Defence Forces in the Nordic battle group. My intention would be to discuss our options with a range of countries, in particular like-minded nations. We have also had informal exploratory discussions with Finland and Austria. Apart from these discussions, I have had no other discussions with my EU colleagues or UN representatives in the matter of Irish participation in EU or UN-sponsored peacekeeping or peace enforcement missions in the future.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	772	My Department does not collect statistics on sales of second-hand houses. However, data on loans paid out for second-hand houses and their average prices are available in the housing statistics bulletins, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library and on the Department's website at www.environ.ie.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	773	The results of the March 2005 housing needs assessment regarding homelessness are being finalised by my Department. It is anticipated that the results of this assessment will be published in the Department's annual housing statistics bulletin. This information will include a breakdown of the numbers of homeless adults and children, respectively, by county.Policy on homelessness among persons of under 18 years of age is primarily the responsibility of the Department of Health and Children in the context of the Government's youth homelessness strategy. Local authorities are responsible for meeting the accommodation needs of homeless persons. It is consequently a matter for individual authorities to determine the level of accommodation to be provided, having regard to the need for such accommodation within their areas. My Department recoups to local authorities 90% of their expenditure on the provision of accommodation related services for homeless persons in accordance with the provisions of section 10 of the Housing Act 1988. Expenditure in this regard in the period 2000-05 came to €230 million. However, my Department does not maintain a comprehensive listing of hostel and other accommodation provision for homeless persons in each individual local authority area.The independent review of the implementation of homeless strategies, which I published recently and copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library, examined the implementation of the Government's integrated and preventative homeless strategies and concluded that they should be amalgamated and revised. The review acknowledges that, while emergency accommodation, such as hostels, is largely sufficient in the major urban centres, it should continue to be provided to address outstanding requirements in other areas. The Government has accepted the broad thrust of the recommendations of the review and work has commenced on the preparation of a revised and updated strategy on homelessness, having regard to the recommendations of the independent review.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	775	My Department does not provide specific funding to local authorities for the upgrading of kitchen units in their rented houses. However, in cases where my Department provides funding for overall refurbishment work to schemes of houses in need of remedial works, the upgrading of kitchen units is, where necessary, included as part of the refurbishment work. In other instances where the upgrading of kitchens is undertaken as a normal maintenance requirement, funding would fall to be provided by local authorities from their own resources as part of their ongoing maintenance programmes.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	776	In addition to the strengthened and simplified enforcement regime introduced by the Planning and Development Act 2000, the Government has increased the resources available to planning authorities to carry out all their planning functions, including enforcement. Planning authorities' staffing levels increased by more than 40% in the years 2000-04 from 1,333 to nearly 1,867 full-time and part-time staff based on local authority returns submitted to my Department. Planning authorities are now also entitled by virtue of the 2000 Act to require any person served with an enforcement notice to refund to them the costs and expenses incurred in investigating the infringement and issuing the enforcement notice. Any fine imposed by a court for a planning infringement must also be paid directly to the authority. Given the above significant increases in staffing, I am satisfied that local authorities are prioritising this sector for staff deployment.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	777	Under the urban and village renewal measures of the current regional operational programmes, available funding may be drawn down in the period to 2008 in respect of projects approved this year for grant assistance. Proposals for a subsequent grants scheme for urban and village renewal are under consideration in the context of the next national development plan.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	778	The serviced land initiative assists local authorities to provide water services facilities, primarily as extensions to existing water supply and waste water collection systems, to increase the supply of serviced land available to meet established demand for new residential development. My Department provides 40% of the approved cost of individual schemes and there are no proposals at present to increase that funding rate.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	779	The Government's national water services pricing policy framework requires local authorities to recover the cost of providing water services from the users of these services, with the exception of householders. The capital cost element of a water services scheme related to domestic users is normally funded in full by the Exchequer through the water services investment programme.The capital contribution for non-domestic use is calculated on a basis related to the marginal cost of providing additional water services capacity. The marginal capital cost of providing the non-domestic capacity of each scheme may be recovered by a local authority in a number of ways. First, where new or additional capacity is required for a particular large scale user, the local authority may seek an appropriate contribution to the cost from that user. Second, the local authority may borrow necessary capital and recover the cost of such borrowing through the water charges on all non-domestic users within their administrative area. Having regard to the above, the cost of providing water services capacity to meet the needs of non-domestic users should not be an element in calculating commercial rates.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	780	Revised peat extraction controls were introduced under the Planning and Development Regulations 2005 in July 2005 to ensure compliance with EU requirements on environmental impact assessment. The regulations generally exempt peat extraction below a threshold of ten hectares from the requirement for planning permission. However, there are exceptions where the peat extraction would have significant effects on the environment. In these limited cases, planning permission must be applied for and the relevant planning application must be accompanied by an environmental impact statement.Under the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations 1997, the cutting of turf on bogs which are designated for conservation, whether on privately owned or rented turf banks, is a notifiable action, namely, an activity that must be notified to my Department and for which my consent must be acquired before carrying out such an activity. Except in very sensitive areas, consent to cut turf for one's own use has normally been allowed to date. However, cutting on a commercial basis has not been allowed on designated bogs.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	781	Caherdaniel is one of the villages included in the Kerry villages sewerage scheme, which is approved for funding under my Department's Water Services Investment Programme 2005-2007 to commence construction in 2007. My Department is awaiting the submission of a preliminary report for the scheme by Kerry County Council. Following approval of the preliminary report, the council will be in a position to proceed with the preparation of contract documents.Funding for a preliminary assessment of phase one of Kerry County Council's proposals to refurbish a number of other village sewerage schemes has also been approved in the water services investment programme. The refurbishment proposals are divided into three phases and Kilgarvan is part of a proposed third phase. Following completion of the preliminary assessment of the phase one proposals, consideration will be given to the approval of further phases. In the meantime, I understand that Kerry County Council is developing a countywide strategy for the delivery of waste water services to up to 28 villages, including Kilgarvan. I will consider any proposals arising from the strategy in the light of the new assessment of water services capital requirements the council has been asked to undertake by my Department as an input to the identification of future investment priorities under the water services investment programme.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	782	Use of personal public service, PPS, numbers has been suggested as a means of improving the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the register of electors. The issues that arise in this regard include linkage with public policy generally concerning identity management, the establishment of mechanisms for associating PPS numbers with electors on the register, the systems required so that registration authorities can verify PPS data, the systems required so that registration authorities can cross-check PPS data with other such authorities and the need for an appropriate legislative framework, including relating to data protection. I will continue to keep the important issue of the register of electors, including this and other proposals for improvement, under close review.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	783	The conservation grant under urban renewal forms part of the National Development Plan 2000-06. It is supported by the European Union under the regional operational programmes for the Border, midland and west, BMW, and southern and eastern regions. Funding is provided to bodies such as local authorities, civic trusts, etc. to upgrade public buildings of significant architectural and heritage merit. The applications for the BMW region are under consideration currently and I expect to make a decision on them shortly.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	784	In general, planning permission must be sought for the erection of an antenna support structure or mast, whether proposed by a statutory undertaker or otherwise. The Planning and Development Regulations 2001, however, set out certain exemptions in this area including, subject to certain conditions, the attachment of additional antennae to an existing antenna support structure, the erection of an antenna support structure in place of an existing antenna support structure and the attachment of antennae to certain existing structures, such as telegraph poles, electricity pylons and certain public or commercial buildings. These regulations were the subject of extensive debate in the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government and were subsequently approved by both Houses.The report of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources on non-ionising radiation from mobile phone handsets and masts in 2005 recommended inter alia that planning guidelines and planning exemptions be examined with a view to ensuring that no electromagnetic emissions or radio frequency emissions emitting equipment be permitted to be sited near health centres, schools or other sensitive sites such as playgrounds or pitches, etc. On receipt of the joint committee’s report, the Government, in September 2005, approved the establishment of an interdepartmental advisory committee and an expert group, working to the committee, on the health effects of electromagnetic fields. My Department is represented on the committee. It is understood that the committee expects to report to the Government before the end of 2006 on the appropriate action to be taken on foot of the recommendations contained in the report. Pending this it is not proposed to amend the planning regulations.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	786	Septic tanks installed on or after 1 June 1992 must comply with part H of the national building regulations. Technical guidance document H — drainage and waste water disposal — calls up the following standards, namely, for septic tanks serving single houses, Irish standard recommendations SR6 of 1991 for domestic effluent treatment and disposal from single dwellings issued by the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, and for septic tanks serving groups of houses, British standard BS 6297:1983, incorporating amendment No. 1 of 1990, a code of practice for the design and installation of small sewage treatment works, issued by the British Standards Institution. I understand that the Environmental Protection Agency is developing a revised manual on waste water treatment systems serving single houses which will supersede SR6 of 1991. There are no grants available from my Department for the upgrading of septic tanks.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	787	Mullaghmatt housing estate in Monaghan town has been designated for funding under my Department's remedial works scheme. The pilot phase of the scheme, involving the refurbishment of 25 rented houses and some works to six tenant-purchased houses, is currently under way. It is understood that refurbishment work has been completed on nine of the rented houses and, to a limited extent, two of the tenant-purchased houses with the remaining houses in the pilot phase scheduled for completion in July 2006. Information on the house numbers of the houses that have been refurbished is not available in my Department. The timeline for the implementation of further phases of remedial works to remaining houses in the estate is a matter to be determined by the local authority in light of the outcome of the pilot phase.It is a condition of the remedial works scheme that tenant-purchasers of houses in a remedial works project may be included in a project where it is considered by the local authority that the undertaking of external works to these dwellings is necessary to avoid an unacceptable or incongruous result to the refurbishment of the estate as a whole. Tenant purchasers are required under the scheme to contribute 50% of the cost of eligible works to their houses. There are no proposals to alter the terms of the scheme in relation to contributions from tenant purchasers.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	790	The provision and management of capital projects and any associated art works funded through my Department's capital programmes are matters primarily for the local authorities. While guidance has been issued to local authorities on the artistic features scheme commenced in 1986 and on the per cent for art scheme that succeeded the former in 1997, my Department does not have comprehensive data on projects which have or have not incorporated an artistic feature under this scheme.General national guidelines on the per cent for art scheme were issued by my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, in December 2004. These guidelines recommend that the commissioning body should maintain a database of all projects funded under the scheme. The commissioning body, in the case of capital projects funded by my Department, is generally the local authority.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	791	Traditionally, waste management services have been provided at a local level with individual arrangements being locally determined and tailored to local circumstances. The present legal framework as determined by the Oireachtas reflects this situation. In accordance with section 52 of the Protection of the Environment Act 2003, the determination of waste management charges and the provision of waivers are both matters for the relevant local authority where it acts as a service provider. Similarly, where a private operator provides the collection service, it is a matter for that operator to determine charges. My Department has no function in either the setting of charges or the provision of waivers.Local authorities and central Government are working together to promote the polluter pays principle, as this is a core element of national and EU environmental policy, including in the area of waste management. In accordance with this policy, all of society must be encouraged to reduce, reuse and recycle waste to the maximum extent possible. In order to encourage households to minimise their waste, all local authorities and private waste operators were asked to begin a switch to use-based charging arrangements from the start of 2005. Use-based systems encourage customers to better control the amount of their charges by availing of an increased number of recycling options. These new pay-by-use charging systems have the potential to significantly minimise the burden of waste charges.My Department also makes a significant level of funding available to local authorities to increase the range of waste recycling infrastructure available to householders. In addition, and in order to assist old age pensioners and other households with lower incomes, I have asked local authorities to engage with commercial waste collectors with a view to agreeing on a more frequent scheduling of payments rather than a periodic lump sum payment.

On receipt of the information requested from Limerick County Council by my Department in September 2005, further consideration will be given to the council's fee proposals for the consultants selected to prepare preliminary reports for the project.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	793	I refer to the reply to Question No. 840 of 21 March 2006 on this matter. Arrangements for the provision of a service for on-line change of vehicle ownership for motor traders are at an early stage of development and no significant costs have as yet been incurred on this aspect of the motor tax on-line system.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	794	A new and updated draft guide for registration authorities on preparing and maintaining the register of electors was completed by my Department in November 2005. The aim of the guidance document is to secure significant improvement in the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the register by setting out clearly the legal requirements in this complex area and identifying best practice for registration authorities in their work on the register. I will arrange to have a copy of the draft guidance document sent to the Deputy, with a summary of the key points.The draft document has been circulated for comment to all registration authorities and returning officers and to the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government, which discussed the guidance in December 2005. Following this consultation process, my Department is now finalising the guidance and, in this, consideration will be given to all comments received. However, in view of the importance of securing improvements in the register, registration authorities have also been asked to proceed to implement the draft guidance with immediate effect.

My Department has not refused to sanction housing units on the basis of cost in 2004 or 2005 which were to be acquired by a local authority in accordance with an agreement under Part V.
