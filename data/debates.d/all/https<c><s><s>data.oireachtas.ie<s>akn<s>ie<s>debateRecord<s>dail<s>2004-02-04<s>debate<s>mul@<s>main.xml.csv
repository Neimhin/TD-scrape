#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	0	Yesterday the House paid tribute to the family of young Frances Sheridan, whose funeral takes place today. The newspapers today carry further revelations which cause serious concern. On 3 September, Dr. Finbar Lennon, medical adviser to the management board of the North Eastern Health Board, advised that there were concerns about the continuity of patient care and the supervision of non-consultant doctors by locum consultants in Cavan General Hospital. Today we learn of a problem with another appendicitis case, described in newspaper headlines as a grave blunder.Yesterday I charged the Taoiseach and the Government with political responsibility for delivering a health care system that is effective and meaningful to people. The Minister for Health and Children has the political responsibility for delivering that system and I see no merit in the Minister whingeing in public that he is frustrated because he is unable to do his job. The good health of the nation is something that goes beyond mere politics and it is patently obvious that section 24 of the 1970 Act constrains the Minister from doing his job. It is time for some creative leadership from the Taoiseach and I offer him the support of this side of the House in doing so.We have an aviation authority and a Health and Safety Authority but why do we not have a patient care authority? It would be similar to a surgeon general's office which would have its own chief executive and staff to cut through the bureaucracy which does not allow the Minister for Health and Children to do his job. It would put patient care and continuity of care at the heart of the system, which is what we want.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	2	People are looking for leadership in the health sector and the Minister for Health and Children has fallen down on his responsibilities because of the constraints in the system. I am suggesting a way out of this. We can set up an interim authority to deal with patient care and put that authority at the heart of what people need now. I offer the Taoiseach the support of this side of the House in facilitating whatever time is needed in the Dáil to get that authority up and running.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	3	I welcome Deputy Kenny's constructive remarks, as obviously there are limitations within the legislation. Yesterday Members on all sides of the House sent their sympathies to the family of Frances Sheridan and to those involved in the related case. In the Cavan case, according to the legislation the Minister is the one who must set up the inquiry and nominate people for the teams, which seems overly bureaucratic. People may not want to serve on those teams — one person who was nominated had a conflict of interest because of family connections, which should have been obvious from the start. Then there was a row about the expenses to be paid and we set up the team at the third attempt. This seems nonsensical, as the row went on from August until the Minister was able to appoint the team some months ago. I gave those details yesterday. What is appearing in the newspapers is not unconnected to that issue but I do not want to get into that matter in the Houses of Parliament. I should not have to get into it.On Deputy Kenny's broader point, obviously the Minister does not have clinical responsibility. He has never had that responsibility and never could have. While I know Deputy Kenny is not saying that, this point is at the core of the issue. The health board, medical health officers and clinical professionals are the people who must make the decisions. Obviously the health board has a role and in many cases the Minister gets drawn in, though historically that was not the case. If one has to provide the service then it must be provided and the Minister has met the relevant people — he met the CEO yesterday as well as other officials of the North Eastern Health Board. They informed him that there were approximately 14 adverse incidents reported to the board and that the board's medical advisers are in the process of reviewing all those incidents. The Minister is meeting a representative of the hospital consultants today and other steps are also being taken to deal with this matter.On reform, this year we are moving from the health board structure to the hospital service executive system and that will cause enormous reforms of the system. I welcome Deputy Kenny's constructive comments on engaging with this process, which will cover the other points he made on aspects of the health system. Those points are noted.These issues are not just matters of staff or resources. It is a question of reform and that is why the Government is so anxious to implement a reform programme.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	4	This is where I differ with the Taoiseach. As a politician, my objective is to ensure that life in Ireland is affected by political decisions. Health goes beyond mere politics. We would all like to see an effective health service where we can be proud of the quality of the services we deliver. What the Taoiseach said here is what was given yesterday. We know all of that.Information given to me yesterday indicated that there will be further cases where the Minister will be constrained by section 24 of the 1970 Act in various other counties. I see a political solution that can impact on the work of the Minister for Health and Children. One such solution is to set up a patient care authority. If an aircraft crashes, the aviation authority deals with that. The Health and Safety Authority deals with health and safety issues at work.We read litanies of misfortune every day in our newspapers; 200 people waiting for beds, nursing crises, patient care crises, grave blunders. While it is not directly the fault of the Taoiseach or the Minister, people die while waiting for treatment. A political response is required to cut through all of this and have an effective response from the Department of Health and Children.I offer the Taoiseach help in this area. Priority legislation was rushed through this House twice in the past week. Why can the Minister not bring in legislation to deal with this and have a patient care authority the public would welcome? We should not have patients involved as pawns in rows that go on between different internal power factions.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	5	There is no difference of opinion between Deputy Kenny and me on this issue so I will not create one. For the past two or three years, all sectors of the health service, consultants, nursing staff, junior hospital doctors, non-consultant hospital doctors and paramedics have worked on what they believed was the best solution for a reformed system. Although the policy reform was organised by Government, it did not generate it. It has been set out. Following the announcements of last year, we have now set up the structures. Various committees and groups are working on this. It has to come back to the House in the form of a new health Bill. The issues raised by Deputy Kenny will form part of it. We are fundamentally changing some systems of the past which were incorporated in the 1970 Health Act. There is no difficulty in this.We are changing from the health board system to a new regime. The hospital executive services and the role of the Department of Health and Children will fundamentally change. Health boards, as currently constructed, will no longer exist. We will have an opportunity to deal with this at a later stage.I do not wish to be simplistic about this matter. Hospital cases which give rise to clinical difficulties will still exist, but through reform we can bring a far better and more transparent service to the public.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	10	I am sure the Taoiseach will agree that the compliant Irish taxpayer is a very fair person. He and she were prepared to fund the services of the State when their betters had Ansbacher deposits, DIRT accounts, deals with the banks and so on and so forth. The taxpayer wants to see a fair deal for victims of abuse in residential institutions. The taxpayer wants the State to pay its share for its disgraceful neglect in invigilating these institutions, but the taxpayer also wants to see that the primary wrongdoers, those who were in the front line in these institutions, pay their fair share. It was on that point that Ms Justice Laffoy, whose resignation was forced by obstruction and lack of co-operation from the relevant Department and Minister, sought discovery of papers to know on what basis the Taoiseach decided that the Irish taxpayer would pick up virtually the entire bill for this disastrous neglect of the past. On what basis did he decide to cap the liability of the religious institutions at €128 million? That is the information that Ms Justice Laffoy wants to know. On what basis was the decision made and where are those papers?I draw the Taoiseach's attention to the reply by the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, last night. When asked this question, he said:I surmise that Deputy Woods based hisopinion that the State was liable on the information that we all had and knew through the television programmes and from various victims' groups and individuals that made contact with us.Deputy Woods apparently made his decision that the State was liable because of television programmes and other media reports.I ask the Taoiseach one simple question and I do not want any of his rambling down memory lane and his apology and his baseless allegations about me wanting to bankrupt religious organisations. He should leave all that out. Are there any extant papers on which his Government based its decision? Do any papers exist, and if they do, will he hand them over to the commission which has replaced that of Ms Justice Laffoy?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	11	Deputy Rabbitte obviously never likes my answers on this issue.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	13	A few thousand cases had to be dealt with and we had to look at what process would function best in the shortest possible time. Legally, liability in each individual case could be divided into four categories and this is what faced the then Minister, Deputy Woods: the individual perpetrators of the abuse, the managers of the institutions, the religious orders who controlled the institutions and the State which put the children into care but failed to ensure that the care was of a sufficient standard. There are thousands of individual cases of abuse and the precise split of liability between the religious and the State would be different——

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	20	That the State believed it was not 100% liable in the legal sense is reflected in the fact that the State negotiated with the religious orders and got a contribution of €128 million after long negotiations. The estimates available to the then Minister, Deputy Woods, gave rise to calculations of compensation of the order of €508 million. This works out about a 75:25 split. The only international evidence available came from Canada where the redress was of that level.The alternative which was open to the Government was to take each of these cases through the courts and cross-examine the witnesses and the various organisations to which I referred, be they religious institutions, professional staff or whatever. I do not want to continue arguing with Deputy Rabbitte but the reason the decision was made was that we thought it would not be fair to put the victims through the trauma of court cases. We asked if it was fair to put these people through court cases. Some of them were out of the country and some were shown on the RTE television programme in Christmas week. In most cases the reason they ended up in these institutions is that the State put them there. The State did not hit them or kick them or do all the terrible things we saw in the television programmes, but by and large the State put them there. It would have taken years to bring these cases through the courts to establish 100% liability against the institutions.

We made a political policy decision and felt that the right thing to do was to come to a settlement, make the churches pay a certain contribution and have the State indemnify the rest. Having done this, we could then process these cases. We did this with Ms Justice Laffoy and we will do it with Mr. Justice Ryan. We are right in doing this. I stand over it and will stand over it every day in this House, if necessary.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	25	If I am wrong, then Ms Justice Laffoy is wrong. Ms Justice Laffoy raised the same issue. Nobody asserted that a 100% liability should be levied on the religious institutions concerned. I did not assert this, nor did Ms Justice Laffoy. The Department of Finance suggested a 50:50 split. However, one eighth has been levied on the institutions and seven eighths on the taxpayer.

Are there papers that show why the Government reached this decision? If such papers exist, will the Taoiseach hand them over? What is difficult about this question? There either are, or are not, papers.

The State put these people into institutions, many of which were 100% owned by the State. Deputies are now asking why I did not put these people through the courts and cause them further suffering, and why I accepted only €128 million.While I am not going to repeat what I said yesterday, the more I watch this argument, the more I realise what irks Deputy Rabbitte.

The Bill was totally inadequate and caused not only concern and disappointment, but real anger among people with disabilities, theirrepresentative organisations and the wider public. Such was the level of protest that the Government was forced to withdraw the Bill and establish a consultation process that included the establishment of the Disability Legislation Consultation Group. This body, comprising umbrella groups representing the different sectors within the area of disability, published its report, Equal Citizens, in February 2003. The report was a substantial contribution to the preparation of the new disability Bill. The report calls for legislation that enshrines two particular points: positive rights that are enforceable by individuals; and duties and requirements on public and private bodies providing services to the public aimed at removing barriers to full participation of people with disabilities in Irish society.It is now 12 months later and we still do not have this legislation. It was promised for the last session. In her press release the Chief Whip has said the disability Bill is the flagship legislation for this session. It states, "Disability Bill top of legislative agenda as Chief Whip announces programme for next Dáil session". What is the position with this Bill? Is the Taoiseach aware that disability groups, organisations and the wider sector have expressed real concern that the legislation soon to be introduced, falls significantly short of the rights-based legislation required by the disability sector and demanded by wider society. Only last week the Taoiseach told the House that the further delay in the publication of this long overdue legislation was because the Disability Legislation Consultation Group had yet to make further responses. I have noted since that answer, that the group has refuted that claim by the Taoiseach.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	59	It is the Government's intention to put in place a framework that will ensure the most effective combination of legislation, policies, institutions and services to support and reinforce equal access for people with disabilities. A number of issues have to be dealt with, some of which Deputy Ó Caoláin has mentioned. An important Bill that has been widely welcomed is the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill 2003 which is before the House. Intensive work is continuing in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the preparation of the remaining parts of the framework for publication of the disability Bill as soon as possible. We hope to provide a disability Bill which will address assessment of needs, service statements, redress, access and sectoral plans across a number of areas, public service employment, genetic testing and a centre of excellence in universal design. We have had prolonged discussions with various interested parties, particularly the Disability Legislation Consultation Group, whose members have given much of their time. I have had two lengthy meetings with them and they have had several meetings with officials. We have outlined the sectoral plans for the key public service sectors.A third Bill, the Comhairle Bill, is also part of this process. The disabilities group wants this Bill which provides for an advocacy service and sign language interpretation facilities. These were provided for in the 2001 Bill, but will now be in this separate Bill. There have been ongoing meetings since Christmas.I want to acknowledge the work of the Disability Legislation Consultation Group. I acknowledge also the work of the officials in the Office of the Attorney General, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and other Departments who have worked four weekends in a row. There have been direct consultations with the groups as we want to try to avoid a repeat of the troubles in 2001. We want to share information and listen to what the disability groups have to say. It may not be possible, as always in legislation, to go the whole way, but we will go as far as we possibly can to satisfy their concerns. We were able to resolve the issues in the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill 2003 and we will do our best with this Bill.

Will he acknowledge that the debacle on the disability Bill is coming at the end of the European Year of People with Disabilities, a year in which people with disabilities had to take to the streets to protest in support of their rights? Does he agree that at the heart of the problem regarding the disability Bill is a culture in Government that is opposed to any rights-based legislation of any kind? That malaise rests at the Cabinet table and was epitomised as never before by the national embarrassment of the legislation presented recently, the Immigration Bill, which stated that there were grounds for the refusal of entry to this country of people with disabilities. While the Government had to climb down on that issue to some extent, let us make no mistake the message was heard and noted and people recognise that the problem is at the Cabinet table, where a majority is opposed to rights-based legislation. It is time the Taoiseach weeded out those people and facilitated those who will take the decisions in the interests of people with needs.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	61	The Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill 2003 is already on Committee Stage and is acknowledged as one of the best education disabilities Bills in the world. Additional funding of €650 million has been invested in disability services in the past number of years. This includes money that was made available last year and additional expenditure in this year's budget. Additional emergency places have been provided for services for school leavers to enhancerelated services for long-term cases and day care cases.I did not state last week that the disability group was responsible for the delay, I said it was involved in the consultation process and that is helpful. We could bring in a Bill without consultation, but we would rather have consultation. We provided an additional 1,700 residential places for people with disabilities in recent years. We have also increased resources for those with intellectual disabilities or autism. I think Deputy Ó Caoláin's statement may have been relevant seven or eight years ago, but a great deal has been done for groups with disabilities, but there is more to be done. As I stated at the outset it is not only legislation, but capital investment and resources for services, which we are continuing to build upon after decades of neglect. I think we are doing a good job——

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	64	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.The first ever United Nations world summit on the information society was held in Geneva from Wednesday, 10 December to Friday, 12 December 2003. I led the delegation from Ireland to this summit and I was accompanied by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and the Minister of State at my Department with special responsibility for the information society, Deputy Hanafin. I addressed the plenary session of this summit on Thursday, 11 December, and a copy of my address has been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.This summit adopted a common vision and understanding of the information society as well as a strategic plan of action for concerted development towards realising this vision. It obtained political commitment, at the highest levels globally, to shape the future of the global information society and to bridge the digital and knowledge divides.While at the summit, I met with representatives of the companies responsible for the Skoool.ie project. This project won a world summit award and was honoured and showcased at the summit. I also met with the chairman of the world summit awards board, Professor Peter Bruck.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	65	May I draw Deputies' attention to the fact that there are three questions in this group. There is then a large group of questions tabled regarding Europe. It is a matter for Deputies as to how they wish to divide time on those questions.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	66	Does the Taoiseach agree that at the end of the day, the issue of the information society boils down to the ubiquitous absence of easy broadband access in this country? Does he further agree that in the OECD survey we were 27th out of 30 countries, and that our attempt at deregulation and privatisation of Eircom has been little short of disastrous, measured against almost any criterion? We have ended up with a situation in which, instead of a monopoly, we have a duopoly which is not functioning. The roll-out of broadband is completely inadequate and is indicted by the Government's own report on the information society.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	67	Obviously we are behind on broadband provision. I have stated many times that while the loop around the country is perfect, the service within the State is not. We are catching up. There is a considerable investment, but we have not got private sector investment to the extent we would have liked. I have given the figures previously to the House. We have finished the 19 areas designated last year. Work is continuing and approximately 90 areas will be dealt with in the course of this year and next year. We need to improve on the loop in the country. That work is under way and the sooner the work is completed the better. We have the capacity to go up the list, if we finish the designated work. The State cannot provide all the resources to do that although it is providing a substantial proportion of them.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	68	Is not the tragedy of all this that we failed to separate the consumer services from the network, as we did in the case of the ESB, when the privatisation and deregulation of Telecom Éireann took place, and that we are now paying the price?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	69	I think it was the right thing to do at the time. We got a huge price for it. It was at the height of the dot.com revolution so from the State's point of view we did well and the company is now operating in the private sector. The difficulty is that, during that period, many private sector companies lost so much on the 3G licences that they did not have the capacity to put in the additional resources we would have wanted. Five years ago the companies' view was that if they were allowed access to broadband they could do this but they were not in a financial position to do so.We have designated 123 areas in the country where broadband access is required and we have to get on with providing it. The State is now being forced to put in a higher contribution than it would have wished. However, as far as the money we got into the pension fund is concerned, I think it was a good deal at the time.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	70	The Government has got it all wrong. The issue at stake is about the copper wire into the facility at the end of the line. Is it not a fact that what is happening is a policy of appeasement to Eircom until the IPO takes place at the end of March? What meetings have taken place between the Government and Eircom? Do we have any guarantee that after the IPO takes place and people have walked away with their money, the Government's objective of having the highest quality level of broadband e-service will actually be fulfilled? If an American pension trust buys this, is there any guarantee that it will want to put broadband into Donegal or west Kerry?I do not know whether the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has informed the Taoiseach that what is called dark fibre is being put in instead of lit fibre. It is a very low level, unambitious programme, which does little service to the Government's fine words about putting us at the top of the ladder internationally. The Taoiseach has a chance, before the IPO is signed, to rectify the matter. He should examine seriously what has happened in the telecommunications sector and how we have arrived at the current position.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	71	I will allow general questions to the Taoiseach, but detailed questions would be more appropriate to the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	72	My questions are about the IPO, which is a big issue.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	73	The fastest increase in broadband roll-out is in this country but, as I told Deputy Rabbitte, I accept that it is being done from a low base. The Minister has had several meetings, including one the week before last, with Eircom about the roll-out and the company is doing quite an amount of work on it, as are some other companies also. We have rolled it out, according to the demands programme, to areas such as Gweedore in County Donegal. We will have to keep doing that.Many companies across the private sector lost a substantial amount of money on the 3G licences but if they had been in a better financial position we probably could have got through much of this more quickly. Instead, the State has had to pick it up to the extent we thought the private sector would do so five years ago. We must keep driving on, however. While our base is low, we can catch up very quickly and can change our position dramatically. The more we can get broadband rolled out around the country into a new series of areas, the better. The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has already mentioned many of them. The next roll out will help in this respect because almost 90 areas will be involved. It is a priority. We have no difficulty in getting broadband rolled out around the country because it is on the loop.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	74	There is no competition because Eircom has a monopoly. That explains the cost, because Eircom has got a total grip.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	75	Eircom has a significant part of it but, as we have seen recently, the ESB has also launched a significant aspect. The more we can use both the private sector and State agencies to do this, the better. It is not a long-term process. Last year's work on the 19 areas was done very quickly. We must continue to do that work, however.

Does the Taoiseach support this call and would he use the current Irish Presidency of the European Union as a platform on which to promote such a proposition? Does the Taoiseach agree that the information and communications technology industry, which has among its number some of the wealthiest corporations in the world, should be making a contribution in this regard? As such companies have little accountability and show scant concern for Third World development, would it not be appropriate to take such an initiative? In echoing the UN summit's call, would the Taoiseach be prepared to make that issue one of his key proposals in the course of our current EU Presidency?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	78	Many Irish companies were involved in the UN world summit, in the spirit Deputy Ó Caoláin mentioned. We are prepared to help and the best way we can contribute is through our technical expertise. We should use our communications technology to bridge the gap between developed and developing countries. We can play a serious role in that respect because we have many companies and individuals who can make a huge contribution. It is not just a question of finance; it is also a matter of using our technical expertise and our people. The answer to the Deputy's question is that we are prepared to help in every way we can.Ireland has been to the fore in trying topromote the development of Internet technology in schools in developing areas. We have good experience in and knowledge of those areas because Irish companies have been very much involved. The fact that the school project onfree access to education won one of the main awards at the UN world summit highlights an area in which we can directly do what the Deputy has asked — getting involved in the exchangeof technical information. We are prepared to do so.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	80	That concept has to be progressed but the fund could comprise person power and technical knowledge. That is probably the best way to do it because we can make a huge contribution in that regard.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	81	I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 37, inclusive, together.I attended the European Council and the Intergovernmental Conference in Brussels on 12 and 13 December. I was accompanied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Roche. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, attended the European Council meeting.The conclusions of the European Council have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and, as Deputies are aware, on Tuesday, 16 December, at the earliest opportunity following the meeting, I made a comprehensive statement on the outcome of the Council. I do not,therefore, propose to go into too much detail here.In brief, the European Council allowed the Heads of State or Government of the European Union to endorse the European action for growth initiative; reach agreement on a range of sites for certain European Union agencies; note progress in the justice and home affairs area, including on the management of migratory flows, progress on establishing a European border management agency and agreement on a number of measures in the fight against drugs; and note a range of foreign policy issues, including the European security strategy and the declaration on transatlantic relations.The European Council was a success, although it was clearly disappointing that we did not reach agreement in the Intergovernmental Conference which followed. We are grateful to the outgoing Italian Presidency for the good groundwork laid by them, which will enable us to advance further the agenda of the European Union during our term of office.During bilateral contacts on the margins of the European Council, I met Prime Minister Erdogan of Turkey on 11 December. I took the opportunity to convey to him the European Union's preference for a reunited Cyprus to join the European Union on 1 May 2004.Ireland's sixth Presidency of the European Union commenced on 1 January and we marked the occasion with a flag-flying ceremony in Dublin Castle. As Deputies are aware, on 22 January I made a comprehensive statement to the House concerning Ireland's Presidency programme. Our key priorities are to make as much progress as possible in the Intergovernmental Conference; to ensure a successful transition from a Union of 15 to one of 25, including the effective and efficient conduct of the business of the enlarged Union, and to carry forward the enlargement process more generally; to give additional impetus at the spring European Council, to the ten-year reform goal set out at Lisbon in March 2000; to take forward commitments in the justice and home affairs area by focusing on the delivery of agreed commitments under the Amsterdam treaty and the broader Tampere programme; and in the external relations arena, to continue the search for mutual solutions to the many difficult issues confronting us on the world stage today.The key meetings I will chair during our Presidency are the two European Council meetings, in March and June. I will also co-chair a tripartite social summit in Brussels prior to the spring European Council in March.In my statement to the House on 22 January, I outlined to Deputies in detail the approach we are taking to the Intergovernmental Conference. Without going over the same ground, I will just say briefly that this is an issue of the highest priority for our Presidency. At the European Council in December, I undertook to consult with partners and to make a report to the spring European Council. These consultations are ongoing. My soundings to date suggest a willingness to support our efforts to progress the IGC during our Presidency.There are still a number of key issues to be resolved before agreement can be reached on the constitutional treaty. There is broad agreement, nonetheless, on many important elements. We are attempting to encourage a spirit of compromise and commitment and to build the consensus necessary for agreement. If it appears at any time that agreement is achievable, we will move immediately to seize that opportunity.On 6 January, as one of the first engagements in our Presidency, I and my Government colleagues met with the European Commission in Dublin Castle. I had a very productive and useful meeting with the President of the European Commission, Mr. Romano Prodi, which focused on the Intergovernmental Conference and preparations for the two European Council meetings during our Presidency, in March and June. Both Commission President Prodi and I agreed that the best way forward is for the Union as a whole to agree the new constitutional treaty. My Government colleagues also met bilaterally with their counterparts in the European Commission to discuss priorities for Ireland's Presidency in each of the Council formations.On 14 January, I presented the Irish Presidency programme to the European Parliament in Strasbourg. I emphasised that Ireland, as holder of the Presidency, is totally committed to working intensively with the Parliament at all levels so that our interaction is as constructive and productive as it can be. Following my address, we had a lively and informed debate on the priorities for Ireland's Presidency and I was impressed by the support and good wishes I received.I met with the British Foreign Secretary, Jack Straw, in Dublin on 16 December. Our discussions focused on events at the European Council the week before, including the Intergovernmental Conference and also the priorities for Ireland's Presidency.On 8 January, I attended the National Forum on Europe to hear an address by the EU's High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, Javier Solana. I had the opportunity to meet Mr. Solana prior to his address. We discussed the priorities for Ireland's Presidency, including the implementation of the European security strategy and a range of international issues, including Iran and the Middle East.Later that day, I met with the Belgian Prime Minister, Guy Verhofstadt, in Government Buildings. We had a productive meeting which focused on the Intergovernmental Conference and Ireland's Presidency programme. I travelled to Berlin on 9 January where I addressed the Bertelsmann Foundation. Before my address, I had a series of bilateral meetings with the Prime Ministers of Montenegro, Romania and Croatia.I also met briefly with Prime Minister Erdogan of Turkey following the address. My discussions with him focused on Cyprus. I thanked him for Turkey's recent efforts aimed at making progress and said the Irish Presidency would be as helpful as possible in the search for a solution through the peace process based on the Annan plan.At my meeting with Romanian Prime Minister, Adrian Nastase, I made clear that the Irish Presidency intends to implement the timetable agreed in the December European Council conclusions on negotiations for Romania's membership of the EU.In my meetings with both Prime Minister Sanader of Croatia and Prime Minister Djukanovic of Montenegro, I stressed that the western Balkans would remain an important EU priority during the Irish Presidency, building on the progress made in 2003. I also discussed with Mr. Sanader the likely progress of Croatia's application for membership of the Union during our Presidency.On 26 January, I travelled to Madrid for discussions with Prime Minister Aznar and last Thursday I met with Prime Minister Miller of Poland in Dublin. The focus of both of these meetings was the Intergovernmental Conference.I will meet a number of EU counterparts in the coming weeks in the context of ongoing consultations on the Intergovernmental Conference, including Prime Minister Barroso of Portugal, whom I will meet later today, Prime Minister Berlusconi, Prime Minister Parts of Estonia and Chancellor Schröder.My next scheduled meeting with the President of the European Commission will be at the tripartite social council which will precede the spring European Council.In accordance with procedures laid down at the Seville European Council in June 2002 for the preparation, conduct and conclusions of the meetings of the European Council, European Council meetings are prepared by the General Affairs and External Relations Council, which co-ordinates all the preparatory work and draws up the agenda at least four weeks before the Council meeting. Work has already commenced at official level on the draft agenda.The spring Council each year is devoted to economic and social issues, namely the Lisbon agenda. It is my intention that the spring European Council this year will focus on a number of key aspects — sustainable growth, competitiveness and employment. In addition to the Lisbon agenda, I will also report to my colleagues on the European Council on progress made on the European constitution.I will undertake a series of Presidency related engagements outside Ireland over the coming months. As part of my ongoing consultations with partners on the IGC, I will travel to Rome for discussions with Prime Minister Berlusconi. In March, I will attend the tripartite council and the European Council in Brussels. In May and June, I will undertake a pre-European Council tour of European capitals in the lead up to the European Council in Brussels on 17 and 18 June.I will also attend a number of external summits outside Ireland over the coming months. It is expected that these will include the EU-Canada summit in Ottawa, the EU-Russia summit in Russia, EU-Latin American summit in Mexico, the G8 summit in the United States, the EU-Japan summit in Tokyo and the EU-NATO summit in Istanbul.In March and July, I will travel to Strasbourg to present progress reports on the Irish Presidency to the European Parliament.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	83	It does not look like it. I will leave that to the Deputy.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	84	I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. The Irish Times reports that the Taoiseach has identified 20 issues which seriously impede a conclusion on the issue of the constitution. Will he outline the priority issues?The issue of weighted voting and the difficulties Spain and Poland have in this area are critical to the business of getting agreement. Last week the President of the European Parliament, Mr. Pat Cox, called on Prime Minister Miller of Poland to arrive at a compromise. Has the Taoiseach spoken to Prime Minister Miller or to the Polish Minister for Europe, Professor Danuta Hubner, about this matter or has there been any progress following a meeting with Prime Minister Aznar some time ago?Having spoken to most of the leaders and Heads of Government, the Taoiseach has set out his consensus platform. Now at the beginning of February is it his opinion that he will be able to achieve conclusion during the Irish Presidency? That would be welcomed by everybody and would make it a very successful Presidency. I offer the Taoiseach whatever assistance we can give from this side of the House.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	85	I am sure other Members have the same questions as Deputy Kenny. Taking the work of January as a block, what I tried to do during that month was to consult the 27 members of the IGC — the present 15 EU countries, the ten new accession countries, Romania and Bulgaria, and I also consulted Turkey. I consulted them to try to establish the opening position on the three legs of the stool, the European Convention of last summer, the Naples document of early December 2003, and the conclusion of the unsuccessful meeting under the Italian Presidency of Silvio Berlusconi. I tried to establish their beliefs and the precise understandings they had with the Italian Presidency in order to have the full picture. It is from that analysis and its conclusions that I have come up with the 20 outstanding matters.Deputy Kenny may recall that at the end of the meetings the popular decision in the media was that there were only two issues of major difficulty. The media did not say much about many other issues but nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.The list of outstanding issues stands at about 20. The Deputy is right that some are major and he has asked me to mention those. The major issue is the voting in the Council and that is the one that receives much attention. The composition of the Commission is another major issue. This revolves around the matter of one commissioner per member state or the Nice formula. The scope of QMV, qualified majority voting, is another major issue. Member states want to know what issues are fully included in QMV and which are not. There is a lot of difficulty around these.There are also issues concerned with thejustice and home affairs area, commonly known in the newspapers as the "clutch" or the "brake". This unusual terminology is a good description of how far to go. Everybody is now using these terms.I went through the full range. The Deputy will appreciate that getting to the 27, the parliamentary committees, the Commission and the Council secretariat amounts to over 34 or 35 groups. What we must now try to do is to narrow the list because whoever, whether I or someone else, had to have an IGC with over 20 issues on the agenda would never get agreement. I must attempt to arrive at understandings and narrow the list. I must pay special attention to the three or four most significant items.I have discussed the matter with Mr. Aznar, the Spanish Prime Minister, and with Prime Minister Miller. I have a very sound understanding of their perspectives which is important if we are to make any progress. I did that last week. I have provided balanced information of the views of some of the larger and smaller countries. I will have to continue to engage with them at official level and directly probably until St. Patrick's Day before I can make a full report. I hope at least to be able to narrow the list.This issue will not be resolved in the short term though I will do my best to achieve that during the Irish Presidency. Before I report to a full Council meeting, I wish to reach a clear understanding over the next five or six weeks that we are not only talking about a few issues which we must try to resolve, but that we must narrow down the formulas relevant to the issues of difference. The formulas for resolving these issues are ten a penny at the moment and they will not work. I will keep the House informed as I proceed.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	86	I agree with Deputy Kenny that the Taoiseach's schedule is absolutely punishing. I wish him well with it. I was pleased to see him in Parnell Park on Sunday and that he managed to fit the match in, given all he has to do.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	90	Yes. The normal St. Patrick's Day arrangement will apply on 17 March. There is another question on the programme to be answered concerning this. The arrangement does not always apply on 17 March, but that is the case this year. After my meeting with President Bush, I will go straight to Ottawa for the Canadian summit.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	91	Does the Taoiseach intend to raise with President Bush the fact that he has now confessed publicly that he was wrong on the Iraq war? While the Taoiseach has changed his position since, when he was supporting the war he said that the speech by the Secretary of State, Mr. Colin Powell, to the United Nations provided the world with the clearest evidence to date that Iraq had secretly produced weapons of mass destruction. The report is strong and clear. Will the Taoisech raise with President Bush the fact that the latter misled him as well as the rest of the world on this issue? Will the Taoiseach tell the President that we might be more sceptical in future about automatically accepting the information of American and British intelligence sources and facilitating the transport of military personnel through our airports?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	92	I will raise these issues because I recall well what President Bush told me last year on 15 March during the St. Patrick's Day visit. I remember in particular what I was told by Vice-President Cheney who provided me with a great many specifics of the USA's knowledge during our meeting on Capitol Hill.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	93	What exactly was the Taoiseach told? He should tell us more.

#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	95	The Taoiseach and his colleagues have repeatedly attempted to rubbish claims that the Government is co-operating in the militarisation of the European Union. What is his reaction to the establishment of the EU armaments agency, known otherwise as the European Defence Capabilities Agency? What is the Taoiseach's reaction to the appointment as head of that agency of Mr. Nick Whitney, the director general of international security policy at the British Ministry of Defence? Does the Taoiseach not see that there is some reason for concern here?As has been said, this is happening in a week in which the Bush Administration and the Blair Government are being forced to concede inquiries — I had better be careful here — on the web of untruths which were used to justify their war in Iraq. Does it not speak volumes that a British international securocrat has been appointed to head up this new EU military body?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	96	The Deputy is straying well outside the content of the 34 questions which have been submitted to the Taoiseach.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	97	Not at all. I am totally in line with Questions Nos. 7 and 37, which I have posed. Does the Taoiseach reflect personally what the EU draft constitution refers to as "active and unreserved support" for this aspect of the so-called security policy of the European Union?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	98	Work on common defence issues and the agreements made in the Maastricht and Amsterdam treaties will continue. I have no great difficulty with those matters. The issue of concern for Ireland is the mutual defence proposal. Although no formal agreement was reached last December, it was broadly accepted by member states that a consensus had been reached on mutual defence, the issue of particular importance and relevance for us. This proposal states clearly that the mutual defence obligation set out in Article 47 shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policies of certain member states. This was the attachment we called for concerning the issue we wished to see resolved. It means Ireland will not be bound by the mutual defence obligation. We retain the right to take our own sovereign decision on whether or not to come to a member state's assistance in the event of armed attack. This is in keeping with the Government's position on non-participation in mutual defence commitments. That covers the other issues. This is our position and in this regard we are well protected constitutionally.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	100	Not on the appointment. When the appointment of Mr. Javier Solana of Spain was made there was a great deal of controversy also. I do not have a problem.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	102	How does the Taoiseach feel about pushing forward the European defence agency issue and an intensification of military research within the EU? Most citizens would consider it an obscene waste that €55 billion is already spent on armaments within the EU. Does the Taoiseach feel guilty about advancing further research, as he has accepted he is obliged to do as President of the EU, to create more technology to incinerate more people more efficiently?The Taoiseach has said he will visit Washington. Will President Bush meet with the EU outside the United States of America? Is there a standing invitation in this regard and, if so, what is its current status? When meeting Mr. Aznar, Mr. Berlusconi and other avid supporters of the criminal invasion of Iraq, has the Taoiseach discussed the issue? Has he discussed with them the implications of the fact that the entire EU was misled by the President of the United States of America on weapons of mass destruction in Iraq? We hope that in meeting these extreme right wing leaders, the Taoiseach does not become even more right wing in his views.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	103	A question, please.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	104	The Taoiseach has undertaken to advance the proposed EU constitution. There are significant disputes on voting rights.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	105	Deputy, you should confine yourself to a question. We are running out of time and there are other Members offering.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	106	I was just about to ask a question on the constitution.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	107	Confine yourself to the question.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	108	Will the Taoiseach insist with regard to Article 1.3.3 of the constitution and the possibility that health and education services will be open to privatisation on a return to unanimity in respect of such provisions?When the Justice Ministers met recently, the centre of Dublin was turned into a virtual police state at huge inconvenience to small enterprises, workers and the general populace. Can the Taoiseach ensure this does not happen again and that further meetings are conducted where they do not disrupt for days on end the running of the entire city and the ordinary people who keep it going with their taxes?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	109	I will take the last point first. It was for that very reason that we moved most of the European Council meetings and conferences outside the city to 20 venues around the country. The security people must come to their own considerations. All that can I say regarding security arrangements in Ireland is that they are very lax compared with what happens in other countries. We will certainly be endeavouring to ensure that we keep disruption to a minimum. We are very conscious of that. For that reason, Dublin will not be troubled too often during the Presidency.There is to be an EU-US summit. No date has yet been set, but it is likely to be in May or June. The intention is that there will be a meeting in Europe. Locations and dates have not yet been agreed, though work is proceeding on the agenda. I have obviously raised the war in Iraq, and related issues in the Middle East come up in all my discussions. I have concerns at how the information was portrayed, and there is obviously great interest in the investigations and inquiries that will now take place. People will certainly look to see the basis of the information.On defence, we have a responsibility under the CFSP to move forward on European security and defence issues. We have no difficulty concerning any of those areas. Our neutral status and sovereign position are well understood. We have no difficulty there. I will consider the Deputy's specific point about education and qualified majority voting.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	110	On the Taoiseach's visit to Washington, will he invite George Bush to Ireland, and specifically, will he ask him to address this House? On the question of the proposed EU constitution, which draft is he working from now? He mentioned concessions he received in early December, but there are reports we are working from the draft concluded in Naples. Which one are we working from? The Irish Presidency has been lobbied by several NGOs and the economist Susan George to pursue the issue of the Tobin tax and put it on the agenda. It was pursued by the Belgian Presidency——
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	111	Does the Deputy have a question?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	112	I am asking whether the Taoiseach will pursue that. It is an extremely important international tax on currency speculation. It has been agreed by the Belgian, French and Finnish parliaments. Will the Taoiseach pursue it too?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	113	As I said, the date and location of the EU-American summit have not yet been resolved, so no invitation has been issued to the President to address this House. Those issues have not yet been dealt with. The Deputy has expressed his position on a speculation tax. This is not the first occasion the matter has arisen. I remember that it famously came up when the ERM collapsed in the early 1990s. I know the Belgians pursued it. I am not sure how one could make it work, but I certainly have an open mind considering the issue, since I was responsible for finance during that international speculation crisis. I became quite knowledgeable on what it can do. It is certainly an area that I would examine.I wish to outline the position on the proposed EU constitution. There are now three areas on which we are working: the Convention text of last summer; what was more or less agreed but not finalised at the Naples meeting; and the failed summit which we did not conclude but after which Silvio Berlusconi gave his outline of issues he had discussed and his understanding as holder of the Presidency on where he had got. Obviously, that third group is not agreed, since it was never discussed. Those were purely issues he had discussed with individuals. He was giving his account of what he would have been reporting if we had been moving to a conclusion. We must take them, since they are still outstanding issues for the countries.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	114	What are those issues?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	115	There are many issues, including qualified majority voting and what areas are listed for it, justice and home affairs, and many smaller issues important to individual countries. One important issue is that of the number of MEPs accorded to the smaller countries. As the Deputy knows, that was not resolved. There is unity of purpose on the part of all the small countries about the minimum number of MEPs, which is quite a lively issue for them. It does not affect this year's election, but it will affect future ones. Most of the other questions were based on individual countries' issues which had been raised by them with the Presidency. They were trying to resolve issues for themselves; the issues were not necessarily collective.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	116	I will take two brief questions from Deputies Kenny and Rabbitte, and then a final reply from the Taoiseach.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	117	I recall the former US President, Ronald Reagan, going to the Berlin Wall and asking Mr. Gorbachev to tear it down. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, has been in Israel recently, where he met Prime Minister Sharon. The construction of a 24 ft. wall by the Israeli Government in occupied Palestinian areas on the West Bank is a cause of very serious concern internationally. Has the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, reported to the Taoiseach, both in his role as Taoiseach and as holder of the Presidency of the Council? What is the European Union's attitude towards its construction? Is it not clear that it is divisive and will lead to further trouble? Will the Taoiseach, in his capacity as holder of the Presidency, make it a priority to see that he has discussions with Prime Minister Sharon and Mr. Arafat to see that the construction is removed?
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	118	Is any initiative likely to be taken during the Irish Presidency on the Stability and Growth Pact? Does the Taoiseach agree that a legal wrangle between the Commission and the Council of Ministers is not exactly good for the image of European cohesion?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	119	The wall has been the focus of an enormous amount of time, dialogue and effort during the Presidency. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and I are involved. Deputy Cowen has met all those on the Israeli side and forcefully put the position. No one believes that constructing a wall effectively on Palestinian territory is helping the process to move forward. There is no unanimity regarding views on the issue either. For better or worse, it is going to the International Criminal Court in The Hague, but that could take some considerable time. In the meantime, the wall is being constructed. I have discussed the matter with President Arafat, with whom I had a lengthy conversation some days ago. I have also discussed it with the Palestinian Foreign Minister, and their Prime Minister is coming here shortly. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, is keeping in touch with the Israeli side. It is certainly unhelpful to the entire region.We are strongly supportive of the Stability and Growth Pact, though there were differences at the 25 November meeting. There was not much difference in substance between the two issues, but ECOFIN and the Commission want to go about things in different ways. The substance is not much different. However, Mr. Solbes felt that he was the guarantor of the treaty, and he is right. He must get a legal judgment on the matter, and he is proceeding to do so. As the Deputy knows, that has created some tension and annoyance, but doing so is his responsibility and right. The Commission is to introduce what it sees as a new document on the governance of the Stability and Growth Pact. It will be for us to start that discussion. Generally, it is felt by ECOFIN ministers that they will not move quickly to reach conclusions on this. I hope that in the presentationof the document, they will look at some of the issues on which we have made points — other countries are supportive of that too. As the Presidency, we will play our role in bringing it forward, but as Taoiseach I hope the issues about flexibility, particularly for countries with low debt, are dealt with in that governance document. I have made that point directly to Romano Prodi and to Commissioner Solbes.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	123	The Order of Business today shall be No. a11, Immigration Bill 2004 [Seanad] — Financial Resolution; and No. 2 — Immigration Bill 2004 [Seanad] — Second Stage. It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: (1) the Dáil shall sit later than 8.30 p.m. tonight and business shall be interrupted not later than 10.30 p.m.; (2) No. a11 shall be decided without debate; (3) the proceedings on Second Stage of No. 2 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 10.30 p.m.; and Private Members' business shall be No. 32, motion re care of the elderly (resumed) to conclude at 8.30 p.m.

Is the proposal for the late sitting agreed to? Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with No. a11, Immigration Bill 2004 — Financial Resolution, without debate, agreed to?
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	125	I oppose No. a11 as it is a contingent part of the Immigration Bill 2004 which we will discuss and decide on later in the week and which is flawed legislation. The Green Party does not support No. a11 being discussed without debate or, indeed, being moved in the House. On those grounds, we oppose it.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	126	With Deputy Boyle, I protest that we are taking a financial resolution on legislation which is not yet an Act. It cannot be taken in this order. Taking a financial resolution on a Bill which is under discussion in the House is not an acceptable procedure. It can only be provided for subsequent to the adoption of the Bill and its enactment. We protest at this and we have strong reservations, as already articulated, about the Immigration Bill 2004. It is not our wish to see it passed.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	127	Is the proposal for dealing with No. 2 agreed?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	128	The Immigration Bill has been introduced because the previous Bill was struck down in the courts from a number of perspectives. I understand the judgment referred to the Oireachtas, as the body empowered to make and introduce legislation, having not debated the Bill sufficiently. That should be a clear warning to the Government that no guillotine should be imposed on this Bill.One hundred amendments have been tabled to the legislation, which is of fundamental importance and addresses an important issue. Far from dealing with closing the loopholes exposed by the court judgment, the Bill brings new concepts into law, such as requiring citizens to report non-nationals if they stay in their house and are not deemed to be legal. I thought this trend had been banished from society some time ago.Obviously, the Bill has also been introduced to deal with the embarrassment felt by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who was Attorney General when the previous Act was introduced.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	132	Thank you, Sir, for your advice not to be deflected by the Minister for unlimited blather. I oppose the proposal. There has already been a change in the Order of Business. I do not know whether this was brought about by yesterday's votes but the position is still not satisfactory. One hundred amendments have been tabled and Deputies want to comment on the Bill. I suggest the Taoiseach allow an open-ended debate until the matter is discussed properly and dealt with comprehensively. For this reason, I oppose the proposal.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	133	I welcome the fact that the Government has backed off from ramming the Bill through today. Given that all Stages of this legislation were supposed to be dispatched as an emergency measure in one day, last Thursday, how can the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, rather than Deputies from this side of the House, table 20 amendments today? If the Bill had been enacted last Thursday, what would have happened to those amendments?I do not know if anybody is managing the shop on St. Stephen's Green. I never thought I would see the day when I would state in the House that, when compared with the man from Cahirciveen, the Minister makes his predecessor look almost half competent.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	134	That is a statement and a half.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	136	A Minister who last Thursday wanted to conclude all Stages of a Bill now wants to amend it today. While drafting these amendments he still has time to deliver to me personally last night a challenge to pistols at dawn.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	137	He is sitting fairly close to the Deputy.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	138	This is the man who handed it out for 15 years in this House and if a person says "Boo" to him he is off to get a douse of cold water and he has to be dampened down.This is a very important Bill. Even the Human Rights Commission has today made public its dissatisfaction with the manner in which it is being processed, as have the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and several other organisations. As Deputy Kenny has said, when one takes the Opposition amendments and adds them to the Minister's 20 latter-day thoughts, there are 100 amendments to this Bill and it is now proposed that Committee and Remaining Stages be taken tomorrow and guillotined at 1.30 p.m. That is not sufficient time. It is not the way to do business in this House. The man who was its greatest critic when he was over on this side of the House is now the greatest abuser of the parliamentary system. I say to the Taoiseach that it is not acceptable.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	139	The Immigration Bill would not have seen the light of day only for the courts. This must be recognised by the Government in its attempt to guillotine this legislation which requires time if only to deal with the amendments. This Government does not appreciate a basic and fundamental principle. With its penchant for guillotines, the Government needs to recognise that the courts should not be treated with the same disdain as it shows for everybody else. The courts have decided that this is a matter requiring legislation.For the Government to say this will be done with a stroke of a pen, reluctantly allowing some time before imposing a guillotine, is nothing more than contempt. If this is not legally contempt of court, it certainly is contempt of court in principle. The Government needs to bear in mind that legislation arising from a court action is the last piece of legislation that should be guillotined.

Although additional time has been given to Second Stage, it is to conclude at 10.30 p.m. and all Stages are to conclude tomorrow. While the extension of time accommodates additional opportunities for Members to participate on Second Stage, it is totally inadequate given the seriousness of this proposal.My party has tabled over 30 amendments and I believe there is inadequate time on Committee Stage to address each of those amendments properly, along with all the others that have now been presented. It is completely unacceptable. We will be opposing this proposal because it is an outworking of the incompetence of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in this and previous responsibilities. That is the reason the House is faced with this proposal once again.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	141	I wish to say a few words on this legislation. If the House allows me I will explain why it is important. Last week I took account of the Opposition argument not to introduce the Bill last Thursday and rush it through the House, something that has happened on many occasions in this House when the courts have struck down legislation. Members were given an opportunity over the weekend to consider the basis of the Bill. Yesterday I listened to Members who did not wish to see it rushed through the House today but the Government must see Second Stage completed today. The Whips can discuss tomorrow's arrangements for remaining Stages but we need to conclude the Bill tomorrow.The House is aware that the High Court delivered a judgment on 22 January 2004 finding, among other things, that there was no basis in the Aliens Act 1935 for the provision of the 1946 Aliens Order relating to the addition of a condition as to the duration of stay on permission to enter the State, which is a very serious matter. The court found that another aspect of permission in the Aliens Order 1946 relating to the power of an immigration officer and the Garda to ask non-nationals to produce identity documents was invalid. This is another very serious matter. It also found that the protection which section 2 of the Immigration Act 1999 purported to give to the Aliens Order was itself unconstitutional, another important matter.The consequences of the judgment go to the heart of the immigration control function as exercised in the State in respect of EEA nationals. All aspects of the operation of immigration control thought to be addressed by the Aliens Order 1946 are now either without a statutory basis or as open to challenge as to render these controls inoperable. These are highly important matters. The approach in the new legislation is to restate its primary statute with the minimum necessary changes and the contents of the Aliens Order 1946 as presumed to be in effect up to the day of the High Court judgment on 22 January 2004.In order for this legislation to be effective in removing doubt as to the conditions of non-nationals' stay in the State and ensuring meaningful entry controls, it is essential that this Bill be enacted immediately. Having waited a number of days because of the serious points at issue which I have outlined, the Government will give over six hours for Second Stage today. This Bill needs to concluded. I have outlined at least three of a number of serious points.

Such a demonstration of respect would not delay unnecessarily the flight of letters around the country from constituency offices.Does the Taoiseach intend to bring forward regulations in respect of electronic voting? Does he accept that it is without precedent that one should seek to change the voting system against the wishes of the Opposition parties in the House?

If it is implemented in its present form, it will have a profoundly negative impact on Irish agriculture. I would like to ask the Taoiseach two questions. When will the land Bill be brought before the House? Will the Taoiseach ask the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to discuss with the Minister for Agriculture and Food how the nitrates directive can be changed or amended to facilitate the agriculture industry?

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	270	I do, Sir, because this is your domain. The record of the House has been altered to read: "It is a deplorable act to target a few religious organisations and try to bankrupt them which is what Deputy Rabbitte is about." The country knows what the Taoiseach said, which is disgraceful in itself. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform thought it was a matter for hilarity, although when he is in the eye of the storm he takes it differently.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	271	The Deputy has made his point.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	272	For a long time the Taoiseach's language has been finessed in the record of the House, but now its meaning is being altered. That is a serious matter. I ask you, Sir, as the guarantor of my rights——

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	278	I will set it out in writing to you, a Cheann Comhairle, because it is a very serious matter. It is one thing to make changes in grammar and so on, but to alter the meaning is another. This is not the first time it has happened. It has happened on a number of occasions. It is here in black and white.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	279	The Deputy should give notice to the Chair.

I refer in particular to the building control Bill, which was promised for mid-2003 and then deferred to late 2003. We were then told it would be introduced in early 2004 and now it is to be mid-2004. Why, when it comes to——

#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	287	I request that Deputies confine themselves to asking a question on legislation as there are many Members who want to speak. There is no need for a preamble or for a Second Stage speech, just a simple question on what is appropriate on the Order of Business.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	288	I was not making a Second Stage speech.

#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	291	There cannot be another question on the same issue. The Deputy asked about legislation and the Taoiseach is about to answer him.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	292	My question concerns legislation. No. 25 on yesterday's Order Paper was the Railway Safety Bill, which could provide for investigations into rail incidents. Report Stage of that Bill has not yet taken place, although Committee Stage took place 12 months ago.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	293	The heads of the building control Bill have long since been approved and the legislation is to be drafted. I assume the delay is due to other priorities. The Bill was to be ready this summer but I will ask the Minister if it can be speeded up.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	294	What about Report Stage of the Railway Safety Bill? It is 12 months since Committee Stage was taken.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	295	That is a matter for the House.

An order dealing with use of electronic voting and other arrangements for the 2004 polls will be made in due course.Now can we have an answer on this matter?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	298	Last week when I was in the House, Deputy Gilmore asked me a question. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, said that at that stage no regulations were required. I asked the Minister whether regulations were required and I said that to the House at the time.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	299	Never mind Deputy Gilmore. This is what the Minister said.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	300	I am telling the Deputy what happened last week. This can be resolved easily if we ask Deputy Cullen to clarify matters.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	301	We will have to change the record again.

The Chair wishes to facilitate them. We cannot have a debate on the issue.

There is no problem with the Chair. There will be someone in the Chair until 11.15 p.m., so he need not worry about the Chair. We cannot have a debate on this issue.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	312	It is not a Bill. It is a question.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	313	The question has already been asked and it has been answered by the Taoiseach. If it is a question of secondary legislation the Taoiseach is entitled to defer his reply until another day under Standing Order 26. We are not having a debate on the matter.

He told me last week that regulations were not required. There may be a distinction between this and making an order. The voting this June is covered under the legislation of a few years ago and there is no requirement for regulations. That is what I understood the Minister to say last week. I will ask the Minister to clarify this and organise for a note to be made. On the Order of Business tomorrow somebody can put it on the record.

Even as we speak, there are no effective statutory provisions that can be relied on to assist the Government in exercising its obligation, as the executive power under the Constitution, to control the entry of non-nationals into the State nor their presence in the State. This Bill is designed to do little more than restore to statutory form the provisions of immigration law in these matters, as they were thought to exist, up to the delivery of the High Court judgment.There has been a considerable degree of debate on whether this matter is urgent. It is urgent to the extent that the more I go into saying how urgent it is, the more damage I might do to the public interest.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	366	Suffice to say that the capacity of the Garda Síochána to control illegal non-nationals in this country is seriously impaired by the absence of legislation in this area. In the ordinary course of events I would not have to move this Bill because, as Members know, under the programme for Government there is a long-term commitment to the restatement of immigration law in one coherent document. Preliminary work on this is being done in the Department ofJustice, Equality and Law Reform. I would have ideally liked to address the modernisation ofour immigration law in circumstances where there was much more time to consider manyof the ideas that have been floated in recentdays.Time is not a luxury on our side. No society can proceed for weeks on end with no statutory controls and no powers for its police force to deal with cases such as we encounter on a day-to-day basis. I say that not simply because of what people consider as classic immigration, but more in the context, which concerns me, of the need to control the movement of people who are engaged in international terrorism, the capacity to stop them at entry points and monitor their behaviour in the State and the capacity of the Garda Síochána to identify who is and is not here by demanding identification. These are basic duties of any democratic state. Of course, there are civil liberty implications in all immigration law. However, the ultimate law, as has been stated over many centuries, is to sustain the safety of the people —salus populi suprema lex. We cannot go on for weeks on end without a law that permits the Garda Síochána to control and monitor the presence of non-nationals in our State. It is not an option open to me.Time is not a luxury available to me or to any other Member. I would have preferred more time for the project on immigration law under way in my Department, to go through a consultative process and so on. This would ensure that the law is modernised, rather than taking an old law and reinstating it in large measure on a temporary basis, as we are doing today. I would prefer to be involved in the long-term project but, unfortunately, there is no warning of events such as High Court judgments. These judgments do not present us with a set of circumstances where we have months to prepare a response. Instead, they are handed down by an independent Judiciary and the House must respond as quickly as it can to the circumstances which then arise.Deputy Kenny suggested that I am somewhat embarrassed that as Attorney General in theprevious Administration I was party to the earlier Bill being drafted. That is not so — I wasnot.

I am not laying the blame on anyone else. However, I am not trying to cover up any personal embarrassment on my part.I want to lay to rest some of the myths and misstatements that have grown in certain public commentaries on this Bill. It is a straightforward exercise in transposing in large measure the content of the aliens orders into the form of a primary statute on a temporary basis to ensure a law in the short term. This is not draconian or punitive legislation. Since 1935, there has been largely one single set of rules regarding aliens. There has not been a Nazi-type immigration regime in Ireland. There have not been laws that have ground down people or been used arbitrarily. When some people saw this Bill reintroduced, they claimed that no civilised society could have these laws. These laws have been in place in large measure for the past 60 years. In that time, nobody has ever claimed that the law was Nazi jackboot-like and draconian. The florid language suddenly emerged because, for the first time, people who have been snoozing in a dreamland have to confront the law of the land.It is innate in any parliamentary democracy and constitutional sovereign state such as ours that the Executive or Government must have the right to control entry into its territory through its various agents and apparatus. That is an inherent duty, rather than a power, of a sovereign government. One could not say one was discharging one's duties as a Government unless one undertook that obligation. Therefore the legislative underpinnings in place at present are an enlargement and outworking of an inherent power residing in the Executive. It is not something which depends entirely on statute. When it is set down that foreigners in our midst should have identification and a permit authorising them to be in Ireland, which is perfectly reasonable, and it is provided that gardaí can both ask them to produce that identification and arrest those who cannot account for themselves, then a statutory basis is needed to do so. The inherent power of the State to protect its borders does not extend to a Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform or Government deciding by decree that gardaí can demand people's identification cards or arrest and detain those people.The Bill addresses the practical realities of both operating immigration controls at our ports and airports, as was done before, and renewing the permissions that non-nationals who comply with our laws already have. These are conditions non-nationals expect anywhere in the world. They are not being asked to submit to a draconian regime in Ireland which is not found elsewhere. The Bill also takes the opportunity, in somewhat more modern language, to omit some of the more arcane and outmoded provisions in the Aliens Order 1946.Some of the criticisms which have been voiced are based on the misapprehension of the relationship in law between a non-national and the State. The position recognised and confirmed by the courts is that, subject to two categories of exception to which I will refer later, a non-national has no right to be in our State and that permission to enter is in law a concession or privilege bestowed on the non-national by the State by virtue of its sovereign power. Control of non-nationals entering a state is a valuable and essential tool at the disposal of every sovereign state for the protection not only of its territory but of the people who lawfully live in that territory. This has long been universally recognised.In the Irish context this position is supported not least in two key judgments of the High Court — Pok Sun Shum and Osheku — where it was recognised as far back as 1986 that the State has extensive obligations to control the entry and presence of non-nationals in the interests of the common good. These cases have been quoted by the Supreme Court with approval, not least in last year's landmark case of L and O concerning Irish-born children, and in the context of the Article 26 referral of the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Bill 2001. In the latter case the Supreme Court, in referring to the 1986 judgments, said they reflected "an inherent element of State sovereignty over national territory long recognised in both domestic and international law".The Supreme Court has also held that immigration powers can be exercised by the Executive in the absence of legislation and the position has for many years been that the Legislature has chosen to legislate for the procedures governing the exercise of the executive power in immigration matters. I refer to the Aliens Act 1935, which is statutory, and the Aliens Order 1946, which is a statutory instrument, as well as the many amending orders made under that Act to those orders.All that legislation came under scrutiny in the 1999 Laurentiu case when the Supreme Court found that the manner in which the 1935 Act had conferred power on the Minister to make secondary legislation, the aliens orders in this case, in respect of deportations was inconsistent with the 1937 Constitution. To deal with the situation the Oireachtas enacted the Immigration Act 1999, which included a provision in section 2(1) that every aliens order made before the passing of the 1999 Act under section 5 of the Aliens Act 1935 was to have statutory effect as if it were an Act of the Oireachtas. The aim was to protect the provisions of the aliens orders from a further finding similar to the Laurentiu case.In the Laurentiu case it was said, in effect, that one cannot simply give a Minister wide-ranging powers without laying down policies and objectives in legislation. One cannot simply say the Minister can do whatever occurs to him in the national good and make orders which affect people's rights. There was an impermissible delegation of legislative function to the Minister under the Aliens Act 1935. In the 1999 Act the opportunity was taken by Members to try to put right what happened in the Laurentiu case and to say that what was in those orders should have the effect of law.The High Court judgment of 22 January, which is the immediate trigger for this Bill, concerned further questions relating to the validity of the 1935 Act and the 1946 order. The court found that there was no basis in the 1935 Act for the provision of the 1946 order relating to the imposing of a condition on a non-national's permission to enter the State as to duration of stay. That was an omission. Although there was authority to deal with the fact that the person came in, the 1935 Act did not confer the power to make laws on the duration of the stay. The court also found that another aspect of the 1946 order, relating to the power of an immigration officer or a garda to ask non-nationals to produce identity documents, was invalid. Most significantly, the court found that the formulation of words used in section 2(1) for providing that the aliens orders, as amended, should have the force of law as if they were an Act passed by the Oireachtaswas an unconstitutional method of creating statute law.The practical effects of the judgment go to the heart of the immigration control function as exercised in the State with regard to non-European economic area nationals. Every aspect of the immigration controls thought to be addressed by the 1946 order is now either without a statutory basis or so open to challenge as to render those controls extremely difficult to operate. As recently as yesterday there were fresh High Court proceedings relating to these matters.The areas dealt with by the aliens orders include the appointment of immigration officers; immigration controls on non-nationals entering or seeking to enter the State, including refusal of leave to land; permission to remain in the State, including conditions covering whether the non-national is permitted to work and the duration of stay; Garda registration of non-nationals; powers to check non-nationals for evidence that they are permitted to remain in the State; and the power to charge non-nationals for breaches of their permission to remain or for illegal presence in the State and to arrest and detain them for such offences.The implications extend well beyond the question of managing the practical entry of non-nationals into the State. There are also practical implications for many of the 128,000 non-nationals who live in Ireland, the vast majority of whom are here legally and are very welcome. There are 128,000 people in current registration with the Garda and the laws under which they are registered are now seriously undermined by virtue of this High Court decision. It is for us to put that right.It is reasonable for a non-national to expect, when seeking a re-entry visa for return to the State after a trip back home, that he or she can rely on the documents and passport stamps provided by the State's immigration systems to back up that application. When seeking to become naturalised, he or she can show that they have been lawfully in Ireland for the length of time necessary for naturalisation. However, that can no longer be the case if the law is invalid or if a cloud of doubt hangs over it. We must address this matter.The judgment also has longer-term implications for the Legislature in that it appears to rule out the possibility of legislating by reference to a text not appearing in the Bill in question. This does not just apply to aliens orders. For instance, it has long been the practice in the House with restrictive practice orders to confirm orders made by Ministers as subsequent to sections in a confirming Act, saying they should have the effect of law. The High Court judgment casts doubt on past cases where that legislative tactic was adopted and raises some serious questions for the House.It is the Government's intention to appeal the judgment to the Supreme Court. However, as in the course of business in the House, there are sometimes delays in the court system. It is unlikely that the Supreme Court decision will be handed down in the very short term. Even if the appeal is determined in the State's favour, in the intervening period the status of immigration law and, in particular, the power to exercise controls on the entry of non-nationals into the State and on their stay here, would at best be in a state of uncertainty. There is no stay on an appeal in regard to a declaration of unconstitutionality. If the High Court rules that a Bill is unconstitutional, I cannot say I am appealing it andtherefore I am going to operate it; it is quite the reverse. As soon as that declaration is handed down, I have to obey it, unless and until the Supreme Court differs with the High Courton it.The remaining parts of the aliens order are vulnerable and open to challenge. Even as we debate this legislation, injunctions are being sought by non-nationals arriving at our ports seeking to enter. This is not a fanciful or contrived emergency, it is real. Accordingly, it is necessary to take what is essentially an emergency step to address the situation arising from the judgment of 22 January. The effect of the Bill is to restate in primary statute, and with the minimum necessary changes, the contents of the Aliens Order 1946 as it was presumed to be in effect up to the day of the High Court judgment. As I said earlier, there will be a time for more considered reflection as to whether we can move it this way or that and take different decisions on it. We do not have weeks and months in which to put together a legislative arrangement.With the exception of the question of fees, all the elements of the aliens order have been part of immigration law up to the present, either exactly as they appear in the Bill or with minor adaptations to modernise its presentation. What we have done in preparing this Bill is to take what, up to the time of the judgment, was thought to be the law as set out in the aliens orders and, as given effect to by section 2 of the Immigration Act 1999, as if it were a primary statute, and to put that into the form of this Bill. For completeness, some elements have been drawn from other sources, thus elements, some based on provisions of the Aliens Act 1935 but mainly from more modern statutes, are pressed into the service of the Bill. The opportunity is being taken to either modernise or drop altogether some of the more obviously anachronistic elements of the law as expressed in the 1946 order.A number of Deputies have tabled amendments, which I have begun to go through conscientiously. I will accept any of them I consider to be right in drafting and substance. It is my intention to accept Opposition amendments or produce a slightly tidied up version in substitution for them because, as I said earlier, this is something we have to get right. Even though I envisage this as a short-term measure, I do not want it said of me that I rejected something worthwhile simply because of the source of the proposal. I want to be open and inclusive in my approach.In going through Opposition amendments yesterday, I noted points from each of the three parties which had tabled amendments that I was disposed to accept. I will explain them at a later stage. I say this in case everyone thinks I am coming in here with the intention of running things through without listening to what has been said. I also listened to what was said by the various lobby groups and the Human Rights Commission. I do not agree with all I have heard, but I am trying to do my best to ensure that in the short time available to us we come up with a good Bill, bearing in mind that it is being done in a very short timeframe for the very good reasons I mentioned before.I want to say one thing about the European Convention on Human Rights. We passed into law a Bill which stated that all laws passed both before and after it should be interpreted, as far as possible, in a manner compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. People have suggested that we should somehow marry the two Bills together. We do not have to make a ritual statutory obeisance to the European Convention on Human Rights any more. Every Bill we pass, unless its content is specifically incompatible with this Act, is to be interpreted and applied in a manner which is ECHR compatible. When people ask how various legislative proposals comply with the European Convention on Human Rights, they should bear in mind that the courts and every legislative and executive institution of the State is bound to apply the law in a manner which is ECHR compatible. If, for instance, it is part of ECHR law that a particular power should only be used in a proportionate manner or some other such provision, this will be implied in the law once it is passed because the House has said that in future its laws are to be read in this way.I do not propose to give a section-by-section account of the content of the Bill. The Bill and its explanatory memorandum largely explain themselves. If there are particular concerns, we can cover them on Committee Stage. However, section 5 is worthy of special mention. This sets forth in clear and simple terms the difference between mere presence in the State and lawful presence in the State. Although we have had statutes governing the presence of non-nationals in the State since its foundation, this is the first statutory expression of the distinction between mere presence and lawful presence. The courts have, particularly in recent cases, been clear in their expression of the lawfulness of a non-national's presence in the State where that presence is in accordance with the terms of a permission given by, or on behalf of, the Minister. This is now enshrined in section 5(1). The courts have been equally trenchant in their expressions on the other side of this particular coin, namely, that a non-national who is in the State, otherwise than in accordance with the terms of a permission given by, or on behalf of, the Minister, is for all purposes unlawfully in the State. That is what subsection (2) says. One is either here in accordance with a permission or not. We are now dividing non-nationals into two clear categories; those who are lawfully here and those who are not lawfully here.People have said that because this Bill replicates the old law, those convicted of offences which carry more than a year in prison may be refused entry to the State, that Nelson Mandela could be refused entry to the State. That is a point, but let us remember the following. This morning we heard it said that people who lived under punishing dictatorships would be refused entry by an immigration officer. Everybody who comes here as an asylum seeker under the 1951 Refugee Convention is not comprehended by the terms of the legislation. I want to make this clear. The Bill specifically acknowledges that people coming to Ireland claiming protection cannot be rejected on the grounds that they have been convicted by some dictatorship or sentenced to Robben Island for life for treason or whatever. I want to make this clear because these things are trotted out as serious propositions. This legislation is not a derogation from our obligations to refugees under international law and does not seek to do so.

What we can do is say to a shoplifter or pickpocket from Paris who has been done several times for an offence and given a year in jail: "No, you don't get into Dublin to practise your trade, sorry, back you go." That is reasonable. This is inherent in our common travel area agreement with the United Kingdom. Like the United Kingdom, we say that people who have been convicted of criminal offences up to a certain degree of seriousness can be refused entry into the State.

The truth is that it is unlikely to be done in small cases. However, immigration officers can refuse entry to this State of known psychopathic murderers, child abusers or convicted money forgers. I challenge anyone to say that this is unreasonable. If it is unreasonable, every state in the world of which I know is equally unreasonable.The point has also been made that this Bill breaches our EU obligations. People from the EU and the EEA are not affected by this legislation. However, even this right is not absolute. It is interesting to note that, under EU law, psychiatric infirmity is a ground for any member state to refuse entry to the citizen of another member state. We were told that this was a terrible new and draconian power. The fundamental law of the European Union and of the Irish State — because it is superior to our own constitutional law — recognises that member states of the European Union are not obliged to admit to their territory people who suffer from certain psychiatric disorders and may invoke that as a ground for refusing entry to the European Union.

However, I was equally unhappy with the original formulation contained in the 1946 Aliens Order and its now long gone references to imbeciles etc. I felt the language was Victorian. We decided to introduce a Bill that was in line with our EU entitlements. In view of the furore that any reference to psychiatric illness under the Mental Treatment Act provoked, I will impose on non-nationals coming to Ireland the same right of exclusion as currently exists for EU nationals. The section will use different language and I hope it does not cause offence to anybody. I could expand on that if I had more time.I have listened to the public debate and have tendered a number of amendments accordingly. It has been suggested that tabling amendments which tidy up the Bill shows it was a mistake to rush this. Anyone will benefit from listening for a week to debate on any measure. Considering Opposition amendments is always a process from which anyone can also benefit. This is a good reason why, in principle, Bills should not be rushed and guillotines should not normally be deployed. By the same token, this House does not have the luxury to delay dealing with these issues. I will take every reasonable amendment, consistent with the purpose of this Bill, to make this legislation as good as it can be, having regard to the time constraints we are labouring under. No Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform can go further than this, nor can a reasonable member of the Opposition ask him to.
#JohnDeasyFG	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-party	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-dob	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	379	The Minister cannot use international terrorism as an excuse for introducing every Bill. I have argued that we do not have proper controls for international terrorism. To use this when discussing the Immigration Bill is raising a spectre that is not necessarily true. It is important that the Minister should dissociate that from the Bill before us.The Minister said we have to get this right. However, a number of provisions in the Bill have been amended twice since the first proof was published. This is not the way to carry out business or get legislation right. The Minister has admitted that elements may be amended three times before we have finished our consideration of the Bill. No consultation process was engaged in with groups involved in this area, particularly the Human Rights Commission. These groups should have been involved at some point. This legislation cannot be right if we deal with it in this haste. If the Minister wants to bring attention to himself for abusing the legislative process, this is a perfect example.The Minister referred to the arcane provisions of the Aliens Order and the modernisation of some of its provisions. If we are to correct such an order, surely we should spend time modernising it and meet people with expertise in the area, such as those who deal with immigrants. The Aliens Order, which originated in 1935, was borrowed from a British order dating from 1910. It is a terrible way to carry out business that we are expected to modernise the Aliens Order over the course of a week. While I might agree with the Minister that we have a problem and the Garda and immigration bureau need certain powers to deal with immigrants, this is an object lesson in how not to propose legislation.I received the proof of this Bill on Tuesday last. While I am not an expert on drafting legislation, some of drafting in the Bill was astonishing. In one case, a reference to disability was changed to mental disorder and we now have a list of classifications. This was not properly thought out. Deputy Rabbitte made a valid point when he asked about the 20 amendments that have appeared since last week. No one has responded to this.The Bill was introduced to remedy constitutional defects in existing law as highlighted by the High Court case. The defects stem from section 2(1) of the Immigration Act 1999, in which the Government attempted to confer retrospective validity on a series of regulations whose constitutionality had been previously questioned by the courts in the Laurentiu decision. In attempting to fix a problem highlighted by the Laurentiu decision, the Government failed for a second time to remedy this problem.Legislation, particularly in the area of justice, is badly rushed. I am told that in many cases it is impossible to properly amend legislation that has 30 or 40 amendments tabled at the last minute. One cannot judiciously examine the legislation or contact experts in the area and the Opposition does not have the opportunity to deal adequately with it. The Minister must stop doing this. This Bill is a perfect example of this practice. While there are circumstances behind this, a pattern of rushing legislation is evolving. Deputy Rabbitte was correct when he said the Minister has become the greatest abuser as far as this is concerned. It does not provide due legislative process.I acknowledge that difficulties have been created by the High Court judgment in enforcing the immigration laws. When the Minister contacted me to inform me that he was introducing this Bill, I understood the problem and realised that it must be addressed. However, this has been done in an abysmal manner. The entire process has been an eye-opener for everyone in this area.We have been waiting for legislation on disabilities for four years and on public order for approximately two years. However, this Bill has been produced over a two-week period, which leads me to question how we prioritise legislation. In the first instance the Government made a mistake, then people put their minds to it and this Bill was prepared quickly. People were embarrassed by the High Court judgment of Ms Justice Finlay Geoghegan.The drafting of the Bill was incredible. In last Tuesday's Bill, it was stated in section 9 that the register may be established and maintained in a form that is not legible, if it is capable of being maintained in a legible form. That makes absolutely no sense. I was not surprised it was delayed as many parts of the Bill made no sense. Some parts have been changed but I do not think the requisite time has been given to people to deal with it.Last Friday's debate in the Seanad was a farce. I did not think I would ever see anything such as that and Senator Mansergh did not think so either. I do not think the assertion that it was authoritarian is far from the truth. We are debating this Bill because a High Court judge found it necessary to find legislation unconstitutional because the Government of the day tried to give statutory effect to an order. In effect, the judge was saying that the Oireachtas should be given due time to deliberate and debate the legislation. Surely the Government should have the wit to allow the Seanad more than two hours to deliberate on it. The Government has called it wrong twice already and it is not a smart move to allow only two hours debate in the Seanad.I voted with the Government when the previous Immigration Bill was before the House. I accepted that access and border controls were necessary and that the legislation was needed. However, I think this Bill is nonsense. The provisions go way beyond what the High Court judge pointed to and it is disingenuous to a great extent. This Bill was meant to correct particular provisions but it goes way beyond that.The debate focused on a reference to disability and this was replaced with a new provision allowing the refusal of entry to people with a mental disorder, as defined by the Mental Health Act. The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, stated in the Seanad that the Government amendment was limited in scope and a justice spokesperson said that the intention was to allow refusal of entry only to people with serious psychopathic tendencies That is a good example of the lack of thought that has been put into the drafting of the Bill. This is the third attempt. The diseases are listed — tuberculosis, syphilis, other infectious or contagious parasitic diseases, drug addiction and profound mental disturbance. It was a case of denial last week and if people had not been given the chance to deal with this during the weekend, it would not have been changed.The Minister will have to rethink the entire Bill. I remember I was given a hiding for speaking on the floor of the House without having anything prepared on a Private Members' motion. I admitted to it. The Minister has to admit that if he wants an example of how not to do things, how to create distrust in the legislative system, he has done it brilliantly. The Schizophrenia Association of Ireland made a very valid point. What would happen to a person who was identified as having a severe mental disorder? Will he or she be put back on a ship or aircraft while we say, "Goodbye"? Do we turn round sick people and send them on their way? The difficulty is this legislation goes far further than filling in the loopholes that were pointed out by the High Court. In one case it criminalises Irish citizens for failing to comply with immigration provisions. It would be an offence for a non-national not to report to the Garda a non-national who is in co-habitation, but it is not an offence for an Irish national to fail to report it. That could be described as discriminatory. We are being turned into a nation of spies.The Bill allows for a non-national to be refused entry if he or she has been imprisoned for a year or more. There has been a lot of hyperbole about it, but I do not think the definitions are as tight as the Minister may think. What happens if one comes from a country with a five-year sentence for stealing a bar of chocolate? One might not be categorised as a political refugee. The Immigration Council of Ireland, among others, says that is unfair. I understand the Minister's point that there is hyperbole when it comes to Nelson Mandela but it is the case that countries hand down draconian sentences for very minor offences. People who have fallen victim to those sentences would again be victims of this Bill.

There is no proper review procedures with regard to decisions made by immigration officials. There is no due process for people who in many cases are extremely vulnerable. They have no right to appear or any effective legal remedy. The Bill was not referred to the Human Rights Commission. The Minister appointed Mr. Maurice Manning and must have believed he had a role in dealing with issues on immigrants. Why did the Minister not provide him or the Human Rights Commission with some opportunity for consultation? I believe the commission raised concerns about giving immigration officers power to detain a person reasonably believed to be a non-national. Its concern was that people could be singled out for special treatment because of race, colour or other distinguishing characteristics. Will the Minister address that concern?I have had legal advice that the Bill does not simply close off the loopholes exposed by the High Court. We were led to believe the Bill would simply put pre-existing procedures on to a statutory footing. That is disingenuous.

Based on the funding being made available, it is planned to offer up to 2,500 places on the scheme. To contribute to the costs of wages, insurance and materials, €10 million will be allocated from the dormant accountsfund.The scheme is aimed at those on long-term social welfare benefits. It is envisaged that to be eligible to participate, a person must be on farm assist or possess a herd number and be in receipt of unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit, if previously on community employment or disability allowance.The rural social scheme will be designed specifically for rural people and its operations and structures will operate in a farmer-friendly manner. The scheme will recognise that these small farmers have a wealth of experience and talents that need to be preserved for future generations. It is my intention that the scheme will be operated so that the talents of both farming men and women will be harnessed for the good of the community. As a result, this scheme is a community programme, with a focus on the provision of direct services in the community.It is proposed that participants on the scheme will receive a payment, which will provide a weekly amount in excess of what they currently receive from the Department of Social and Family Affairs and will receive a rate comparable to what they would currently receive on schemes such as the community employment scheme. It is planned that participants will remain on the scheme for one year, with priority being given to new applicants. In the event that there are no new applicants, participants may continue on the scheme.FÁS has advised my Department that it has approximately 1,300 participants on community employment who would qualify for the new scheme. It is anticipated that the vast majority of these people on community employment will opt for the new scheme, thus freeing up additional places on the community employment scheme. Detailed guidelines for the scheme and the administrative arrangements are currently being developed by my Department in consultation with other public bodies.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	396	It is clear that the rural social scheme is still at an early stage of development but who will run it? Will it be operated under the Leader programme or some other group? How will the Minister co-ordinate it with the existing community employment schemes? For instance, if a few people in a parish are working under the scheme will they be supervised by the same supervisor who deals with the community employment scheme? The Minister should ensure that the new scheme will not become a bureaucracy to override existing community groups and schemes.The Minister referred to the disability allowance. If a farmer's son or daughter does not have a herd number — I have a specific case in mind — will such a person be eligible? There is such a limited involvement in FÁS now that the opportunities for people in rural areas are scarce. The Minister should take that type of situation into account. Farmers or their children should be eligible for the scheme.Will people on farm assist be forced to take jobs under this scheme? As the Minister has said, of the 8,600 who are currently on farm assist, roughly 1,300 are working on FÁS schemes. Therefore, approximately 1,200 extra must be found to fill the new scheme. Will the Minister assure the House that the scheme is not being proposed just to make sure that fewer farmers will be able to avail of the farm assist scheme? When farm assist was introduced it was supposed to be for 20,000 people but because of red tape and a lack of interest by farmers, 8,600 is the maximum number who participated in it.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	397	The Deputy has asked a series of pertinent questions. First, nobody will be forced into the scheme. I accept, however, that there may be farmers who are entitled to farm assist but are not claiming it for one reason or other. During the past week, I attended an IFA meeting at which I made clear my attitude to theseissues. I am glad to hear the Deputy's comments because I concur with him that it is important, particularly with the changes in relative agricultural incomes, that people should claim their due entitlements.The Deputy referred to the issue of eligibility for farmers' sons and daughters. As things stand currently, they will not be eligible for the scheme. However, we are examining a situation whereby a farmer's dependent spouse could go on the scheme but, in return, the person in receipt of farm assist would have to give it up. It is important to achieve a balance of men and women participating in the scheme in rural communities.The situation is clear. At the moment, there are approximately 20,000 community employment places, with a further 5,000 between the job initiative and the social economy schemes. The new rural social scheme will add another 2,500 to the current total of 25,000. FÁS has provided us with an estimate because it did not register whether people who came from the unemployment benefit system had a herd number. Those figures therefore represent our best guess at the moment. We will allow for a minimum of 1,300, or maybe up to 2,000, to come off community employment and on to the new scheme.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	398	The minimum is 1,300.

That should accommodate some of the people to whom the Deputy has referred, farmers' sons and daughters on the scheme. As regards when the scheme will commence, we have done quite a bit of work and we are having discussions with the various agencies. We hope to have local sponsors as well as some intermediary body, although not FÁS in this case because it is not a training scheme. We are talking to Leader personnel because that programme operates throughout rural Ireland. We need some intermediate body and currently there are discussions and negotiations going on about that. FÁS, the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the Leader programme and Údarás na Gaeltachta have great experience with such schemes and have been helpful in sharing their knowledge with my Department. I hope to finish the process of designing the scheme quickly. While we will have to discuss it with FÁS, there is merit in the Deputy's suggestion to share resources in certain cases.

It will be like the community employment scheme. I am a great believer in rural Ireland and in what I call the parish scheme which, rather than a special scheme, gets all the bodies in a rural parish together. This could include the soccer club, the GAA club, community councils, the tidy towns committee, the day care committee, etc. This amalgam of the bodies — the parish scheme — then becomes the sponsor. I have seen this work well and successfully in my parish. When the parish gets its pool of people, they are divided out based on the needs of each organisation and according to their skills and talents. The sponsors must be local.There must also be an intermediate tier responsible for recruitment and organisation. We are considering Leader for that. No decision has been made but we are discussing the matter with Leader because when we look at the review of structures, we see that although we have State-sponsored community groups, Leader is the only one covering all of rural Ireland, which is what we need.Another issue we are considering is whether we should tell each sponsor and each local committee to set up a wages system or whether this should be done centrally because of the complications involved. We are examining a number of technical issues some of which are very mechanical. We will obtain quick answers to those.On the dormant accounts, whatever the money is spent on, if it is not all capital spending, the fund will run out at some stage. That is the reason we have been prudent with regard to spending. Allowing that some money must still come from dormant life insurance policies, at the present rate of going there are ten years of life left in the fund. Dormant accounts funding should not all be capital spending because we would then wind up with many buildings and not many services. If the fund runs out, it will have to be substituted by something else. If people stopped buying lottery tickets, schemes funded by the lottery would have to funded by something else.This scheme is here for the long term. At the rate of spending we are talking about, and we have been careful not to be tempted to spend it all in one go, the dormant accounts fund will have a fairly long shelf life, even if no new dormant accounts appear.

To date, nobody is able to answer the questions people ask about it. Will the Minister ensure that somebody who knows something about the future of the scheme is available to answer questions? I do not doubt the money in the dormant accounts will last, because the scheme is so slow getting off the ground. Significant funding will be available. My concern is where and when we can get answers and information.

There is a tendency nowadays to require an answer before something has been worked out and then to blame the person if matters do not work out as planned and one needs to change tack slightly. I have been as open and frank as I can be today about the direction I am taking.

However, until the deal is done and I have it cemented in place and the arrangements made, I do not want, nor is it fair to ask, a member of staff to postulate on what might or might not be done, although it is all right for me to do this in the Dáil. We would like to move forward quickly on this and to be able to say soon how it will be done. We can then build on the scheme and get it up and running for the people. It is a scheme for 2004 and nobody should doubt that. It will be done as quickly as possible, but some technical details must be worked out.

A critical objective is to maximise the benefit to the west of the national spatial strategy, major roads investment, the strategic rail review and decentralisation. At that time I said that it was vital that infrastructure and development go together — that each should make the other happen — and I felt that the commission was ideally placed to spearhead such an initiative. The overriding objective has been to enable local and regional authorities in these counties to plan a co-ordinated approach to maximise the development potential of the region.I view the Jobs for Towns report as a detailed and valuable report in such a relatively short time. The commission consulted the various local and regional authorities to compile and assemble this report. It has identified 20 towns with populations in excess of 1,500 and analysed their potential for development by reference to a wide range of criteria such as road, rail and air access, remoteness and physical and social infrastructure. I was especially pleased that account was also taken of towns' proximity to a CLÁR area. The need for an emphasis on smaller towns as part of the strategic development of the western region has been consistently pointed out in commission reports.In addition to the findings of the recent report, the commission intends to continue research into the development of small towns in the region. The national spatial strategy also reiterated the Government's commitment to balanced regional development, including the development of towns outside gateways and hubs, and rural regeneration. It will be noted that many of the findings of this report are relevant to the recent Government decision on decentralisation, the implementation of which will be greatly assisted by the data and analysis contained in the report.The report also deals with the issue of rail links and infrastructural development. I am aware the commission wrote to the four local authorities on the route of the western rail corridor to establish if towns in each county have been prioritised for growth, in part because of their positioning on the western rail corridor. Each local authority responded that it has made reference to this in its draft or current development plan.I have not doubt that the research undertaken for this report will be immensely valuable not only to local and regional authorities but also to national organisations, including Departments such as mine. I intend to use the findings in promoting development in the west in co-operation with my colleagues in Government. In this context, the decentralisation programme, coupled with infrastructural development, will contribute significantly to enhancing economic and social activity across towns in the west.
#PaddyMcHughIND	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-party	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-dob	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	409	I thank the Minister for his reply and acknowledge his interest in and knowledge of rural Ireland. Does he agree that the Western Development Commission report is one of a series of reports, strategies and reviews which have been produced with the express aim of achieving balanced regional development?I was in Knock Airport on the day the Minister requested the commission to prepare this report. My reaction at the time was to wonder why we needed another report, because we all knew the problems and ought to have been resolving them. Does the Minister agree that, at the time, he also said the report would inform thinking on the locations in the western region suitable for decentralisation?My scepticism was confirmed when the decentralisation programme was announced before the official launch of the commission report. It was further confirmed when a town designated in the national spatial strategy and also included in the Western Development Commission report did not qualify for decentralisation. The Minister knows that town is Tuam. Does the Minister agree that we have had enough reports? We should co-ordinate and dovetail them to move forward. The rejuvenation of the western region is dependent on the reopening of the western rail corridor. As the Minister will be aware, the Minister for Transport has said that for this to happen it is necessary to create a critical mass. Local authorities should take that into account in the development of their policies. What are we to make of the fact that on the one occasion the Government had to contribute directly to the creation of this critical mass in Tuam, it ignored its own national spatial strategy? The Government also ignored the public pronouncements of Ministers. When decisions are made on the final IT and health sector jobs to be decentralised, will the Minister ensure that some are moved to Tuam in support of the statements and policies in which we have been asked to believe?

Decentralisation, the western rail corridor and development in the west are all linked and we wish to position ourselves on them. The Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, made clear in the statement he made following publication of the report that we could create the circumstances in the west which would ensure the western rail corridor was opened. I discussed the matter with him and we agreed it would be a good idea to ask the Western Development Commission to produce a report in conjunction with local authorities, which would push the process forward.The report is useful. It promotes the concept that local authorities should prioritise for development towns along the western rail corridor and outlines the strengths and possibilities of each urban centre. The decentralisation model developed in the report was overtaken by a decision which was made faster than anybody in this House expected. I welcome that. There were a great many issues which had to be taken into account in the selection of towns. One of the problems with previous decentralisation programmes was that above principal officer level, a civil servant could not pursue a career without returning to Dublin. Therefore, the creation in the regions of a critical mass of Civil Service jobs is very important.Deputy McHugh spoke about Tuam and I understand that we all have to look after the home patch. However, the idea that if one places an industry in a town everyone working there will live in the immediate vicinity is incorrect. They will live in any town within a 15 to 20 mile radius. If a Department were situated in Claremorris, Tuam would benefit hugely. When the new road is completed, the distance between the two towns will be very short. My Department has used the Western Development Commission report to outline for people considering decentralisation the travel times between various locations in the west. In the case of my Department's decentralisation to Knock, travel times to Ballina, Tuam and Claremorris are outlined. That is what people consider when they are examining decentralisation. They ask what their choices are if they decide to live 20 minutes, 30 minutes or an hour from work. The report in question has proved its worth in the creation of an atmosphere in which we can move forward.

The rural settlement policy framework contained in the NSS aims to sustain and renew established rural communities while strengthening the structure of villages and smaller settlements to support local economies. In that way, key assets in rural areas are protected to support quality of life, and rural settlement policies are responsive to differing local circumstances.My colleague in Government, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, accepts that it is vitally important that there is certainty and consistency in the implementation by planning authorities of Government policy regarding rural housing through their own development plans and in the operation of the development control system under planning legislation. That is the purpose of the guidelines under the Planning and Development Act 2000 which the Minister, Deputy Cullen, intends to bring forward to deal with this issue.I gather that those are at an advanced stage of preparation and following ministerial consultation the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government hopes to issue them as soon as possible.

Does the Minister agree that contributing to that decline are the difficulties in some areas for local people in getting planning permission? Does he agree that another contributing factor is that when there is a shortage of supply and an increase in demand, it is almost impossible for local people or working-class people in rural areas to compete in the market? I speak in particular of scenic areas, where the number of holiday homes is increasing. Does the Minister agree it is of enormous importance that he come up with some form of imaginative scheme to help working-class rural people and those who were born into single-room rural cottages and do not have land of their own? Owing to the escalating cost of sites, effectively any couple trying to build their own home needs two mortgages, and in many instances the price of the site can exceed the cost of the building. Is some form of imaginative scheme — perhaps an interest-free loan over 25 years towards the purchase of the site, administered through local government — not needed urgently to reverse the decline?
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	420	It is well known that I believe that in rural areas outside those areas subject to major urban pressure, those with a connection with the place or who live there permanently should be accommodated. All that is clearly spelt out in the spatial strategy. The spatial strategy is there, and we do not need any housing guidelines to lay down the basic rules. Let us be clear about it. It states that near the big towns and cities where there is urban influence, people with a connection with the place, either through background or employment, full-time or part-time, should be accommodated with rural sites. It goes on to state that in the BMW region, away from areas of urban influence, anyone who will live permanently in a house should be accommodated. It therefore rules out overspill from the towns and cities into areas adjacent, as well as second homes.We must all be up-front about this. By designing the spatial strategy as we have, particularly in the scenic areas that the Deputy mentioned, we have excluded the very wealthy person who wants to build a second home from competing in the market. According to the spatial strategy, they should not be at the races. That was done for two reasons, the first being the obvious one of preserving the countryside, since one wants to ensure that those houses that are granted permission go to locals. The second one was the social reason that the Deputy has just propounded, the market for young local people buying sites whose parents do not have farms and have no connection with planning, and their right to planning permission. Those people should not be wrongfully priced out of the market by having to compete with holiday home owners.From the point of view of the person selling, we have limited the market, but for a local buyer we have ensured that he or she does not have to compete with holiday home owners. I am glad the Deputy has raised this matter because at many meetings throughout the country people on the one hand want to get top dollar and to be able to sell to the outsider while on the other they complain that those same outsiders are pricing their children out of the market. We can have it one way or the other.I was part of a council which adopted this policy long before the spatial strategy. Priority to build houses in rural areas and in scenic areas should be given to local people or to people who have moved to an area, live in it permanently and have a job in it, and not to people to have second homes. That is the best social policy we can follow.

Rural development policy is set out in the White Paper on Rural Development which is being implemented primarily through the national development plan.As pointed out in the national spatial strategy, in many rural areas the combination of a high dependency on a changing agricultural base, a scarcity of employment opportunities and resultant outward migration, has weakened their demographic, economic, social and physical structure.My Department is represented on the interdepartmental committee on implementation of the national spatial strategy. During 2003, my Department contributed to implementing the strategy, through, for example, the CLÁRprogramme which is targeted at particularlydisadvantaged rural areas and supports the national spatial strategy objectives. In addition, I asked the Western Development Commission to co-ordinate a strategy for towns on radial routes in the west so as to maximise the benefit to the west of the NSS in regard to major roads investment, the strategic rail review and decentralisation. In addition, I commissioned a review of support for enterprise in rural areas, the report on which I expect to have later this month.The national spatial strategy addresses many of my concerns in regard to such issues as rural housing. The rural settlement policy framework contained in the NSS, which represents overall Government policy on rural housing, aims to sustain and renew established rural communities, while strengthening the structure of villages and smaller settlements to support local economies. In this way, it seeks to ensure the key assets in rural areas are protected to support quality of life and that rural settlement policies are responsive to the differing local circumstances in different areas.My colleague in Government, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, accepts that it is vitally important that there is clarity and consistency in the implementation by planning authorities of Government policy in regard to rural housing through their own development plans and in the operation of the development control system under planning legislation. This is the purpose of the guidelines on rural housing which the Minister, DeputyCullen, intends to bring forward to deal with this issue. These are at an advanced stage of preparation.I understand from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government that under the Planning and Development Act 2000, all planning authorities must draw up a development contribution scheme in respect of public infrastructure and facilities provided by, or on behalf of, the local authority that benefit development in the area. These schemes must be adopted by 10 March 2004. It is the elected members of each local authority who decide on the level of contributions, the types of development to which they will apply and exemptions from the scheme, if any, for their own functional area. I am advised that all planning authorities have drafted development contribution schemes and as at 21 January 2004, 14 city and county councils had adopted their schemes.

I agree with the sentiments the Minister expressed but the time has come to make decisions. When will those decisions be made? I ask the Minister not to push them into the future because nothing is happening.

There was a difficulty with the 1997 sustainable development guidelines which, at the very least, led to obfuscation as to what urban generated development was. Planning authorities defined urban generated development as anything other than people functionally engaged in agriculture, which was nonsense. The majority of people living in rural areas are not functionally engaged in agriculture. Chapter 5 of the national spatial strategy, which is Government policy for the next 20 years, clearly lays down the ground rules for rural housing. It states that anybody with a connection with a place, either by way of background or by employment, full-time or part-time, is entitled, subject to good planning and design, to build in the countryside. Maybe we are missing the next step in the building block. It is now up to each local authority to write that clearly into its county plan. If it does not do that, we should not blame the planners but councillors from all parties. There is now no way a planner can state it is contrary to Government policy, which was the mantra we heard until then. This was clearly supported in a High Court action. There is an absolute obligation under the law for the planner to put the plan into force as written. The planner cannot rewrite the plan as she or he does not have that legal authority.We have, therefore, put all the blocks in place and in some counties it is working well because the councils put the second block in place and made sure their planners adhered to the law. It would appear that has not happened in other counties and Deputies should not blame the Government for that.

The Taoiseach made a speech in Sligo and when I queried him on it, he said he meant a farmer's son or daughter could get permission. It is time we cleared this matter up. Does the Minister accept it is logical, in an area he has designated for CLÁR and which is clearly identified as one that has suffered serious depopulation, to ask somebody who wants to live in it to pay significant development charges? Is there no Government thinking on this matter to ensure those areas are allowed to develop and to maintain their populations? Has the Minister been involved in this matter to ensure the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government does not bring forward a single regulation, clause or otherwise on an all-Ireland basis because the situation is different in various areas? There is no village in my parish of Aghabog which the Minister visited; it is totally rural. I wish to make sure a common sense approach is taken and not a global one which will be all things but which will mean nothing.

We all have a duty not to get involved in obfuscation. Any Deputy who wants to know the Government policy on rural housing would be well advised to go back to his or her office, to look up the national spatial strategy on the web and read chapter 5. I have outlined it twice today but there is a little more detail in it. I have, however, given Deputies the essence of what is in it and it is quite clear. Anybody with a connection with a rural area by way of background or employment, part-time or full-time, is entitled, subject to good planning and design, to get planning permission.

I explained how one would make sure that policy is delivered on the ground. If some local authorities are not doing that, they are not using the implement they have been given. In fairness to my county council, with which I have arguments on some issues, it is, a bheag nó a mhór, adhering to it.The issue of development charges is clear. Under the law, one cannot be charged for that with which one is not provided. In rural areas, for example, one must pay for public water if one is provided with it, which is not unreasonable. If, however, one is not provided with a sewerage service, one cannot be charged a development fee. If a local authority charged a person for seven years for a service it had not provided, the law provides that the local authority must return the money, with interest, to the person in question. Similarly with amenities——

Amenity charges are an issue for local authorities to decide. The level of charges and the way in which they are structured is a matter for each local authority rather than central government. The original intention of this measure was to ensure that those who benefited from amenities paid for by the State, namely, the taxpayer, having bought land at agricultural rates which was later rezoned, made their contribution to the costs of the provision of necessary services on their sites.

Deputies share the Minister's opinion on once-off rural housing. Planners interpret county development plans in their own way in many cases. The Minister may shake his head but it is the reality.The Minister's argument, if I have interpreted correctly, is that the only way to ensure that people in rural areas will be able to obtain a site at an affordable price is to require persons selling sites to sell to local people only. How can anyone implement such a measure without coming into conflict with the provision on private property in the Constitution, which, I presume, allows property owners to do as they wish with private land? How can local authorities or the Government prevent someone from selling a site to whom they want?

If a planner proves that the words a person has written meant something else, the simple course of action for that person is to change the plan to make it mean what he or she intended. I am fed up listening to the argument that certain planners defy the law. If that is the case, they should be made amenable to it. Perhaps the reason the problem arises is that, when push came to shove in the cases in question, some people were not willing to do the hard work or read the small print to ensure the plan was watertight.I am surprised at a Labour Party Deputy framing a question on property rights in the terms used. The Constitution is clear on the issue of private property rights. All private property rights are subject to the exigencies of the common good. If that were not the case, we could not have planning law. We all know one cannot build a 50 storey office block or make hundreds of other changes on one's private property. The only matter the Constitution makes absolute in private property is that it is not within the power of the State to abolish it. It has, however, a right to delimit its use, which the House does regularly in the laws it passes — for example, on special areas of conservation and so forth. I do not accept the argument that we cannot impose restrictions on those who may obtain planning in certain areas.

The term "common good" needs to be defined, not only, as is usually the case, in the construction of roads and so on. It is not defined in planning.

Planners are not delivering Government policy in their planning decisions. It is time the Minister and his colleagues in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government issued a directive to county councils stating that Government policy, as outlined in the spatial strategy, is the way forward. While I acknowledge the Minister's commitment to this issue, it is unreasonable that nothing has happened in this area. The Government has been talking about the issue since it came into office but there is no finality about it.Will the Minister ensure that, when the planning guidelines are issued, positive discrimination takes place in favour of rural areas in which the population is stagnating or declining? If possible, we should discriminate to make it easier for people to live in disadvantaged and distant communities rather than communities nearer to large towns. Deputy Crawford made the important point that one cannot have one rule for all but must discriminate positively and selectively in favour of rural areas.

We have stated that the bias must be in favour of local people or people working locally. I do not know how often we have to repeat this before others accept that this is laid down in black and white in cold print.Some local authorities have listened carefully and use the clear statement in the spatial strategy to ensure their county plans are specific on this subject. I congratulate, in particular, councillors in Galway who wrote the relevant sections of the spatial strategy into the county plan to reinforce the sub-rules they made. This was done to ensure that, if any planner argued that the rules were contrary to Government policy, councillors could point to the relevant section of the spatial strategy. Is Deputy O'Dowd indicating that county councillors are not including Government policy in their plans?

What appears to be happening according to the Deputy, and it surprises me, is that some councillors and councils, as opposed to council officials, are not implementing the spatial strategy, despite all the shouting. If they write the strategy into their plan, a planner has no choice but to implement it. If we can persuade everybody to stay calm and follow a three step process, we will get there. We could shout forever about the issue, but most politics is about slow, step-by-step work.

There are, however, problems. For instance, on one side of the road from Castleisland to Tralee, a national primary route which the Minister knows well, 40 or 50 trucks per hour access the road from the John A. Woods quarry company, while on the other side, where there are three agricultural entrances, a person who owns eight acres of land cannot obtain planning permission. This is an example of the anomalies in the system.From a rural point of view, nothing is being done to facilitate local working class people who want to live in their area but cannot afford sites. The knock-on effect of this is that they join the housing list and the Government must pay €140,000 to build a council house to accommodate them. If the Government could provide a mechanism to offer such people an interest-free loan, they could buy a site and live in their own area.

It is far wider than the interest of the common good because the common good is very difficult to define——

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	446	I have a question. It is very difficult to define when it comes to the single, one-off dwelling; it is much easier when dealing with a road, for instance. In Cork County Council's development plan, a farmer's son who has no connection with the land other than he was born in a particular area, has no difficulty getting planning permission but the farm labourer's son who may have the county council acre is refused point blank. That is an issue of discrimination. In order to ensure rural areas continue to be populated, is the Minister prepared to issue clarification to county councils who are implementing this policy before someone takes them to court and they are found guilty of discrimination?
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	447	On the issue raised by Deputy Ferris, we must ensure that lives are not unnecessarily endangered. In County Galway, planning permission for such a case as outlined by the Deputy will not be granted for land opening on to a national primary route if there is an alternative opening on to a secondary or smaller road. This is purely for safety reasons. Some years ago, An Foras Forbartha proved quite conclusively that the more openings on a road to accommodate houses, the greater the risk of accidents. We must always look at the big picture and be honest with ourselves.In reply to Deputy Crawford, as I have not seen the applications in question, I cannot say why they were refused on technicalities. I reiterate that as far as Government policy is concerned, in the BMW region such as the Deputy's constituency, in an area of non-urban influence and where the person wishes to live permanently, that person should get planning permission, subject to good planning and design and as long as he or she does not build in a bog hole, for instance.I was very involved in the spatial strategy and in the wording of this section. The words "farmer's son or daughter" or any other, do not appear. The phrase used is, "those with a connection with the place by way of background." That word is crucial. I am tired of this argument about the farmer's son when I know that more and more young people growing up in the countryside are not going to be the sons of farmers but the sons of somebody with a half-acre site. The spatial strategy is clear on that issue and I advise the Deputy to study it.There also seems to be a problem in the case quoted by Deputy Lynch in that even though the spatial strategy is not the interpretation wished for by either of us, the county plan, which is not the prerogative of the manager, but 100% the prerogative of the councillors, has not yet aligned itself with the spatial strategy. I do not know when the Cork county plan is due for review but I suggest the Deputy line up the county plan to exactly reflect the spatial strategy. Her problem is then solved in one go and the county manager has no option but to apply the plan as written.There was a court case which tested the issue of whether they had a right to rewrite the plan in their own head contrary to what the council had done and the answer was clearly given in the High Court case, as I interpret it, that they had to comply with the plan as long as it was legal.

My Department, supported by ADM Limited, co-ordinates the implementation of the RAPID programme. It is, therefore, a matter for each of the other Departments to report on progress on the implementation of RAPID and details of funding for the proposals that fall within the remit of their own Department.In the case of my Department, proposals from RAPID plans fall to be considered under the community development programme, CDP, funding for local drugs task forces, LDTF and the young peoples' facilities and services fund, YPFSF. Allocations of funding have been made to a LDTF project and a number of CDPs. I refer the Deputies to my reply to Questions Nos. 102, 103, 106, 108, 127 and 131 on 21 October 2003, for details of these allocations and general progress on the RAPID programme. There are no plans at present to extend the RAPIDareas.As I have stated previously, many of the proposals from RAPID plans have been sent unnecessarily to Departments for consideration, when it would be more efficient for them to be dealt with at local level. To this end, a dedicated fund of €4.5 million has been set aside for capital expenditure for the RAPID programme to support such small-scale projects. These projects will be co-funded by the relevant Department or local agency with levels of co-funding agreed at national level. Projects will be co-funded under a number of categories and I am in the process of conducting a series of meetings with my ministerial colleagues to agree such arrangements. Once these measures have been agreed, it is envisaged that an allocation will be made to each RAPID area based on size and population, for example. Area implementation teams will then select projects to be supported in this manner. I intend to make a formal announcement shortly regarding the precise details of the operation of this fund.My Department also provides the sum of €1.3 million to ADM Limited to meet administration expenses and to provide support to area implementation teams. The dormant accounts disbursement plan also gives priority to RAPID and CLÁR areas.As regards CLÁR, the measures introduced under the programme were decided after consultation with the communities in the areas concerned. They are, for the most part, operated in tandem with the lead Departments or agencies, as appropriate, thus ensuring coherence and effectiveness by public bodies in delivery of such measures in CLÁR areas.

I welcome the fact that money is finally being allocated to RAPID. In today's edition of The Irish Times it states that €1 billion was promised when it was launched, not €4.5 million. I ask the Minister to produce the goods and to say where the money is.There are many bodies involved, such as local authority employees who work for the RAPID programme, partnerships and ADM Limited. What are the Minister's plans for these funding bodies? Is there a case for having one organisation in charge of these schemes on a county basis?I question the non-involvement of elected public representatives in RAPID at the district level when projects are being developed. They are involved at county level but not in the decision making or the nomination of projects at local level. Will the Minister give the House his views and will he ensure that local representatives would be part of that partnership because they are excluded from it at present?

The figure being spent on housing renewal runs to approximately €900 million or €1 billion. Much of that money is concentrated in a small number of RAPID areas. Many things happen and I accept it has been difficult to define whether they would have happened anyway or whether RAPID has made a difference. It was one of the weaknesses in the scheme. There are new schools and new health centres in these areas but many people say that would have happened anyway and it is also happening outside the RAPID areas.This time last year I said there were weaknesses, even though the concept is very sensible and good. I have set about redressing those weaknesses. I see the operation on four levels. The fund is in place to deal with small issues — it is not intended to deal with the big issues.It seems ridiculous that one has to call the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to deal with a small area of a housing estate, for example, that needs some landscape management but is not receiving it. Similarly, if minor changes are needed to a health centre or a school — for example, if a few ramps or CCTV cameras are needed, one should not need to process the matter through the whole system. My idea was to put in place a fund to match it with other things so that, as is the case with the CLÁR programme, the small issues can be dealt with on the ground. The advantage of this approach is that by separating the small issues from the thousand other issues that exist, we are left with a much smaller number of big issues that need to be dealt with in RAPID areas. We will focus on such issues on a Department-to-Department basis. The reprioritisation element of the big things has not been removed from the scheme. It clears the way to focus on them to a much better extent.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	452	One of the weaknesses of the RAPID scheme since its beginning is that there has not been a report at a worthwhile level into what happened under the scheme. It was suggested that projects in the RAPID areas would be front-loaded, but there is no measure of that. There has been no effective monitoring of it. I agree with the Minister's idea of taking micro-decisions at local level and macro-decisions in Dublin. Nobody at central level is responsible for the implementation of the RAPID programme, however. I went through this in more detail on the last occasion the Minister took questions in the House. Nothing the Minister has said today leads me to believe that there will be a real coherence to improve on what is an awful situation.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	453	The Deputy asked about a report. I have a fairly simple view of life. The country is full of reports, each of which is glossier than the next. People in the CLÁR areas, for example, are aware of things happening there. I receive feedback from those on the ground. The compilation of a big, glossy report will not necessarily change very much, but it will take up a great deal of time and staff resources. Although it might give some glory to the Minister, that is not what it should be about. Our approach should be about making people's lives better.Many things have happened. If I trawl through the Departments and ask them to list everything they have done in RAPID areas in the past four years, I will find that many things have been done. In such circumstances, we would have a big debate in the House about whether such things would have happened in any event. My concern is to make more things happen. As I have said, I am trying to deal with the micro-matters at local level and, based on the IT plans, then deal with the big issues that remain. Individual Ministers will be responsible for trying to make progress in that regard. Those of us who understand the nature of the system accept that it is much easier to progress three, four, five or ten issues at interdepartmental level than try to progress hundreds of big and small issues.Deputy O'Shea asked who is responsible for the implementation of the RAPID programme at central level. I wish to make it absolutely clear that I will take central responsibility for this. I have put a great deal of time and effort intotrying to advance this matter in a way that will work and I will take responsibility for it. I am taking a hands-on approach. Some people have accused me of adopting too much of a hands-on approach, but if one is elected to do a job, the greater the hands-on approach one takes the better if that is the way to get the job done. I will answer to any committee of this House at any time in respect of any of the actions under the RAPID programme.

The RAPID programme is available in the progressiveCavan town area, but it is not in place in the Monaghan town area. Is there any possibility of the programme being extended in that direction or is there any reason it is not being so extended?

One of the mistakes we made in pursuing previous programmes was that we could not resist the temptation to extend the boundaries. The effect of this policy was that too large an area of the country was covered. We did a disservice to those suffering the greatest levels of disadvantage by diluting the programme's effect. The boundaries of the CLÁR and RAPID programmes are fixed for the foreseeable future. I would like to make something happen within those lines.One of the good aspects of the CLÁR programme is that one receives letters from people outside its area who say they would love to be included. I think that is a great measure of the success of the programme. I will be happy when people start to ask for their areas to be included in the RAPID programme because I will know I am making a difference and that it is better to be in rather than out. We have not mentioned the transfer of moneys from dormant accounts, under the terms of which funds spent on social and economic matters had to be distributed in RAPID and CLÁR areas.We said that a large proportion of the funds allocated to combat educational disadvantage should be ring-fenced for RAPID areas. Let us be honest, rural Ireland does not suffer from educational disadvantage in the same way as the areas covered by the RAPID programme. Our decision led to the provision of an amount of money, over and above the sum of €4.5 million which I believe I can double following discussions in my Department. The funds from dormant accounts will be provided on top of that. These provisions will make a difference in advancing many smaller issues.

I have no doubt it is true.I am delighted to see the Minister present. As he knows, we are discussing an important Bill. He has explained that it is emergency legislation and he is determined to get it right. We would not have to be here had it not been for bad legislation from 1935 and a botched attempt to repair it in 1998. At this point all the signs indicate that we will botch it again and that we will rue the day the Department decided to railroad the Bill through both Houses without adequate time for debate.We saw the debacle in the Seanad last Friday after the Minister could not have his way in the Dáil on Thursday and have all Stages passed. All Stages were completed in the morning and early afternoon of Friday in the Seanad, with the result that there was no time for amendments to be debated. Now there is a quantity of amendments from the Minister as well as one or two he selected from our earlier amendments. I see a few changes similar to the Labour Party amendments from the Seanad. The end result is that it is unlikely we will have adequate time. We will finish Second Stage today and then take all other Stages tomorrow.This is a terrible waste of Dáil time. The normal procedure is for the Bill to be taken out of the Dáil and dealt with in select committee so that the Dáil may proceed with its business. Instead, we will deal with Committee Stage in the Chamber, although we could deal with other legislation, and then finalise all other Stages, all in a maximum of two and a half hours. It was said earlier that there will be more than 100 amendments in addition to the Minister's 20 amendments. I cannot see how we will get it right.The Minister indicated in his earlier remarks that this is something we must get right and indicated further that many of us are wise after the event, suggesting that there was quite an amount of support for the 1999 legislation from the Opposition backbenches. There certainly was not. I was in the Seanad at the time and dealt with the Immigration Bill 1999. To refresh the Minister on the degree of opposition expressed at that time, I will quote some of my remarks. On 2 July 1999, on Second Stage, I said:I am very opposed to [the Bill]. I am opposed to it because of its basic ethos. It is draconian legislation and is totally against non-nationals. There is an air of suspicion and penalisation about every aspect of the Bill and its entire tenor is unacceptable.I went on to say:With a Bill of this tenor, I am afraid we are not too big a step away from racism. I am very disappointed that the Department and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should come forward with this inadequate measure with regard to what we would regard as fundamental human rights. We should be ashamed of ourselves given the millions of Irish people who have gone to the far ends of the earth and who were non-nationals and illegal aliens in many of the countries to which they went. So much for our traditions ... As we approach the millennium, we have come up with legislation which effectively enshrines hostility towards non-nationals coming from other jurisdictions for whatever reason. We will put them through hoops and place as many hurdles as possible before them.I stated: "I am disappointed that the Bill is being forced through in the last two weeks of this session". There is a sense of déjà vu about this. I went on to say:The guillotine was imposed in the Dáil yesterday and 75 amendments had to be guillotined because the Minister was not prepared to tease out or amend the legislation in a fundamental way. It is no way to deal with such a fundamental matter.This echoes what has been said in recent days inside and outside the House. There is a perception that what is happening today is similar to what happened in 1999, and we know the dire results of that. Sections of the Bill were found to be unconstitutional, which has broader implications for a large body of legislation that has passed through the House. Much of that legislation will now need to be scrutinised to see whether orders and regulations made under it operate properly in the context of this constitutional decision.In the short space of time available since the Bill was introduced, the human rights organisations and those concerned with non-nationals and immigrants have been extremely active. I congratulate them on the number and quality of documents that have been prepared. There has been a tremendous response. The fine joint document from the Immigrant Council of Ireland, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, the Irish Refugee Council and the Migrant Rights Centre of Ireland states in its introduction:The Immigration Bill 2004 is a draconian piece of legislation lacking in basic safeguards and divorced from the practical operation of the immigration system. It contains discriminatory and retrospective provisions in violation of international law, and if passed would in our view be detrimental to developing an effective, managed immigration policy in Ireland.It goes on to state that the Bill is:— clearly inspired by the 1935 Aliens Act — a virtual re-enactment of the UK's 1914 Aliens Act which replaced the First World War Aliens (Restrictions) Act, 1911, a legal instrument drawn up by Britain in a time of emergency to prevent German spies infiltrating the state — the Bill creates unaccountable and non-transparent decision-making structures.The introduction also states:We believe that the Bill is so fundamentally flawed that it should be withdrawn. As a bare minimum, this piece of legislation should only be passed with a review clause which requires the Oireachtas to re-consider the legislationin three months and ultimately to replacethis "emergency" Bill with an effective, comprehensive Bill addressing Immigration and Residency rights.These quotes sum up the views of all the organisations that have made submissions to us. No doubt the Minister has received much of the documentation. These organisations include: the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, because labour and work permits are an important aspect of the Bill; Cairde, whose motto is "Challenges ethnic minority health inequalities"; the Kosovo Ireland Solidarity Group; Schizophrenia Ireland — one would not expect this group to protest about a Bill such as this, but it must, because of concerns about the aspects of disability and health; and the Irish Human Rights Commission. This is the statutory body, belatedly set up by the Oireachtas, which was envisaged under the Good Friday Agreement and whose Northern Ireland counterpart has long been in existence. It has only been up and running for the past few months with a premises and staff. However, it is a statutory body to monitor human rights in this country and which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is expected to refer to and consult.So far the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has shown a blatant disregard for the wishes of that organisation. He did the same during the passage of European Convention on Human Rights legislation when we sought to get a more robust incorporation of that convention in law before last summer. However, the Minister did not listen to the group. It was the same case with the immigration legislation that was put through the House before the summer recess.The Human Rights Commission has again issued a statement to the media on the matter. Its chairman, Dr. Maurice Manning, a distinguished former Member of the Seanad, stated, "The commission regrets that the Government and the relevant Minister chose not to refer the Bill to the commission in advance of its publication." This is hardly proper procedure and certainly not the way to get the legislation right. The Human Rights Commission also stated:We have not had the time to make detailed observations on the Bill as we would wish to do and which we are statutory empowered to do. It is our view that it is most undesirable that any legislative proposal with such significance for the promotion and protection of human rights should be processed so quickly and without the benefit of wider consultation.No good is served when the Minister claims he will consult with the Human Rights Commission because by tonight, there will be only two hours left to debate the Bill tomorrow. This does not give much time for the Minister to consult with them. The consultation needs to be done in advance with proper notice to ensure the Bill is properly proofed with regard to civil and human rights.This legislation has come under severe criticism for the lack of consultation and the timescale in which it is been put through the House. There has been criticism of the disdainful manner in which the Minister treated the Seanad and that no time limit has been put on this legislation. This legislation was to be rammed through the Dáil a week ago, yet the Minister is now introducing 20 more Government amendments. If none of these amendments could have been introduced from the Government side a week ago, one must ask what would have happened then.The Minister, in referring to section 4 on disability and prescribed illness, asked rhetorically what should be done with a violent psychopath attempting to gain entry into the State. The Minister came up with the solution that the individual be put back on the aeroplane. To put a violent individual back on the aeroplane without medical care or attention is a mind-boggling approach. Surely, the Minister would not do something of that nature but ensure the person received proper treatment. However, this is what the Minister intends to do. The individual's nature does not matter. If they fall into that category, such people go back on the aeroplane, irrespective of how they could affect other passengers and that they need urgent treatment.On looking again at section 10 of the Bill dealing with hotel registers, I noted it does not just deal with hotel registers. Section 10(5) applies to any premises whether furnished or unfurnished in which lodging or sleeping accommodation is provided for reward. I would like to see the Minister explain that to a bean an tí who does not have to be registered with Bord Fáilte to provide accommodation, unless she has more than four units of accommodation in a residence. Is the bean an tí or a landlord going to check hitchhikers from France to ensure they are not registered as non-nationals under the provisions of this section?Under the new tax rule introduced by the Minister for Finance, somebody can have a lodger in his or her own home to earn a tax-free amount. How will that be dealt with in this legislation? How will these provisions apply and how will the distinction be made between European Union nationals and so-called non-nationals? There is the derogation for European Union nationals in this Bill. Why bring in such messy legislation in this fashion that is all over the place as to what constitutes nationals in the European Union context? This issue has been so badly addressed even though we are members of the European Union. This section of the Bill will not be effective.During the sos, I was witness to the marriage of a young disabled lady. Marriages take place quickly now in registry offices. However, it made me reflect on section 4 of the original legislation and how many disabled people have additional difficulties imposed on them. There are many other difficulties that are part and parcel of their lives, as in the case of the young lady today who is also homeless. This legislation will impose further difficulties on individuals who are disabled. At least, the Minister has decided to amend section 4.To lose a High Court argument once might be regarded as a misfortune. To lose the same argument again, six years later, looks like carelessness. However, that is what happened to the Government two weeks ago when yet another provision of the Aliens Act 1935 was struck down. The 1935 Act was a copy of emergency legislation introduced in Britain just before the First World War. It has long since been repealed and replaced in the United Kingdom, but astonishingly its dark and draconian provisions were considered by successive Irish Governments to be a more than adequate substitute for an open and transparent Irish immigration law.Passed in Saorstát Éireann law, the Act predated the Constitution and the Irish Republic. Section 5(1) of the Act conferred power on the Minister to make Aliens Orders "in respect either of all aliens, aliens of a particular nationality or class, or any particular alien". This was to prohibit them from entering the State; prohibit them from leaving the State; impose restrictions and conditions in respect of entering or leaving the State; provide for their exclusion and/or deportation from the State; require them to reside or remain in particular places; prohibit them from residing, or remaining, in particular places; and require them to comply with provisions as to registration, change of abode, travel, employment, occupation and so on.The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, effectively was empowered by the Oireachtas simply to make it up as he went along and change the rules whenever he wished. All this was under a Constitution, adopted two years after the Act in 1937, that stipulates that the sole and exclusive power of making laws for the State is vested in the Oireachtas and that no otherauthority has power to make laws for theState.There is of course nothing unique about legislation conferring on a Minister a power to make orders. Secondary legislation is necessary to fill in matters of detail which are unsuitable for Acts of the Oireachtas. However, according to a 1980 Supreme Court judgment, the parent Act must contain clear declarations of policies and aims. The Oireachtas can then delegate to a Minister the setting up of machinery to carry out those policies and achieve those aims. In the absence of a statement of principles and policies in the parent Act, there is an unconstitutional delegation of the law-making power by the Oireachtas to a Minister.As soon as the 1980 judgment was delivered, alarm bells should have rung in the Department of Justice as the Aliens Act 1935 could not survive legal and constitutional challenge. It conferred a power to make orders but without reference to any governing criteria. This amounted to an unconstitutional delegation of the legislative power of the State. In 1999, in Laurentiu v. the Minister for Justice, the High Court struck down the part of section 5(1) that dealt with the deportation and exclusion of aliens. The inevitable happened but it was only a matter of time.The Government's response was to rush the Immigration Act 1999 through both Houses as an emergency measure. It recognised that if one part of section 5 conferring on the Minister a bare power to legislate was unconstitutional, then all the other parts of the section which did the same thing were equally vulnerable and, further, that all the orders made over the years under section 5 could be challenged.However, it seems that the Government had learned nothing from Laurentiu. Instead of introducing those orders and powers as substantive sections of a new Bill which could be debated and amended in the Houses, the Minister decided on a blanket solution. Section 2(1) of the 1999 Bill provided that every order made under section 5 of the Aliens Act should have statutory effect "as if it were an Act of the Oireachtas". Deputy Howlin, then our spokesperson on justice, said, "The section is at odds with the principles enunciated by Mr. Justice Geoghegan, which are that the Minister maynot make primary law by way of statutoryinstrument." That sums it up. He went on tosay:This is such an important issue that the will of the Oireachtas is required to be determined. The Minister should make clear his intentions and introduce as part of a statute the regulations he wishes to validate ... Where are the specifics the Minister purports to validate? Let us debate their merits and demerits.In its judgment in the case of Leontjava and Chang on 22 January 2004 the High Court held that nothing in the Constitution authorised the Oireachtas to decide that secondary legislation should be treated in the legal order of the State "as if it were an Act of the Oireachtas". The only provisions which might be treated as a law, as defined by the Constitution, were laws made by the Oireachtas. The explanatory memorandum states that the provisions of the Aliens Order allowing a condition as to duration of stay to be attached to a permission to stay in the State were ultra vires section 5 of the 1935 Act.The judgment confirms that there can be no legislative shortcuts in devising a legal framework to control immigration to this country. The reason this attempt failed in the 1999 Act, like its predecessor in 1935, was that it sought to bypass the normal parliamentary law-making process in favour of the Executive. The judgment of 22 January reasserts the primacy of the Oireachtas in the legislative process and it prohibits sleight of hand efforts to short-circuit that process and to ignore the constitutional mandate of Members of the OireachtasIn August 2002 the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform published a review of submissions on the public consultation on immigration policy, which he mentioned earlier. According to the review, proposed legislation would:— contain a general statement of principles and policies to be observed in operating and developing the Irish immigration system. This is in line with the requirement, identified by the courts in the Laurentiu case, that an Act which gives a power to make subsidiary legislation should indicate the principles and policies which the subsidiary legislation must observe. What principles and policies should be contained in the legislation?Those are the Minister's words. Today he told us he is working on this but 18 months later we are no closer to an answer. We do not know how long this temporary emergency legislation will be on the Statute Book. There is no sign of major immigration legislation.The Labour Party and the rest of the Opposition oppose the Minister's decision to force all Stages of this new Immigration Bill through the Dáil in one day. We accept that amending legislation is required as a result of the decision of the High Court to strike down section 2 of the 1999 Act as unconstitutional, but the manner in which the Minister is doing so is totally unsatisfactory.The Bill's contents are a restatement of what is in the Aliens Act with an attempt to proof it against constitutional attack, but it does not achieve that aim. The legislation is very unsatisfactory, as some sections do not seem to recognise the changes in our status as a country, the change from Saorstát Éireann to the Irish Republic, the fact that we have a Constitution in place and our status as equal members of the European Union. The Bill is cobbled together in an awkward attempt to address those changes but it does not succeed.The lesson to be learned from this legislation is that we need to get this right. This is not a doomsday situation. It has taken two weeks to get this far and the Minister will have to go back to the Seanad, so why can we not have three weeks? That would give various organisations the time for consultation that they sought. We are trying as best we can to deal with the legislation but ultimately we are unlikely to be left with anything other than a new Act which is also vulnerable to constitutional attack.Private Members' business dealt with the emigrant issue last week and we learned that there are approximately 1.2 million Irish people living abroad, some of them in dire conditions. Obviously they are treated as non-nationals in other parts of the world. We issued 47,000 work permits last year in Ireland and we are told that approximately 100,000 graduates will be required to come to Ireland in the next few years, yet at the same time this is the only kind of legislation we can produce to deal with the high numbers of non-nationals coming to Ireland. We should look at this issue in a more positive way and deal with it in a more humanitarian and democratic fashion. We should treat everyone who comes to Ireland as our neighbours and friends.

It is not an immigration Bill but an anti-immigration Bill. It should not have come before the House at all, and certainly not in the dictatorial and chaotic manner the Government has used to present it.Measaim gur d'aon ghnó go bhfuil an Rialtas ag déanamh deacair orainn ár ndualgas mar reachtóirí a chomhlíonadh. An dualgas atá orainn reachtaíocht a chíoradh agus cinnte a dhéanamh de go bhfuil na cosaintí cuí sa mBille. Inniu agus amárach ní bheidh muid ach ag tabhairt srachfhéachaint ar an mBille atáós ár chomhair, Bille atá impleachtaí móra náisiúnta ann agus atá impleachtaí ollmhór ó thaobh cearta daonra ann chomh maith.Níl san breis ama beag a tugadh dúinn inniu ach measaim fhéin cleasaíocht poiblíochta. Tríd is tríd is masla an sórt seo diefir, an sórt seo brú orainn agus na heagrais eile a bhí spéis acu san Bille seo. Is masla é don daonlathas.The findings of the High Court imply a need for temporary legislation to allow for responsible, managed migration pending the introduction of a comprehensive modern immigration law. The approach advocated by Sinn Féin is realistic, as the Government already plans to introduce an immigration and residency Bill at some pointthis year. However, we were also told this last year.Contrary to the Minister's assertion that no one complained about this outdated law before now, since becoming a Member of the House, I and others have complained about it and called for comprehensive immigration law reform. Some of the provisions before the House form part of what we sought to have changed and reformed. We need a new law that upholds our international obligations to both refugees and migrants, recognises the enormously positive economic and social potential of immigration, allows for family reunification and provides complementary protection for those genuinely in need but do not fit the strict refugee definition in the convention.We know what is needed. What was the Minister's response to the High Court decision? He hastily produced a bad and repressive law, using what I believe is a dictatorial process intended to silence dissent. He manipulated the situation by introducing new draconian measures such as the now notorious provision to exclude disabled people at section 4(3)(c), which has thankfully been changed, if only slightly, and the provision in section 9(4) which compels citizens to report any non-nationals living with them to the Garda, even if they are related. The penalty for non-compliance with this requirement is a fine or imprisonment. The Minister has opportunistically used the High Court decision to escalate his ongoing campaign against immigration. Operation Hyphen, when he had 50 legally resident non-nationals rounded up and arbitrarily arrested, symbolises the Minister's ongoing campaign.Without doubt the Bill is fundamentally flawed. The Immigrant Council of Ireland, the Irish Refugee Council, the Migrant Rights Centre and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties released a joint statement saying that the Bill is open to abuse and likely to be used in an arbitrary and discriminatory way. They concluded that the Bill contains unconstitutional provisions, as well as provisions contrary to international human rights law and domestic anti-discrimination laws. They believe that a number of provisions are also in violation of the European Convention on Human Rights. The National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism has similar concerns, and has called on the Government to equality-proof all immigration and residency legislation to ensure that it is non-discriminatory, and to specifically include the principle of non-discrimination in this Bill's provisions.Cáirde is concerned that the Bill is inconsistent with best practice in fighting global infectious disease and protecting public health. Moreover, it is in breach of the UN Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenants on Civil and Political and Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, all of which outlaw discrimination on the grounds of health.I share these concerns and add that the Bill also promotes a racist notion of citizenship and what it means to be Irish by creating a formal category of second-class citizen; the oxymoronic "non-nationals born in Ireland" referred to in sections 9(5)(b) and 12(4)(b). I am interested to know if this phrase is contrary to the definition of citizenship contained in the Constitution as altered by the Good Friday Agreement. I see the Minister nodding. I would love to see that tested in court.Amnesty International argues that, since the 1946 Aliens Order was made before the adoption of a series of human rights instruments, its compliance with human rights standards cannot be taken for granted and that its importation into law requires rigorous parliamentary scrutiny which has not been allowed by the Government on this occasion.The Human Rights Commission, which was not consulted, also outlined a number of concerns about provisions it found disturbing in their implications for human rights in the State. Most importantly, the commission recommended that the Bill be withdrawn to allow for proper consultation — the Minister can still do this — proper parliamentary scrutiny and detailed consideration of the human rights issues affecting this area of law. It is not acceptable that, despite the human rights implications of the Bill, the Minister did not consult the Human Rights Commission. In failing to do so and in his general approach to the Bill and immigration law and policy, the Minister acts contrary to the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement under which the Government promised to strengthen human rights protections in this jurisdiction.There is no question but that the High Court judgment demands a response and we accept that, but it is misleading for the Minister to insist that he had no choice but to introduce the Bill in this form. This is not true. He had a choice and could have taken the more commendable road. He did not and has presented this legislation to us with little time provided to debate it.In this Bill, as in much of the other legislation he has produced, the Minister has shown he is nothing more than a foot soldier for fortress Europe. He is unfit to guide the development process of the EU common migration and asylum policy which comes within his remit during the Presidency period. He is also unfit to frame Irish immigration and asylum policy. He increasingly proves that all the legal education and experience in the world cannot compensate for a basic failure to comprehend what justice really means.The State does not need more flawed immigration legislation. It needs a positive, compassionate, anti-racist immigration law and policy, as befits a nation scarred by emigration, with an extensive diaspora, and whose people have reaped such significant benefit from the open immigration policies of other countries. It is high time to drop the disgusting hypocrisy that drives anti-immigration law in this State. Thousands of families in this country have relatives who are illegal immigrants in other countries. We do not stigmatise them as criminals nor call for their immediate arrest and deportation back to Ireland. The Minister for Foreign Affairs called for sympathetic treatment for them and the regularisation of their status.Sinn Féin submitted more than 40 amendments to the Bill, which was an exercise in damage limitation. Ultimately, the Bill should have been withdrawn. Legislation that properly deals with the matter should be drafted and presented to the House in the near future.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	481	Before I go into the detail of the legislation, it is important that we take a serious look at the issue of immigrants. I call for calmness, common sense and clarity in our discussion on this important topic.Let us first look at ourselves as an emigrant nation. We should not shy away from our history. Let us also remember the many Irish people who had to emigrate in the past because of oppression, injustice and lack of economic rights. Such details should be uppermost in our minds as we debate the legislation before us.Let us acknowledge that hundreds of thousands of Irish people were forced, through economic and cultural circumstances, to emigrate to Britain to earn a living from manual work, particularly in the 1950s and 1960s. We must also be conscious that this group is believed to have brought home approximately €3.5 billion between 1939 and 1969. This played a crucial role in sustaining families and communities in a time of dire poverty. Members will recall the "American parcel". We are shocked at the appalling conditions in which many of these now elderly Irish citizens in Britain are forced to live. We have a duty to assist them and the Government has a duty to act. We must face up to these issues when we are dealing with new immigrants to Ireland.On 22 January 2004, the High Court found that there was no basis in the Aliens Act 1935 for the provision of the Aliens Order 1946, relating to the addition of a condition as to the duration of stay or permission to enter the State. The court found that another aspect of permission in the Aliens Order, relating to the power of an immigration officer or garda to ask non-nationals to produce identity documents, was invalid. It also found that the protection section 2 of the Immigration Act 1999 purported to give to the Aliens Order was itself unconstitutional.In section 4(3), the Bill purports to govern the control of entry into the State, the duration and conditions of stay and obligations for non-nationals. However, it is seriously deficient in several important areas that would be found in immigration and residency legislation elsewhere. For example, the Bill fails to set out any provision governing family reunification for non-nationals. In addition, it does not set out provisions for persons in need of protection but who fall outside the refugee convention, procedures for non-nationals married to Irish citizens or long-term residents, international students, and bridging periods for non-nationals to re-establish themselves if they lose work permits, etc. Under section 4(5), Irish citizens will, for the first time, be criminalised for failing to comply with immigration provisions.All immigration legislation should be based on respect for human rights and people, and founded on compassion and understanding. While I know it is not popular to say this, it is essential that all people entering this country are treated with equality, fairness and justice. This is not currently happening. Knee-jerk reactions and rushed legislation is not the way forward.Racism is a thorny subject that we must face up to. Like sectarianism, racism has no place in any democratic society. I commend the many new workers that have come to this State. They are making a massive contribution to our economy and bring a new dimension to Irish life. Let us enjoy and celebrate difference. Let us not treat immigrants with suspicion, instead, let them get on with their lives and their work. After all, they need us and we need them. Kofi Annan, Secretary General of the UN has raised these points in recent weeks.We must also support anti-racist workplaces. Ireland now has a multicultural society and our workplaces reflect this diversity. Migrant workers, now a permanent feature of the Irish workplace, bring economic, social and cultural benefits and our workplaces must adapt to reflect this diversity. Law now prohibits discrimination on the grounds of race or membership of the Traveller community. Anti-racist workplaces will reward us all. Work practice can easily take account of different needs of customers and employees, whatever their ethnic identity. People from different backgrounds may perceive and do things differently. This can be seen in diet, religion, dress, customs and practices.While I welcome the Minister's climbdown on discriminating against people with disabilities, we need to go further. I welcome the comments made by the Human Rights Commission. I totally oppose this Bill.

The Minister has highlighted the sense of urgency that has brought this Bill before the House. Many countries have tightened immigration legislation in recent decades as they long ago experienced the problems we are now facing. Nobody was interested in coming to Ireland prior to the Celtic tiger. The Aliens Act, with some minor amendments, is now almost 70 years old. This Bill has Orwellian tones to it, especially in that it expects citizens to report on non-nationals in this State.The judgment of the High Court on 22 January has left a vacuum in our legislation. According to the Minister, there are, in effect, no immigration controls in this jurisdiction. This is unacceptable and we must ensure the Houses pass adequate legislation in this area. We have the right to control who comes to this country and we also have the right to deport people from here. The other issue is our treatment of non-nationals once we give them permission to live here. They should not be discriminated against once they have been allowed to stay in the country.In some respects, the Government is not as bad as it may seem. For example, from 1 May, all citizens from the accession states will be given rights equal to those enjoyed by other EU citizens who reside here. This is not being extended by many other member states that are considered to have better immigration policies than Ireland.Large numbers of asylum seekers and refugees came to the south-east in recent years. Prior to the arrival of these people, the incidence of hepatitis B was pretty rare and we now have more than 300 cases. I do not want to use this to scaremonger against refugees; rather I want to show how we can do positive things. We have successfully treated many of the asylum seekers suffering from hepatitis B. Furthermore, we have instigated a programme where children born to asylum seekers have been born free of hepatitis. We have broken a cycle going back hundreds of generations where those born with hepatitis B pass it to their children and then die young.Positive things can be done if we take a positive attitude in how we look at immigration. While we must control the entry of people into this State, we must be careful not to introduce bad or harsh legislation. While this Bill will probably be passed, it should be passed with the proviso that this should be revisited in a couple of months to highlight the concerns that have been aired today.We need a broader debate, not only on immigration legislation, but also on how a multicultural society is developing in Ireland. There has been much recent discussion about how our population is rapidly ageing. By 2030, this State will need more than 1 million immigrants to maintain economic productivity and look after our ageing population. It will be difficult to find 1 million people that comply with this legislation. We need to balance this legislation and must revisit it to take account of how our society is going to change in the future. I hope the Minister intends to look at this issue again.I have seen asylum seekers and refugees benefit from coming to this country. We could promote the positives. It is important to keep a positive frame of mind rather than going backwards to an Orwellian and harsh regime where we try to keep these people out.

It reads:Give me your tired, your poor,Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,The wretched refuse of your teeming shore,Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me,I lift my lamp beside the golden door!If the Minister were to commission a plaque for the front of his Department or his front door I wonder what inscription would we find? Would the words at the base of the Statue of Liberty be parallel to the words the Minister might commission?I am the first to admit there is a loophole in the legislation that requires to be fixed but we can do far better than this Bill. We are in effect using a sledgehammer to crack a rather small nut. Where is the Government's immigration policy? It is not enough to work out who to keep out. The Government should be concentrating from a humanist, social, environmental and economic perspective on who we should be attracting to the country. We only hear about those who will be kept out.The Bill is a shoddy and flawed proposal. It allows immigration officers to discriminate against non-nationals who suffer from a prescribed disease or disability. This is a slap in the face to disability groups awaiting the publication of the disability Bill. It is also couched in a language that harkens back to Victorian times. It belongs to the type of legislation introduced at the time of the Famine and the poor house. We must face up to what is required in the 21st century. There are broad and sweeping clauses that could be used against many. If enacted, the legislation cold be used against persons in similar circumstances to Nelson Mandela. It could also be used against Travellers and gay rights advocates and almost any group that suffers discrimination in countries other than Ireland. I have no doubt that if the Minister put his mind to it, he could probably use any of the Ten Commandments as the basis for keeping somebody out of Ireland, for example, for not keeping the Sabbath day sacred, or committing adultery.The non-governmental organisations have engaged in concerted lobbying of the Minister. I am grateful for the lobbying I have received from the civil liberties groups, migrant groups, Amnesty International, Cáirde and Schizophrenia Ireland. A multitude of bodies have grave and deep concerns about the Bill. We believe it should be withdrawn in its present form and that the Minister should, after a lapse of 90 days, introduce a carefully worked out proposal. It seems that the Bill was cobbled together from outdated and archaic legislation and orders that were suited to the 19th century.I note the Minister will introduce amendments. The blanket ban against those suffering from mental illness or disability needs to be withdrawn. I am concerned that the reference to non-nationals born in Ireland may be a means for the Minster to pave the way for removing the right to citizenship for those born in Ireland. I am also concerned by the reference to those convicted of an offence in another country. The Minister should look again at the legislation to ensure it is disability proofed. The nine grounds for discrimination used by the Equality Authority are not included. Will the Minister ensure that he is not insulting the minority groups and NGOs?Will the Minister also ensure that immigration officers shall receive anti-racism training? No doubt many have done so but I would like him to ensure that anyone dealing with a foreign national arriving in Ireland should have received such training. It is imperative that we do not repeat the mistakes of the past, many of which were made through ignorance rather than trying to erect barriers. We need a quantum jump in the amount of knowledge that is made available.In the limited time available, members of my party have tabled varied and detailed amendments, as have the other parties. The Minister has put on record that he will consider them. To end on a positive note, will the Minister think again about the grave concerns about the Bill expressed by Opposition parties, civil liberties and human rights groups?

#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	486	Before discussing the detailed provisions of the Bill I will discuss the implications of the Leontjava and Chang decision, made on 22 January. The implications of this High Court decision are wide ranging and potentially serious in terms of the legislation which has been passed by the House. In brief, the decision was very clear that the Aliens Order 1946 was ultra vires, but the High Court also decided that legislation by reference to text or by statutory instrument is no longer constitutional, which has major implications for the way we do business in the House. Many Bills that come before us refer to text, international treaties or schedules in other Acts and so forth.It is very important that we, as the Legislature, ascertain where we stand. It is vital that whatever about the substantive issue in the case, this issue alone needs to be appealed to a full sitting of the Supreme Court to get definition and certainty as to how we conduct our business. For that reason I ask the Minister to appeal this decision. The implications have to be looked at. Perhaps the Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, the Law Reform Commission or the All-Party Committee on the Constitution may also consider the constitutional implications. There is no doubt that an appeal will take a long time, detailed research will have to be carried out on the implications and detailed submissions will have to be made to a full sitting of the Supreme Court. All the judges will need to make detailed judgments on this critical issue for our country.The question with which we are face is what to do in the meantime. Many people would implore us to do nothing and sit on our hands until we see what happens. The Government and the Dáil have to deal with the reality as it is presented, so let us examine that for a moment. The reality is that we now have very little legislative justification to refuse entry to anybody coming into this country, no matter how suspicious or unwelcome their motives may be, regardless of their past criminal record, and no matter what their intentions might be regarding terrorism. Without wanting to overstate the position, if Osama bin Laden presented himself at Dún Laoghaire or Rosslare harbours tomorrow, we would have very little legislative justification to refuse him entry.

However, people both inside and outside this House are saying that we should do nothing until we have a big national debate. This is an urgent and pressing issue with which the House and the Government have to deal. The suggestion that we should take a few months to reflect on our immigration policy is unsustainable and unreasonable. The vast majority of the Irish people would not support such a position.There is no doubt that legislation is required urgently, so our discussions should be based simply on the nature and content of the Bill. In that regard, we need to look at the role and duty of the State to its own citizens, as well as its role and duty to non-EEA nationals entering this country. In the first instance we must examine the State's responsibility to its own citizens, which is paramount. The first duty of any sovereign country is to protect its citizens. Inherent in that duty is an obligation to know what non-citizens are in the country at any given time. That is both self-evident and reasonable. It is a fundamental expression of our democratic sovereignty that we should be able decide who comes into the country. That is why, when we signed up to various EU treaties in the past, the big debate was that we might be weakening our sovereignty by ceding our right and discretion to decide who will be allowed to enter the country. The State's rights and duty in this regard are recognised in international law and have been recognised by the Supreme Court in many decisions, including the Osheku case. In fact, there are reasonable grounds for arguing that legislation is not needed in this respect and that the Government, acting in an executive capacity, is entitled to regulate who enters and leaves the country. It is only right and proper, however, to have the necessary legislation in place. To fail to enact the Bill before us would be a total abdication of the House's responsibility.We should examine our duties to non-nationals living here. I agree with the comments that have been made during the debate to the effect that our basic duty is to protect the fundamental human rights of non-nationals. We should be non-discriminatory in dealing with such people coming into the country. One of the concrete ways in which the Bill achieves that is through the use of a modern nomenclature. The word "alien" is arcane and conjures up images of celestial intervention, depending on what way the missions to Mars may go. We should get rid of such terms. It is reasonable for people coming into this country, however, to expect systems to deal with their arrival and departure, as well as requiring them to register, produce identification and prove that they have permission to be here.It is unreasonable for people to argue that the country should not have a tight and highly regulated regime in this regard. Lest the contrary message emanates from this House, we must make it clear that the vast majority of non-nationals are here with our permission. They are living here legally and are making a welcome contribution. We have to develop an evolving policy, to which Deputy Cuffe referred, for a multicultural society. In that regard, I welcome the Minister's earlier comment that we can expect further legislation in this area. Failing to act now, however, would be to abdicate our responsibility as legislators.To accept what the Opposition in the House, and the Bill's opponents outside it, have been saying, which is to do nothing——

I recall that during the last general election campaign the immigration issue did not come to the fore, for the most part. That was due to an agreement or understanding between politicians on all sides, and was despite the fact that the issue was coming up on the doorsteps. It is to the credit of the body politic that the issue was not allowed to enter the electoral debate then and the same attitude appears to be prevailing in this debate.It is said that a week is a long time in politics. We saw what happened in the Seanad last Friday when there was a great deal of emotion and complaints were made about the way in which the Government was proposing to introduce the legislation.

I now understand better what is going on and why we have to do this. It is not unusual for emergency legislation to come before the House. For example, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform introduced an amendment to the Domestic Violence Act in short order because of a High Court judgment.Looking to the future, specific Standing Orders are required to deal with the introduction of emergency legislation in order to obviate the problems that occurred last week in the Seanad. Such measures could create a short-notice system of introducing legislation, whether they are taken with the consent of the President, the Council of State or by some other formula.Deputy Peter Power has outlined clearly and articulately why the Bill is necessary, so there is no point in me reiterating those points. However, I do have some general comments to make about the contents of the Bill. It is not an excuse to say that this legislation is simply a transposition of something that existed before now and that, therefore, we should not debate its contents and can ignore what it means. Just because it existed beforehand, does not make it right.I refer first to some of the wording in the Bill. Section 3 states that a medical inspector or immigration officer can reasonably come to the conclusion that somebody is a non-national. In the Seanad, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, argued ably that this is not a form of racial profiling and that it is not possible for racial profiling to occur as a result of this.I hope that in future legislation some effort will be made to create more appropriate language which will prevent even the possibility of racial profiling. We must remember that the European Union has millions of people with Caribbean origin who are British citizens, with north African origin who are French citizens and with Turkish origin who are German citizens. This Bill and the aliens order which came before it allow the detention and examination of such people on the basis of a reasonable view held by an immigration officer or a medical inspector. What qualifications does a medical inspector have to make such a reasonable inquiry. The words "detain" and "examine" are unnecessary in the long term. All these officers should be empowered to do is require the production of a passport or equivalent document from a person reasonably suspected of being a non-national at a point of entry. It is not beyond the powers of the draftsmen to come up with some wording which would settle some of the fears expressed over the past few days with regard to the Bill.With regard to the use of the term "disability", I was initially concerned about the issues raised in the Seanad. However, I am satisfied that the First Schedule set out by the Minister deals with that question fairly well. It is sometimes invidious to make lists in legislation because there is always a possibility something will be left out. Once a list is made that danger exists. I do not know if it is possible to address that situation more comprehensively in the Bill being prepared for the long term. Most Members are honest enough to accept that this legislation was, in a way, prepared to try to close a loophole.I accept we are dealing with the transposition of previous legislation with regard to the conviction issue. During my recent honeymoon I was able to take time to read the work of Paul Theroux, an old man in his late 50s — no deliberate offence to the Minister or anybody here in their 50s — who decided to travel from the north to the south of Africa. He wrote about all the countries he visited, including Uganda, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Mozambique etc. In almost every country visited he met many people who had been in jail for political offences of one sort or other. Having read the relevant part of the aliens order, it strikes me that far too many people would be unjustly examined, detained and prevented entry on the basis of convictions by a system of justice which bears no relation to ours or that of the European Union. While I accept that this is emergency stop-gap legislation, I hope this area will be properly addressed in due course and that we acknowledge that people entering the State should not be prevented from doing so on the basis of convictions in countries that do not have the same rigorous human rights record as Ireland.The age of the Aliens Act 1935 is no bar to it being sound law. The Constitution, which dates back to 1937, is probably one of the oldest constitutions in western Europe and it has stood the test of time. There is no reason something which originated in the 1930s should not be equally valid today.While I accept that we are dealing with emergency legislation and that it is intended to prepare proper legislation in due course, an appeal process would be appropriate. The short time allowed for a judicial review is unacceptable. It would be wrong not to provide an adequate remedy to anybody dissatisfied with the manner in which they have been refused entry or detained and examined. I hope these problems will be considered when the promised legislation is brought forward.I do not wish to detain the House further. The manner in which this legislation was introduced is unfortunate but necessary. I commend the Department on bringing it forward so quickly and with so few problems in it. I commend the Bill to the House.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	499	My experience is that rushed legislation is bad legislation. There is something fundamentally undemocratic about putting through legislation without adequate consultation, consideration and debate. I am not in favour of old style filibusters but parliamentary experience over the centuries shows that proper debate leads to proper legislation.One of the downsides of rushed legislation is that it can often lead to litigation. In a way, this is what happened here. This legislation arises directly from a decision based on the Immigration Act 1999. The Minister in his desire to get new legislation on the Statute Book as quickly as possible seems to ignore the fact that legislation has to pass a further step, beyond the Dáil and the Seanad, in the Oireachtas process. It must pass the eye of the President. The Minister seems to take for granted that the President will not decide that a referendum under Article 26 of the Constitution might be necessary.A further aspect of the present situation is a cause of concern. Another downside of the rushed approach is that it allows little or no time for public debate. The sense is conveyed to the public that the people need to be protected by rushed, emergency legislation. From what do they need protection? If we look at the name given to earlier legislation, the Aliens Act, we could ask if the Minister was protecting the people from aliens descending from UFOs or from Mars — now it is the other way around and man is heading for Mars. To be serious, the sense of the need to protect the people conveys a sense of unease and distrust and may contribute to the development of a racist approach.Do we learn at all from the past? In a way we are debating another sticking plaster approach. The 1999 Laurentiu decision was followed by the Immigration Act 1999 which had a marvellous subsection stating that every order made before the passing of the Act, under section 5 of the Aliens Act 1935, would have statutory effect as if it were an Act of the Oireachtas. How lazy can one be with regard to putting through legislation? How much can one take for granted that Parliament will rubber stamp everything that has happened under earlier legislation as if it has gone through the Oireachtas? That was shot down by Ms Justice Finlay Geoghegan. I say "hurrah for her". She was absolutely right.Ms Justice Finlay Geoghegan said that the relevant subsection of the 1999 Act was an unconstitutional legislative method of giving the effect of primary statutory authority to secondary legislation and, thus, did not operate to save the provisions concerned in the orders. That was great work. According to some comments, that particular provision passed through the legislative net. I ask what net that is. There is a need for parliamentarians to ensure that we put decent legislation on the Statute Book which will not have to be tested in court again. A couple of hours debate in the Seanad and a very short debate here does not constitute a proper legislative net. We must ask if the Government has learned any lessons or is it hoping it will be a case of being third time lucky, hitting the jackpot and being spared further legislative challenge. I doubt it very much.I saw the legislation for the first time last night and I cannot say I am an expert. I must take on board the concerns expressed by people such as the members of the Human Rights Commission. They are very upset because there was a failure to provide proper notice or involve them in proper consultation. I remind the Minister that when we spent a great deal of time in the legislative trenches examining the European Convention on Human Rights Bill, we examined it in detail. We spent weeks looking at every provision. Ultimately, the Minister accepted an amendment which made it clear that the Human Rights Commission had to be given notice of proceedings under the Act. I was very glad he did so. In that spirit, it is wrong that the Human Rights Commission was not given notice and was not involved in consultation on this legislation.I acknowledge that time was short, but consultation would have been possible.On the question of what is to be done, there is a case for legislation. I would like to see as much consultation as possible. The best way to proceed would have involved a minimalist approach, which is not what the Minister has adopted.

The approach should be minimalist and accompanied by a time limit. The Minister has indicated that he will introduce broad legislative provisions in this area, which is necessary. We are operating to a certain extent in a vacuum. Legislation should arise from Government policy, which begs the question of what that is. I do not know what Government policy is in this instance. If the policy is one of closing the door, that is one thing, though I do not believe that is the case. It seems to be an ad hoc policy which the Government is making up as it goes along.I will not tell the Government what its policy should be in the few minutes left to me. However, I read the speech on emigration and emigrants which the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, made last week. He spoke about the 1.2 million Irish citizens who are living abroad. There is a much larger number of persons of Irish decent. On St. Patrick's Day, that number is supposed to run to about 50 million. That is the background against which we must consider any approach we adopt. We must look at the dramatic changes which have taken place and accept that the pendulum has swung completely in the opposite direction. We must condition public opinion to realise that immigration has enormous benefits. We need immigration from an economic perspective.We must re-examine our work permit system and establish whether we are dealing with the issue properly. We must ask if our system amounts to bonded labour in which people are tied to employers. There is a provision in the Bill before us which I question in that context. Someone coming here must produce a work permit but this document is issued to the employer rather than the employee. The employee will not have possession of it when he or she arrives here. The one-year duration of the permit is very wrong and promotes a great sense of insecurity. I am not sure we would have been very happy if our people who obtained American green cards were subject to the notion that they could be sent back after 12 months.In an asylum and refugee system people want fairness, justice, due process and efficiency. I acknowledge the enormous pressures which were put on the Department. The flood was not expected and the Department was not ready and able to cope. Now, however, people want to know that people who come here genuinely or otherwise have their cases dealt with fairly, properly and, above all, quickly. There is a question in the context of work permits and our international obligations of whether we should consider a voluntary quota or figure per year as has been done in other countries. Are we wealthy enough to consider that?I am concerned that there is a lack of safeguards in the Bill. Can an amendment be introduced to counteract that? There seems to be no provision for an appeals mechanism, which begs the question of whether the legislation can stand up under the fundamental rights provisions of our Constitution or the European Convention on Human Rights? The section which reduces the residency time limit from three months to one is a new provision. That is a radical and serious change. I raise the issue on the basis that the Minister put forward the Bill as a mere restatement of current law. Will the Department be able to deal with the change. I came across a case recently of an American who had a three-month residency permit towards the end of which he decided to stay longer. He wrote to the Department and subsequently phoned to find out how long it would take to grant his application. He was told it would take six months. What will we do if the residency time is reduced to one month? I suggest the Minister considers the practical effects of the provision in his own Department. It may give rise to chaos.Under section 4, there is the creation of an offence in the case of a person coming into the country who fails to report to an immigration officer. This is a serious offence which involves an enormous fine, which the person probably will not have, or a jail sentence of up to 12 months. What happens if the immigration desk at an airport is unmanned as is often the case? An absolute penalty is created and there is no question of mens rea. If a person fails to report, he or she is guilty. What happens if there is no one to report to? These are just some of the problems which suggest themselves on a cursory inspection of the Bill. I mentioned work permits. A person to whom the permit is not issued is expected to bring it to the immigration desk. If it is issued to the employer, how can the person coming in have it with him or her? It does not make sense.A rather unusual provision is made regarding powers of arrest. Under the Bill, a person can be arrested without a warrant on suspicion. However, if a garda wishes to seize property, he or she must obtain a search warrant from the District Court. That merely indicates the contradiction between the rights of someone with property and individual freedoms.I am not fully sure what the Minister has in mind with this obligation on people to report on any non-nationals who are staying with them. I have not had the opportunity to tease this out fully, but if a non-national friend of one of my daughters came to stay the night or weekend, would I be obligated to demand that she produce her papers? That is apparently what is in the legislation, and that needs to be teased out much more.There is some understanding of the Minister's situation arising from the decision. Several options were open to him. There is an acceptance of the need for legislation. What should not happen is the reproduction of an Act based on regulations from a different era, merely changing the name. That was not the right approach. I accept the need to put legislation in place within a reasonable time. It should be minimalist, not making those changes, some of which I have described. It should be as a result of consultation with the interested parties and mediated, as far as possible, by the public. It is hugely important that it is part of a process that will lead to a Green Paper or White Paper on immigration generally and an informed debate so that before the end of this year full and comprehensive legislation covering the entire area can be put in place. That is the approach that I recommend. I am concerned about the approach being adopted by the Minister, while at the same time not shutting the door entirely to legislation. I accept the Minister's dilemma, but he has taken the wrong option in this case.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	502	The Immigration Bill 2004 is an emergency response to a situation that has arisen out of an unexpected High Court judgment which left the legal system without proper immigration controls. The responsibility of Government is to ensure that Ireland can continue to have immigration controls to protect the interests of society and the individuals, whether Irish or non-national, who make up that society. This legislation is crucial to the protection of the State and its people. Every sovereign state in the world exercises on behalf of its people the right and obligation to control who enters its land. It is the responsibility of the Government to do everything necessary to preserve and restore proper immigration controls. We will not apologise for doing so. Some in this House will try to distort the facts and insinuate that the Bill is about repressing or inhibiting people's rights to enter this country, but that is not so. It is about protecting Irish society, which includes, of course, many non-Irish nationals who are genuinely in need of Irish refuge. In that instance, I commend the Bill to the House and congratulate the Minister on introducing the Bill.

#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	506	The past ten years have witnessed more changes in Irish society than the previous 50. For over 150 years, Ireland endured the haemorrhage of its population to all parts of the world to seek a new beginning. Now, however, almost 20,000 more people make their home in Ireland each year than emigrate from the country. A recent report prepared for the United Nations states that Europe will need 159 million immigrants from outside the continent within the next 25 years. That will be necessary if it is to maintain its present equilibrium between the numbers of those at work and retired. The United Nations has estimated that, without such immigration, the population of the European Union will fall by 30 million over the next 25 years because the birth rates are so low. By 2050, almost half the entire population of Europe will be above the retirement age. That is unsuitable.Fine Gael believes that Ireland's asylum policy is in turmoil and the procedures are inadequate. In many cases, applicants for asylum are left waiting for two years before a decision is made on their applications. In 1998, only 77 of the 4,626 applicants were granted asylum. Of the 5,500 applications made in 1999, only seven had been granted by November of that year. The one-stop asylum application centre at Lower Mount Street is totally inadequate when it comes to coping with the numbers applying. A temporary scheme of work permits announced in July 1999 is too complex and unworkable. Only 53 permits of an eligible 2,000 had been granted by November 1999. The scheme requires urgent alteration. Many applicants applying for asylum are economic immigrants who are forced to apply because of Ireland's failure to devise a national immigration policy.Fine Gael believes that a national immigration policy is necessary to fulfil our moral responsibility and legal obligations under international law, meet the estimated labour shortfall of 160,000 over the next seven years and realise our vision of a more open, inclusive and culturally diverse Ireland in the next century. The national immigration policy must be accompanied by an integration policy. All immigrants to Ireland, whether they intend to become citizens, are granted residency on humanitarian grounds or come as economic immigrants, should integrate as fully as possible into the Irish way of life and be actively encouraged and assisted to become part of the Irish nation.The Government must develop a comprehensive range of education programmes suitable for immigrants of all ages. The Department of Education and Science should draw up a special curriculum for this purpose and certification should be provided for those who complete this. The preparation of this curriculum should require a more formal articulation than has hitherto been necessary of the core values and attributes upon which Irish society is based and it should be debated by the Oireachtas. The Department of Education and Science must also formulate modules for primary and post-primary schools to assist young Irish people to appreciate and understand the cultural diversity of non-nationals residing here.Fine Gael believes that an active immigration policy cannot be implemented unless the Government tackles the growing chronic housing crisis. Fine Gael, therefore, urges the Government to adopt the policy proposal outlined in Affordable Housing for All. Fine Gael also believes the State has an obligation to ensure that communities with a high level of immigrant population are adequately supported by the State.Fine Gael also proposes a twin system to deal population inflow. Category one, refugee-asylum services, would operate under the aegis of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and would process applications from asylum seekers in accordance with the Geneva Convention on Refugees 1951, the Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees 1967, the Refugee Act 1996, the Dublin Convention 1996 and the Immigration Act 1999.Fine Gael proposes the establishment two additional one-stop-shop application centres at Rosslare and Shannon and the provision of accommodation at different locations throughout the country for applicants. It is a pity the rent allowance is being removed and the Minister proposes to accommodate refugees in centres. It is unfair in terms of their privacy and integration into the community. The rent allowance enabled them to have their own home subsidised by the State, but that will be removed and all asylum seekers will be accommodated in centres.Five centres were developed by the Government at a cost of approximately €19 million, including Broc House which has cost the State in excess of €11 million in the past three years. It believed it could get a ministerial derogation for change of use but that did not happen.

It is regrettable that Broc House, a centre which cost the State in excess of €11 million in taxpayers' money, has been lying idle for the best part of three years. It is costing €500,000 to maintain security at Broc House which is in the centre of Dublin and not far from the RTE studios. There is also a centre in Rosslare and Lynch's Hotel. The Devereaux Hotel was sold at a considerable loss. Five centres, which were bought by the Government at a cost of €19 million for the accommodation of asylum seekers, are now vacant or have been sold at a loss. I did not know Broc House was in the Minister's constituency.

#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	510	I call on the Minister to state how he can stand over expenditure of €12 million of taxpayers' money which is rising daily. Broc House, which is in his constituency and was bought to accommodate asylum seekers, is lying idle. The Minister thought he could use ministerial power to get planning permission, but there were local objections. That property is costing money at a time when people are sleeping rough in Dublin. People are sleeping in cardboard boxes in this city, yet there is accommodation which, if not suitable to accommodate asylum seekers, could be used to accommodate people who are sleeping rough. It is regrettable that the Minister has allowed this to happen and that people coming into this country are being treated like third-class citizens.Fine Gael proposes that asylum seekers who are eligible for work permits should be specifically identified, education and skills audits should be undertaken and permission stamped on applicants' identification cards so that they can approach employees who would, therefore, not need to research eligibility.I know from the Committee of Public Accounts of the level of dissatisfaction about the management of property acquired, that thereis now a move from direct provision of accommodation to indirect provision and that the support of the private sector is being sought to accommodate asylum seekers in large centres which would incorporate clinics and educational facilities. It was stated in correspondence that the reason for having all the services within the one centre was to ensure there was no chaos or bad management in respect of local post offices and services. It was a clear inference that asylum seekers were causing anarchy in the services. It is outrageous when we hear the Minister talk about accommodating asylum seekers that he has stood over the expenditure of €19 million of taxpayers' money on property which has not been used or approved or has been sold at a loss. The Minister is giving an open invitation to the private sector to secure change of use in respect of accommodation before he signs a tenancy on the provision of accommodation for asylum seekers. That is outrageous.Category two, the immigration service, proposes that membership of the immigration service should be drawn from the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Foreign Affairs, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Education and Science, Health and Children, and Social, Community and Family Affairs, IBEC, ISME and the ICTU and a representative of non-governmental organisations. The functions of the service should be to develop and implement a cohesive immigration policy based on Ireland's capacity to absorb an annual predetermined number of non-EU nationals to meet the labour and skills needs of the economy; to consider applications for work visas from non-EU nationals provided such applications are made from outside the State; to process applications in accordance with the principles set down in the European Convention on the Legal Status of Migrant Workers and the UN Convention on the Protection of All Migrant Workers and their Families; to recruit staff, provide information and develop integration and support services; to provide information to agencies, employers, schools, NGOs, voluntary organisations and communities on the origins, cultures and needs of the immigrant population; and to provide advance information to would-be immigrants on the criteria for admission, thereby maximising the number of applicants likely to be successful while minimising the number likely to be unsuccessful. That is not done. We have an ad hoc policy on immigrants and on granting visas. It is very badly managed.The Minister is bringing in draconian legislation in light of the High Court case last week. The provision whereby information could be sought from individuals was thrown out by the High Court and it is has given the Minister an opportunity to bring in even further restrictions. It is regrettable that the Minister has sought to bring in far-reaching changes instead of a minor adjustment. People left this country to live throughout the world and it is a poor "thank you" to the Irish diaspora in America and the UK who have been catered for with green cards, work visas and so on.The immigration service should also advise on the training, language and other needs of immigrants and provide applicants with information on work, conditions of work, housing, rights of family members to join them, education, social welfare, health services, taxation, and access to courts and the relevant authorities. That is not being done.People who come to this country feel they are fourth rate citizens and could be turfed out overnight. I learned of the circumstances of a case of a person from Tubbercurry who was deported. When she came to Dublin, the Minister sent a taxi from Dublin to Tubbercurry to pick up her baggage and she was put on an aeroplane the following morning. Is that what the Minister who speaks of equality in services, a friendly nation, hospitality and so forth calls justice?These kinds of cases send out an outrageous signal. The Bord Fáilte slogan, "Ireland of the Welcomes", does not apply to immigrants, asylum seekers and those seeking work visas. The difficulty in obtaining work visas, the provision tying recipients to their employer and the restrictions on employers the Minister has introduced are outrageous. He has increased fees, imposed a delay on the period of assessment and, in certain cases, the entitlement to a permit has been considerably curtailed. These are draconian measures.The Fine Gael Party proposes that non-nationals who have been legally resident here for five years should be eligible to apply for citizenship. It would be desirable for those deemed eligible for citizenship to be able to demonstrate knowledge of the country and its history, culture, values and democratic principles. Economic migrants should be invited to fill an annual quota of approximately 10,000 non-EU workers to meet the labour requirements of the economy.The Fine Gael Party proposals are contained in the Proper Policy Response to Immigration, a far-reaching document on which I compliment Deputy Deasy. I also congratulate the Deputy on the important amendments he has tabled for Committee Stage. The Minister's cynical attitude in more or less sniggering at the Opposition for raising issues which need to be debated is outrageous. It is also outrageous that he has guillotined a Bill introduced in response tolosing a case ten days ago in the HighCourt.We must ensure the target of allocating 0.7% of gross domestic product to development aid by 2007 is realised and continue to persuade other European states of the necessity to do likewise. The enlargement process needs to be supported and adequate funding made available to applicant states to assist them in developing their economies.Amendment No. 35 tabled by Deputy Deasy is important. The practice of issuing work permits to employers, which has long been criticised by the Fine Gael Party, amounts to a system of bonded labour in which the worker is tied to an employer. As has been borne out in a number of high profile cases, it leads to exploitation of workers. It is deeply flawed to suggest that a non-national should possess an employment permit when landing here given that only the employer may have such a document. One cannot expect more of non-national than that he or she should carry a copy of the permit.

The Bill introduces a new concept into immigration law, which marks a new low in the Minister's well-trodden path of legislation by stealth.The speed at which the Bill was drafted is impressive. Year on year, we listen to the Government promise much needed legislation which it fails to publish, yet it was able to produce this Bill within a week. The Bill is not short and includes more than 20 sections.

It is interesting that this legislation comes so soon after a Private Members' motion on the position of Irish immigrants in Britain. I spoke on that motion in the House last week and I quoted from Cobbett who said that in one month 15,640 Irish immigrants who had previously been harvesters arrived in London ragged and in a state of destitution. Frances Finnegan's book on poverty and prejudice documents this transition from pre-Famine migrants who laid down channels of emigration to Britain and how this became a flood at the time of the Famine. This was before the great emigrations to the United States. The reaction to them in Britain was as carriers of disease who were passed from the jurisdiction of one poor law institution to another, moved on so that the cost from one area could be passed on to another. This is burned in my mind as one reads of their experience. They were simply people from pre-Famine times who were seeking to pay the rent and pay debts to shopkeepers, to provide facilities for other people to build churches after the Famine, to provide facilities for emigration to the United States and elsewhere.Our history is very much one of sending people to other countries in the absence of our capacity to provide the opportunities for employment. As late as 1957, 59,000 people left Ireland and at the end of the 1980s urban people in the main emigrated.It is interesting to note the rhetoric used when discussing Irish illegals, as so called, in the United States. We refer to them in this House, usually, as out of status. Having had that experience, our language when referring to those who arrive in this country is curiously insistent on a kind of fortress mind which is that the State territory must be protected against these strangers arriving on our shores. It is fascinating how close we are to British thinking at different times.The basic study of West Indian migrants arriving in London is called Dark Stranger. Much of this legislation is about identifying strangers who are not welcome here or whom we wish to exclude. I wish the House had been discussing fundamental legislation that drew distinctions between those who are refugees, economic migrants, those seeking to be bonded with their families, distinctions that it behoves us to address in this Legislature, rather than this rushed legislation.I am not a lawyer but I am interested in law. I found it curious to read the judge's comment that his decision was based on a glitch. Speaking with respect from outside that profession I suggest judges are there to judge, reach conclusions and arrive at decisions, not to identify glitches. The Government is there to introduce legislation. Members of this House, Opposition and Government, are here to legislate with some degree of certainty. To come with rushed legislation on the basis of filling or transcending a glitch will, in turn, as so many speakers on this side of the House have said, create its own problems and certainly not satisfy many.The two founding Acts of 1935 and 1946, which are at the root of this Bill, those which it seeks to amend, are not without their own particular context. The 1935 legislation created the capacity to deport. I often think ofMr. Graltonwho was deported from this country on the basis that he was a threat to the State because of allegedCommunist sympathies. He is the only Irish citizen deported under the old legislation. The immigration policy of the State is not a new question.The Minister has his own view and I differ with him on some fundamental points. His view is fundamentally a conservative one, argued within a very narrow view of the Irish Constitution. This is a view on jurisprudence that has been encountered previously. In his speech to the House he states:Some of the criticisms which have been voiced are based on the misapprehension of the relationship in law between a non-national and the State. The position recognised and confirmed by the courts is that, subject to two categories of exception to which I will refer later, a non-national has no right to be in our State and that permission to enter is in law a concession or privilege bestowed on the non-national by the State by virtue of its sovereign power. Control of non-nationals entering a state is a valuable and essential tool at the disposal of every sovereign state for the protection not only of its territory but of the people who lawfully live in that territory. This has long been universally recognised.That is an extraordinarily strong statement and comes out of the politics of fear. It is capable of doing immense damage not through its own direct reference but through the misconstruction that would be made of it. He states that in the Irish context this position is supported not least in two key judgments of the High Court. There has been a movement in law which recognises there are fundamental rights which attach to the person and to the family in movement from one country to another.It seems to me that the Minister's speech on this hastily drafted legislation represents a further indication of a distaste for international law as being somehow less than a narrow interpretation of the protections that lie within the Constitution. The Minister's introductory contribution included another extraordinary statement, which was somethingof a flourish on his part. He said that: "the Supreme Court has also held that immigration powers can be exercised by the Executive in the absence of legislation". Translated into layman's terms, this means that we can make it up as we go along.When I attended a select committee meeting not long after I became a Member of the Oireachtas in the 1970s, I was told that Ireland's policy was in place to protect its people, more or less, from people coming here. I remember that I was very upset by this remark, which was made in the context of a Committee Stage discussion of a Bill. This remark was followed by a more astonishing statement, to the effect that if Ireland has a policy, it is to keep Ireland "white". It was very interesting.

I can find the reference for the Minister. I will not fall into the trap of suggesting anything else in that regard, as it is not my business to do so. The Minister might find it easier then me to converse with the person in question.An interesting point arises when one examines the controls that have been suggested. When one considers, in an abstract sense, those from whom we should be protected, it is interesting to note that nothing in this legislation will prohibit or delay to any substantial extent the entry into this country of the international financiers who float around the world and who have robbed thousands of people. Unless such people have served a year in jail, they will be perfectly free to arrive at Dublin Airport and use their bought passports to come in and out of the country as they wish. As I prepared this speech today, I thought of the numerous non-nationals — the new landlords to whom people love to tug their forelocks. As such people come and go, how many of them have ever been stopped and asked about their 90 days, or the length of time they spend in this country? Frankly, I do not think such people will be too much discomfited by fear.On 4 January last, The Sunday Times reported on the interesting case of a fugitive Czech-born financier who exploits his Irish passport. Mr. Viktor Kozeny holds 8 million shares in IMS Maxims, formerly Irish Medical Systems and is thinking of running for the European Parliament on the basis of his Irish passport. Far be it for this House to impede his progress in and out of Dublin Airport.The Minister's speech contained an appeal to practicality. Most people who made submissions attested to the courtesy and attempts at fairness at the point of immigration. I acknowledge that, but it is true that those who have made complaints come from minor ethnic groups. I do not think any of us would contest that. I would have thought, therefore, that it would have been practical to include in the legislation a declaration that the fundamental or substantial legislation which is promised in the Government's 2004 programme will deal with issues such as proper training, the procedures to be followed, the right of appeal and the various conditions to be laid down if a person is turned away. It would have been practical for the Minister to have made such a statement in his speech, but I missed it if it was there. A declaration of the planned content of the substantive legislation is essential, as one should not introduce a measure of this type without including such guarantees. I have outlined the evidence for my suggestion that one is moving away from human rights and international law and towards a narrow interpretation of protecting the territory, etc.I have listened with care to the thoughtful speeches that have been made by Opposition Members. It is impossible to accept that the opinions of the Irish Human Rights Commission on legislation such as this were not sought. In light of the debate we have had, it would have been prudent to have sought the opinions of the members of the commission on the fundamental issues involved in the legislation, especially when one considers their backgrounds and the contributions they could have made.I think the Minister was shocked by the reference I made to a comment made by an official in the 1970s. I will dig out the exact quote from my historical references when I have more time.I would like to discuss section 10(5). This matter attracted my attention because it reminded me of the 1940s approach to sufferers of TB. Under legislation passed by this House at that time, landlords and landladies were compelled to record the fact that a person suffering from TB was staying at their accommodation. It was an offence for the sufferer of TB and the person offering accommodation not to keep a register to be kept open for inspection. I do not suggest that this legislative provision guided the thinking of the Minister, Deputy McDowell, but when I read section 10 of this Bill, I thought it was almost identical. According to section 10(3), when a non-national arrives in Ireland, "a register shall be produced by a keeper to a member of the Garda Síochána or an immigration officer if so requested by the member or officer". Section 10(4) states that "a person who contravenes subsection (1) or a provision of regulations under this section that is stated in the regulations to be a penal provision shall be guilty of an offence".

I emphasise that I have concerns about the absence of any guarantee at the point of entry, the notion of entirely neglecting the Human Rights Commission, the establishment of procedures requiring notification, the inspection of registers and the notion that one cannot move from one house to another without notification. What kind of legislation is this if it is not draconian, introduced without consultation with those whom this House has facilitated by appointing them to independent bodies like the Human Rights Commission?I would like to discuss some of the points made by a number of organisations, the first of which is important. I have not heard the Minister outline the particular parts of the Opposition's critique which will be included in the fundamental legislation which has been promised in the Government's 2004 programme. Such an explanation would have been useful but it was not offered. I will return to the point with which I began by stating that there is something especially miserable about legislation of this nature, when one considers it in terms of Ireland's own experience.The Bill's suggestion in respect of persons with a disability is entirely daft, although I understand that it is to be amended. This legislation is such an act of genius that approximately 20 Government amendments to it have been brought forward, shortly after its gestation. I read the Minister's speech carefully so that I would be accurate and so that I would not attribute opinions to him which he does not hold. He suggested that the language of the Bill will be changed to take account of "more modern" usage.An airport is a place of considerable stress. Many people suffer stress during and after flights. The suggestion that the response should not be one of medical care but of disposing of the problem — sweeping the problem away as quickly as possible — represents an extraordinary mindset. Where in this legislation is there a suggestion of any form of appeal or recourse for such a person?The description of the manifestations of disability, to be amended by the Minister, includes agitation and all the symptoms usually attributed to the most abused category in medical practice — schizophrenia. It refers to a person exhibiting the manifestations of a psychotic condition. It is wonderful that those in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform are now able to draw distinctions between a psychotic condition, a minor schizophrenic condition and agitation and stress. I congratulate them on their medical advances. Our hospital wards, especially in the area of mental illness, are full of stupid, imprecise and inaccurate diagnoses on the basis of indications such as this.I found it interesting, on reading the Bill, to wonder who would arrive at these conclusions. Not a doctor or any consultant — just the person who happens to be the immigration officer. I wish these people well and I hope the Minister, when he comes to a more mature phase of deliberation, will make some provision for their training, even if I do not expect him to recognise the evolving principles of international law and the widely held principles of human rights law, which at one stage protected persons who were moving from one jurisdiction to another. It is interesting to note that at the moment, international gangsters and criminals will not be discommoded for half an hour by this legislation. Members of ethnic minorities and people who have fewer economic means than those who have been stealing in a corporate sense will suffer. One will be able to buy one's way——

#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	540	I will finish in a moment. No internal or independent appeals mechanism is offered in this legislation. This is a matter of derision on the Government side, particularly for the Minister. There is no independent monitoring at the point of entry. Nothing is offered to upgrade the circumstances in which a person might seek an outside opinion or appeal. In addition, there will be a particular impact on those with lesser means than those who are international thieves. It will affect ethnic minorities and those who differ from the population of the country in which they are arriving.I believe in an immigration policy and immigration legislation, but this kind of stuff, as I would call it, is unfortunately redolent of an ugly side of the Irish mind. I end where I began. We sent hundreds of thousands of people abroad, expecting a welcome, who themselves were often looked upon as the carriers of disease and threat. This legislation will result in our turning people away at points of entry simply because we are in fear of being overwhelmed. It is very sad. This kind of stuff will feed into the subterranean currents of racism, as people will no doubt discover over the next 12 months. I hope they will notdiscover it during the local and European elections. The loose language of the Bill, which lacks aim and about which even our own Human Rights Commission is concerned, is singularly unhelpful.
#DennisODonovan	unknown-#DennisODonovan-party	unknown-#DennisODonovan-dob	unknown-#DennisODonovan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	541	I wish to share my time with Deputy Kelly.I welcome this important legislation. The Bill deals with a lacuna that has arisen because of the High Court judgment in the case of Leontjava and Chang. It was an appropriate decision for the court to make because of the separation of the powers of the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary. It is entitled to make such a decision and it is up to the Oireachtas to react. A statement has been made that a non-national has no right as such to come into the State. Permission to enter or to be in the jurisdiction is a privilege or concession bestowed on a non-national by the State. That is a statement of fact. There are two exceptions to this rule. If one is a citizen of an EU state one has free access to this country as Irish citizens do in all other EU states. A non-national may also apply for and obtain refugee status. That is fair enough.Do we have or need immigration controls and an immigration policy? It is clear that we do. Otherwise there would be chaos, for which our citizens would not thank us. Is there a gaping hole in our immigration laws since the High Court decision of 22 January? There is, and both Houses of the Oireachtas have a clear, unequivocal duty to ensure that this is rectified quickly, efficiently and fairly.Let us consider the history of inward migration. We referred to the Aliens Acts of 1936 and 1945 as having originated in an era totally different from this one. We hear people talking about the thousands of emigrants that left these shores. However, there were always controls. Eight members of my family emigrated. When they went to America in the 1950s and 1960s they were required to have health certificates and Garda certificates stating they had no criminal record. If they were guilty of any misdemeanour they were not allowed in. In Boston, New York and Chicago one had to sign on every week to ensure the state knew where one was. People say we had carte blanche but that is not true. In the 1950s and 1960s there was a clear indication from Australia and New Zealand that people from the UK and Ireland were wanted to come there and work. Schemes were set up under which one was taken out there virtually free and could work for two years. Those were different times — there was a different climate in those days.We have always had immigration laws and controls, and rightly so, but we did not have a problem with immigration until the period 1994 to 1996, when there was an influx of migrants. I heard the Government being criticised by earlier speakers because Broc House has been left idle. I understand it is idle because there is a court injunction holding everything up — it has nothing to do with the Government. The matter is sub judice. One hears criticism of the amount we are spending on creating facilities and places of accommodation for migrants, refugees and asylum seekers, but we are also being criticised for doing nothing. When the rainbow coalition left in 1997, the problem of immigration, which we had not encountered before, was emerging. The numbers entering the country built up from a few per month to about 1,200 people per month in 1999-2000. This was a big problem.In the early days of the last Government it was obliged to put mechanisms in place. The rainbow coalition left no initiative, no financial plans, no structures, no system of appeal, no offices, no staff. Millions were spent by the last Government on providing a system under which queues were eliminated, proper appeals structures were put in place and people were treated humanely. They were given accommodation, despite some criticism. There was criticism that refugees and asylum seekers were accommodated in hotels and decent buildings when many of our own citizens were on housing lists. This situation should be recognised.I was in Stockholm, with the then Deputy Monica Barnes, at a conference on migration into Europe, the situation in the USA and the balances that were introduced. In 2000, the EU member state with the largest problem of per capita inward migration of refugees, asylum seekers and economic migrants was Belgium. Ireland came second in this table and was well ahead of even the United States.When inward migration to Ireland increased, it caused logistical problems for the then Government. Despite this, it strove might and main to cope with the matter. The Exchequer responded by creating new offices created and quadrupling immigration personnel. Despite this, when I was a Senator, I heard a number of Members claiming that the Government was not doing enough. However, much has been achieved. If we were to go down the road of having no immigration laws as some people advocate, the system would break down.If I am stopped by a garda while driving from my constituency to Dublin, I am obliged to have on me a driving licence with my photograph, to explain who I am and where I am going to and from. As a result of the recent High Court decision, a garda or an immigration official cannot stop an individual to ask him or her basic questions such as where he or she is staying, coming from, and so on, and to record the information. This is a serious issue.There are Members and political parties who advocate an open door policy to all and sundry, refugees and asylum seekers. There is this notion that we must do so because we had outward migration for centuries. This, to a certain extent, is correct. However, if one looks at migration to Britain after the Second World War, the Irish were encouraged there to work on the railways and the roads. The same happened in America and Australia. The same happened here too when, three years ago, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Harney, went to South Africa to encourage people to come to Ireland to fill the many vacancies. In Bantry Hospital, we are glad that we have several Filipino nurses. Most of the doctors there are coloured and are more than welcome because they do a great job. That is the type of migration we want to encourage.An impression, however, has been created, maybe not intentionally by those "do-gooders" in this House and the Seanad, that Ireland is a céad míle fáilte, free and plenty place, irrespective of what one is. This message went out to the drugs and human traffickers. We have seen the consequences of this where people are now smuggled into both Great Britain and Ireland. The impression was that, once one reaches Ireland, one is home and dry, irrespective of motives. I do not say that to those who come to these shores seeking asylum, who have suffered torture and fled from situations in their own countries. When they have come here, we have tended to deal with them properly and humanely. They are also entitled to the full facilities of our legal systems and allowed to appeal any decisions. Many of them remain here.Do the opponents of this Bill realise the terrible repercussions that will ensue if the loophole created by the High Court's decision is not closed quickly? It gives out the wrong signal. I do not advocate the guillotining of the Bill. There is a foundation of immigration law in this State, our policy is clear and successive Governments have supported it. Clearly the Bill is a responsible reaction to a High Court decision. It is a reaction that we must take in hand, sooner rather than later. It is important that a clear message goes out internationally that we have immigration laws and controls.A Member asked what should be done with an individual who is ill and attempts to gain entry. It is a valid point. However, what if a dozen people arrive at Dublin Airport with bird 'flu or SARS which could infect thousands of Irish citizens? Do we tell them they are welcome to enter? What if a hundred people in west Kerry, Clare or Sligo are infected by this 'flu as a result and we cannot control it? That is an irresponsible approach. We need controls at a time when new viruses crop up throughout the world that our scientists and doctors cannot control.I must conclude as I am sharing my time with Deputy Kelly.

#PeterKellyFF	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-party	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-dob	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	544	The Bill aims to address matters arising from the High Court judgment of 22 January 2004 in the case of Leontjava and Chang. The consequence of the judgment has been to cast serious doubt on the validity of all statutory provisions dealing with the control of entry to and stay in the State by non-nationals.The maintenance of security and looking after the interests of all citizens is a serious matter which is a huge responsibility for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Somebody must take responsibility because it cannot be put on the long finger and forgotten. We need people to be responsible and the Minister has accepted his responsibility. We need people to take charge, to do things and take control, because we cannot have a situation where there is no control and people can come and go as they like. There have been many misconceptions about this Bill. It must be made clear that this is emergency legislation without which the issue of immigration law would be left in limbo. How often do we hear who is responsible and the call for people to take responsibility?Permission to enter or to be in the jurisdiction is a privilege or concession bestowed on the non-national by the State. The primacy of the importance of the control of non-nationals entering the State has been universally recognised from earliest times. It is a valuable and essential tool at the disposal of every sovereign state. No matter where one travels, one will be asked for valid identification papers. In New York, if one wishes to buy a train ticket to go to Boston, one will be asked for a driving licence or passport which is a reasonable request. Most people are reasonable, sensible, law-abiding citizens who will accept that they must have valid papers. Due to the threat to world security, it cannot be tolerated that there are no controls.The State's power to exercise immigration controls is not a repressive, punitive or draconian power. It is a duty which falls on the Government in the protection of Irish society, which includes the many non-nationals who live and work here, and in accordance with our legal system. The main provisions were contained for a long time in the Aliens Act 1935 and in the Aliens Orders made thereunder. The Immigration Act 1999, as well as framing the deportation process in the form of a primary statute, provides in section 2(1) that every order made before the passing of the Act under section 5 of the Aliens Act 1935 shall have statutory effect as if it were an Act of the Oireachtas. The Aliens Orders have been the foundation and charter of the operation of our immigration control system since their adoption many decades ago.The recent High Court judgment related to the validity of the 1935 Act and the 1946 order and the court found there was no basis in the 1935 Act for the provision of the 1946 order which imposed a condition regarding the duration of stay on a non-national's permission to enter the State. The court found that another aspect of the 1946 order which related to the power of an immigration officer or a garda to ask non-nationals to produce identity documents was invalid and it also found that the protection the Oireachtas conferred through section 2 of the 1999 Act on the Aliens Orders was itself unconstitutional. When we travel we do not do so without the proper papers and documentation. I know of no-one who does not conform to such controls in the interests of the majority.The practical effects of this judgment go to the heart of the immigration control function as exercised in the State in respect of non-European Economic Area nationals. It leaves every aspect of the operation of immigration controls thought to be addressed by the 1946 Aliens Order either without statutory basis or so open to challenge as to render the controls extremely difficult to operate.The State has inherent powers in this area but they require perfection and clarification in some legislative detail. To date that legislative detail has been provided through the machinery of the Aliens Order which is now open to challenge. Aspects of the machinery in question include: the appointment of immigration officers; immigration controls on non-nationals entering or seeking to enter the State, including refusal of leave to land; permission to remain in the State, including conditions outlining whether the non-national is permitted to work and duration of stay; Garda registration of non-nationals; powers to check non-nationals for evidence that they are permitted to remain in the State; and the power to charge non-nationals for breaches of their permission to remain or for illegal presence in the State and to arrest and detain them for such offences.There are also practical implications for the many non-nationals already in the State. Over 128,000 non-nationals were registered with the Garda in 2003 and the expectation of a non-national in compliance with immigration law, for example, is that when seeking a re-entry visa to return to the State after a trip back home, he or she can rely on valid documents to support his or her application. In addition, when seeking to become naturalised, he or she can show, with valid documents, that the statutory conditions for naturalisation are met. That can no longer be the case if the law is either invalid or has a cloud of invalidity hanging over it.The inroads made into statutory provisions mean the effect of the decision of the High Court is a serious diminution of the powers available to the Executive to fulfil its obligations to its citizens to control the entry of non-nationals to the State. The Bill is an emergency measure and should be taken on those terms. We need to place an obligation on non-nationals to present themselves, on arrival in the State, to an immigration officer for leave to land and we need immigration officers to have the power in certain circumstances to refuse leave to land to a non-national.The Bill is important and necessary and I commend the Minister for bringing the legislation to the House. We have been accused in the past of being slow to react but when we react swiftly we are also accused.

I agree with him that there is an urgent need for new immigration legislation, but the legislation which is needed urgently is that which will address cases such as the one I am about to describe. It is not the first time the Minister has heard of the case. The details will be familiar to him because I spoke personally to him about it before Christmas and on his invitation I subsequently wrote to him with a further appeal regarding the case.The case concerns an 11 year old girl whose name, appropriately enough, is Precious. I will only use her Christian name. She is the older sister of two Irish children she has never met. Their parents have been legal residents of Ireland since 2001 but when they fled Nigeria they were forced to leave Precious behind in the care of her grandmother. Tragically the grandmother died 18 months ago and Precious has been living on her own since then as there are no other family members there to give her support. I will repeat that in case it was not clear: an 11 year old girl has been living on her own for 18 months, distanced from her parents and young brothers by the refusal of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and his colleagues to give her the basic right of reunification with her mother and father.Precious's parents filed for a family reunification visa in October 2002. It took the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform ten months to issue a decision and when it did, the decision was to deny this 11 year old girl a visa to come and live with her parents. An appeal was filed and last month this too was denied. The stated basis for the refusal was the Supreme Court decision last year which held that the parents of Irish citizen children no longer have an automatic right to residency in this State, but that decision said nothing about families such as Precious's. They have already been granted residency and they are appreciated and respected members of the community in my home town. I have a great regard for them which is shared by the community I represent. I regret having to say it but it seems the Government will do anything it can to keep as many people as it can out of this jurisdiction. It saw an opportunity and took it. An entire category of children are now to be denied the right to the care and company of their parents. It needs to be emphasised that these parents are already legally resident in this State.I will dwell for a moment on this family's plight. I ask the Minister to please think about these parents and their 11 year old daughter. She is Precious by name and precious to her family, whose love for her is no less than the love of any of us for our children. Her parents are now placed in a terrible predicament. I have tried to analyse the repeated decisions in this case and can only come to the conclusion that the Minister's refusal in this instance amounts to a method of forced expulsion of the parents and their Irish-born children.They are faced with a terrible dilemma. The Minister's repeated heartless refusal of this child's plea to join her parents, presents this family with a choice between two dangerous situations: the first is to stay in Ireland and leave their 11 year old child to fend for herself, with all the possible dangers to which she as a vulnerable young person would be exposed; the second is to return to Nigeria from where they fled persecution and face an uncertain and dangerous future. Let us not make any mistake about this. Their case is well documented and there is no question about that.This case, above all else, proves the point I made, along with my Sinn Féin colleagues and others here, about the urgent need for a human rights-compliant, comprehensive and compassionate reform of our immigration laws. No provision exists in our laws for complementary protection in which a person who does not qualify as a refugee can still be acknowledged as in need of protection on other grounds. If Precious were somehow to make her way to this country, the Garda at her port of entry would simply turn her back. This is fundamentally unjust, and nothing in the Bill remedies it.

The Minister cannot suggest that the child can find entry here after repeated refusals on his part.The Bill before the House is unjust for the reasons already set out by my colleague, Deputy Ó Snodaigh, and several other Opposition speakers. This State already has a full complement of unjust immigration laws, which should be more accurately described as anti-immigration laws. We do not need to add another one. We need laws to remedy the injustices that this State's short-sighted, ad hoc approach to immigration has caused. This needs to be addressed urgently.I appeal to the Minister to revisit the case of this young woman with which he is familiar. It is an outrage and a shame on every one of us that he has repeatedly denied this child the opportunity of reunification with her parents and siblings.
#PaddyMcHughIND	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-party	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-dob	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	554	The saga surrounding everything to do with this Bill is breathtaking and frightening in the extreme. I fully support firm and proper controls on immigration and I say this because I do not want my words to be misconstrued.I have no confidence that the content of the Bill is proper. Everything to do with the Bill has been rushed. Its introduction into the House has been unsure, as was the case with its introduction to the Seanad. From its inception, it has reeked of incompetence. An example of this is the use of the word "disability" without clarification in the original text. This example alone shows the incompetence and insensitivity surrounding the formulation of the Bill.The fact that some 20 amendments have been tabled to the Bill demonstrates that, until today, the Minister is still unsure of the approach to take to the legislation. What would have happened had the Bill come before the House last Wednesday? We would not have the benefit of the 20 amendments. However, it is of no benefit to receive 20 amendments on the day a Bill is being considered in the Chamber. It defies explanation that a Minister who has a view on everything and everybody's business and is able to tell everybody how to do their business, can act in such an incompetent way and make such a cock-up of everything to do with the Bill.It is not possible to expect Deputies to support the passing into legislation of this Bill with all the uncertainty surrounding it and with all these last minute changes. However, I accept the need for effective controls and that it is necessary to enact legislation to give a degree of protection on immigration controls. If this could be done on an interim measure, it would allow time for proper consideration to be given to this matter so that legislation introduced subsequently would be acceptable to the majority. The interim measure should be put in place for a specified maximum period of six months to allow time for proper consultation. This would also allow for mature consideration and provide time for the Minister and his officials to reflect on this saga with a view to getting it right, something which should be the bottom line. With so many alarm bells ringing, the Minister should listen and consider what reasonable people say. He should withdraw this Bill, replace it with interim legislation and work towards putting in place proper legislation to control immigration.In his contribution to this debate, Deputy Peter Power expressed the fear that, if we did not put this legislation in place as soon as possible, none other than the bold Osama bin Laden would soon be hitting our shores. Unlike Deputy Power, I do not have a direct line to Osama bin Laden. He claimed that this could happen if nothing is done on foot of the High Court decision. He suggested that people, inside and outside the House, wish that nothing would be done. I am not aware of any Deputy who supports the proposition that nothing would be done. A number of Deputies, however, are concerned about many issues regarding this legislation. None of these has suggested that nothing be done, rather that whatever is done now be revisited in a few months when full and proper consideration is given to the issue. I want firm and proper controls on immigration, but because of all the questions surrounding this legislation, I have no confidence that we are getting them.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	555	In the week and a half of formal sittings this year, matters arising outside this House have heavily influenced the Government's legislative programme. Not only are we considering this Bill for this reason, the Civil Registration Bill has come before the House as a result of Supreme Court consideration. We can also anticipate a Bill to deal with the result of the Carrickmines decision when the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government acted beyond the scope of his powers. Many Opposition Members did not need a court to confirm this.It does not bode well for a Government that likes to pretend it is concerned about reforming legislation and setting an agenda for a future Ireland. This Bill is the ultimate example of panic legislation. While the Minister may call it emergency legislation, the consideration that the House will give it — even though the Government has twice relented on how it is presented to the House — is nowhere near the degree of scrutiny that should be given to any legislation, particularly legislation that might show itself to be flawed when it is considered by the courts.I am happy Government Members have chosen to come to the Chamber. Earlier, it seemed that no Government Member other than the Minister was choosing to speak on the Bill.

#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	561	I was grateful for the short contribution from my Cork city colleague, Deputy O'Flynn, on this subject, although he has said far too much already. The House did not need to be exposed to any more of his ill-informed opinions on this topic.The Minister is facing criticism from bodies like the Immigrant Council of Ireland, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, the Irish Refugee Council, the Migrant Rights Centre of Ireland, Cairde, Amnesty International and State linked bodies such as the national committee on racism and interculturalism and the Human Rights Commission. The breadth of bodies criticising the Minister should make him take notice and produce a more considered Bill over a longer time period.Of all people, the Minister should realise the danger of emergency legislation. It can be dangerously applied and, more worryingly, it can become permanent. This is happening in a vacuum; we are passing immigration legislation in the absence of an immigration policy. My view, and that of my party, is for a more liberal approach to immigration. We can sustain higher levels of immigrants and we will benefit culturally and economically by inviting people to the country. However, the levels of immigration must be sustainable and only then should suitable levels of control be introduced. The Minister, who styles himself as a liberal yet shows precious little evidence of being a liberal in the legislation he publishes, is putting an ad hoc immigration policy in place that assumes people coming to this country have something to hide and are in some way not worthy of being here. Until we have such a policy, legislation such as this should not be brought before the Houses.The Minister is panicking by introducing a Bill he knows will only cover the short-term problem raised by the court case. I hope he gives more attention to Committee Stage deliberations than he is giving to this debate.The arguments for strong controls made by the few Government Members that contributed to the debate strike me as being extremely insular. I speak as a child of Irish emigrants. The idea of the country being swamped by all manner of infectious diseases — which informs this legislation and how people with disabilities are likely to be defined as being of ill health — is an insular attitude that can be equally applied to people who emigrate from this country. If we want to keep this island pure, surely the argument of putting the strongest controls in place to prevent people from coming here should also be applied to people coming back to this country. If our history as an emigrant nation means anything, we must learn from the experiences that we have had in other countries, where the Irish have been treated as second class citizens and where we have been exposed to Punch-type caricatures.It is offensive that we are making these arguments in our more developed economic and cultural state. Immigration can help benefit our development as a country and has the potential to bring greater prosperity. Immigrants can add to our greater cultural and economic stock. On these grounds, the Minister is again perpetrating bad legislation. The Opposition has no option but to use every means at its disposal to ensure this legislation is exposed for what it is. We lack the means to prevent it from reaching the Statute Book. We can only hope that provisions are made to bring this emergency legislation to the House for review, as has been suggested by Cairde, at three, six or even 12 month intervals. Perhaps then we can have confidence that a proper long-term and all-embracing immigrant Bill will come before the House.
#MJNolan	unknown-#MJNolan-party	unknown-#MJNolan-dob	unknown-#MJNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	562	I do not think any Oireachtas Member wanted to see this Bill published, or the manner in which it was brought before the Seanad on Friday and the Dáil today. The decision of the High Court on 22 January was clear. It unequivocally stated that existing laws and statutory instruments are unconstitutional. The Government had no choice but to introduce the legislation. Much as we regret the haste with which the legislation was drafted, published, and is now being debated, fair-minded Members and commentators will acknowledge the difficulty in which the Minister finds himself.This is not the first time emergency legislation has been introduced to fill a vacuum created by decisions of the courts. I am pleased to note that the Minister is appealing the decision to the Supreme Court. However, as Members are aware, this is going to take some time and we do not have the luxury of allowing the vacuum to exist. The Garda and immigration officers do not have the authority to seek documentation from non-nationals.In the meantime, the Government is obliged to implement this legislation in order to fill the vacuum. We have an obligation to protect the human rights of Irish citizens and those who seek asylum here. I do not think any Member can say that the Government, or any previous Government, has not protected the rights of persons that have come to this country. Many Irish people have had to emigrate to other countries and some were harshly treated.

In fairness, my time allocation should start from now. I am pleased to have theopportunity to speak on issues related to the provision of services for older people and to outline what the Government is doing to meet the needs that have been identified for this population group.Services have been developed in line with the recommendations in The Years Ahead — a Policy for the Elderly, the report of the working party on services for the elderly. Poor quality, older long stay accommodation for the elderly has been upgraded or replaced and there has been a progressive shift from the provision of care in institutions to care in the community in line with the recommendations in the report and in keeping with the wishes of older people. The emphasis now is on providing and developing appropriate community support services to enable older people to live in dignity and independence at home in accordance with their wishes as expressed in numerous research studies.In my constituency and beyond there are different models of what is excellent new thinking in this area. Examples include Fr. Kitt Court in Crumlin, St. Andrews community centre, Rialto and, outside my own area, an independent living area for senior citizens, Brabazon House, run by Protestant Aid in Sandymount. This is the future of care for the elderly.Most elderly people want to be independent, if at all possible. The last thing an elderly person wants is to be put in a residential home and forgotten about. The first and best option is help, assistance, care and love in a family home or in their own independent home and, if necessary, in a community and, only as a last resort, in a residential home. The so-called liberal thinking on care of the elderly is that families have to somehow forget their responsibility. Parents look after their children when they are young and children should look after their parents when they are old. There is no getting away from the primary obligation of people to look after their parents. I lost time to the interruptions but I will give way to the next speaker.
#CharlieOConnorFF	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-party	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-dob	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	576	I am not going to deal with the hecklers because I do not have the time. I am not going to take lectures because as a member of Fianna Fáil in Government since 1997, we do not have to take lectures from anybody about what we have done for the elderly. Look at the budget figures over the past number of years and compare them with the figures for the years before that. I am glad to see the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, is present but I am sorry that his colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, is not present because of other Government business. I admire the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, because he has been taking some unfair criticism from the other side of the House in the way in the past week or so. People are saying that he is too busy, that he is sending too many letters. He is doing a great job.I have known the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, for a long time since he first became chairman of the then Eastern Health Board in 1984 and when I joined the health board in 1994, he was always extremely helpful to us all, ensuring that the resources of the health board were made available in various areas. He did a tremendous job and he continued as chairman of the Eastern Regional Health Authority. I had the privilege of bringing the Minister of State to the new senior citizens centre in Kiltipper Road, Tallaght, a little while ago. Not only did he have a cup of tea but joined in the singing and dancing. Fianna Fáil Ministers are on the ground, doing their job.I come from a community which has a very young population, but we are all ageing. I am from a generation where I am as aware of that as anybody else. In Tallaght we are doing a great deal of work for the elderly in Glenview day care centre and the Kiltipper centre. The health board has a facility in Brittas, which is almost in Tallaght.I am not afraid to make the point that we need more resources to meet the needs of the elderly. I strongly support the private nursing home development taking place in Kiltipper Road. When it opens this summer it will be a boost to services for the elderly in the area.I compliment the Independent Members for tabling this motion because it gives colleagues across the House an opportunity to debate issues of the day. Caring for the elderly in our communities is one such issue. It is a shame we do not have more time to debate it.I have read the motion and the Government's response, which is very positive. I look forward to remaining in touch with the Minister and the various agencies to ensure that we continue to care for the elderly among us.
#DennisODonovan	unknown-#DennisODonovan-party	unknown-#DennisODonovan-dob	unknown-#DennisODonovan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	577	I might take a leaf out of the previous speaker's book and be parochial. We get a pain in the head sometimes from hearing about Tallaght. I am not saying that in a derogatory way, but the Deputy refers to it frequently.The cottage hospitals in Schull, Clonakillty, Dunmanway and Castletownbere were neglected for many years. Phenomenal work has been done in those hospitals in the past four or five years which has been gladly welcomed. Extra facilities have been provided in Bantry hospital at a cost of several million euro. The needs of the elderly are now met by the appointment of a geriatrician among other things. In excess of €2 million was spent in Schull where we were campaigning and raising funds for more than 30 years for a day care centre. It was eventually opened last year. In Castletownbere we had similar a situation. The local hospital was upgraded with new beds, new facilities and additional staff to care for the elderly. It also happened at another small hospital in Dunmanway. When one compare what the Government has done for the elderly, not alone during this term of office but over the last six or seven years, with what went before, we can hold our heads high.While canvassing during the last general election campaign, I met a 93-year-old man on Bere Island. He was an old republican and remembered Éamon de Valera coming to Castletownbere in 1932. The old man did not know me well but, unfortunately, he knew my constituency colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, much better. I had a job to persuade him to come on the right side of the fence. He remembered when there were no pensions and he remembered the shilling pension that was introduced later. He is in receipt of a pension now but due to his advanced years he is unable to travel to the mainland to spend it. He said, "Why should someone like me complain?" He was living on his own on that island. He had no axe to grind, although he probably went through hard times in the past, having lived for almost a century on an island that had been occupied by the British forces for several years. Yet, as far as he was concerned, he was well catered for by the Government.In 1997, approximately €12.7 million was spent on care of the elderly. By 2003, that sum had risen almost tenfold. Inflation has been relatively steady during those years and never went into double figures, yet almost €112 million was spent last year, and the figure is rising annually. Having said that, I welcome the motion tabled by the Independent Deputies because care of the elderly is an issue — like looking after people with sensory or physical disabilities — about which one cannot do enough. We must care for the less well off in our ageing population. Even if we doubled funding for care of the elderly, we would probably still be lacking part of the provision of such services. I welcome this debate but we should take into account the improvements in care for the elderly that have occurred over the past decade.
#JohnMcGuinness	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-party	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-dob	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	578	I compliment the Minister for Health and Children on the work he has undertaken in the Department and his achievements to date. The speech by the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, was most impressive because, as well as dealing with the usual schemes, he also outlined the various pilot schemes that have been undertaken in other health board areas. I am impressed by the imaginative schemes that are currently in place and the sooner they can be implemented in other health board areas, the better. Care in the home is something that every elderly person desires, rather than being hospitalised. The Minister of State mentioned the personal care packages, which can ensure that old people are cared for in their own homes.I compliment the work of the senior citizens' parliament. In my own constituency its members have made a positive contribution to this debate in identifying areas where action can be taken, which will result in improved schemes for the care of the elderly.In addition to what the Minster is doing, we must also examine the schemes that are already in place and judge them in terms of value for money, efficiency and delivery. The DPG scheme and housing aid for the elderly need to be re-examined. They attract a significant amount of national funding from the Exchequer but there is too much of an overlap from health boards and local authorities. We could achieve greater efficiency while spending more money on such schemes.I wish to draw the Minister of State's attention to the need to deliver a 30-bed unit at St. Canice's Hospital at a cost of €2.4 million. That unit would fill a gap in the care of the elderly in Kilkenny city. The issue has been debated as part of the political agenda for the past 20 years but we need to take action on it. We also need to examine the role of health boards. The South Eastern Health Board has 114 acres of urban development land and 235 acres of agricultural land over and above its requirements. It is time we drew attention to these landbanks all over the country. Alongside the investment the Government is making for the care of the elderly, and health services generally, we should encourage health boards with such landbanks to dispose of them. In that way they could invest in frontline services, including the care of the elderly. We must ensure that a bias is built into health policies to deliver services for old people.The disposal of large landbanks should be prioritised by every health board. For example, I am sure that if the landbank I referred to in the South Eastern Health Board's region was disposed of, it would deliver not only the 30-bed unit at a cost of €2.4 million, but would also deal with many other health issues in the counties comprising the region.We need to focus on the care of Alzheimer patients through local partnerships that can be formed with groups acting to raise funds and care for such patients. We should examine the possibility of working in partnership through health boards to work with local groups to deliver services for elderly Alzheimer patients in particular. We should also ensure that local units can provide institutional care based on the same kind of care that patients would receive at home. Such services need to be developed rapidly throughout the country. If money raised through the sale of landbanks owned by health boards could be invested directly in such projects, there would be less demand on other health board funding. We would then see the kind of health services that all of us in the House argue for, being delivered more quickly. In that way, services for the care of the elderly would be improved. I would encourage the Minister to examine that proposal.

As my colleague, Deputy Sexton, said earlier in this debate, no one in this House has a monopoly on social concern, justice or care in the community. We accept, for our part, that that applies equally to the members of the Technical Group. We recognise fully the record of life expectancy and the effect on mortality in Ireland its members from the republican movement have had. We recognise fully what the republican movement has done for active retirement in the cases of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe, Jean McConville and many hundreds of others. We recognise the contribution they have made to the health status of the population with baseball bats, blindfolds and balaclavas.We recognise that the parties in the Technical Group promise everything, yet deliver nothing. It is always easy to call for more money, extra expenditure and additional services — more of everything they know they will never be asked to implement and deliver. Predictably, therefore, the motion seeks more of everything. No one is against more services, more support or more care. It is highly relevant that these are the very services and supports that the Government has introduced and that the parties opposite have never done anything about.

These are challenges only parties in Government will address. I am talking about parties currently in Government which are prepared to accept the responsibility of Government.We are willing to address issues for an ageing Ireland, issues which mean taking a long-term view of sustainable services for an older population. It was for this reason the Progressive Democrats organised its recent conference. The issues are complex and require thought, consultation and reflection. The clear reason the Technical Group has nothing constructive to say on the matter is that this consideration has not taken place.We have an opportunity now to address age issues and to avoid the problems that have beset older populations in other countries because they acted too late. We must think and act strategically. As my colleague, Deputy Sexton, said yesterday, we must counter the aura of negativity that surrounds debate about older people, an aura to which this motion only contributes.We are all ageing and some of us are aged already. We will not become dependent, decrepit and demented just because we turned 65, 75 or 85. Our policy for ageing Ireland should be developed to meet this reality as well as the real needs for care and financial support of many older people. We in the Progressive Democrats are doing this. We are getting on with the real job of policy development, called governing — not that this is of much interest to the Technical Group.
#JohnCreganFF	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-party	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	590	I am glad to have the opportunity to defend the Government's record on the provision of care to the elderly. The Government has been fully committed to enhancing the care of the elderly and the Taoiseach is to be complimented on appointing a Minister of State with responsibility for the care of the elderly, Deputy Callely, who has done an excellent job during his short time in office.It has long been the policy of the Department of Health and Children to encourage older people to remain in their communities and retain their independence for as long as possible. It is necessary to have certain provisions in place for them to do this. The old age pension has been increased substantially since 1997 to the current figure of approximately €150. This will be enhanced to a figure of €200 by the end of the lifetime of the Government.Everybody over the age of 70 in the country is in receipt of a medical card. This is important for those people who need to visit their general practitioner or get medicines on a weekly or monthly basis. People in receipt of old age pensions also have additional entitlements such as free units of electricity, free telephone rental, an additional fuel allowance and a free television licence.We also have three different schemes in place to ensure that people have proper facilities in their homes: housing aid for the elderly, which is administered by the health boards, disabled persons' grants and essential repair grants. I encourage the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, to streamline this area because some people avail of all three grants while others get none. This area needs to be examined. The Minister of State has a review group in place which will try to ensure that we enhance the area by having one scheme which will cover all older people who require work to be done on their homes.Besides these schemes for people who live in their own homes, we have day care facilities in almost every town. People may avail of transport and leave their homes to come to the day care centres where they can avail of either social or medical therapy, something they appreciate greatly. We also have respite facilities available for them.Our carers must be rewarded for the fantastic job they do. The carer's allowance is being paid and over the past number of years there have been changes in the means test so that more people can avail of the allowance. The carer's benefit means that people may leave their jobs for a short term to care for elderly relatives. These schemes are in place to help people who want to live in their homes. The Government must be complimented on putting these schemes in place. I do not say we have a perfect system; we do not. There are gaps to be filled and anomalies to be rectified. I encourage the Government and the Minister of State to continue the good work to ensure that people do not fall between stools and lose out on the different payments and services available.Unfortunately, some older people cannot be cared for in their homes because they need specific treatment. We have some excellent facilities in our public geriatric hospitals. In St. Ita's Hospital in Newcastle West in my constituency, people receive top-class care, sometimes indifficult circumstances. I compliment the staff and management of such hospitals on the manner in which they carry out their duties. We also have private nursing homes and tax breaks available for people who have invested in these. Nursing home subvention has been increased over the years. I would like to see the subvention increased and improved because some families have no choice but to place their elderlyrelatives in care. They often find at the end of week that there is a shortfall which they must meet.There has been a ten-fold increase in spending in care for the elderly from 1997 up to 2004. This must be admired although there is more work to be done. I compliment the Government on what it has done and encourage it to do more.
#PeterKellyFF	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-party	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-dob	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	591	The policy of Fianna Fáil in Government is: to maintain older people in dignity and independence at home, in accordance with their wishes as expressed in many research studies; to restore independence at home to older people who become ill or dependent; to encourage and support the care of older people in their community by family, neighbours and voluntary bodies; and to provide a high quality of hospital and residential care for older people who can no longer be maintained in dignity and independence at home.There are more than 900,000 people aged 50 or over in Ireland. In the past, the growth in the number of older people has been referred to in negative terms. While old age has been associated with dependency, the vast majority of older people are healthy and independent. Our aim in Fianna Fáil is to provide improved services which benefit an older population whose contribution to society is fully acknowledged by the Government.All our budgets have been characterised by measures to improve the position of older people in society through their pensions. Those with selective political memories should not be allowed to forget that, over the three budgets of the rainbow Government, the Labour Party Minister for Finance gave pensioners an average increase of €2.95. In contrast, the average increase to pensioners under the budgets of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, now stands at €9.75. In percentage terms, the old age contributory pension increased by less than 10% under the rainbow Government. Under Fianna Fáil it has increased by well over two thirds. The figures speak for themselves.The effect of the increases under Fianna Fáil is that the rate of old age contributory pension will now stand at €167.30 per week, an increase on the €99 per week which was payable on the day the rainbow Government left office. The increase in pensions this year is real and ahead of inflation. Our critics on the Opposition benches should explain why, when they were last in office, old age pension increases stood below the rate of inflation.The cornerstone of policy on the care of older people is care in the community. The overall aim is to support older people to allow them to live with dignity in their own communities for as long as possible. I pay tribute to all those who look after the elderly. The people who work in public and private nursing homes are an example to us all.

#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	594	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion and to commend the Technical Group on choosing to debate the important issue of care of the elderly. In his speech last night, the Minister of State with responsibility for the elderly, Deputy Callely, asked the House to believe the Government was aware of and is addressing the needs of older people. He said little to convince us and the wider community that this is the case. His statement contained no proposals to deal with the issue. It was full ofreferences to reports, reviews, working groups, interdepartmental groups, pilot schemes, national implementation groups and public private partnerships, the last of which will be a disaster. While there has been no shortage of talking shops to date, there has been precious little action.The situation facing many older people has reached crisis proportions. Following telephone calls and visits from constituents, I visited accident and emergency departments at a number of Dublin hospitals. It was appalling to have to speak to older people, some of whom were crying and asking me to get them out of the hospital and bring them home. People were lying on trolleys for up to 40 hours while public beds were left unoccupied. It is a scandal. While I commend the professionalism and the caring attitude of the staff working in such atrocious conditions, the Minister must address the lack of dignity afforded to older people. They have scraped and made sacrifices over the years on behalf of their families and the State but must now endure terrible conditions when they are in need of medical care in old age.I have paid visits to elderly people in my constituency and received numerous telephone calls on their behalf. I provide the House with the example of a husband and wife aged 78 and 82, respectively. The husband suffers from Alzheimer's disease and in recent weeks has been confined to a wheelchair. He must be helped into and out of bed. His frail wife, who has been diagnosed with the early stages of Parkinson's disease, has endeavoured for the past ten years to care for him and continues to do so. While he is in receipt of a limited though welcome amount of respite care, she cannot cope on her own. Her husband has an immediate requirement of long-term nursing home care, but I question his prospects and the prospects of thousands of other older people of receiving this care.Older people in need of long-term public nursing home care in areas of Dublin now face a waiting period of up to 12.5 years. While the Tánaiste lectures families as to their responsibilities to care for the elderly, the Government fails to meet its obligations. It is turning its back on the crisis it has allowed to develop. Approximately 150 elderly people are on each of the waiting lists in community care areas Nos. 6,7 and 8, which are north of the Liffey. This is about 450 people in total. I have been reliably informed that the withdrawal of contract beds, which are beds in private nursing homes which were hired by the health boards last September, means there has been an average of only one placement from each waiting list per month.A vacancy occurs only when a patient in care passes away. This means a hospital in-patient capable of being discharged to a nursing home or an individual in the community seeking permanent care must wait for up to 150 months for placement. Clearly, this is ridiculous. If it is allowed to continue, many of those on the waiting list will have passed away long before they are offered a bed. Consequently, many elderly people are forced to remain at home and rely on family support where available at a time when community care and home help services are being cut back. It is also the case that hundreds of acute hospital beds are being occupied by elderly people who do not require that level of care.Older people may have to wait for up to 12.5 years for long-term nursing home care, should they live that long. It is appropriate and imperative that home help services be extended and developed. Last night, the Minister of State said the Government was committed to developing these services for the elderly. We must ask if we can believe him given that the facts do not bear out his statement. From information received from the different health boards, I can confirm that there was a reduction of 250,000 home help hours in 2003 from 2002. I do not have all the information yet and this figure does not include returns from the Eastern Regional Health Authority. The statistic emphasises clearly that basic care for people in their homes is being cut back drastically by the Government whose members pay lip-service to the elderly in this Chamber.Community care services are essential to maintain at least 90% of people aged 75 or over in their own homes. It is clear to the Labour Party, which carried out investigations throughout the country, that they are not being provided. The key community care services for older people and their carers are domiciliary nursing, general practitioner services, home help, respite and day care services, and meals and transport services. However, other factors and services must be provided. These include paramedic services such as occupational services, physiotherapy, chiropody, speech therapy and social work services. Chiropody and physiotherapy care is required by 50% of olderpeople.While the pressure on hospital consultants to treat medical ailments will decrease, there is a serious chiropody problem. People have an ongoing problem trying to access chiropodists. The issue must be resolved as proper chiropody reduces an older person's chance of suffering a fall and ending up in an acute bed or a nursing home. There is evidence that people with medical cards cannot find a chiropodist to provide them with a free service. Chiropodists who provide a service now ask for a top-up fee. This is a serious issue. It is also very difficult to get a registered chiropodist to provide a home service because of current fee levels and structures.Perhaps the Minister might clarify those allegations, which are scandalous and, if true, unacceptable.This wide-ranging issue needs debate on an ongoing basis. However, judging from the Minister's commitment and the needs of the elderly who served this country, the Government has failed them. Unfortunately, I cannot envisage from any commitment given today that this will change in the near future.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	595	I have listened to many comments from the Fianna Fáil side of the House regarding the dignity of older people. I suggest that the party's members might like to visit an accident and emergency department and see how much dignity is provided for elderly people awaiting treatment or a bed. In Cavan Hospital, a patient in her 70s and on a drip was left sitting in a chair overnight waiting to get a bed. However, I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue, which is extremely important, and the Technical Group, including Deputy Harkin, should be complimented on introducing it.It is fair to point out that the vast majority of older people live independent lives and make a contribution to society. Although that is obvious, we should state it. It is a time of opportunity, wisdom — one hopes — and change. A full life can certainly be lived by older people. More people are getting old. The greying of Europe is a well-known phenomenon. By 2020 approximately one in five Europeans will be aged 65 or over. In Ireland, the rate of greying is not as rapid. At that stage, in 2020, our average age will be five per cent lower than that in continental Europe. In that regard, we do not have the same scale of issues to address as others, particularly in Europe. The challenge is much less acute, and we should be able to meet it, especially at a time of such prosperity.Unfortunately, however, there is no real evidence that this Government is setting out to address the issues and meet that challenge in ways that are humane, competent, systematic and methodical. Those are the people who created the prosperity for us and who deserve our collective attention as a community to ensure that they live out their lives with some kind of comfort and security.One organisation that represents older people made some valuable points in a very recent publication on long-term care. Age Action Ireland described the situation regarding long-term care beds for the elderly as "a mess". Three Dublin consultant geriatricians used the word "crisis". Whatever the most appropriate description, few professionals or clients of the service can doubt that there is a significant political, financial and logistical problem to be solved. They go on to talk about the shortage of beds, the fact that their numbers are being reduced, and that, although elderly so-called "bed blockers" are in hospitals, many elderly people in the community suffer from respiratory and cardiac conditions or anaemia who should be in hospital and cannot access the beds. The situation is serious. It is therefore very regrettable that, instead of getting good, meaty policy regarding the care of the elderly, there is a situation regarding long-term care described by Age Action Ireland as "a mess".From the Tánaiste, in particular, we get ideology, and that is very regrettable. It is important to remember what she is reported as saying in The Irish Times: “Is it fair that people require the State to pick up the bill, and then they get the benefits when people die?” She is also quoted as saying that society has become increasingly greedy. That is ironic. She says that too many families leave the responsibility for minding family members to the State or someone else. Just in case anyone missed the point, she talked about using a carrot and stick approach to the issue of care of the elderly. What is that about? That is ideological rather than dealing with reality. It must certainly be challenged, and that she has become so furious about the criticism she has received does not alter anything about what she said.If saving the taxpayer an expense is the issue, she is saying that no elderly person who might wish to be independent can expect to have the right with community supports such as home helps, or even dished footpaths or the services of the district nurse. Are those not things that elderly people might expect to have as a right? The reference to nursing home care suggests that people were not looking after their elderly relatives and had somehow decided that they would not care for their mothers anymore. That is not how things are. People put great effort and expense into looking after their elderly relatives within their families.If the Tánaiste had any honesty, she would have pointed out that, when it comes to the idea of family assessment or any way of engaging with younger generations to contribute towards the elderly, she should look to the record of her Government. The Ombudsman discovered that the State, without any statutory authority, had robbed family members of up to £6 million through forcing families to pay contributions to nursing home subventions.The most extraordinary aspect is that her words now were mirrored then in 2001 by those of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. There are Progressive Democrats in Government who are members of Fianna Fáil, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, is one of them. He certainly found a soul mate in the Tánaiste when she made her recent comments. He was being asked to reimburse the people who had been robbed of their money, and he wanted to ensure that the Government held firm and did not pay back what it owed. Even though the law was quite clear according to the Ombudsman that a health board, under the Act, is to pay such a level of maintenance as it considers appropriate, having regard to dependency and the means and circumstances of the person, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, tried to prevent the State living up to its obligations. That is a shabby record, and the two parties in Government must live with it, especially when they resurrect the issue themselves. Is that what the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, is talking about now — that the same family assessment which turned out to be a shambles will be applied by health boards with no authority in law?I have very little time left, but I would like to mention a young man who came into my clinic in south Wicklow. His mother lives on her own in a little house in a rural part of the county. Her suffering from Alzheimer's disease has worsened in recent months. He and his brothers and sisters are trying to look after the woman. It is now impossible for them to do so. She needs 24 hour care. They are on very modest incomes and have children to raise. To hear a lecture being given by the Tánaiste from the comfort of this House or a seminar to those people trying to manage in a rural area with very little support apart from very good voluntary agencies and the district nurse is hard to stomach.At present, the woman is in respite care for two weeks. At the same time, there is a private nursing home down the road with empty beds, and the Minister for Health and Children has provided those who built those nursing homes with fantastic tax breaks. His generosity was so overwhelming that he went further and extended the breaks to one of his constituents, who is now building a private hospital. Today, under the Finance Act, he is extending that generosity on private nursing homes even further. I do not know what that thinking is about. The nursing homes representatives are pleading with the Minister to end the tax breaks because of the danger of a glut. There are empty beds andthere are frail, vulnerable elderly people who need to be able to access them but that is not happening.It is the core responsibility of this Government to deal with that need. It should not lecture us or try to stop legitimate payments, as has been done in the past. It should keep ideology out of the debate and start to look at the real needs of people who are struggling and who will continue to do so without a proper home help service, the chiropody they need when they get older and help with looking after eyesight and hearing. These are services people need but cannot get without resources. The Minister for Finance and the Tánaiste can lecture us about our responsibilities but I point to their responsibilities in this issue.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	596	At the outset I thank the proposers of this motion for highlighting many of the important issues surrounding the well-being of elderly people in this State. I am well aware from my constituency that there are far too many people living in poor circumstances which are the consequence of neglect. Indeed, I know of cases in which elderly people are living in truly appalling circumstances. In many cases, these people are living in isolated parts of the country, although living in a town or city is no barrier to this social isolation.Elderly people living in rural areas are often in a vulnerable position. It is made worse by the fact that a higher percentage of the rural population is elderly. In the last census almost half of those over 65 years of age were living in rural communities. Elderly men in rural areas were almost twice as likely to be bachelors as those living in cities and towns. Again, that is something which adds to the problem of isolation. It is a documented fact that older, unmarried men living in isolated circumstances are more likely to suffer from a range of problems affecting their mental and physical health. They are more likely to drink heavily with all the problems that creates. It is no coincidence that the president of the IFA was asked to make an advertisement for the Samaritans in the recent past. Unfortunately, the reality is that more and more people, particularly men from isolated rural areas and small farming backgrounds, are inclined to take their own lives. None of us can ever know what causes a person to take their own life but it does not take a genius to discover a link between suicide and social deprivation, whether material or simply a lack of a humane society.It is, therefore, a duty of society as a whole to ensure that the elderly are not allowed to slip into such a state. Of course each of us, especially if we have elderly relatives, share in that duty. Communities have an obligation to ensure old people living among them are made part of them. However, the State also has a duty to provide the wherewithal to ensure that elderly people have sufficient money on which to live and that they have secure and safe accommodation and access to whatever public services they need.There are some on the extreme right who will argue that this is not something the State should be doing and that people should provide for their old age while they are working. Most people try to do so, through insurance and so on, to the extent that they can. However, I would argue that any person who has contributed to society through work and paying taxes or in any other way has a right to expect that society will protect them in their old age. That has been one of the marks of a humane society since the ancient so-called primitive times. Indeed, I doubt if the stone age ancestors threw people out of their caves when they were no longer able to go out to get food. However, that would appear to be the mentality of some of our liberal economists who see nothing wrong with elderly people being deprived of their homes if they can no longer afford them.Thankfully, this society has not yet been captured by that kind of thinking but there is evidence that the elderly and the vulnerable are paying the price for a public policy that is increasingly market-led. Not only are elderly people finding it difficult to remain their homes because of rising costs, but they are also suffering because of the cutbacks in public services.I draw attention to an old lady of 92 years age who lived in a single bedroom house in Tralee. She had the services of a home help for one hour five days per week. Many public representatives from the area tried to have it increased to seven hours per week so that she would have that service everyday. Unfortunately, she fell and broke her hip on a Saturday and was not discovered until the Monday. She subsequently died. What is ironic is that she was part of the 1916-23 period of struggle which created a society in which all of us have enjoyed some relative freedom. This Government and the system failed that old lady as it fails tens of thousands of others throughout this country. It is a shame that people who are charged with responsibility to regulate society so that we can have equality and justice and look after our elderly and the people suffering from social deprivation fail in the responsibilities with which they are charged. They are failing to take care of the most vulnerable sections of our communities, both the young and the elderly.
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	597	The programme for Government contains a small section dealing with older people. The first sentence is worth quoting. It states: "One of our core objectives will be to help all older people live in dignity which their immense contribution to the development of our country deserves." Reading through the ever damning statements on the motion put down by the Independent Members, which Sinn Féin is proud to support, I wonder whether the Government Deputies lined up last night and tonight to defend its record on assisting the elderly really think the Government is adequately rewarding them for their immense contribution.A survey carried out by the Economic and Social Research Institute and reported before Christmas found that one in four people living alone have no central heating. Is it any wonder that the State is joint second with Spain on the European league table for winter deaths? There are 2,000 premature deaths per year in the State while in the Six Counties, another 1,300 people die from the cold — a holocaust of the old and the infirm. However, this is what the Government believes is living with dignity, as promised in its programme for Government. Elderly men and women wearing layers of clothes huddle close to small fires, shiver in the dark beneath blankets and duvets and sit alone in their homes because they cannot afford to go out. Some 58% of them cannot afford to run a car. They eat frugally as they try to make their miserly Statepensions go that little bit further. Almost one in ten are unable to afford a meal that includes meat.The Tánaiste recently said society cannot be indifferent to older people living in neglect. She is right but it is not society that is indifferent, it is the Tánaiste and the Government. What else can we do to explain the cuts in the home help service and in the community employment scheme, including meals on wheels and support for the elderly, or the failure to abolish the means test for the carer's allowance or the cuts in nursing home subventions? Why do we blame the elderly? Last night Deputy Sexton claimed that the Tánaiste was speaking out on behalf of older people abandoned by their relatives. The truth is that there are elderly people in hospitals throughout the State who would like to go home and whose relatives would like to have them home to look after them but this Government especially, led by the Progressive Democrats, has abandoned the elderly and it is nothing but hypocrisy to try to pass the buck to the families of the elderly.According to the Irish nursing homes organisation, a staggering 400 nursing home beds were free last September at the same time as Beaumont Hospital had 26 patients on trolleys and chairs in its accident and emergency department. The hospital had 65 patients fit for discharge to nursing homes and rehabilitation facilities but they had nowhere to go. A survey of accident and emergency departments across the State announced by the Irish Nurses' Organisation last week stated that 207 people were on trolleys and chairs while elderly patients whose families wanted to take them in but could not afford to do so are in acute hospital beds. In the meantime, a report in the Irish Examiner a couple of weeks ago stated that 150,000 hospital beds were denied in 2003 due to cutbacks and the lack of alternative care facilities. It also stated that patients declared fit for discharge had to be kept in acute hospital beds because funding cutbacks meant they could not be sent to nursing homes and their families could not afford to take them in.If the Government were to assist these families, make it easier for them to make improvements to their homes, provide a more generous carer's allowance and end the means test, the elderly would return home. If no other argument will convince the Progressive Democrats Party that such measures would be worthwhile, perhaps it will be persuaded by the fact that such a policy would ultimately save money by freeing up hospital beds and staff for accident and emergency patients.I commend the Independents on tabling the motion and giving the Opposition an opportunity to hold the Government to account on this issue. Far from living their lives in dignity, the elderly find themselves facing constant increases in the cost of living, including increases in the cost of fuel with which the fuel allowance does not keep pace, and living in fear, alone and frightened in their homes. What sort of life are we allowing them to live?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	598	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important matter and thank the Independents for tabling the motion which has the full support of the Green Party. This debate is no doubt the result of the Tánaiste's recent unfortunate remarks about the elderly. At the time, she stated that she realised her comments were controversial and she was correct. Later, she tried to wriggle out of her faux pas but the damage had been done.The Tánaiste has the unfortunate habit of putting both her feet in it. The House will recall remarks she made about unmarried mothers and 25,000 Civil Service jobs which cost her party dearly. Her problem is not that what she says is wrong in terms of Progressive Democrats Party policy but that sometimes she does not possess the political skill to disguise its real agenda. The cardinal sin of the new Progressive Democrats Party theology is to be a burden on the State. The elderly have now fallen into this category and joined the aforementioned unmarried mothers as well as immigrants, the unemployed, the sick, people with a disability and those who simply cannot cut it. In its harsh Darwinian world the weakest will always go to the wall and the fittest and richest will not only survive but thrive.To cap it all the Tánaiste now has the effrontery to accuse society of becoming greedy. This accusation emanates from the greed party, of which Gordon Gekko, who claimed greed was good, would be proud. No doubt he would also have given it a few bob — as a legitimate contribution — to ensure it further facilitated his greed. This is the party that boasts we now have the lowest tax take in Europe. We witness the terrible consequences of this greed daily in our hospitals where people lie on trolleys if they are lucky and on chairs if they are not, and are dying because of our inferior health service. Yesterday evening, a gentleman on a radio programme stated the treatment he received in a hospital in Brazil for an asthma condition was superior to what he could have received here. Given our wealth, this is an indictment of the Government.We also see the consequences of this greed in our public services, including our appalling transport system with its sub-standard trains in which passengers, many of them elderly, must stand in the aisles. I felt ashamed to live here when I saw this.The Tánaiste and the Progressive Democrats Party are now worried about our new demographic problem, namely, the ageing population. As Deputies stated, the people in question have made a contribution to our society. They paid their way while the tax cheats got away with millions and they watched this country prosper in recent years as a result of their efforts. The Tánaiste's accusation that they are greedy is an insult. Her real fear is that caring for the elderly will cost the State and require the tax take to be increased. This would not be in line with the low tax, low spend ideology of the Government.The Tánaiste's solution is to make the elderly pay but her analysis is flawed because, as previous speakers stated, the Government is out of touch. The Progressive Democrats Party, in particular, lives on "planet privilege" and does not know what life is like for many people. We may be living longer but, as the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Callely, should know, our life expectancy rates are not what they should be because of our inferior health service.

Given that 50 years is now supposedly the new 40 and 75 years the new 65, the Tánaiste and her party appear to be unaware of the new reality. People in their 60s, who are sometimes considered elderly, frequently find themselves in a difficult position of living with their children and their elderly parents for whom they must care. They are, therefore, sandwiched between two generations and sometimes suffer great stress as a consequence. The reason their children still live at home is that they cannot get on the property ladder, which is also due to Government policies. Parents could downsize and sell their property to give money to their children to help them onto the property ladder. This raises the question of what they will do in their oldage now that they have sold their asset, as itwere.We need to examine the consequences of these trends and apply some lateral and holistic thinking. Let us examine the statistics on health. During a debate on immigrants last week, I noted that we had received a demographic bounce because so many of our elderly people live in Britain, having emigrated there. According to the health economist, Dr. Seán Barrett, this resulted in a demographic bounce of about 1.9%. Notwithstanding this, however, in 2001 some 11% of our population was aged over 65 years, while 27% of the hospital population was aged over 65 years and a massive 46% of bed days in hospital could be attributed to that age group. According to projections, the percentage of the total population aged 65 years or over will increase significantly to 15% by 2001 and nearly 20% by 2030. Inevitably, this will require increased health spending which will mean increasing the tax take in some shape or form. That is the reality the Progressive Democrats Party does not want to face.Rather than coming down hard on the elderly, the Tánaiste and her party should have examined a number of initiatives. The best way to deal with the issue is to consider some of the proposals made by the National Council on Ageing and Older People, including its call on the Department of Health and Children to donate millions of euro annually to support and promote the development of national healthy ageing initiatives. This will be vital.We should also target older women who, compared with their counterparts in other European countries, have a lower life expectancy and greater incidence of ill health. They must be prioritised in policy and strategy planning by statutory and voluntary bodies working on women's health issues. My party is particularly supportive of Well Woman centres which address holistic approaches to support ageing women in health, lifestyle and environmental health issues. We should have a charter of rights for older persons and we also require a more systematic mechanism for consultation with older people at all stages of planning provision.

In a reply to my colleague, Deputy O'Donnell, he stated, "I believe that sons and daughters who are in a position to contribute to the cost of a parent's nursing home fees should do so." At least the Tánaiste and I agree with Deputy Howlin who also said, "It is the natural Irish thing to support elderly relatives." Deputy Rabbitte might wish to read his statements as a Cabinet Minister.I have listened to a lecture from several Members of the Opposition, in particular from Deputy McManus. It is a pity she did not confer with Deputy Howlin about his statements in 1993. The Labour Party and others on the opposite side of the House pretend to have a monopoly on compassion. I suggest there should be a health warning to the electorate that listening to the Opposition will shorten their lives.This Government values our older people and emphasises an approach that helps all older people live in dignity and independence at home. We encourage and support the care of older people who become ill or dependent by family, neighbours and voluntary bodies. Most older people will never require long-term institutional care but for those who can no longer live in dignity and independence at home, the Government works to provide a high quality of hospital and residential care.In the last six years the Government has made a constant commitment by allocating additional resources for services for older people. In 1997 an additional £10 million was provided, increasing by an additional £36 million in 2000; an additional £57 million in 2001; an additional €87 in 2002 and over €111 million in 2003.

It is estimated that by the 2011, the number of people aged 65 years and over will have grown by 25%. The over-65 population increases by 6,000 each year and the number of people aged 80 years and over rises by approximately 1,500. These are statistics to be celebrated as they represent great progress in our society.In order to continue to meet our strong commitments, it will be necessary to significantly expand our current range of services. This is recognised in the health strategy which contains specific commitments over the next seven years: the continued development of community-based services such as community nursing, home help services and community supports, including the provision of 7,000 additional day care centre places; the provision of 1,370 additional geriatric assessment and rehabilitation places attached to acute medical units; and the provision of an additional 800 extended-care beds per year, including beds for those suffering with dementia.This Government of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats has given very visible evidence of its commitment in this area.

I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion tabled by the Independent Deputies. This motion is dedicated to the 440,000 people, 11% of the population of the State, who are over 65 years of age and the 266,000 over 70 years of age.The aim of the motion is to make Ireland a better place in which to grow old. It is also to thank older people for their years of service to this State as citizens and taxpayers. It is an absolute disgrace that after years of economic boom and wealth, our elderly are not being treated with respect by the State and this Government. There are 80,000 elderly people aged over 70 years living alone with few community-based services. I say to the Minister of State that this is not good enough. They feel isolated and intimidated and must bolt their doors and windows every night at 7 p.m. There has to be something wrong with a State, with a Government and with a society that allows citizens to be treated like this.In response to Deputy Fiona O'Malley's remarks about the Technical Group, I suggest she drop the words "progressive democrat" because there is nothing progressive about her policies. There have been cuts in home help services, elderly patients on trolleys in accident and emergency units. The less well-off are dying because of unequal access to health care. There are 1,382 persons with intellectual disabilities on residential waiting lists; 621 seeking day care places; 823 waiting for respite care. Elderly parents are forced to accept services for their intellectually disabled children and adults which are often 100 kilometres distant from their homes.I wish to suggest some new and radical ideas for the support of the elderly. Older people are people, not just patients or potential patients. We must look after all aspects of their lives, not just health, important as that is. Secure and adequate income with index-linked pensions must be provided and work options with a flexible retirement age and protection for older workers.

Affordable and appropriate housing combined with care is necessary, as is affordable and accessible country-wide transport. Safety and security in every part of the country and affordable and accessible lifelong learning and social contact should be provided. These are just some sensible proposals which will assist the elderly in a practical way. I urge all Deputies to unite in support of our motion which is good for our elderly, good for society and above all it is the right thing to do. I thank the Deputies who have spoken in support of the motion.
#JerryCowleyIND	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-party	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-dob	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	629	Our elderly population is lower because we have exported people as emigrants and we should bear them in mind also. For too many years we have allowed the export of our older people to institutions. We lost our young people to emigration and we are losing our older people. Those most vulnerable and alone who most needed our help were exported never to return. Just like the old Indians, they lost heart and died. I have nothing against faraway institutions but they are not home and they are not community.Old age has been mismanaged. It is a physiological state, not a pathology requiring nursing homes and medical care. People need medical care from doctors and nurses when they are ill but not otherwise. People went to institutions because there was no community alternative. It is said that our institutions are full of people who would not be there if facilities were available in their own communities, but such facilities do not exist.If one examines a comparison of the age of older people in institutions in Ireland with the age of such people throughout the EU, one will see that the age is lower here. People are moving into residential care prematurely. We know that nursing homes are being used as a catch-all. If facilities such as sheltered housing were available for people in their own communities, they would be the most appropriate place for them. Some 16% of residents in all types of long-stay units are there for social reasons. Such people should not be there. One in six older persons in nursing homes is categorised as low-support and certainly should not be there. They should be in their own communities.There is a community alternative. The solution is to encourage developments such as St. Brendan's Village. This concept already exists and is seen as a model of best practice. It is a means of supporting people in their communities. It extends from support at home with a day centre to low-support sheltered housing with a caretaker, medium support and communal high support. In that way, one can receive a guarantee of staying in one's community regardless of one's age or level of disability. It is a continuum of support which ensures that people will not have fears for the future. Persons who are getting old or more frail can move sideways. That is all they have to do. Such people can live to the maximum ability with their disability. People want to be in their own communities.St. Brendan's Village is the biggest employer in its locality. The concept has many advantages. It employs 65 people and supports rural enterprise. We are reversing the vicious circle of loss of services and increased depopulation. Why do more units like St. Brendan's Village not exist? Government policy favours the profit-driven nursing home sector rather than community care developments. Nursing home subventions increased by 400% in the mid-1990s compared to an increase of 8% for home care services. I do not claim that nursing homes are not necessary — of course they are doing a good job in the absence of a community alternative.The development of the full potential of sheltered housing is being prevented by problems with rural planning, difficulties in securing adequate funding for high-support housing and the lack of a defined revenue funding scheme. The Government recently launched two reports, the Mercer report and the O'Shea report, which favour a redressing of the balance towards community care rather than residential care. The findings are based on the fact that the costs associated with residential care are higher than those associated with community care. While no particular model is mentioned, sheltered housing most successfully bridges the gap between living at home and in residential care. The St. Brendan's Village model facilitates these concerns and provides for residential care in the community.Traditional sources of land are drying up. The budget increase for voluntary housing this year was just 5%. This is insufficient to realise the increase targeted in the national development plan. The Government needs to provide adequate funding to realise the potential of the community model. It should ensure, by statute, that the provision of older persons' accommodation in the community is preferred to non-community facilities. The same bias should be given to community care so that adequate funding is made available for this purpose. The priority should be to provide social housing to a greater extent than affordable housing. Life interest schemes should be offered to those who are ineligible.
#MarianHarkinIND	unknown-#MarianHarkinIND-party	unknown-#MarianHarkinIND-dob	unknown-#MarianHarkinIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	630	This Private Members' motion, which is sponsored by the Independent Deputies, outlines the reality of the problems faced by many elderly people, their carers and families. The motion describes the day-to-day reality which, as public representatives, we see in our offices and clinics. Having listened to the stories of such people, we know that the Government's amendment contradicts the reality of the lives of many of them. The amendment refers to the Government's "policy of supporting older people who wish to continue living at home in the community". What is the reality for those who apply for special housing aid for the elderly? Approximately 340 elderly people in the North Western Health Board area are awaiting the necessary funding to enable them to stay in their own homes. Some of the people in question have been on a waiting list for more than three years. Their reality relates to draughty windows, damp walls, poor heating and broken ranges. Circumstances are similar in every health board area.The Government's amendment recognises the need for "ongoing restructuring" to ensure that community employment schemes continue to meet "the specific needs" of "vulnerable groups", but the reality is different. Community employment workers in Sligo town worked on the special housing aid for the elderly scheme until recently, but they no longer do so. The backlog is increasing while community employment schemes disappear. There was a cut of 20% in the number of community employment workers in counties Sligo and Leitrim in 2003. The Minister told us last night that there will be no cuts in 2004, but they already took place last year. It is a nonsense for the Government to suggest in its amendment that the restructuring of community employment schemes continues to meet the specific needs of vulnerable groups. The Government's restructuring is doing the very opposite.There are 170,000 full-time carers in this country, many of whom care for the elderly, but just 20,000 people receive carer's benefit or carer's allowance. Those who listened to Deputy Cregan earlier would have got the impression that all carers receive this benefit. Less than 15% of carers receive the benefit or the allowance. There are approximately 2,340 carers in Sligo, of whom just 404 receive carer's benefit or carer's allowance. That is the reality of the benefits system for many carers.Earlier this evening, Deputy Fiona O'Malley lectured the Technical Group by telling us of the need for "thought, consultation and reflection". What good is reflection to a man aged 69 who receives the old age pension and cares full time for his wife who has Alzheimer's disease? All he has to live on is his old age pension. He cannot receive carer's benefit because he receives the old age pension. He needs carer's allowance and not "thought, consultation and reflection".

She is wrong. We have many constructive proposals. I would like to add one more proposal to the list. Strong tax revenues exceeded spending by almost €500 million in January 2004. If the Government spent one month's excess revenue on carers, it would ensure that all 170,000 carers would receive a benefit or allowance. Such a measure would lead to the elimination of the waiting list for housing aid for the elderly in one year. It would put in place an effective home care scheme. By spending that money, some substance would be given to the Government's amendment this evening.I ask the Government Deputies to join the Technical Group in doing something constructive. I demand that the Minister for Finance spend one month's excess revenue —€500 million — on care of the elderly. If this step is taken, we will all have done a good evening's work for those who deserve it most.

We need a long-term plan if we intend to care for the elderly in our community into the future. Regardless of what has been said by Government Members, it is obvious to those of us who work at the coalface that carers are getting a raw deal. Nursing home subvention levels vary greatly between health board areas. The maximum level in all health board areas doesnot cover the minimum cost involved in any nursing home in that health board area. All Members of the House should take these facts on board. The average age of Members is 50, which means that the average Member will, just like one in four of the population, be over the age of 65 by 2030.

There is too much window dressing and not enough reality. The Government prides itself on telling elderly patients they must wait five years for an orthopaedic appointment and a further year to have a hip replaced on the GMS system. What sort of poor planning are we seeing in the health services? We see health centres in Ballymun lying idle at a cost of millions to the taxpayer. A day hospital in Wexford has been built but is still not occupied. Government policy seems disjointed. There is a massive shortage of acute beds and poorly developed step-down facilities, yet 10% of those acute beds are occupied by patients who do not need them. What will happen in the future? Today's patients take up 25% of the acute beds and 46% of the day beds in each of these acute hospitals. Our population will double in the next 20 years.Everybody remembers that we began to decimate the health services in 1980, when we started closing hospitals and cutting down the number of beds. If we take the same length of time to improve it, the elderly population will have doubled. However, nothing is happening.

#MJNolan	unknown-#MJNolan-party	unknown-#MJNolan-dob	unknown-#MJNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	651	This Bill has had to be introduced at short notice, but society cannot proceed without statutory controls or without powers for gardaí to deal with situations they encounter on a daily basis. We cannot have a situation where gardaí are unable to monitor the presence of non-nationals in the State. The Minister and the Government could not agree to that, hence the rush in introducing the legislation in the manner outlined by the Minister. He is not going to introduce a Nazi-type immigration regime; the regime to be put in place will have a lot in common with those in most of our European partner states.There are practical implications for almost 130,000 non-nationals who live in the State, the vast majority of whom are here legally and are very welcome. There are 128,000 non-nationals currently registered with the gardaí and the laws under which they are registered are now seriously undermined by virtue of the High Court decision of 22 January. The aim of this Bill is to correct that situation.It is no coincidence that in recent years we have had an influx of non-nationals into Ireland given the improvement in our economy and the very generous social welfare package available to both citizens and non-nationals. It is no surprise that so many of them have flocked to our shores, particularly in the last ten years. The introduction of better screening of individuals by immigration officials at air and sea ports means that those numbers have fallen somewhat in recent years. Challenges in our courts, some of which have gone to the Supreme Court, have also contributed to changing the perception in certain countries that Ireland was a place to come for easy money and accommodation. That change in perception has resulted in a significant fall in the numbers seeking to come to Ireland.We have a proud record in dealing with refugees and this Bill will not reflect badly on that record. Anyone who has travelled to the United States, or any other country to which Irish people were forced to emigrate, is impressed by the difficulties Irish people had to overcome in their travels, particularly in the 19th century. During the Famine, hundreds of thousands of Irish people were forced to emigrate and some of themdid not make it to new homes in the promised land due to their poor physical condition on arrival.Civil liberties groups have commented on the Bill and I commend the Minister on his commitment to take on board any Opposition amendments which will strengthen or enhance the Bill. Whatever about the speed with which the Bill is being introduced, strengthening it with worthwhile amendments is welcome.The Minister said that even if the State wins its appeal to the Supreme Court, in the intervening period immigration law is in a state of uncertainty, in particular the power to exercise controls over the entry of non-nationals into the State and the length of their stay. It is not within the Minister's powers to continue to implement an Act which the High Court has declared unconstitutional. He has outlined his intention to be open and inclusive in dealing with Opposition amendments on Committee Stage.There has been much criticism of individuals with criminal records in other countries coming to Ireland, where they are refused admission. The legislation is clear on this, as is the Minister. We should not be seen as a safe haven for criminals who are forced, or encouraged, to leave their own states to seek refuge here where they can continue the trade in which they have made their name. The Minister is correct in stating that people who have been convicted of criminal offences up to a certain degree of seriousness, will be refused entry to the State. Individuals who present themselves at our ports are not being asked to submit to a draconian regime. Our code is less stringent than in many other countries.The High Court judgment has serious implications for the law as it stands for non-nationals presenting here until this sovereign Parliament enacts legislation. I wish the Bill a speedy passage and ask for it to be supported by all sides of the House. The Opposition should take the Minister at his word and accept his bona fides when he says that worthwhile proposals or amendments will be taken on board.

However, this Dáil schedule has left me no choice.This month's Dáil schedule and the way the Bill is being handled is both insulting and disappointing. I thought that during the Christmas break Government Members might get their ears cleaned and start listening to us, but they did not do so. They are still not listening. I thought Santa Claus might deliver hearing aids to them, but he failed to deliver as well. They must not have opened the doors for him.This is a new Dáil session and the Opposition is not being listened to on simple matters. We put forward suggestions but we were not listened to. We asked for more time and we were not given it. We asked for debate on certain topics but this was not granted.We represent the people as much as the Members of the Government parties. We cannot make decisions because we were not given the power to do so, but we are here to represent the people. We should be listened to more often, not treated in this way.As a new person in politics, I am still unimpressed by the way this place works and it is getting worse by the day. I do not expect the Minister to change it single-handedly, but he is part of a Government that can change it. If he were on this side of the House, he would shout more than we do.

#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	657	I stand before the House discussing the important issue of immigration and find the House dilly-dallying with the subject, using legislation the courts will probably find flawed. There are so many other pressing problems that should concern us. I do not doubt there is need for a stop-gap Bill and that this needs to be implemented urgently. However, we should not implement one that is makeshift, which has changed two or three times already.The Minister has tabled some 20 amendments and the Opposition has tabled up to 90 amendments. This is hardly legislation that will stand up in the courts. I have great concerns about it. If it were so urgent we could have come in on Saturday and Sunday. I would not have any problem working over the weekend, but the Bill before us was ready last Tuesday or Wednesday. If the Minister really wanted to get it right, why not give it the proper time rather than pushing it through by means of a guillotine measure?The sad part of all this is that we all know it, yet we still have to go through with the Bill. We cannot cop-on and stop it now and come back in a week or two when it has been done properly.What has this Chamber achieved in the nearly three sitting weeks? Where are the properly finished legislative measures that will make a real difference to this problem and to many other problems? Where is the legislation that will save people's lives or way of living, stop multinational companies relocating abroad, and put extra beds in our hospitals so people in need of medical care do not spend their last days or hours on trolleys waiting for a bed, or worse, dying shortly after being discharged.As a result of a court finding, the Minister has tried to rush this unfinished work through the House in two weeks. Will the deaths of young people in and out of the country's hospitals in recent days spur the Minister or the Government to use similar speed to address the many well-documented health problems or the carnage on our roads? What will the Minister have done about these problems in two weeks' time, or even two years? I will not hold my breath. I am here nearly two years and these problems have not yet been addressed. They have hardly been discussed in the House, among many other pressing needs. Do court decisions take priority over people's health and their very lives? Do people's lives mean anything to the Government, apart from as statistics that can be moved around to suit whatever message it wishes to spin that day?When will we learn that rushed legislation is bad legislation? I ask that the legislation be withdrawn and replaced with an appropriate one, on which we can all have a say and over which we can stand. If not, the House will again be made to look foolish in the courts. A good read of Bunreacht na hÉireann would not do any harm to many around here and it would certainly make a change from all the fairytales and stories that are spun.It is not that we are short of legislation to put in its place. Where are the justice Bills that are required to keep law and order on our streets or the one gardaí need to restore people's confidence in them? What elected representatives do in this House at the behest of the Government is a joke. The only comfort for me is that the good people of Ireland are no longer laughing. They know it is serious. It might be acceptable behaviour for the Government after years of running down the importance of this House but I will never accept it from any Government. A Government that does nothing in the House but push through flawed Bills is not good enough. People are fed up with this. The message is finally getting through and they know what is going on, namely, the Opposition is not being allowed to perform in the House.I do not wish to spend all my time talking about how the Dáil works, but I am getting very fed up with it, as are most people. People are dying because we are not working effectively here. It is time we faced up to this failure of democracy.Immigration is not new in Ireland. This legislation, like its predecessors, attempts to bring regulation to what is a natural element of the functioning of any country. People come here and people leave. It is not rocket science. It is not as if the problem only began two days ago. This has been a gradual problem that has been handled badly from day one. As the saying goes, two wrongs do not make a right. This also holds true for three, four, five or six wrongs. It is a natural tendency to want to shut our borders and become fortress Ireland, but it is not just or right. The attempt to establish fortress Europe has failed but this legislation seems to take its lead from such failed European policies.It is not that the idea is wrong or the concept of some form of control is wrong, it is natural for all of us to want to protect what we have. However, a system that turns a holiday camp in County Meath where people used to pay to go to enjoy themselves to a place in which we, the taxpayers, pay for people to go, is fundamentally wrong. These unfortunate people do not even want to be there. They do not want to be stuck in a holiday camp in Meath with nothing to do. They would prefer to be out working but our immigration policy does not allow that. It could take six months or two years for them to get permission to work.I am not saying this is where the Bill is wrong, but it is a symptom of what is wrong with our overall immigration policy. After many years of immigration we have no concrete idea of what we want to achieve through legislation. Like the legislation itself, we have a half-baked idea of what we want to achieve. The Bill has been rushed in here in a matter of two days, many of the words are changed and we will have some 100 amendments discussed tomorrow.We all know that the courts which deal with Bunreacht na hÉireann do not deal in half-baked ideas, so it is incumbent on the House and the Government to draw back and fully develop our immigration policy. We should make use of the experience of the rest of Europe and that of Australia or America. While I would not subscribe to all American policies, I am impressed with how a land of immigrants has been transformed in 200 years into the single greatest economic bloc in the world. It is a lesson and a model from which we can all learn.Following our inaction in recent years we are rushing through this Bill. One of the biggest drawbacks of our legislation in this area is that people from other countries who wish to settle here, but who are kept idle for long periods while their applications are dealt with, are perceived to be gleefully receiving handouts. This is not the case. They do not necessarily want the handouts. Many of them want to work. For example, some are pharmacists and could fill the shortages we have. However, they are not allowed to work. This causes resentment among many taxpayers, and resentment can easily turn to racism. While I know it is not the intention of anybody to stir up racial tensions through legislation, this Bill and the discussion over the past week has done so. Through its failure to adopt a clear policy, the Government has stirred up racial tensions. I have spoken on this matter on numerous occasions yet nothing has been done. The Members opposite can smile all they like, but when they listen with their clean ears they will hear what the people are saying.This legislation was born out of a court judgment and we know there is a potential problem with this. The only solution is cool heads and the formulation of a plan dealing with immigration. This may require us to think outside the box or indulge in lateral thinking — we should not be afraid to do this. Following the formation of the plan, the best legal brains should be called together — if there are any that are not involved in the tribunals — to study the plan and formulate legislation that will observe the Constitution.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	658	The High Court ruling declared a section of the Immigration Act 1999 to be unconstitutional. This has provided an important warning and tells us that Government should avoid legislative shortcuts in responding to specific political and administrative pressures. The timing of the judgment, as EU Ministers met at Dublin Castle to discuss the asylum issue, was apt. The Amsterdam treaty has set 1 May as the date for the adoption of a common EU approach on issues of asylum and the treatment of refugees. It is vital that any resolution of these matters is carefully considered and is humane and just. Whereas there is pressure on us to reach a common solution by 1 May, I hope that it will not be a knee-jerk reaction and is well thought through.The judge found that a section of the Immigration Act dealing with Garda controls on the movements of non-nationals was unconstitutional. She also ruled that a section of the Aliens Act 1935 requiring non-nationals to comply with provisions regarding registration or change of address or employment was unconstitutional. Flaws had previously been found in the Aliens Order and the 1999 Act was supposed to rectify these. As a result of her findings, Ms Justice Finlay Geoghegan granted an order preventing the prosecution of the Albanian Kosovan man who had failed to produce identification to a garda when requested to do so. This shows how inadequate is our immigration legislation.This has been a live issue for a number of years. Deputy Bruton said that we should have immigration law that is firm and fair, and I agree with this sentiment. A large number of amendments have been tabled to this Bill and this indicates that it has not been properly thought through. The Minister should review the immigration legislation with his officials and other experts in the area. While I realise this will be done on a pan-EU basis, we should also look at our own laws.The Human Rights Commission has publicly stated that it regrets the Minister did not refer the Bill to it in advance of publication. The president of the commission said:We have not had time to make detailed observations on the Bill as we would wish to do and which we are statutorily empowered to do. It is our view that it is most undesirable that any legislative proposal with such significance for the promotion and protection of human rights should be processed so quickly and without the benefit of wider consultation.I think the House shares these sentiments.The problems associated with immigration will continue for some time. I hear about these problems in my clinic in Tralee as a large number of asylum seekers are resident there. I am keenly aware of the human interest stories that have been recounted by a number of Members. Tackling the root causes of migration is the only long-term solution. This will involve a significant increase in overseas development aid and the abolition of unfair trade barriers. While progress is being made in these areas, it is not being achieved rapidly enough. Coherent channels for legal migration are needed, rather than the current ad hoc system. Temporary work visas must be made available for migrant workers and those already here on a temporary basis must have their status regularised.The granting of visas is a major issue. I know of a case where a woman, who is in hospital having a baby, suffered complications and is very sick. Her Algerian husband, who has applied for refugee status in England, was refused a visa to visit Ireland. The woman came here to look after her sick mother who has since died, and her husband could not attend her funeral here. It is a tragic story. Any immigration system that does not allow a husband to visit his sick wife is neither fair nor good.A recent ESRI report has predicted that Ireland will need approximately 300,000 educated immigrants by 2010. We should look at the Australian model where visas are issued not to the company, but to the individual worker. This would be a fairer system. Under this system, people could apply for an Irish work visa and travel here.There is much confusion in immigration legislation. The legislation that was in place, dating back to 1935, was inadequate to deal withthe complexities of modern asylum and immigration norms. An overview of the entire area must be taken and our approach must become more cohesive. I am sure this Bill will be challenged in the courts and there will be further challenges. The Minister should review the legislation in this area to ensure that our legislation is watertight and will not be subjected to regular court actions. While the common European policy may be of some assistance, it is important that this State should have coherent legislation.

We are the victim of our success. If one turned back the clock, the picture was very different 15 or 16 years ago . All colleagues in the Chamber with the exception of Deputy Deasy were members of either the Dáil or Seanad at that time. We have come a long way since the days of income tax rates of 65% and 35%, interest rates in excess of 18% and emigration of 50,000 people each year. We had one of the highest inflation rates in the EU at that time and the national debt was doubling. Those were the facts.I have been around for a long time and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, is one of the most progressive and courageous Ministers in any Government in the past 20 years. I commend him for bringing this legislation forward. I know he wants to bring a more comprehensive Bill before the House next year but there are no controls to deal with the problems that have resulted from our success during the past 15 to 16 years . Something has to be done urgently. Members have given various examples and our colleague, Deputy Deenihan, has just given an example of hardship and heartbreak. One's heart would go out to these human beings, fellow Christians

We must recognise that we are here from an act of birth. We would like to think we shaped our own destiny, but it was an act of the Good Lord where we were created and where we would live. Taking all these factors into account, any reasonable person who has had an association with emigration — most families had members who emigrated to foreign shores, never to come back — understands the hardship involved. That background was not pleasant, but thankfully now a person can be born and reared, educated to the highest standards, get a job in his or her home country, get married and live the rest of his or her life in the land where he or she was born. That is a major change in a very short time and we made it happen. The Members of the Oireachtas and our wonderful Presidents made Ireland the success story it is today. We take the kudos for helping this to happen. The Fianna Fáil Party has been in power for a good part of that time, from 1987. I compliment Deputy Howlin who played a major part during his time in office.I know that Deputy John Deasy is a young man starting off in life and I wish him well and a great future. It is lovely to see young people coming to the Dáil. I know from being there on a few occasions that he was very highly thought of in Capitol Hill. Today's young generation are probably the best generation the country has ever seen.The Bill before us this evening deserves our full support and we should not be scoring political points because the lives of human beings are at stake. We urgently need to put controls in place. The interim Bill before us provides for such controls. There are no controls in place and it is not fair to the Irish people or to our EU or UK partners, in particular, because we have a common reciprocal agreement with the UK that allows freedom of movement for our and their citizens.I think Members on all sides of the House, deep down in their heart welcome this legislation. We wish the Bill a safe passage and look forward to a more comprehensive Bill coming before us in the next 12 months.

I hold seven weekly advice clinics in Dublin South-West, in Tallaght, Greenhills, Templeogue and Firhouse, and I have found that people who might be affected by this Bill come to my clinics as their colleagues bring them. One interesting aspect is that they are accompanied by other members of the community, people who have been living in the area for a long time. That is integration at play, which is a positive sign.I support this Bill and I congratulate the Minister and his official on what I see as their prompt response to the outcome of the recent Supreme Court judgment. We are debating legislation which is clearly a response to what has become a frequent occurrence, where legislation is found wanting for one reason or other by the courts.

The Deputy is now eating into my time. When I have more experience, having served a few more terms in office, I will have more confidence in dealing with these interruptions. I look forward to that.I think it is accepted that it falls on the Government to ensure that permission to enter the country is a permission bestowed on the non-national by the State. I am happy to note that the word "aliens" has at last been removed from this legislation. Throughout the debate — I have listened carefully to many of the contributions — I have noted Members using the opportunity to highlight individual cases, but only negative cases, of course. Cases have been brought to my attention at various clinics. In dealing with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on certain items, I find that many of the simpler issues are often resolved very quickly, but from listening to the debate, one does not get that impression.The public will not thank the Oireachtas if we do not move to close off the loopholes in the system I note that in 2003 there were more than 128,000 non-nationals registered with the Garda Síochána. All these welcome visitors are incompliance with our immigration law and will be reassured by the enactment of this Bill, which will underpin the continued Garda registration of non-nationals. No one can object to the stating and clarification of the obligations on non-nationals to present themselves on arrival in the State to an immigration officer for leave to land. This measure is enforced internationally whenever we travel abroad, be it for business ortourism, to many states, especially outside the EU.People are expressing an interest in the list of powers by which, and circumstances in which, an immigration officer may refuse leave to land or grant permission to remain in the State, including the conditions under which the non-national is permitted to work for the duration of his or her stay. As legislators, we should support these basic operational controls.The power to check on non-nationals for evidence that they are permitted to be in the State, to charge them for breaches of that permission or for being illegally present in the State, and to arrest and detain them for such offences is an acceptable and essential part of the Bill for the enforcement of our immigration system. None of us should forget that all these elements have been part of Irish immigration law up to the present.I am interested in the points that other speakers made, although I was somewhat confused as to how some Opposition colleagues managed to misunderstand who was in the House at different times. That, however, is a distraction as far as this debate is concerned. I listened carefully to the discussion and formed the impression that people wanted to debate this legislation to a great extent and to spend as much time as possible doing so. If the public noted today's process, they might have been somewhat confused as to how we do our business.

I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on the Bill. Following the recent High Court judgment of 22 January, the Government must address urgently the immediate legislative requirements that have arisen.Many concerns have been expressed by various interest groups, and I have received much documentation from people who are genuinely committed to assisting the plight of non-nationals. Copies of submissions have been received from groups including Cairde, Challenging Ethnic Minority Health Inequalities, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism.What is restated in the Bill is what was thought to have been the law prior to the High Court decision of last week. The urgency arises from the fact that the validity of all statutory provisions dealing with the control of non-nationals' entry to, and their stay in, the State may now be called into question. We need not apologise for the speediness with which we are now act to put back in place what has been undermined by the recent court decision.A non-national has no right, as such, to come to or stay in this State without permission. The appointment of immigration officers, immigration controls on non-nationals entering or seeking to enter the State, the issuance of work permits, the provision of accommodation and literacy classes are all means we have put in place to give a fair chance to those who wish to establish themselves here legally.There was a certain irony in a recent story relating to my constituency. The small town of Borrisoleigh in north Tipperary was originally the home of Bishop Joseph Shanaghan, a renowned missionary who established many schools to educate people in Nigeria. In recent years, the people of Borrisoleigh have welcomed with open arms a large group of Nigerians who came to live in the area. The literacy skills they were provided with are indicative of the Government's commitment to ensure that people who genuinely need safety and care will be looked after.Concerns have been expressed about the Bill in the documentation provided to us. I will refer first to the NCCRI, which provides an example of the experience of racism that has been a reality for some non-nationals arriving at our airports. They have provided accounts of their experience of racism, which are unacceptable and unforgivable We must ensure that this will not recur. Unfortunately, such behaviour occurs in our streets at times, and it must be a very demeaning experience for non-nationals. However, to learn from these committed organisations that non-nationals have experienced this behaviour from officers of State agencies is unacceptable. I hope the issue will be addressed through the internal workings of the Department. I am glad that section 4(3)(c), under which entry could be refused to non-nationals with a disease or disability, will be removed by a Government amendment.As convenor of the Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, I am aware of all the work that has gone into the preparation of the legislation. The Bill covers the following areas of immigration law: the obligations on non-nationals to present themselves on arrival in the State to an immigration officer for leave to land; the power to, and circumstances in which, an immigration officer may refuse leave to land to a non-national; the power to attach conditions as to duration of stay and engagement in business, profession or employment to a permission to enter the State; the legal status of non-nationals present in the State, depending on whether they have a current permission; the obligation on non-nationals to comply with registration requirements while in the State; the obligation on hotels and other accommodation providers to keep a register of all non-nationals staying on their premises; the obligation on every person landing in the State to have a valid passport or other equivalent documentation; the obligation on non-nationals in the State to have a valid passport or registration certificate where they are registered under the Act; the power of arrest for offences under the Act; and the power to designate classes of persons who require a visa or transit visa.If a non-national arrives on our shores and is eventually deported, the average cost of the process is €20,000. The Bill is a common-sense measure to address the issue of immigration at the point of entry. It will establish clearly whether the non-national is legally entitled to come here. The carrier's liability legislation has already been put in place to address some aspects of the matter. Those who genuinely seek safety here should be accommodated, but we must be sensible also. Our objectives should be to reduce the costs and the workload involved in immigration procedures while looking after non-nationals who are genuinely in need.From the work of the Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, we can see the effectiveness of the procedures of the Department. A large number of employees in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform have been designated to serve the requirements of non-nationals here. I have every confidence that the Minister's commitment will continue. We have the right to protect our citizens from people with adversarial histories, and the Bill provides the means by which to do that.I compliment the Minister on his commitment to date. He is a person for whom I have the height of respect. He has proved himself on every occasion in committee to be fair and sensible and I am sure he will continue to be so as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I commend the Bill and urge that it move towards implementation without delay.

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	680	I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this Bill. This is no thanks to the Government which seems determined to stop people talking about it rather than to assist them. Earlier, I noticed the antics of a Fianna Fáil Deputy — Deputy O'Flynn — who stood and spoke for exactly one minute. Presumably, he was trying to cause the collapse of the debate. I do not know whether he was put up to it or whether the Minister was keen to end the debate.It is a pity we did not get to hear what Deputy O'Flynn has to say on this issue. We certainly heard what he had to say during the last general election in the city of Cork, and it was quite disturbing. It would be appropriate for him to come into the House and state his views on immigration in a way that leaves them open to record and scrutiny. Instead he spoke for a minute and tried to cause the collapse of the debate. Fortunately, he did not get away with it.An important challenge for all democratically elected representatives is to face the issue of racism wherever it rears its head. My fear, which does not come from this side of the House, is that some of those on the Government side will, under pressure, begin to use the race card at election time. The reality is simple. We debated emigration in Private Members' time the other night. I listened, sometimes with tears in my eyes, to what was being said about emigration from this country.Our emigrants have always been immigrants to some other country, nation and people. Now, our immigrants are emigrants from some under country. Until we get this into our heads, the distrust, ignorance and danger of racism will never be fully overcome. It is up to us to lead the way in whatever capacity we can.It is in our interest to ensure that we tackle the challenge presented by racism and immigration in a proactive way. I was interested to hear what Kofi Annan said the other day when he received the Andrei Sakharov prize at the EuropeanParliament. He made the important and simple point that a closed Europe would be meaner, poorer, weaker and older, whereas an open Europe would be fairer, richer, stronger and younger.We have just been debating the issue of care of the elderly. We need to see people coming into this country and making their contribution. Our economy is dependent on that kind of movement. We need only look at the US. Its economy could not have grown how it has without the inward movement of people to provide growth and economic activity. Our demographic trends are no different to any other European country. It is interesting that we have been able to benefit enormously from immigration in recent times. Ireland had some 300,000 people come into the country to work in the past six years, from all over Europe and the rest of the world. That is a staggering number of people. They are of value to us. They assist us in building our economy and prosperity.It is a pity this Bill is not about an immigration policy appropriate to our times. It is about plugging a hole created by the ineptitude of the previous Government. It is important to deal with the issue of immigration. This Bill is not dealing with it in any forward thinking or appropriate way. Will a serious effort be made to produce an immigration policy and legislation appropriate to these times? What we are getting at the moment is arrogant and thoughtless. It is a risky approach to the issue by the Minister.We all know the Bill arises because of a court judgment which found that the Government was not acting in a statutory manner and that the Aliens Order was invalid. The Government tried to do a patchwork job and brought in legislation deeming the order would have effect if it was an Act of the Oireachtas. This was rejected by the High Court. Now, instead of looking at the fundamental issues and ensuring our legislation is appropriate to our needs, we are attempting another kind of patch-up job.The Ireland of the Aliens Act 1935 is not the Ireland of today. Then, emigration was our overriding national experience. Now we can afford to welcome immigrants. We are bringing them in, welcome or not, on occasion. The tide has turned and this is a sign of growth and prosperity for us. What has happened is good and brings social, cultural, economic and even genetic benefits. We need to recognise that.Why did the Government not consult the Human Rights Commission about its concerns? The best expertise and advice available was not obtained. We have the embarrassing situation of the Human Rights Commission being critical of the legislation instead of having its advice and support of better legislation.As spokesperson for my party on health I want to concentrate on the section of the Bill that empowers an immigration officer to refuse people permission to land in Ireland on the grounds of their health. People are uneasy about this. I know this was already in the legislation. Obviously we must have safeguards, but be that as it may, there is something disturbing about the idea of saying, based on the word of an immigration officer, that somebody who suffers from a mental illness cannot land. Since when does an immigration officer have the diagnostic skills of a psychiatrist or psychologist? Psychiatrists themselves would admit they are not as great as that at their job.The Minister's amendment to the Schedule defines it some more when referring to conditions or grounds for refusal as "Profound mental disturbance, that is to say, manifest conditions of psychotic disturbance with agitation, delirium, hallucinations or confusion." Is the appropriate way to deal with a person arriving into the country in this condition to put him or her back on an aeroplane or boat? Is that what one does with a human being in that state? For all sorts of reasons many perfectly sane people are traumatised and confused but they are not psychotic. Many of us have delusions ——

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	687	I rise with a sense of déjà vu. I handled the justice spokesmanship for several years under the stewardship in Government of the previous Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, although I recognise the officials present as ones who served under him. The permanent Government goes on I suppose. I thought when I left that spokesmanship that I would not address the same issues again. What frustrated me most during my time handling justice issues was the handling of the new phenomenon in Ireland of asylum and the separate issues of immigration and integration. Our attitude since the phenomenon began has been botched. I hoped a different Minister would adopt a fresh approach, but the botched approach continues however and it is depressing to see it.There are very many fine, diligent and hard working civil and public servants involved in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I make no negative comment on any of them but I have something to say about the political head who is accountable to this House. In my experience, the modus operandi of the Department has invariably been to present legislation in a piecemeal fashion and to seek to amend it in the middle of debate by presenting sizeable chunks of amendment on critical issues, often after the conclusion of Second Stage. That the Department has no long-term strategic approach to fundamental issues is a political charge. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of the political head of the Department to approach its work with vision, a sense of compassion and understanding of the realities. While it is not my contention that there should not be amending legislation on foot of the High Court decision, the legislation before the House is not the appropriate response. That does not surprise me. What surprises and disappoints me greatly is that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform presents it.It is perhaps ten years since this country first encountered the new phenomenon to which I referred. Deputy Cassidy spoke of how wonderful the great Celtic tiger was and how we could all share in it. He gave everyone in the House a degree of acknowledgement for our common endeavours in making Ireland an attractive place to which to come. God knows it was not an attractive place for a very long time for a variety of reasons. We decanted our human surplus across the globe in a manner which we addressed in a Private Members' debate no later than last week. We all cried crocodile tears. I remember in my early days in this House debates on how to legitimise the 100,000 young Irish illegals in the United States of America. I remember when the job of the current Taoiseach and others was to go on deputations to ply as best they could our influence with our friends on Capitol Hill. How quickly we forget.There are three issues involved which are related but distinct. The first of these is asylum. We still do not have a co-ordinated, clear, manifestly fair asylum seeking strategy which deals effectively and efficiently with all asylum seekers.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	689	That is a point of view. I say that after years of effort — none of us has put such a system in place. We do not have a rational immigration strategy which takes account of the many people who come to our shores who are not asylum seekers. While they will tell one that honestly, no other avenue is open to them but to apply for asylum in the clear knowledge that it will not be granted. It is better than the alternative of staying where they are. They try to better themselves as millions of Irish people have done for generations, but we have no rational green card system to determine the skills base and the national base of people who should be allowed to come here and work. Instead, we have applied a sort of serfdom which allows employers in too many cases with which I am personally familiar to bring people here and use and abuse them. I am not accusing all employers but those who are guilty do this on the basis that it is they who have the permits in their fists rather than the immigrants who will face deportation if they fail to toe the line. We still have not addressed that issue after all the years of talking.In a document which was fair, though far from perfect, I addressed the issues many years ago and outlined the third strand of a rational approach. It was an anti-racism integration strategy which would have provided communities with the resources to integrate and prepare for multi-cultural, multi-racial and multi-religious Ireland. For all the talk about committees and moneys, we have still not done the job effectively. I am aware of the plight of desperate people. I do not live too far from the port of Rosslare. I was one of the first people to arrive at Kerlogue Industrial Estate on the bright Saturday morning a container was opened which was full of corpses. I will never forget that morning nor will the ambulance crews and those who dealt with it. The local parish priest still recalls the incident by which he is indelibly scarred.These are the realities of dealing with measures like this. While we have done much important work to prevent that sort of trafficking in people, the plight of desperate people must be recognised. All Europe has a moral obligation to provide people with the hope that they can apply to be legitimised, which is what millions of Irish people sought for generations. I wish I had more time to develop my points as to why this legislation is depressing. I have endless files deriving from my spokesmanship on this area containing letters dating back to 1998 which cover the same issues that arise today and in which the previous Minister said exactly the same things the current Minister is saying. It is profoundly disappointing. That we do not have anything fresh, new, fair and distinctly Irish and unique to say on these matters is deeply annoying.We are here tonight because what I predicted in this House in 1999 has come to pass. In the landmark case of Laurentiu v. the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the High Court struck down that part of section 5(1) which dealt with the deportation and exclusion of what were then called “aliens”. As the Government is doing now, the Governmentof the time rushed legislation through the House in a knee-jerk response to the High Court judgment. The consequences were highly predictable. I told the House that the section was at odds with the principles enunciated by Mr. Justice Geoghegan to the effect that the Minister could not make primary law by way of statutory instrument. Yet, that is what he insisted on doing. I told him it would be struck down. The Minister, his officials and the then Attorney General, now an EU Commissioner, felt that what I was saying was wrong, yet what Ipredicted has come to pass. We are back again with another fix-it Bill. I would have no difficulty with that if there was a genuine promise to introduce comprehensive and over-arching legislation.In the typical departmental way, they bring in all the measures reminiscent of the original 1935 Act that has its origins in First World War legislation and thought processes.It is profoundly disappointing that we are back doing the same business. It is upsetting beyond measure that a Minister who promised so much about being a genuinely fresh mind in an extremely difficult Department with a challenging issue to deal with regurgitates the same old attitude that will have a negative impact on so many people's lives. I wish that this Bill were withdrawn and that a smaller one were enacted to plug the gap, allowing us the time and space, with compassion and broadness and mind, to introduce important legislation to deal with these issues.

I compliment Deputy Hoctor, a new Deputy, on her caring, compassionate and understanding speech. It is good to hear a new Member make such a speech. It is easy to go with the crowd and pick up all the prejudices. One goes along with them and says that we must be careful about allowing too many people into the country since it will make life difficult for the rest of us.More than any nation on the face of the earth, we have a duty to recognise where we came from and all those times that we bade goodbye to our people as they fled our shores. They did so for economic reasons rather than because they had done something wrong. It was simply because they could not afford to live in their homeland. More than any other nation, we should be compassionate and recognise that there are others now who have the same problems and must leave home because of economics. While I fully recognise that there must be some controls in Europe, we should not allow ourselves to over-indulge in them simply to accommodate prejudice, since that is always with us, whether we like it or not.In recent days, we have been concerned about the urgency with which it was proposed to rush this legislation through the House. Urgent legislation rushed through has a bad record. On every occasion that has happened, we have paid a price. I do not blame the Minister or anyone else, since the previous legislation was struck down in the courts. Like it or not, a comment was made to the effect that we in this House did not discuss all the legislation's implications adequately. That is our fault, and there is no excuse for it. For as long as I have been in the House, we have always had an opportunity to discuss adequately all the legislation that came before us. Any time that there was interference with the time taken to discuss legislation, we ran into trouble. I am disappointed that we do not have that small period of extra time. It would be helpful. I know that the Minister also has constraints, but that is life. Constraints effect everyone from time to time.My family and the families of other Members had to leave this country's shores to seek a living abroad. Nobody in the countries to which they emigrated put up barriers or said that they could not come or were not welcome on their shores. As previous speakers have said, it is not that long — only in the past 15 years — since we tried to ensure that Irish people in the United States could remain there. Now that we have a different economic climate, we see headlines in some of the newspapers saying that 170,000 eastern Europeans are about to descend on our shores. There is a grave danger that those headlines will do what they are intended to do: rough up and encourage prejudice that is barely under the surface. If we take that route, we will do a grave disservice, not only to those who will be thevictims but also to this country and its reputation.I recognise that we have been given extra time tomorrow until 3.30 p.m. to discuss Committee Stage of the Bill. I hope that we get it right this time and that it is fair and does a fair and compassionate job. We should not try to show the rest of the world how tough we are. We cannot afford to show it anything other than it showed us in the past — hospitality.

The power being given to immigration officials to turn back non-nationals with a disability is reminiscent of the Third Reich's eugenics and testing for racial purity. It smacks of the Aryan policy of racial perfection. Without anyone having a blemish or weakness, they are regarded as non-persons or non-human for immigration policy. At its core, it strips people of their personhood and dignity. It also shines some light into the dark recesses of the Government's mental health policy in Ireland. We have now reached the position where, unless one has utility in economic terms, one is regarded as an irritant. That so-called economic model certainly does not embrace the full spectrum of society. Such thinking has serious implications morally, socially and economically. However, the Government does not have the guts to come out and say it.To carry this to its logical conclusion, does it mean that anyone of low economic value should not have access to health, housing or education? Singling out non-nationals with a proscribed disease or intellectual disability would have reduced last year's Special Olympics to a shambles. How many of the competitors from all over the world would have been permitted to enter Ireland had our mental police been on duty at our airports? Last summer, we all basked in the reflected glory of the heroics of the world's special competitors and their achievements. The Government made a great show of its compassion and concern for the special olympians and promenaded in Croke Park in front of the world's media. However, its attitude to the disabled as enunciated in this Bill amounts to a gratuitous insult and is utterly unacceptable in a so-called enlightenedsociety.I acknowledge that the Minister has responsibility for immigration control, but to single out one group is venturing into dangerous waters. That was the policy of Hitler and dictators down the centuries. The Bill's provision to debar non-nationals convicted of offences in other states is another McCarthy-style attack on the vulnerable. Placing the onus on householders to report and register non-nationals resident there is also reminiscent of witch hunts. If someone were convicted in Mugabe's Zimbabwe of bad-mouthing the beloved leader, would he or she be debarred from entering Ireland? In effect, the Bill reintroduces the Aliens Act and does not reflect immigration rights. It does not take too much account of the huddled masses yearning to be free.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	700	The haste in which the Minister is pushing this Bill through Dáil Éireann is not just indecent but obscene. The Government, when it comes to targeting the vulnerable, cannot hasten enough. However, when it comes to targeting the landlords, the financiers or the legal robbers of the people of this State, we have no such haste.Owing to lack of time, I will go immediately to the most repugnant sections of this Bill, sections 9(2)(c), (d) and (e), which state that a non-national shall comply with the following requirements as to registration:(c) he or she shall, if about to change his or her residence, furnish to the registration officer for the registration district in which he or she is then resident particulars as to the date on which his or her residence is to be changed and as to his or her intended place of residence;(d) on effecting any change of residence from one registration district to another, he or she shall, within 48 hours of his or her arrival in the other registration district report his or her arrival to the registration officer for that district;Section 9(3) is the worst part of this section. It states that if a non-national has no residence, meaning no fixed abode — his or her regular residence, if you like — he or she shall attend at the office of a registration officer and, so far as possible, supply the particulars that would be required under this section if he or she were resident in the district of that officer, and shall report to the registration officer for any other district in which he or she stays for more than 24 hours.The last place provisions such as this were notoriously enforced was Stalinist Russia.

It was notorious for visitors from abroad, so-called aliens or non-nationals. To find a Minister, who probably deludes himself into thinking he is a paradigm of liberalism of some sort, imposing a provision such as this is quite incredible, but worse is to come. Section 9(4) beggars belief. It states:If a non-national who is required under this section to register or report is lodging with, or living as a member of the household of, any other person, it shall be the duty of that person to take steps (either by giving notice to the registration officer of the presence of the non-national in his or her household or otherwise) to secure compliance with the terms of the Act.This is quite incredible. A non-national may be lodging in a flat with a few other Irish workers and the Minister is turning them into policemen for the State. This is not the Stalinism of the 1970s or the 1980s, but of the 1930s. It is quite incredible. Fortunately, I could not go to Stalinist Russia when it was in its hard-line phase because with my philosophy of democratic socialism, I possibly would not have come out safely. I went there shortly after it fell and they still had some of the bad habits——

This will be carried on by the gardaí who will have the right to go into a hotel or otherwise where non-nationals are staying and demand to look at the register and to take it with them. It is absolutely incredible. They will be able to arrest non-nationals without warrant. This means pinpointing people living on this island on a racial basis. That is, in practice, what it will come down to. Gardaí will not approach every white person on the street but one can be sure people of a different colour will immediately be singled out as being non-national and subject to these checks.This notoriously resembles what used to happen on the underground in France, and possibly still does. Fleets of special police move in to target immigrants which means targeting people of different colours. It is absolutely incredible that the Minister, who fancies himself as a liberal, would push this kind of legislation through under the guise of controlling, or regulating, immigration in this State.I ask the Minister to think again about these reprehensible and noxious provisions included in this Bill. If he wants to bring in a Bill regulating, or providing for, people who are not born in this State residing here, that is fine. He can bring it before the House, we can have a proper debate on it and the same democratic provisions can be open to them as are open to everybody else. The Minister should not scapegoat them in this noxious way by including such provisions in theBill, and I have only had time to point out afew.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	705	I thank all the Deputies for the interesting contributions they made to this debate. I have taken everything I have heard on board. I profoundly disagreed with some of it but found I totally agreed with other parts. I have welcomed — in my own mind at any rate — the breadth of views expressed on this legislation. Many Deputies said they wished they were discussing different legislation — broader, more fundamental and comprehensive immigration law such as that which is promised in the programme for Government — as do I. I wish I was bringing forward that Bill and not this one, but circumstances are different.We live in a democracy and one of its features is that any person, even those who are not citizens, can go to the High Court at any stage and can challenge the validity of any Act, or provision of an Act, which has been passed by the Oireachtas. If the High Court condemns such a provision by reference to the Constitution, it immediately falls — the lever kicked and the trap door is open. There is no argument. One cannot go to the Supreme Court saying one wants to make a case to it in three weeks' time, asking that the legislation be saved in the meantime, asking it to say what the High Court said may not be correct and saying that it would be more administratively convenient to carry on as heretofore. That is not the system we have; we have a different system which is more thoroughgoing and radical. This is the only country in Europe where such a system obtains.Sometimes we hear in this House that we have a system which is more draconian, less citizen-friendly or human rights-friendly. This is the only republic in the European Union in which a citizen or non-citizen can go to the courts and ask that any Act of Parliament be knocked down immediately without any recourse on appeal as to the immediate effectiveness of a High Court judgment.

Let us remember that. I welcome the fact we live in such a democracy. Sometimes when I hear criticisms of our legal system and our constitutional order, I think people should remember that it is the right of anyone, citizen or non-citizen, to go to our courts and to challenge any legislation in these circumstances.The Attorney General, as is his right in an adversarial system, is about to appeal this decision on behalf of the Government and bring it to the Supreme Court. There will be a Supreme Court hearing sooner rather than later but in the meantime, I am faced with a situation I think all Deputies fully understand, which is, that in large areas dealing with the control of non-nationals, there is no effective law at the moment. That places a moral obligation on me to take immediate steps to remedy that situation in circumstances in which I prefer not to have to do so.We owe it to the European Union to be in a position to protect our fellow member states from a situation where we have no law for the regulation of non-nationals. We owe it, in particular, to the United Kingdom with whom we have a common travel area and many things in common, including the right to travel without identity documents of any kind between one state and another. We owe it to them to have some system whereby we can say to them, as we would expect them to say to us, that non-nationals in either country are subject to some form of regulation. Above all, we owe it to ourselves as a sovereign state to have in place some system whereby we exercise our democratic sovereign right to say who does and does not come in, for how long and so on. We must have a system of that kind.I fully defer to the view of Members that it would be preferable in an ideal world for the House to have weeks and months to consider these matters. I do not live in such an ideal world but in a slightly different one in which our constitutional guarantees mean a High Court judgment can be handed to my officials while working hard in the middle of an EU conference, having spent hours and weeks preparing for that process because it was centred on migration issues. They were suddenly placed in a totally different, inverted world and asked to work on a legislative response to the High Court decision because one was required. They worked hard for hours over a weekend to develop a text for the House. While the text introduced in the House was not perfect, as the officials in question and I would be the first to admit, we must do our level best to get the best law possible in the current circumstances because there is a legislative process. If we had another month to consider the matter, there is no doubt that we would find many aspects of the text which could improved or that little ideas would occur to many Deputies to improve the text.We do not live in that perfect world. I live in the real world in which I must inform the Garda national immigration bureau tomorrow whether it has powers. In the great majority of cases, it does not have any of the powers which are normal and conventional in a European Union member state. I, and every Member of the House, regardless of his or her views on migration or ideological issues, owe a duty to the Garda national immigration bureau to provide it with a law it can operate in short order.It has been suggested that this is an appalling text. The officials in my Department, who have worked long and hard, took the perfectly predictable and straightforward approach, namely, they replicated in as far as possible the pre-existing law. Incidentally, that legislation allowed all the participants in the Special Olympics, the asylum seekers currently in the State and all those with psychological and psychiatric problems who have entered the State for medical treatment to come here.The High Court did not state the legislation was out of order but that it was mechanically flawed in the way Deputy Howlin had apparently predicted in 1999 when I was not a Member of the House.

It is one issue if certain matters are imperfect from a point of view of policy, but if someone tells me I am infringing fundamental constitutional rights and doing something constitutionally impermissible and I or my officials agreed or I was advised to that effect, we would stop the process immediately and take a different approach.In listening to the debate and the public comment which has taken place since the law was struck down by the High Court, we have been careful to distinguish between arguments concerning the merits of policy issues and those related to fundamental civil liberties and the rule of constitutional law. We have taken all the arguments on board and carefully measured this legislation as best we can to address those fundamental difficulties in the current difficult circumstances.There is a race, a trade-off in this circumstance, between the time available to us, on the one hand — I agree with Opposition speakers that in principle the more time available the better because law tends to improve on reflection — and, on the other, the fact that our police and immigration officials are left with no law to administer. If Marc Dutroux walked through the immigration section of Dublin Airport or Sean Evans walked into the Chamber tomorrow, it would have moral implications. My point in saying this is that I do not live in a moral vacuum which would allow me to tell my officials to spend three weeks preparing the legislation because it is no skin off anybody's nose. Ihave to live in the real world in which not acting is as potentially immoral as acting and delay is just as bad as precipitate, ill-thought out reaction.A sub-current in a number of contributions — not, I am grateful to note, the majority — was a fundamental suggestion that migration and asylum seeking, on the one hand, and illegal migration on the other hand, form part of a moral stew in which it is impossible to distinguish them and, therefore, it is pointless to try to attempt to do so politically. I agree with Labour Party speakers that the biggest threat to society is the possibility that racism will be played as a political card. The most potentweapon to hand to would-be abusers of the race card is to have a system of law which is not effective and in which people argue that legislators have let them down, migration controls are ineffective and nobody is responding adequately to people who should not be here entering the State.It is not the case, therefore, that the legislative measures I have taken through the House since my appointment as Minister are racist in undertone. On the contrary, they are necessary to maintain the integrity of our immigration laws. Those who would have us have ineffectual laws in this area would play straight into the hands of an emergent hard right which would do immense damage to society, particularly migrants, and social cohesion.

If I do not make that distinction, the public will make it and it will play straight into the hands of extremists who will capitalise on it and use it to divide society.

I tried to raise the issue by means of Standing Order 31 yesterday and I raised the matter of building site safety with the Taoiseach on the Order of Business today. I made specific reference this morning to the widespread disruption caused to commuters using the DART by the collapse of a crane on the Barrow Street building site in Ringsend, sometimes known as the gasometer site.Those most affected by this incident were the residents of Barrow Street, Upper Grand Canal Street and Emerald Cottages, who had to spend three nights away from home in the Mespil Hotel or in the company of relatives and friends. The residents with whom I have spoken have been very complimentary about the staff of the Mespil Hotel, who went out of their way to make the displaced residents very welcome indeed. It has been a difficult number of days for the residents, however. Some of them who work from home have lost three working days as a consequence of this incident. Others have been simply inconvenienced. I pay tribute to the Garda Síochána, the fire brigade, the health and safety officers and the many people on the building site who dealt courteously with the residents.I would like to ask a number of fundamental questions this evening. The crane collapsed at approximately 11 a.m. on Sunday morning and I arrived on the scene at approximately 1 p.m. I noticed at that stage that gardaí were warning people that they were in imminent danger and asked them to vacate their homes. Residents have asked why they were required to do so, given that businesses in the area, such as Session Hire, GTS and Thomson Travel, continued to operate.The most fundamental question, which I intend to pursue in this House by other means, relates to who is responsible for picking up the tab for the disruption. It is obvious that thousands of commuters, who were unable to get to the city because of the closure of the DART line near Barrow Street, were unable to get to work on time in the usual manner. Other expenses were incurred by the employment of extra gardaí to seal off the street. Payments had to be made to the Dublin fire brigade, which was quickly on the scene, and to health and safety officers who had to assess the situation. A Garda escort was required for the two extra cranes that had to be hired to make safe the damaged crane. These services will have to be paid for. Where does the liability lie?A thorough investigation is needed by the Garda and the health and safety authorities if we are to determine what went wrong in this case. Did the crane driver leave the brake on, as many people suspect? Was the crane up to standard? A separate recent incident involving a crane in Tallaght did not have fatal consequences, thankfully. When one considers the amount of building work taking place in our city, it is only a matter of time before there are "civilian" fatalities, if I can use that word, as a consequence of some accident. One need only examine the location of cranes to imagine what could happen if a crane were to topple on to houses. The cranes on the Barrow Street site are towering over residential areas. It is natural that many residents are worried, in light of this incident, about what might happen in the future. They have already experienced noise, excessive light, dust and dirt from the site. Only this evening I was informed by residents at a meeting that on 16 December last year lorries blocked the footpath and residents tried in turn to block the lorries. They have also had difficulties with green space in the area being taken up by the builders.We need strong legislation and regulations to deal with the issue of building control which I raised this morning. The residents are only too aware of recent fatalities on building sites on which the same property developer operated and they are concerned about lax standards. This morning I asked the Taoiseach when he will ensure that the highest standards are maintained on our building sites. Greater investment in safety and less emphasis on profit are needed. Higher standards could mean taking more time and, as they say in the trade, time is money.Is it not time the Government began to take this issue seriously? I am well aware of the close connection between the Government parties and the building trade and I know these property developers can often be seen in the Fianna Fáil tent at the Galway Races. Is this not one case in which people must come before profit? I hope this incident will not be quickly forgotten and that the Government will act.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	732	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment. The responsibilities of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Health and Safety Authority in this matter relate to the provisions of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989 and the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Construction) Regulations 2001. It should be noted that other statutory bodies, including the Garda Síochána and the fire services, were involved in responding to this incident and in its aftermath. The role of the Health and Safety Authority represents only one element of any general emergency response.The Health and Safety Authority was notified on Sunday, 1 February 2004 that the jib of a crane had become destabilised at a building site off Barrow Street in Ringsend. The fire services and the Garda were already on site when a Health and Safety Authority inspector arrived. Gardaí had advised certain residents in the vicinity of the incident to vacate their homes until the crane was made safe. DART and other transport services on the adjacent rail line were also suspended on grounds of safety. The immediate concern of the Health and Safety Authority was to ensure that the crane was dismantled with the minimum possible risk to the safety of essential workers on site and also taking into account the safety of the public in the vicinity of the site. Consequently, inspectors of the authority have been on site at the location of the incident since Sunday.Although a method of stabilising the crane was identified on Monday, 2 February, adverse weather conditions prevented the work of stabilisation beginning and it was not possible to carry out the operation safely until last night, Tuesday, 3 February. The crane has now been stabilised, allowing the return of local residents in the vicinity to their homes and the recommencement of DART transport services in the area. The operation of dismantling the crane will proceed as soon as weather conditions allow.When the crane is safely dismantled, the Health and Safety Authority will undertake a detailed investigation into the circumstances of the incident, taking into account the requirements of relevant legislation, including the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989 and the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Construction) Regulations 2001. This investigation will focus on establishing the reasons for the failure of the crane jib. Deputies will understand that I cannot comment further on the particulars of this matter or speculate on possible causes or factors pending the outcome of that investigation and any possible action that may be necessary. Costs for inconvenience and disruption do not come within the sphere of responsibility of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment or the Health and Safety Authority. These are civil matters that can be pursued in the normal way with the people responsible for the crane and its operation.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	733	I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for the opportunity of raising this matter on the Adjournment. I am, however, disappointed that the Minister for Education and Science is not here to respond. It is an important issue and a personal issue for the family involved. The case concerns a young boy whose family are seeking financial support for him to attend a special grammar school in England. The boy is profoundly deaf. He is academically excellent. The Leiter intellectual performance scale has indicated his non-verbal intellectual functioning to be within the superior range. His previous school reports stated that he was not being challenged intellectually in the group system that was operating in his former school. It was considered by his former class teacher that he was not fulfilling his educational potential because of the existing system in the school. Neither was the necessary educational support made available for him to attend a hearing mainstream school. His parents faced the prospect of allowing him to remain in his former school, although all the indicators from his class teacher were that he would not reach his potential.At great personal cost, his parents transferred him to the Mary Hare grammar school in England, where he has consistent A or B grades in all his subjects. His parents have no criticism of the individual teachers in his former school. It is simply the case that the school does not meet the requirements of their son. In a group of mixed ability, some members of which had learning difficulties, he was frustrated and not achieving his potential. If he were to be placed in a mainstream school in Ireland he would need two sign language interpreters. The cost of providing interpreters would be equivalent to the fee being paid in the Mary Hare school so, from the point of view of the Department of Education and Science, the cost would be broadly the same.The family is suffering severe financial strain. They are concerned about meeting the cost of keeping their son in school in England. This boy deserves the chance of achieving his intellectual potential. It is unacceptable that his parents must suffer severe financial strain to provide him with an appropriate education, to which he is entitled. I ask the Minister to consider favourably the request to assist with funding for this boy so that he can remain in the school. There, he is intellectually challenged and his talents are recognised. He is happy and has made friends. It is not ideal that any family should be obliged to send their 13 year old son to school in England, away from his friends and family, but they have been forced to make financial and personal sacrifices to give their son an opportunity to achieve his potential.On the basis of equality, this boy is entitled to be given the best available opportunity, which is not available to him in Ireland. His parents, with the advice of his former class teacher, have succeeded in obtaining a place for him in an appropriate school that meets his educational requirements. I ask the Minister to look favourably on the request to fund this boy's education so that he may have the same opportunities as his peers. The cost of keeping him in school is in the order of £12,000 sterling per term. This is an unbearable financial burden on the family. I ask the Minister to consider this request.

The issue raised by the Deputy provides a welcome opportunity for me to inform the House of the range of assistance provided by the Department of Education and Science for children with special educational needs, including those with a hearing impairment. Up to October 1998, the Department's capacity to respond to individual children with special needs was limited. This changed with a Government decision in October 1998 whereby children assessed as having special educational needs in primary schools have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs. Since this automatic entitlement to support was introduced, the number of resource teachers in the primary system has increased from approximately 100 to more than 2,500 and the number of special needs assistants has grown from approximately 300 to almost 5,500 full-time and part-time posts.The nature and level of the educational response is based on the professionally assessed needs of each child. While the Department's policy is to ensure the maximum possible integration of pupils with special needs into ordinary mainstream schools, those who have been assessed as having special educational needs have access to a range of special support services. The services range from special schools dedicated to particular disability groups, through special classes and units attached to ordinary schools, to placement on an integrated basis in ordinary schools, with special back-up supports. The response will normally take the form of resource teacher or special needs assistant support, or both, depending on the level of need involved.I understand that the student in question was enrolled in St. Joseph's special school for hearing-impaired boys in Cabra. St. Joseph's caters for pupils with hearing impairment, both at primary and post-primary level. The pupil teacher ratio applicable to the school is 7:1 which is as recommended by the special education review committee. The actual pupil teacher ratio in the school is more favourable than this figure. I understand that the parents of the student withdrew him from the school.I also understand an application was made last year to the Department to fund an educational placement abroad for the student in question. This issue was investigated by the Department's inspectorate and following on from this investigation, a letter issued to the students parents advising that the placement in Cabra was considered appropriate and that the Department would not be making funding available for the person's attendance at an education facility in the United Kingdom.More recently, the parents of the student in question appealed the Department of Education and Science's decision and the additional information they provided is being considered. I assure the Deputy that the parents will be advised of the outcome of this review in the near future.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	735	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this issue.I welcome the national parasuicide registry's report which was launched by the Minister for Health and Children on Monday. I congratulate Professor Ivan J. Perry, director of the national parasuicide registry and the National Suicide Research Foundation in Cork, and his staff on the report.In 2002, there were 10,337 parasuicide presentations at accident and emergency departments in hospitals in the State. Of this figure, 8,421 individuals were involved. Of the 8,304 recorded presentations at accident and emergency departments, 42.3% were men and 57.7% were women. Parasuicide episodes were generally confined to younger age groups. Slightly under 90% of them were by people less than 50 years of age. In most age groups, the number of parasuicide acts by women exceeded the number by men. This was most pronounced in the ten to 19 year old group where there were 2.4 times as many as self-harm acts by women. To illustrate this, there were 458 parasuicides by men and 1,094 by women. The ratio of completed suicides of men to women is 5:1. The only notable exception to this female preponderance were in the 25 to 34 year age group where there were almost equal numbers of episodes involving men and women.I want to impress upon the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O'Malley, that investment in research to know why this is happening is vital if we are to deal with the problem. Up to 257 parasuicides were by residents of homes and hostels, 102 by in-patients in psychiatric hospitals and 32 by prisoners. Repeated acts of self-harm represent a significant problem. In 2002, one in five of those who attempted to take their lives were repeat acts. The development and delivery of interventions for this difficult patient group must be prioritised by the Department.Parasuicide is an increasing problem in Ireland. Each of the five health board areas from which substantial data were collected in 2001 experienced increases in the number of individuals and episodes of parasuicide treated in hospital in 2002. Rates among women are approximately 40% higher than among men. Every possible research facility should be given to the National Suicide Research Foundation to ascertain why this is occurring because only then will we be able to deal with the issue. Rates are particularly high among young people, with 90% of all presentations under 50 years of age. While the male peak rate for parasuicide is between 20 and 24 years of age at 407 per 1,000, the peak rate for women is between 15 and 19 years of age, at 626 per 1,000. The high rate of deliberate self-harm in adolescent girls poses a particular problem for the health services, as individuals in this group may fall between the child and adult mental health services. We need to know why girls between 15 and 19 years of age have such a high rate of self-harm.Compared to the national rate, the incidence of parasuicide were significantly higher for men residing in the Midland and Mid-Western Health Board areas and the Eastern Regional Health Authority area. Rates of parasuicide are higher in urban than in rural areas. This is the opposite to completed suicides which tend to be more prevalent in rural areas.I ask the Department to provide funding for research into parasuicide incidence and introduce ways to reduce the level of self-harm among young men and women.

This important project is carried out by the National Suicide Research Foundation. Parasuicide is increasing in this country and repeated acts of self-harm represent a significant problem.International studies have found parasuicide to be one of the most significant risk factors associated with suicide. Those who engage in self-harm are 20 times more likely to eventually die by suicide. Studies have shown that at least one third of all suicides have a history of parasuicide. To this end, the National Suicide Research Foundation launched the national parasuicide registry. It is now close to achieving its aim to establish the extent of the problem of hospital-reported parasuicide in Ireland. The findings in this report indicate that approximately 8,400 individuals presented to hospital due to deliberate self-harm in 2002. The development and delivery of interventions for this patient group is a priority for the health services.The national parasuicide registry provides information on the general characteristics of people who attempt suicide. It also provides a better knowledge of suicidal behaviour and specifies trends in parasuicide over time and in different regions. The analysis of this information will be vital in the development of policies and the implementation of measures aimed at preventing suicide.The report highlights the challenge that deliberate self-harm and suicide prevention poses for our health system and our society as a whole. The work of the registry will also be very useful in the allocation of resources. It will help identify groups which are particularly vulnerable and will assist health boards to evaluate the impact of the preventive and clinical services being provided.We cannot ignore or be complacent about the growing incidence of self-harm and suicide. Suicide prevention is an issue with which we must all concern ourselves. Since the publication of the report of the National Task Force on Suicide in 1998, there has been a positive and committed response from both the statutory and voluntary sectors towards finding ways of tackling the tragic problem of suicide. In response to the recommendations of the task force, the National Suicide Review Group was established by the health boards and membership of the group includes experts in the areas of mental health, public health and research.Health boards, in particular, have a major role to play in co-ordinating efforts to help reduce the level of suicide and parasuicide in this country. In this regard, resource officers have been appointed in all the health boards with specific responsibility for implementing the task force's recommendations. There are also numerous regional initiatives being run by the health boards in conjunction with non-statutory organisations, which focus on mental health issues like stress management, depression, stigma reduction and suicide-related matters. These are issues of paramount importance which require further attention to ensure that positive mental health and the well-being of people is promoted.The national suicide review group and the Health Boards Executive, HeBE, together with my Department, have commenced work on the preparation of a new national action-oriented strategy for suicide prevention. It is important to stress that this proposed strategy will be action-based from the outset as it will build on existing policy as outlined in the national task force on suicide's report of 1998.My Department has given special attention in recent years to the resourcing of suicide prevention initiatives. Since the publication of the report of the national task force on suicide in 1998, a cumulative total in excess of €13 million has been provided towards suicide prevention programmes and for research. This includes funding to support the work of the national suicide review group, the Irish Association of Suicidology and the National Suicide Research Foundation for its work in the development of a national parasuicide register.Significant additional funding has also been made available to develop further child and adolescent psychiatry, adult psychiatry and old age psychiatry services to assist in the early identification of suicidal behaviour and to provide the necessary support and treatment to individuals at risk. My Department also supports the ongoing work of many organisations, such as Mental Health Ireland, Grow, AWARE and Schizophrenia Ireland, in raising public awareness of mental health issues.I share the public concern about the level of parasuicides and suicides in this country. It is a worrying trend and I am fully committed to the further implementation of suicide prevention initiatives and the further development of our mental health services.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	741	I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this issue, which was the subject of several letters I received recently. A couple came to see me over the weekend to discuss the issue because they are frustrated at the lack of progress in this area.On 31 December 2002 Vietnam was closed to Ireland for adoptions and the only way to re-open the channels was to sign a new bilateral agreement between Ireland and Vietnam. That agreement was signed last September, yet hundreds of couples are still waiting to adopt children. The process has been delayed since last September by the need for the President of Vietnam to sign off on the agreement and for our Department of Health and Children to do the same. There were promises that both Governments would have signed off on the bilateral agreement before the end of last year, and there was great concern when that had not happened by the time we moved into 2004. On 7 January Vietnam signed off on the agreement, so it has nothing further to do to ensure adoptions can proceed. The only obstacle now is the Department of Health and Children because it has not signed off on the agreement.Some Irish couples have been waiting up to three years to finalise their adoption procedures to bring children into their homes. Adopting a child from as far away as Vietnam is a long, drawn-out process, and if it is the case that the Department, the Government or any other body in Ireland is stalling the process, will the Minister of State ensure that that stalling ends as quickly as possible? The utter frustration some of the parents have expressed to me is unacceptable, especially if there is no valid reason for the continued delay.The situation is so bad that some parents' police clearance certificates and health certificates, which they obtained during the long adoption assessment process, will be out of date soon as they only last for six months. One couple has had to obtain health certificates three times to be up to date in anticipation of the agreement being signed off.I am not interested in scoring political points. I want factual answers. Why is the process still being delayed? Will the Minister of State confirm that the Vietnamese have done all they need to do? Will the Minister of State give me a firm date for the resolution of this problem, as the Department told us it would be done early in the new year and it is now February? Families are waiting for children and children are waiting for families. Can we move this process on, fast-tracking it, if necessary? If there is a valid reason for the delay, the Minister of State should outline it because parents deserve to know it at this stage.
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	742	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and am pleased to reply on behalf of the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children with special responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan.The Minister of State has taken a number of initiatives on adoption since coming into office. Work was already ongoing within the Department on legislation on adoption, one provision dealing with inter-country adoption and the establishment of the Adoption Authority and the other on the provision of adoption information and related issues. While there had been some public consultation on aspects of these proposals, the Minister decided that, in view of the huge changes in attitudes since the enactment of the primary adoption legislation in 1952, there was a need to examine the area of adoption with a view to developing new approaches for the future. A broad public consultation was held last year covering all aspects of adoption, including a successful oral consultation in October. The results of this consultation process are being examined and it is hoped that proposals will be ready for submission to Government in late spring.In recent years there have been changes in adoption trends and the growth of adoption by Irish parents of children from other countries in particular has been a significant development. One of the issues raised during the consultation process was inter-country adoption and the overwhelming consensus was that Ireland should move to ratify the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Intercountry Adoption. The Hague Convention provides a child-centred basis on which to provide for inter-country adoption and is of particular importance in ensuring that the best interests of the child are kept to the forefront in all decisions made. The proposals submitted to Government will include proposals for ratification of the Hague Convention.In the meantime much work has been done by health boards and the Adoption Board to ensure that existing practices are carried out in accordance with the high standards set by the Hague Convention. The introduction of the standardised framework for assessment for inter-country adoption was a major step forward in this regard and one which was welcomed by parents, support groups and practitioners. The standardised framework is now in use throughout the country.Some of the countries from which we adopt prefer to operate on the basis of a bilateral agreement. The Adoption Board has entered into working arrangements with the authorities in Thailand, China, Belarus and the Philippines. In the past we had a state-to-state agreement with Romania but, due to concerns about whether the best interests of children were being properly looked after, Romania has suspended inter-country adoptions and is working to draft new legislation to ensure best practice.The Vietnamese authorities decided that, from the end of 2002, adoptions would only be allowed to countries with which a bilateral agreement was in place. During 2002 the Adoption Board tried to develop such an agreement, but the Vietnamese authorities wished to have an agreement at state level. The Minister of State, Deputy Lenihan, contacted the Irish ambassador and, in March last year, a delegation headed by the ambassador to Malaysia and Vietnam negotiated a bilateral agreement on inter-country adoption.Both Ireland and Vietnam signed the agreement and Vietnam ratified it on 7 January 2004.The Adoption Board has been working with its counterparts in Vietnam to set up the practical arrangements and procedures for Vietnamese adoptions. In the meantime, the Department of Foreign Affairs is examining options to enable ratification of the agreement by the State as soon as possible. Under the terms of the agreement, adoptions can recommence 30 days after Ireland has ratified the agreement.As this is a state-to-state agreement, the terms have to be examined very closely to ensure that the State can meet its international obligations. The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, is confident that we will be in a position to ratify the agreement soon, following completion of the necessary work within the two Departments.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	743	The designation of voluntary activity support units, VAUs, in relevant Departments to support the relationship between the State and the community and voluntary sector is one of a number of recommendations in the White Paper, Supporting Voluntary Activity. The tasks envisaged by the White Paper for VAUs include monitoring the relationship between the State and the community and voluntary sector and liaison with the sector regarding policy development and service and programme delivery.The question of designating VAUs in Departments and the monitoring of progress in that regard has been a frequent agenda item for the White Paper implementation and advisory group, IAG, at its monthly meetings, most recently on 26 January last.My Department has been in ongoing contact with relevant Departments with a view to ensuring the establishment of supports which, having regard to the nature of the individual departmental relationship with the sector, can best meet the White Paper recommendation. Departments have diverse views on how this can be achieved and on the most appropriate arrangements for their particular circumstances, in light of the extent and nature of their relationship with the sector.A number of Departments have designated certain units to function as VAUs. Such examples include the social policy unit in the Department of the Taoiseach, the voluntary and co-operative housing unit in the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government, and the voluntary and community services division in the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. The Department of Health and Children has designated a VAU on a cross-divisional basis with representation from the various divisions in the Department dealing with the community and voluntary sector.I am aware of the importance that the sector attaches to the concept of VAUs and discussions are continuing between my officials and relevant Departments, and within the IAG, in relation to progressing arrangements for increased implementation of this recommendation.

Based on the funding being made available it is planned to offer up to 2,500 places on the scheme.Savings will be made in the social welfare budget when participants cease getting payments on social welfare schemes and join the scheme. The saving in each case will vary from person to person.It is envisaged that to be eligible to participate on the scheme a person must be on farm assist or possess a herd number and be in receipt of unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit, if previously on community employment, or disability allowance.Funding from the dormant accounts fund for the scheme is additional to the €30 million previously announced. Guidelines for the scheme, and practical administration arrangements are currently being developed by my Department in conjunction with the relevant public bodies. I intend to bring proposals to Government when the detailed guidelines have been finalised.

This decision follows consideration by the Rural/Agri-Tourism Advisory Group of a report presented recently by the Consultation Group on Access to Waymarked Ways. The establishment of a countryside council was the key recommendation of the report. The report has been published on my Department's website, www.pobail.ie.I will initiate Comhairle na Tuaithe by reconvening the Consultation Group on Access to Waymarked Ways directly. Subject to receipt of a valid application on behalf of the Rural/Agri-Tourism Advisory Group, to the rural development fund, up to €40,000 is available to enable the initial research, evaluation and pilot actions of Comhairle an Tuaithe to be undertaken by a research-development officer.I also propose to make provision for maintenance of waymarked or approved locally agreed walks to be included as possible rural services for the purpose of the new rural social scheme.The rights of farmers in relation to their land and their concerns on liability are critical issues. These and other relevant issues can be debated in Comhairle na Tuaithe.

There is a list of languages in only one place in the draft European constitution and the Irish language is mentioned on an equal footing with the other national languages of the existing and new member states in that context. By virtue of that reference, which is a reflection of the position in the current treaties, Irish will continue to have constitutional status within the EU. As a resultof this status, a citizen has, for example, the right to write to any of the European institutions in Irish and to receive a reply in the samelanguage.No language is mentioned as a working language in the new draft constitutional treaty. This is not an issue therefore to be addressed in the new constitution itself, but would be an issue to be addressed by legislation — in effect, Council Regulation 1/1958 would have to be amended unanimously in the Council of Ministers.As announced recently by the Taoiseach, the Government is establishing a working group to analyse what can be achieved on this issue and the possibilities that exist to make progress. A meeting on the matter of high-level officials has been arranged for tomorrow. I hope that the process will be completed quickly and that it will be possible to go back to Government with considered recommendations soon. At this point, I cannot say that I am certain that the issue is as simple as has sometimes been portrayed and it is too soon still to say what the outcome of these discussions might be.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	748	As part of the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008, ten regional drug task forces have been established throughout the country. The RDTFs are made up of nominees from State agencies working in the region, the community and voluntary sector and elected public representatives. It is intended that all the RDTFs will work in a partnership manner, similar to the local drugs task forces.All RDTFs are currently mapping out the patterns of drug misuse in their areas as well as the range and level of existing services with a view to better co-ordination and addressing gaps in the overall provision.This work will feed into the drafting of regional action plans, which will be assessed by the National Drugs Strategy Team and recommendations on funding will be made to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion in due course. Given the experience of the local drugs task forces, this work is likely to take up most of the current year.As regards funding for the RDTFs in 2004, a sum of €500,000 is being set aside in my Department's drugs subhead for administrative and technical assistance expenditure incurred by the RDTFs in the preparation of their plans. It is also worth noting that my colleague the Minister for Health and Children has previously, through the relevant health authority, allocated ongoing funding of €50,000 to each RDTF to cover administration costs.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	749	The national advisory committee of the community development programme, CDP, has been a valuable forum for exchange of views and information between projects and the Department for over a decade. The committee is composed of representatives of projects and agencies funded under the CDP and includes additional external representation, that is, the Combat Poverty Agency, Area Development Management and the Community Workers Co-operative. It meets on an ongoing basis and its key role is to discuss, agree and make recommendations on issues of national policy that affect or arise from the work of the programme.In September 2000, the national advisory committee initiated a joint planning process involving all the projects in the CDP with a view to developing a strategic plan which would maximise the impact of the programme within the context of a range of new structures and policy initiatives. This plan included proposals concerning alternative representative structures for the programme. The Department has proposed an expanded structure, designed, in particular, to increase participation by volunteers.As outlined to the House on previous occasions, a comprehensive consultation process was initiated by my Department with providers of schemes and programmes and the social partners, on improving local delivery structures. In order to ensure that any decisions arising out of the review will have been informed by the expertise of those engaged at a community and local level, all projects and support agencies funded under the CDP were invited to contribute to this process. The CDP projects were represented at a national seminar in June 2003.Following proposals emerging from the projects in the CDP, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will examine the operation and membership of the social inclusion measures groups of the city and county development boards to ensure balanced representation and their enhanced operation.The arrangements that I have outlined ensure that the key stakeholders in the CDP continue to have access to information in relation to programme developments and are included in any consultation process initiated with regard to proposals for policy change.

The theme was, planting seeds for rural futures: building a policy that can deliver our ambitions. There were some 1,000 delegates from current and accession member states, including Ministers with responsibility for agriculture and rural development.The conclusions of the conference outlined a number of principles to guide future rural development policy. The principles relate to the following areas: a living countryside being essential for farming, as agricultural activity is essential for a living countryside; preserving thediversity of Europe's countryside; the competitiveness of the farming sector; rural development policy to apply in all rural areas of the enlarged EU; rural development policy to serve the needs of broader society in rural areas; rural development policy to be implemented in partnership between public and private organisations and civil society in line with the principle of subsidiarity; more responsibility to be given to programme partnerships; and a significant simplification of EU rural development policy. Delivery must be based on one programming, financing and control system tailored to the needs of rural development.By way of context to the Salzburg conference, I refer to the national rural development forum held in Cashel on 7 November 2003. At this event, I referred to the need for Ireland to take a proactive part in shaping the European agenda towards rural development.I also said that such policies should, in my view, include: recognition that rural areas must have multi-dimensional development policies and that a total dependence on agriculture will not sustain the population in rural areas; clear spatial strategies, ensuring the continued maintenance and growth of rural populations; targeted funding for rural areas as a matter of urgency to ensure that infrastructure deficits in roads, telecommunications, water, public transport etc., do not inhibit rural growth, these funds in particular need to be targeted at declining and peripheral areas; provision that EU competition law does militate against the provision of essential services at reasonable cost in rural areas; and recognition that enterprise support mechanisms need to ensure that rural areas can compete for enterprise development. I am pleased with the broad convergence of many of the conclusions of Salzburg with these concerns.The conclusions of the Salzburg conference will help shape EU policies in this area in the period post-2006 and will also help inform our policy agenda in a national context. In this context, the Commission will be bringing forward specific proposals on rural development later this year. My Department will be actively involved in contributing to subsequent deliberations arising from the Commission's proposals in this regard.

Such meetings are usually attended by officials, although individual national co-ordinationstructures vary and a small number of Ministers may attend. The meeting under the Irish Presidency will be held in Clontarf Castle on 15 June 2004.Although the agenda has not yet been finalised for the June meeting, the aim of these meetings in general is to provide an up-date on the various national drug situations, on developing drugs legislation and to exchange useful comparative data. The meetings also aims to foster exchanges of information and debate. The Deputy should note that the meeting in June will be the first meeting of national drug co-ordinators of the 25 member states.

Is é príomhchuspóir an Achta ná soláthar níos mó de sheirbhísí i nGaeilge a chur ar fáil ón seirbhís poiblí ar chaighdeán níos airde. Tá freagracht ghinearálta orm mar Aire Gnóthaí Pobail, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta faoin Acht chun a chinntiú go gcuirfear na seirbhísí sin ar fáil.Tá réamh-obair nach beag déanta nó idir lámha cheana féin ag mo Roinnse maidir le cur i bhfeidhm an Achta:— Tá scríofa go dtí na comhlachtaí poiblí atá i gceist — thart ar 650 ina iomlán faoi láthair — le cóip den Acht agus achoimre ar na príomh-fhorálacha.— Tá próiseas idir lámha faoina dtugann oifigigh de chuid mo Roinne-se cur i láthair do chomhlachtaí poiblí maidir le himpleachtaí an Achta dóibh, tráth a bhíonn deis chun tuilleadh eolais a thabhairt agus saincheisteanna a phlé.— Tá feidhm tugtha do Chuid 5 den Acht a bhaineann le logainmneacha ó 30 Deireadh Fómhair 2003 agus tá seacht nOrdú déanta agam sa chomhthéacs sin go data.— Tá leabhrán dhátheangach foilsithe — Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla 2003: Osradharc — a thugann léargas ar phríomh-fhorálacha an Achta mar aon le freagraí ar roinnt ceisteanna a chuirtear go rialta faoin Acht.— Tá soláthar €500,000 curtha ar fáil agam i Meastacháin mo Roinne don bhliain seo chun Oifig Choimisinéir na dTeangacha Oifigiúla a bhunú.— Tá plean gnímh maidir le cur i bhfeidhm fhorálacha an Achta ar bhonn céimiúil glanta ag an Rialtas agus fógraithe.— Tá an tUasal Seán Ó Cuirreáin ainmnithe ag an Rialtas le bheith ceapaithe ag an Uachtarán mar An Coimisinéir Teanga, ach na rúin cuí a bheith aontaithe agus rite ag an Dáil agus an tSeanaid. Tá na rúin sin réidh le leagan os comhair Thithe an Oireachtais go han-luath agus tá súil agam go nglacfar leo.— Tá ordú tosach feidhme déanta agam ar 19 Eanáir 2004 a thugann feidhm don chuid is mó d'fhorálacha an Achta le héifeacht ón lá sin agus ó 1 Bealtaine 2004 i gcás alt 10.— Tá dhá grúpa oibre ar leith bunaithe le déanaí. Baineann ceann acu le Scéim mo Roinne féin faoi alt 11 don Acht a ullmhú agus beidh fógra maidir leis sin sna nuachtáin go luath. Is Meitheal Idir-rannach an ceann eile le chomhairle a chur ar mo Roinnse maidir le treoirlínte a ullmhú faoi alt 12 den Acht d'fhonn cabhrú le comhlachtaí poiblí scéimeanna a ullmhú.— Tá réamh-obair ar súil i ndáil le rialacháin a dhéanamh faoi alt 9(1) maidir le húsáid na Gaeilge amháin, nó na Gaeilge agus an Bhéarla le chéile, ar stáiseanóireacht ar chomharthaí agus ar fhógraí.Anuas ar sin, tá sé i gceist go gcoimeádfear an liosta den na cuideachtaí atá clúdaithe faoin Acht faoi athbhreithniú agus go mbainfear úsáid rialta as an gcumhacht atá agam mar Aire faoi mhír 3 den Chead Sceideal chun cuideachtaí nua a thabhairt faoi fhorálacha an Achta.Maidir leis an gceist faoin soláthar airgid atá ar fáil dom chun an tAcht a chur I bhfeidhm, táim lán-sásta go bhfuil an tsuim airgid atá ar fáil i Vóta mo Roinne do 2004 dóthaineach chun freastal ar riachtanais mo Roinne ó thaobh fheidhmiú an Achta i mbliana, ag cur san áireamh nach mbeidh forálacha uile an Achta i bhfeidhm go hiomlán sa bhliain reatha. Caithfear a thuiscint freisin gur beag an líon scéimeanna faoi alt 12 a bheidh i bhfeidhm i mbliana ó tharla go mbeidh treoirlínte le hullmhú agus go mbeidh tréimhse 6 mhí ag comhlachtaí poiblí chun dréacht-scéimeanna a ullmhú bunaithe ar na treoirlínte sin. Mar atá ráite agam roimhe seo, tá soláthar €500,000 curtha ar fáil chun Oifig Choimisinéir na dTeangacha Oifigiúla a bhunú.Maidir leis an lion post a cruthaíodh ó tháinig an tAcht i bhfeidhm, dírím aird na dTeachtaí ar an bhfreagra a thug mé ar Cheist Uimh 334 ar 1 Deireadh Fómhair 2003 maidir leis an ábhar sin.

Meastar go dtógfaidh an staidéar, a thosóidh i mí Aibreáin, 2 bhliain go leith nó mar sin le cur i gcrích. Cuirfear aon mholtaí maidir le hathruithe ar na limistéir faoi bhráid an Rialtais in am tráth.Tabharfaidh cur i bhfeidhm Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla 2003 aghaidh ar go leor de na moltaí atá déanta i dTuarascáil Choimisiún na Gaeltachta agus chuige sin tá soláthar déanta agam sna meastacháin do 2004 i ndáil le bunú Oifig Choimisinéir na dTeangacha Oifigiúla, rud a bheidh lárnach do chur i bhfeidhm an Achta.Tá dul chun cinn suntasach déanta chomh maith maidir le cur i bhfeidhm moltaí eile atá déanta i dtuarascáil an Choimisiúin, eadhon:— Tá beartas pleanála teanga á thionscnamh ag mo Roinnse faoi lathair i gcomhar le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta a chabhróidh le pobail Ghaeltachta straitéis bhuanaithe agus sealbhaithe teanga a chur chun cinn ina gceantair féin mar chuid dílís den phróiseas forbartha.— Tá feachtas feasachta teanga a bheidh dírithe ar an nGaeltacht go príomha á ullmhú i gcomhar le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta.

Deputies are aware that my Department will decentralise to two locations. The Irish language functions will go to Na Forbacha, Galway where my Department already has an office and the remaining functions to Knock Airport, County Mayo.It is also intended to decentralise a section of ADM to Clifden County Galway and, subject to the approval of the North-South Ministerial Council, it is proposed to move 30 staff of Foras na Gaeilge to Gweedore in County Donegal.To advance the decentralisation process in my Department, a decentralisation unit has been established comprising a higher executive officer and a clerical officer, reporting to the personnel officer. A departmental committee comprising members of senior management and staff has also been established. The first meeting of this committee was held on Wednesday, 14 January and a liaison officer has been appointed to maintain direct contact with the central implementation committee and the Department of Finance.Two special meetings of the partnership committee have taken place to date to brief staff on issues arising from and relating to decentralisation. Appropriate contacts with union interests are also being maintained and a full briefing of information available to date has been given to the union representatives through our departmental council. Arrangements have also been put in place whereby I will meet with the decentralisation committee on a regular basis.All staff have access to a special decentralisation corner on our computer network in which relevant information regarding decentralisation is being posted. A regular bulletin will be circulated where answers to questions raised by staff are answered. The first of these issued on 16 January 2004.No survey to determine the interest of staff in participating in the decentralisation programme has taken place in my Department. However, officials working in the decentralisation unitare at present engaged in compiling an information pack relating to the locations to which the Department will be transferring. It is intended that this information will assist staff in making informed decisions about their future work locations. The Department's training unit will also have a key role in supporting effective communications throughout this challenging change process. Information seminars on the decentralised locations will be held in duecourse.With regard to ADM, I understand that a survey has been conducted among its staff based throughout the country. All 129 staff members were asked if they would be interested in decentralising to Clifden and replied as follows: eight staff were interested; 79 staff were not interested; 14 did not know; and 28 gave no response. I understand that no survey has been carried out at Foras na Gaeilge.The Deputies will appreciate that primary responsibility regarding issues relating to office accommodation rests with the Office of Public Works.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	755	I propose to take Questions Nos. 151, 153, 156, 163, 172, 173 and 185 together.I refer the Deputy to earlier questions on this topic, in particular my reply to Question No. 76 on 21 October 2003, my reply to Question No. 108 and allied questions on 26 March 2003, and my reply to Questions No.s 330 and 331 on 28 January 2004.As indicated in these replies, the Government recognises that local and community development measures are contributing significantly to tackling a range of challenges at local and community level. These range from drugs, unemployment and youth services to community and enterprise development. With their bottom-up approach and the active involvement of local communities, they are a key mechanism, not just for innovative local responses and for delivery of services, but also as critical input for public policy.However, the structures employed to deliver these programmes vary considerably. The number and complexity of structures now involved is both extensive and complex. These arrangements can be confusing and present difficulties for the very communities they are designed to serve.With this in mind, I undertook a review of the structures employed in the delivery of local and community development programmes with my colleagues' the Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The review incorporated a comprehensive consultation process, as agreed with the social partners, and an independent review of Area Development Management Limited, ADM.Our purpose is to ensure these structures best support communities in tackling disadvantage to the greatest extent possible.Arising from the review, we brought forward proposals which Government has now agreed. These are designed to: improve delivery of services on the ground; improve arrangements under which community and local development initiatives are delivered; re-affirm Government's commitment to local and community development programmes; improve cohesion and focus across various measures; and enable communities to more readily access and make maximum use of the funding available.The main features of the measures agreed by Government are community and local development groups across urban, rural and Gaeltacht areas are being requested to bring forward measures for improved alignment of structures in their respective areas by mid-year. This process will be co-ordinated by the local county and city development boards, CDBs.Funding is being earmarked to support specific co-ordinated measures emerging from this process. This will continue over the next three years. The focus of this funding will be towards enhanced service provision. Except in exceptional circumstances Departments and public bodies will look to existing local or community development bodies and-or local authorities for delivery of any further initiatives in this area. In this way, additional expenditures can be prioritised towards services rather than administration.Restructuring of ADM is to be undertaken to take account of changes since its inception. CDBs will be asked to consider and endorse plans prepared by community and local development agencies. This will help secure better co-ordination of services on the ground. The role of CDBs in overseeing and promoting an integrated approach to service provision at local and community level is also being underlined. I will continue to seek improvements in the alignment of community development structures falling within the remit of my Department. Our Departments, as appropriate, will be in contact directly with the agencies affected by the decisions in the near future.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	756	The Unclaimed Life Assurance Policies Act 2003 provides for similar arrangements for unclaimed life assurance policies as apply to dormant accounts in banks, building societies and An Post. The Act requires insurance undertakings to take steps to identify and contact the owners of the unclaimed policies. If the owners cannot be traced, then the proceeds of the policies will be transferred to the dormant accounts fund and surplus funds disbursed by the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board for purposes of community and societal benefit.The Act was passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas on 13 February 2003 and the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs signed the commencement order which gave formal effect to the Act on 10 March 2003.Since March 2003, much has been done to ensure that the mechanisms provided for in the Act designed to notify account holders are effective. Section 9 of the Act obliges insurance undertakings to arrange for publication of a notice in two or more daily newspapers and Iris Oifigiúil every year, advising the general public about unclaimed life assurance policies. The first such notice was published on 21 March 2003 and a further notice was published on 1 October. The Irish Insurance Federation, IIF, which is the representative body for insurance undertakings, published these notices on behalf of its members.Insurance undertakings are obliged to write individually to each policy holder regarding policies with a value in excess of €500 advising them of the provisions of the Act. I understand from the IIF that this process is under way.The Act provides that the transfer of moneys by insurance undertakings, from unclaimed life assurance policies, to the dormant accounts fund will take place at the end of April each year, beginning in April 2004. At this stage, the yield to the fund from life assurance policies is unknown and will only become clear following the first transfer of funds at the end of April.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	757	I propose to take Questions Nos. 154, 177 and 180 together.As Deputies are aware, my Department has overall responsibility for co-ordinating the implementation of the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008. The strategy contains 100 individual actions, under the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research, to be implemented by a range of Departments and agencies.Since it was launched in May 2001, these Departments and agencies have made considerable progress in implementing the actions set out for them in the strategy. In particular, it should be noted that: guidelines to assist schools in the development of a drugs policy have also been developed and were issued to all primary and post-primary schools in May 2002; and the Department of Education and Science implemented substance misuse prevention programmes in all schools in the LDTF areas during the academic year 2001-02 and the social personal and health programme, SPHE, has been on the curricula of all primary and secondary schools since September 2003. This work is being supported by the SPHE support service, which has recruited additional trainers and support officers. Considerable progress is also being made as regards increasing the number of methadone treatment places. The number of places at the end of December 2003, the latest date for which confirmed figures are available, was 6,883. The equivalent figure at the end of 2000 was 5,032. Ten regional drugs task forces, RDTFs, have been established throughout the country. They are currently mapping out the patterns of drug misuse in their areas as well as range and level of existing services, with a view to better co-ordination and addressing gaps in the overall provision.The Department of Health and Children launched a national awareness campaign in May 2003. The campaign featured television and radio advertising supported by an information brochure and website, all designed to promote greater awareness and communication about the drugs issue in Ireland. This first phase targeted the general population while the second phase, launched in October, is aimed at parents. A third set of television advertisements are currently being aired.Customs and Excise has launched a coastal watch programme and implemented a number of measures to enhance drugs detection capability at points of entry; and over 1,120 recovering drug misusers are now on the special FÁS community employment scheme.The strategy also provides for an independent evaluation of the effectiveness of the overall framework by the end of this year. This will examine the progress being made in achieving the overall key strategic goals set out in the strategy and will enable priorities for further action to be identified and a re-focusing of the strategy, if necessary.My Department also has responsibility for the work of the 14 LDTFs which were established in 1997 in the areas experiencing the worst levels of drug misuse. To date, the Government has allocated or spent: approximately €65 million to implement in the region of 500 projects contained in the two rounds of plans of the LDTFs. Over €11.5 million was allocated under the premises initiative, which is designed to meet the accommodation needs of community-based drugs projects, the majority of which are in LDTF areas; and approximately €68 million to support some 350 facility and services under the young people's facilities and services fund, YPFSF. The main aim of the fund is to attract at-risk young people in disadvantaged areas into recreational facilities and activities and divert them away from the dangers of substance abuse.As I informed the Dáil in previous replies on this topic, I am confident that through the implementation of the 100 actions in the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008 and through projects and initiatives operated through the LDTFs and the YPFSF, the problem of cocaine use can be addressed. Each of the LDTFs has in place an action plan to tackle drug use in their area based on their own identified priorities.These projects deal with supply reduction, prevention, treatment and rehabilitation for a range of drugs including cocaine. We have to be aware that most drug users engage in poly-drug use and, therefore, projects need to be able to address this pattern of usage rather than concentrating on one drug to the exclusion of others.With regard to treatment, as the Deputies are probably aware, there is no substitution treatment drug for cocaine and I am advised that existing services, such as counselling and behavioural therapy, are the best treatments available. The Deputies should note that the three area health boards of the Eastern Regional Health Authority have recruited additional counsellors and outreach workers in recent years.In addition, where cocaine use is found to be a problem, this can be reflected in the measures proposed in the action plans of the RDTFs who, as I have outlined above, are currently mapping out the patterns of drug misuse in their areas.I can assure the Deputies that I will be keeping the matter of cocaine use under review. The need to amend the strategy to reflect changing patterns of drug use will be considered in the context of the mid-term evaluation of the strategy which, as I have outlined above, will be carried out by the end of this year.With regard to the national alcohol policy, Deputies will be aware that this is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, who is pursuing a number of initiatives in this area. The national drugs strategy calls for increased links between both policies in terms of cross-representation on the relevant committees and working groups to ensure complementarity between the different measures being taken and this is being done. There are no plans at present to merge these two areas.

This Act will address many of the recommendations contained in the report of Coimisiún na Gaeltachta, particularly those on the provision of improved public services through Irish.In order to provide for the implementation, where appropriate, of other recommendations contained in the report of Coimisiún na Gaeltachta, an additional €890,000 has been set aside in 2004 to facilitate the implementation of a number of specific initiatives and measures. These include: the commissioning of a comprehensive linguistic study of Irish usage in the Gaeltacht, the contract for which is being awarded to Acadamh na hOllscolaíochta Gaeilge, Ollscoil na hÉireann, Gaillimh, in partnership with An tInstitiúid Náisiúnta um Anailís Réigiúnach agus Spásúil, Ollscoil na hÉireann, Má Nuad, this study will commence in early April; a community-based language planning initiative in the Gaeltacht, the details of which I will be announcing shortly; the further development of third level education and training through the medium of Irish in the Gaeltacht; and the implementation of changes in certain Departmental schemes in the Gaeltacht, namely Scéim Labhairt na Gaeilge, Scéim na gCúntóirí Teanga agus Scéim na gCampaí Samhraidh, aimed at strengthening their effectiveness. My Department's various other activities in support of the maintenance and strengthening of the Irish language in the Gaeltacht, and the promotion of sustainable and culturally vibrant communities there, are being progressed continually.A number of other issues and initiatives being progressed or under consideration at present and include: a submission from my Department to An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscolaíochta regarding critical issues affecting the Irish language in primary and post-primary education in the Gaeltacht; the active support by my Department to the Department of Education and Science for the development of an education centre for the Irish language at Baile Bhúirne, County Cork; and submissions regarding the linguistic impact of planning policy in the Gaeltacht from my Department to local authorities responsible for Gaeltacht areas in the context of the preparation and implementation of county development plans and local area development plans.These measures emphasise the importance of adopting language-centred initiatives and, in so far as Údarás na Gaeltachta is concerned, an additional €1 million has been allocated to further enable the Údarás to implement relevant recommendations contained in the commission's report, particularly in relation to pre-school education, youth services and the role of the Gaeltacht co-operatives. Recommendations contained in the report regarding the role and structure of the Údarás are also being discussed with that body.A sum of €300,000 has also been allocated for the implementation of a language awareness campaign in Gaeltacht areas primarily aimed at informing prospective parents, as well as parents of children up to five years, of the advantages of choosing Irish as the main language of the household. While the campaign will focus on that target group, it is expected to generate an additional benefit of heightening awareness nationally regarding the advantages of possessing fluency in Irish. This approach is in line with the relevant proposals contained in the report of Coimisiún na Gaeltachta. While television and radio advertisements will form part of the campaign, specific measures will also be undertaken to provide support and advice to parents who wish to raise their children with Irish, including the provision of suitably designed literature. Precise measures are currently in hand in association with Údarás na Gaeltachta with a view to launching the campaign in the near future.The successful outcome of the overall process is of course largely dependent on the co-operation and commitment of the Gaeltacht communities themselves, as well as all who have a stake in the future of Irish as the chosen language in Gaeltacht areas.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	761	In accordance with the terms of the Dormant Accounts Act 2001, as amended, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs wrote to the chairman of the Dormant Accounts Disbursements Board on 12 December 2003 to consult them on the provision of the additional €10 million for the rural social scheme.The board discussed the matter at its December 2003 and January 2004 meetings and recently confirmed in writing that it noted the Minister's decision.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	762	The National Advisory Committee on Drugs, for which my Department has responsibility, published a study on the prevalence of opiate misuse in Ireland in May 2003 and estimated that there are 14,452 opiate users in Ireland.This estimate was based on statistics provided by three data sources for 2001 — the central drug treatment list, Garda data and the hospital in-patient data. This was the first formal estimate of the number of opiate users undertaken since 1996. However, it should be noted that the 1996 study, which arrived at an estimate of 13,461, estimated prevalence for Dublin only.The latest study estimates that there are 12,456 opiate users in Dublin with a further 2,225 users outside the capital. The Deputy should note that the Dublin and outside Dublin figures do not add up to the national total as all three figures are the result of separate statistical calculations which are performed independently of each other.I am sure that the Deputy will agree that the drop in prevalence figures in Dublin since 1996 is encouraging. Equally encouraging is the finding that the number of users in the 15 to 24 year old bracket has reduced substantially which may point to a lower rate of initiation into heroin misuse.In this context, the Deputy should note that since 1996 the availability of treatment for opiate dependence has increased very significantly and this may be a factor in explaining the latest estimates. For example, in relation to methadone, there were 1,350 places available on the central methadone treatment list at the start of 1996, whereas currently there are approximately6,900.While many of the study's findings are encouraging, I strongly believe that we cannot afford any degree of complacency. The Government is committed to working in partnership with communities most affected by drug misuse and the continued implementation of the 100 actions set out in the national drug strategy remains a priority. In broad terms, the strategy seeks to increase the seizures of heroin and other drugs, to expand the availability of prevention, treatment and rehabilitation programmes while also putting in place more focused initiatives through the local drugs task forces and the young people's facilities and services fund in areas where drug use, particularly heroin, is most prevalent.I should point out to the Deputy, that the strategy provides for an independent evaluation of the effectiveness of the overall framework by end 2004. This will examine the progress being made in achieving the overall key strategic goals set out in the strategy and will enable priorities for further action to be identified and a re-focusing of the strategy, if necessary.

However, as a first step towards preparation of draft legislation, a consultation paper entitled Establishing amodern statutory framework for charities was prepared within my Department during 2003and approved by the Government lastDecember.Immediately following Government approval, the consultation paper was posted on my Department's website, www.pobail.ie. I draw the Deputy's attention to Part 5, entitled Accountability, which contains a proposal for positioning an independent statutory body as the centrepiece of a modern framework for charities and, in that connection sets out options for new institutional arrangements.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	764	I propose to take Questions Nos. 171, 182 and 207 together.I introduced the CLÁR programme in October 2001 to address depopulation as well as the decline and lack of services in rural areas. The Agreed Programme for Government contained a commitment to annual funding for the CLÁR programme and to consider additional areas for inclusion in light of the 2002 population census data. The Government decided on the additional areas for inclusion in the CLÁR programme and I announced these on 17 January 2003. Areas in 18 counties are now included in the programme and there is no plan for a further review or to make any further changes to the boundary of CLÁR areas.CLÁR funds, or co-funds, with other Departments, State agencies and local authorities, investment in selected priority developments. These measures support physical, economic and social infrastructure across a variety of measures such as electricity conversion, roads, water and sewerage, village enhancement, health, broadband and sports projects. The measures introduced under the programme reflect the priorities identified by the communities in these areas whom I consulted at the outset.The measures were agreed with and are, for the most part, operated in tandem with the lead Departments, State agencies or public utilities, as appropriate. This ensures efficiency and effectiveness and meets the needs of the people in the CLÁR areas. I intend to continue this practice for any new measures, depending on needs identified. Equally, I will keep under review the operation of existing measures.The merits of this practice are reflected in the successful delivery of the programme. Expenditure amounted to €14.14 million in 2002 and to €8.613 million in 2003 which, it is estimated, levered a further €17 million in related public and private expenditure into the areas which otherwise would have been bottom of the list for infrastructure investment. The provision for 2004 is €10.74 million and will enable the continuation of investment under existing measures of the programme while providing the scope for the introduction of possible new measures as may be identified during the year.Allocations from the dormant accounts fund will be targeted at programmes or projects within RAPID, CLÁR and drugs task force areas. I strongly believe that a reasonable proportion of the moneys available should be directed towards projects in areas designated by Government as experiencing particular social and economic disadvantage. In the first 12 months 40% of the disbursement of the spend will be directed on programmes or projects within RAPID, CLÁR and drugs task force areas. Every year after that, these areas will receive not less than half of the 40% annual allocation, with the balance available to all areas.With the ongoing co-operation of other Departments, State agencies and public utilities, CLÁR will continue to deliver on the commitment of supporting rural communities.

I also addressed the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in the European Parliament on 27 January 2004, and the text of my address canbe accessed on my Department's website, www.pobail.ie.As regards my Department's planned programme, I informed the House in 2003, in response to similar questions from Deputies, and again last month, that our planned Presidency events are as follows: Conference on Territorial Cohesion, formerly Islands, Galway, 25 to 27 May 2004; Conference on Rural Development, Westport, 30 and 31 May and 1 June 2004;and Meeting of National Drugs Strategy Coordinators, Clontarf, 15 June 2004.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	768	The funding scheme for research into the voluntary sector described in the White Paper was deferred arising from the emerging financial situation in 2003. I currently have no plans to introduce proposals for such a scheme; however, the matter will be kept under review.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	769	I refer the Deputy to the reply to Question No 92 of 21 October 2003.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	770	I propose to take Questions Nos. 181, 189 and 192 together.The Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board published its first disbursement plan on 7 November 2003. The plan sets out the board's priorities and provides for the distribution of funds to assist programmes or projects targeting three broad categories of persons — those affected by economic and social disadvantage; those affected by educational disadvantage, and persons with a disability. A significant level of disbursements from the fund will be ring-fenced for programmes and projects within RAPID, CLÁR and drugs task force areas.The board has engaged Area Development Management Ltd., ADM, to administer the initial round of funding on its behalf. In this regard, an invitation to organisations, groups etc. to make applications for funding was advertised in the national press on Friday, 21 November. I understand that approximately 190 applications have been received to date which ADM is assessing on an ongoing basis.At its meeting on 19 December 2003, the board approved three projects for funding totalling approximately €175,000. The board will next meet on 17 February 2004 and it is anticipated that a significant number of projects will be submitted to the board for decision at this meeting.The current value of the fund is in the order of €175 million, including a reserve which must be maintained to meet claims for repayment and various costs associated with administering the scheme. A second transfer of funds from credit institutions, together with the first transfer of moneys from life assurance policies, will take place at the end of April 2004. However, at this stage I do not have an accurate estimate as to the likely yield from these sources in 2004 and this information will only become clearer at the end of April.The Deputies should also note that at its meeting of 16 December, the Government reviewed arrangements in relation to dormant accounts. It decided to give the board key roles in relating to advising, monitoring and planning in the area of dormant accounts, with particular regard to the following: advising on priority areas to be considered annually for funding; preparation of the disbursement plan; reviewing, evaluating, and reporting on the effectiveness, additionality and impact of disbursements.In the context of the need to ensure appropriate capacity to evaluate and process applications, and so as to secure maximum transparency on disbursements, the Government decided that the objectives of the disbursements scheme would remain unchanged but that it would make decisions on disbursements. Such decisions would be taken following a transparent application and evaluation process, and appropriate arrangements would be put in place so that spending from the dormant accounts fund is clearly separate to the Estimates provision.Draft legislation is to be brought forward in 2004 with a view to giving effect to these decisions.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	771	As I stated in reply to a similar question from Deputy McCormack, Question No. 153 of 21 October 2003, the review of financial and audit requirements to which the Deputy refers is one of the outputs specified in my Department's Strategy Statement 2003-05. This underpins a strategic approach to achieve greater coherence across the range of structures, processes and schemes supporting local and community development. Effective decision-making and proper financial control are critical to advancing this agenda.The first phase of the review, involving a survey of the criteria and processes used across a range of schemes operated by my Department, has been completed. The next phase, developing, as part of a number of wider processes going forward, best practice templates appropriate to the diverse programmes operated or funded by my Department is in progress. The Deputy will be aware, from my replies to earlier questions today, that the Government has taken a number of decisions arising from the review of local and community development structures.As part of my Department's developing IT strategy, a number of projects have been identified which will facilitate more effective decision making and control.The strengthened financial management controls over the schemes and programmes funded by my Department, as outlined in the previous reply, have continued to be implemented.Also, the evaluation of the systems of internal financial control in my Department, which was carried out in line with the recommendationsof the Working Group on the Accountabilityof Secretaries General and Accounting Officers — Mullarkey Report — has just been completed.Further progress has also been made on the implementation of the management information framework, MIF, in line with the strategic management initiative, SMI, in the public service. Contracts have been placed for the project, which involves the installation of a new financial management system that will facilitate better financial and general management across the Department. The project is progressing on schedule, with full completion due by next November.So as to deepen the ethos of financial control and value for money, a systems audit of the community development support programme, CDSP, has commenced and is nearing completion. A review of expenditure in relation to the local drugs task forces is also due to commence in the coming months.In light of the progress to date I believe that the work under way will lead to best practices across the Department and deliver on the agenda for change as set out in the strategy statement.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	772	I propose to take Questions Nos. 184 and 196 together.My Department has received a copy of the report in question. The Deputy will be aware from my responses to earlier questions that, as part of the review of local and community development structures, the bodies involved were asked to submit their plans to county and city development boards, CDBs, for endorsement. These include area partnerships, ADM supported groups, community support programme groups, and county/city child care committees. Leader groups were also asked to provide their plans to the CDBs. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has required the county/city child care committees to have closer liaison with the CDBs.The objective of the endorsement process is to enable the CDBs build up a picture of the range of services, activities and priorities of the various community and local development bodies within each of their areas. In this way improved coherence of the delivery of services and better use of resources to the benefit of local communities can be pursued.Where issues of overlap or conflicting priorities emerge, I would hope that the CDB and local bodies will, acting in the interests of the community, succeed in resolving these. Where it is not possible to resolve matters, it will fall to be considered by the funding authority — the Department or ADM. In that regard, I should point out that the responsibility for funding decisions has not changed. As I mentioned in my response to questions earlier today, the Government has decided that the CDBs should continue the endorsement process.Guidelines on the endorsement process, agreed between the three Departments involved in the review — my own Department, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform — were issued to CDBs by the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government last July. These were also copied to the various local and community agencies involved. The guidelines are designed to assist and clarify the objectives of the process.

Although this is a matter that comes primarily within the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, my Department continues to co-operate with his Department on this issue.A high-level interdepartmental group, chaired by the Department of Education and Science and including representatives from my Department, the Higher Education Authority and Údarás na Gaeltachta, was established to examine a plan prepared by certain third level institutions for the development of third level education in theGaeltacht. This group has had a number of meetings, as well as seeking submissions from various interested parties, and is preparing itsreport.My Department continues to fund a number of third level initiatives in the Gaeltacht. The Deputy may also be aware that I recently sanctioned funding in excess of €1 million for the National University of Ireland, Galway, to facilitate the establishment of Acadamh na hOllscolaíochta Gaeilge. This funding, aimed ultimately at assisting the university in further developing the comprehensive provision of courses through the medium of Irish, will in practical terms be used to assist the Acadamh, in which the university's Gaeltacht centres play an integral part in meeting staffing costs associated with the provision of such services.As Minister with responsibility for the Gaeltacht and the Irish language, I believe that the provision of third level courses through Irish, which serve the needs of the Gaeltacht community and those who wish to pursue their education through the language, is central to the maintenance of the Irish language in the Gaeltacht and on a national level. Addressing these needs will play no small part in empowering Gaeltacht communities and in supporting the survival of the language within these communities.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	774	My Department is committed to maintaining the maximum number of people in rural areas and to strengtheningrural communities economically, socially and culturally. Government policy on rural development is set out in the White Paper published in 1999. As an integral part of this process my Department operates a number of programmes, as set out below, designed to assist rural development, including support for rural enterprises.The Leader programmes are EU programmes in place to encourage the implementation of integrated, high-quality and innovative strategies in rural communities, including a number of rural enterprise projects. Some 22 local action groups throughout the country deliver the EU Leader+ initiative. The allocation for Leader+ for the period 2000 to 2006 is €73.6 million which is co-funded by the EU. The Leader national rural development programme closely complements the Leader+ initiative and is operated by 13 local groups in areas of the country not covered by Leader+. It also provides nationwide coverage for rural and agricultural tourism and focuses more on mainstream activities. The allocation for 2000 to 2006 is €75.7 million which is also co-funded by the EU.There is provision of €42.2 million in my Department's Vote to support local development social inclusion measures. Funding is allocated to area partnerships and community groups to deliver the local development social inclusion programme, LDSIP, under three measures — services for the unemployed, community based youth initiatives and community development. An element of this funding is provided to rural enterprises.My Department's responsibilities also include the rural development aspects of the joint cross-Border programmes PEACE and INTERREG as well as the farm relief services measure of the national development plan. The rural measures under these programmes aim to foster the economic and social development of rural communities. Projects supported by the programmes are community based as well as focused on farm diversification.Total funding of €7.351 million is being provided under the rural development measures of the PEACE II programme during the period 2000-2004. Support is available for cross-Border and cross-community development and the development of agri-diversification projects.Under the INTERREG Ireland-Northern Ireland rural initiative measure support is available to rural businesses and communities to engage in developing the economic and social sustainability of the region and to promote the development and expansion of cross-Border businesses through integrated local area based projects with a strategic focus in geographically defined areas of rural disadvantage. Total funding of €18 million is being provided for the period 2000-2006.Total funding of €10 million is being provided under the rural initiative measure of the joint INTERREG Ireland-Wales programme for the period 2000-2006. Under the programme support is being provided in the eligible area for joint projects promoting rural business skills, rural tourism, rural health and on and off-farm diversification to complement agricultural activities.The development of Gaeltacht areas, which are mainly rural, is actively supported by the activities of Údarás na Gaeltachta. An tÚdarás promotes enterprise and community focused schemes and provides assistance to Gaeltacht community co-operatives.The measures I have introduced under the CLÁR programme support physical, economic and social infrastructure across a variety of measures. These measures reflect the priorities identified by the communities in the selected areas whom I consulted at the outset.The measures with a community focus are group water schemes, group sewerage schemes, local improvement scheme roads, village enhancement schemes, local authority housing estate enhancement schemes, bi-lingual signage schemes, top-up schemes, sports capital grants and community initiatives schemes. Those with particular reference to rural enterprise are the single phase to three phase electricity conversion scheme, wireless based Internet service for selected projects in the Border, midland and regional assembly area, call for broadband proposals in 15 CLÁR locations and fibre optic network supply in Belmullet, County Mayo and Dungloe, County Donegal.In September 2003 I announced that Fitzpatrick Associates, economic consultants, had been appointed to carry out a review of enterprise support in rural areas. This review aims to analyse official enterprise support, including tourism enterprise, already available in rural areas. The greater Dublin area, as well as gateways, hubs and their areas of influence, were excluded from the analysis to ensure that the focus remained on regions that have not benefited from urban-generated economic growth. I hope to receive the completed report later this month.

The committee also comprises representatives of the Special EU Programmes Body and the North-South Ministerial Council Secretariat.The terms of reference of the committee are as follows: to promote the maximum co-operation in the implementation of rural development programmes, including EU programmes; to exchange information on experience and best practice in both jurisdictions in relation to rural development; and to examine the scope for a common approach to the feasibility of developing cross-Border area based strategies and rural development research. In support of its work the committee commissioned two studies in 2001 on co-operation between cross-Border rural communities and cross-Border education, training and research in rural development.With regard to the co-operation study, the North-South Ministerial Council endorsed the main finding, namely, that an area based approach to cross-Border rural development should be adopted. The rural initiative measure of the INTERREG III programme was identified as the vehicle through which this approach could be implemented and the applications for funding under this initiative are currently being assessed.The second study on cross-Border education, training and research identified the need for greater co-ordination, accessibility and practical application of information on current education, training and research provision. Its main recommendation is the setting up of a one-stop shop for collecting, holding and disseminating information on training and education provision in the Border region.The steering committee agreed that the two lead Departments would write to all the universities, colleges and relevant organisations which had been included as part of the study for their views on how the main recommendation for the one-stop shop could best be implemented and a number of common suggestions for the format and functions of the one-stop shop were identified from the comments received. This has been done.The committee is currently considering the establishment of a web-based one-stop shop for factual information and is exploring with the Centre for Cross Border Studies the possibility of amalgamating it with the centre's proposed website BorderIreland.info. The committee continues to meet regularly to discharge its terms of reference.

A key objective of the plan is to approve 200 jobs per annum for the Gaoth Dobhair area, with the aim of achieving peak employment again in five years time.I am pleased to inform the Deputy that, according to Údarás na Gaeltachta, 185 new jobs have been created and 274 new jobs have been approved for the Gaoth Dobhair business park since the action plan was launched over a year ago.A further positive development is the provision by National University of Ireland, Galway, of third level educational courses through the medium of Irish in Gaoth Dobhair with Údarás support.In progressing other recommendations contained in the report, an tÚdarás, in co-operation with my Department and other relevant agencies, is continuing to develop and upgrade the telecommunications and physical infrastructure of Gaeltacht areas. In addition, new training and educational initiatives are being promoted in order to assist up-skilling and retraining of the labour market.A greater emphasis is also being placed on the natural resources of the Gaeltacht and, in this connection, I should mention the scheme Fiontraíocht Ghaeilge sa Ghaeltacht, which was introduced by an tÚdarás last year and supports the recommendations of the working group with regard to the Irish language.

This conference will present an opportunity to debate the concept of territorial cohesion generally and, in this context, to exchange ideas and present proposals on the strategies necessary for sustainable development in an enlarged EU and on relevant national, regional and Community policies.The Department hopes to finalise the draft programme for the conference shortly. It is anticipated that leading experts and interested stakeholders will present analyses and engage in debate on how specific areas of the EU with recognised territorial constraints can be developed in an inclusive way, consistent with the objectives of a uniform cohesion policy.

The primary objective of the Act is to ensure better availability and a higher standard of public services through Irish. As Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, I have a general responsibility to ensure such services are made available.My Department has carried out, or is currently engaged in, the necessary preparatory work to implement the Act. It has written to the approximately 650 public bodies concerned to provide them with a copy of the Act and a summary of its main provisions. A process is under way whereby officers of my Department are providing briefing sessions for public bodies on the implications of the Act. The process affords opportunities to make information available and discuss the Act's specific import for different people. Part 5 of the Act, which deals with place names was commenced on 30 October 2003 and I have made seven orders under that part to date.A bilingual booklet, Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla 2003: Osradharc/Official Languages Act 2003: Overview, has been published. It gives an insight into the main provisions of the Act and answers frequently asked questions. A sum of €500,000 has been provided in the Estimates of my Department for 2004 for the establishment of the Oifig Choimisinéir na dTeangacha Oifigiúla. An action plan on the phased implementation of the provisions of the Act has been approved by the Government and announced.Mr. Seán Ó Cuirreáin has been nominated by the Government for appointment by the President as An Coimisinéir Teanga, subject to the relevant resolutions being accepted and passed by the Dáil and the Seanad. These resolutions will be ready to be placed before the Houses of the Oireachtas very soon and I hope they will be approved. On 19 January 2004, I signed a commencement order to give effect to most of the provisions of the Act from that date and to section 10 from May 2004.Recently, two working groups were established. One is responsible for preparing a draft scheme for my Department under section 11 of the Act and a notice in relation to this will be published in the national press soon. The other is an interdepartmental group whose function is to advise my Department in relation to the drawing up of guidelines under section 12 of the Act to assist public bodies in preparing draft schemes. Preparatory work is ongoing to make regulations under section 9(1) to deal with the use of Irish only, or of both Irish and English, in oral announcements, on stationery, on signage and on advertisements. It is intended that the list of public bodies to which the Act applies will be kept under review and that I will regularly exercise my powers, as Minister, under paragraph 3 of the First Schedule to bring additional bodies within the ambit of the Act.I am fully satisfied that the moneys available in the Department's Vote for this year will be sufficient to meet the requirements of my Department to implement and operate the provisions of the Act in 2004. I am taking into account the fact that not all of provisions of the Act will be given full effect in the current year. It must be understood that the number of draft schemes to be agreed under section 11 will be limited since the statutory guidelines must be prepared in the first instance and public bodies will then have a period of up to six months to prepare a draft scheme based on these guidelines. As stated previously, a sum of €500,000 has been provided in the 2004 Estimates for the establishment of Oifig Choimisinéir na dTeangacha Oifigiúla.With regard to the number of new posts created since the enactment of the OfficialLanguages Act, I direct the Deputy's attention to my response to Question No. 334 of 1 October 2003.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	779	I refer the Deputy to Question No. 54 of 27 November2003 in which I set out details of the many schemes and initiatives to be operated by my Department to assist rural and urban communities in 2004.I can inform the Deputy that there is provision of €42.2 million in my Department's Vote for the local development social inclusion programme, LDSIP, to support local development social inclusion measures. Funding is allocated to partnerships-community groups to deliver the local development social inclusion programme under three measures; services for the unemployed, community-based youth initiatives and community development. A new dedicated fund of €4.5 million capital funding is being made available in 2004 to support small-scale localised actions in RAPID areas, through co-funding with the relevant Department or agency. I propose to announce full details of how this money will be spent shortly. Details of the areas covered by LDSIP and RAPID are available on my Department's website www.pobail.ie.
The Leader+ community initiative and the area-based rural development initiative are currently open for applications. Consistent with the bottom-up philosophy of rural development, decision-making with regard to applications for aid under the initiatives is devolved to 35 local action groups and three collective bodies nationwide. Details of application procedures, closing dates, etc., are established by the groups and collective bodies. The total amount of funding available in 2004 is €21.272 million.Under the CLÁR programme, community groups can avail of assistance under the measures detailed in the following appendix. The closing dates, where applicable, are set by the body administering the scheme. The areas targeted under the CLÁR programme will continue to benefit from assistance in 2004. These areas are parts of counties Cavan, Clare, Cork, Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Limerick, Longford, Louth, Mayo, Meath, Monaghan, Roscommon, Sligo, Tipperary, Waterford, Westmeath and all of County Leitrim.

However, the success of the measure is reflected in the high level of uptake with 12 businesses availing of the assistance in 2002, 53 in 2003 and seven to date in 2004. It is also reflected in the range of counties involved. I am currently reviewing the conditions of the scheme.

An implementation committee was established to direct and implement the plan and an employment target of 200 new jobs a year was set for the Gaoth Dobhair business park. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that already, arising from this plan, 185 new jobs have been created and 274 new jobs have been approved.As part of the continuing implementation of the action plan, an energetic marketing campaign has been initiated to attract investment from the services sector to the Gaoth Dobhair area and Údarás na Gaeltachta has to date hosted 20 site visits from various companies who were examining investment opportunities in European countries. These site visits have yielded two project approvals, while others are still in negotiation. A further positive development is the joint venture between Údarás and National University of Ireland, Galway, to invest €2 million to develop a third level educational facility and a resource for a modern internationally traded services company.In progressing other recommendations contained in the report, Údarás na Gaeltachta, in co-operation with my Department and other relevant agencies, is continuing to develop and upgrade the telecommunications and physical infrastructure of Gaeltacht areas. In addition, new training and educational initiatives are being promoted in order to assist upskilling and retraining of the labour market. A greater emphasis is also being placed on the natural resources of the Gaeltacht and, in this connection, I should mention the scheme Fiontraíocht Ghaeilge sa Ghaeltacht, which was introduced by an tÚdarás last year and supports the recommendations of the working group in regard to the Irish language.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	783	I propose to take Questions Nos. 203 and 210 together.Deputies will be aware that I have no statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of fire services. Deputies may wish to note the Fire Services Act 1981, section 9 of which states that the local authorities shall be the fire authorities for the purpose of the Act. Section 10 states that a fire authority shall establish and maintain a fire brigade, provide premises and make such other provision as it considers necessary or desirable for such a purpose.Notwithstanding the statutory responsibility of local authorities and other public bodies, my Department continues to seek ways of promoting and maintaining living and working populations on the islands by helping to foster sustainable vibrant communities there. In this context, my Department has provided limited financial assistance for the provision of smoke alarms and fire extinguishers in island houses and I understand that this equipment was of invaluable assistance during the recent fire on Clare Island. In addition, my Department has received applications from Donegal and Galway County Councils for 50% of the cost of providing new fire tenders on Árainn Mhór and Inis Mór respectively. A decision on these applications will be made upon confirmation that the local authorities will receive the balance of funding from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	784	I refer the Deputy to the reply to Question No. 151 and other associated questions of today regarding the review of local and community structures.My Department has, in the past, contracted with 13 regional support agencies to deliver training and support to projects funded under the community development support programme, CDSP. In 2003, the cost of providing this support came to some €3.4 million. That represents almost 17% of the total amount spent on the programme last year. In order to maximise the spend for communities themselves and to bring investment on training and administrative supports for the CDSP more into line with the costs of other programmes under the remit of my Department, I embarked on a process last year of restructuring arrangement involving regional support agencies.One of the key issues identified in the review of local and community development structures undertaken by my Department is the complexity and multiplicity of structures and programmes for the provision of local and community services. In this context, the Government has decided to streamline arrangements involving regional support agencies and to reduce the number of such agencies with which the Department has a contract under the CDSP. Accordingly, I will shortly be inviting tender proposals from agencies to provide training and administrative supports to projects funded under the CDSP in six regions, that is, Dublin South, Dublin North, South East, South West, West-Midlands, and the Northern region.The measures I have outlined will achieve the objective of refocusing investment on community development activity and improve coherence between local and community development programmes.

In this context, I refer the Deputy to the cross-ministerial review of schemes which I have initiated with my colleagues, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Decisions arising from this review have been set out by me in this Housetoday.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	787	At the end of last year, the Government approved a proposed consultation paper on establishing a modern statutory framework for charities which had been prepared within my Department.The electronic version of the consultation paper, together with the related press release, have been posted on my Department's website, www.pobail.ie, since 17 December 2003, in anticipation of the public consultation which I expect to be announcing in the very near future. The charities regulation webpage is currently being redesigned, and my plan is that it will go live at the same time as the public consultation is launched.The consultation paper is intended to serve as a reference document for the public consultation. The outcome of the public consultation will, in turn, inform the development of the draft legislation.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	788	As the Deputy is aware, the young people's facilities and services fund, YPFSF, was established in 1998 to assist in the development of facilities — including sport and recreational facilities — and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop.To date, the main focus of the fund has been in the 14 local drugs task force, LDTF, areas, which were established in 1997 in the areas experiencing the worst levels of drug misuse. However, recognising that the drug problem is not confined to the LDTF areas, funding was also allocated to a number of urban areas, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Carlow. To date, just over €68 million has been allocated or spent to fund almost 350 projects in the areasidentified.Proposals submitted as part of a second round of allocations in LDTF areas are currently being examined by the national assessment committee, which is chaired by my Department. I hope to make announcements in this regard in the near future. There are no plans at present to extend the YPFSF to regional drugs task force areas.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	790	I believe the Deputy is referring to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, EMCDDA, Annual Report for 2003 on the State of the Drugs Problem in the European Union and Norway which was released a couple of months ago.That report found that after cannabis, the most commonly used drug in EU countries is usually either amphetamines and or ecstasy, which are the second most commonly used illicit drugs in Europe. In this context, recent use of ecstasy, that is, use at any point in a given previous 12 month period, in Ireland was reported as high and being just under 5% in the 15-34 age group in the EMCDDA report. However, the Deputy should note that the data reported in relation to ecstasy use in Ireland was primarily based on data which is six years old — taken from the 1998 SLÁN survey.In this context, I draw the Deputy's attention to the results of the first drug prevalence survey in Ireland, which I launched in October 2003. This survey was undertaken jointly by the National Advisory Committee on Drugs, for which my Department has responsibility, the Drug and Alcohol Information and Research Unit in Northern Ireland, the National Advisory Committee on Drugs, NACD, for which my Department has responsibility, and the Drug and Alcohol Information and Research Unit, DAIRU, in Northern Ireland, and it provides solid statistical information and more up-to to-date figures on drug use in Ireland.As part of the survey, a total of 8,442 people were interviewed on a face-to-face basis between October 2002 and April 2003 in line with EMCDDA guidelines. With regard to ecstasy, the survey reported usage in the last year prior to the study in the 15 to 34 year old age bracket at 2.2% and at 1.1% for the 15 to 64 year old group. In relation to last month use, the levels are 0.3% of 15 to 64 year olds and 0.6% of 15 to 34 year olds. Although this level of usage is still of concern, it shows Ireland to be more in line with European norms.In general, the drug prevalence survey found that the vast majority of the general population have never used any illegal drugs and that a relatively small percentage are currently using illegal drugs. However, we are aware that drug use — including the use of ecstasy — continues to do much harm in society and the Government is determined to continue tackling it through the ongoing implementation of the 100 actions set out in the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	791	As the Deputy is aware, I have responsibility for co-ordinating the implementation of the national drugs strategy which contains 100 actions for the relevant Departments and agencies to carry out. However, I regret to inform the Deputy that I have no responsibility for the specific matter in question.In relation to the use of benzodiazepines, my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, has responsibility for matters pertaining to the prescription of these drugs and my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, has responsibility for matters relating to the illegal trade of prescribed drugs.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	792	I informed the Deputy in a previous reply that my Department is considering the recommendations contained in the report of the National Committee on Volunteering in respect of a wide range of volunteering related issues, including volunteer bureaux, and I indicated that the matters raised by him would be considered in that context. This remains the current position. However, the Deputy may be interested to know that on 1 January 2004 my Department assumed responsibility from Comhairle for the provision of certain volunteering supports to Focus Ireland, Tallaght Volunteer Bureau and Volunteering Ireland.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	793	I have been in touch with the chairman of the board of Shannon Development on the impact of the move of Enterprise Ireland, EI, staff to Shannon. At my request, the board has considered the issue and has written to me in the matter. It believes that there is a logical case for the integration of the activities of Shannon Development in relation to indigenous businesses, which it carries out as agents for EI, into an expanded EI. I fully concur with its view on this aspect. Obviously, the modalities for such integration will have to be factored into the overall plans to give effect to the EI move.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	794	The total funding allocation for employment schemes in 2004 has been fixed at €351million, which will support up to 25,000 places across the three employment schemes, that is, community employment, job initiative and social economy. FÁS is being given some flexibility in the management of this financial allocation to maximise progression to the labour market while at the same time facilitating the support of community services. I have no plans to increase participation levels on community employment above the level that will prove possible based on the funding provided in budget 2004.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	796	The European Communities (Requirements to Indicate Product Prices) Regulations 2002 (S.I. 639 of 2002) which came into force on 1 March 2003 require traders to ensure that the indication of the price of a product is: (a) unambiguous, easily identifiable as referring to that product; (b) clearly visible and legible to prospective customers; and (c) in proximity to the product or, in the case of a product for sale by distance contract, to the description of the product.I am not aware of any widespread difficulties in relation to the operation of this requirement but I will consider the matter further in consultation with the Director of Consumer Affairs in the context of a review of the operation of the regulations generally which I will be undertaking soon.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	797	I propose to take Questions Nos. 225 to 229, inclusive, together.Married quarters for members of the Defence Forces have for sometime been considered an anachronism and it is the policy of the Department to discontinue them in a managed and orderly manner save in exceptional circumstances. The provision of housing is primarily a matter for the local authorities and married military personnel have an equal claim on such housing as other members of the community in the same income category.For the past number of years it has been the practice to only carry out emergency repairs to married quarters and this policy will continue in the future. The military authorities estimate that about €100,000 was expended over the past five years in carrying out such repairs. Rents for married quarters are considerably less than the market value rental valuation for the properties and in this regard negotiations with the Representative Association on an increase in charges are currently at an advanced stage. However, any revised rates that might be agreed will reflect the present condition of the quarters and those rates would have to be adjusted to reflect any future investment in married quarters.Inspections of married quarters are carried out by the military authorities from time to time and in this regard I am advised that no complaints regarding structural problems have been received from any occupant of married quarters. It is the policy of the military authorities not to re-allocate quarters which are considered sub-standard.With regard to overholding of married quarters the position is that my Department is continuing to examine all options, including affordable housing and voluntary and co-operative housing schemes, in relation to the re-housing of those overholders who, in the normal way, would be eligible for local authority housing.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	798	The opportunity to amend the Defence Acts is availed of when legislation sponsored by other Departments and which has a bearing on the Defence Forces is being formulated. This is particularly so in the area of amendments to civil and criminal law relating to the provisions prescribing the punishment for certain civil offences which are also offences against military law as prescribed in the Defence Acts. Generally speaking, the punishments for offences against military law, whether awarded by court martial or otherwise, are in line with punishments prescribed under civil law for similar civil offences.The most recent amendment of the Defence Act 1954, which was sponsored by my Department, was in 1998. The Defence (Amendment) Act, 1998 provided for the re-organisation of the headquarters of the Defence Forces and for the appointments of Deputy Chief of Staff, Operations, and Deputy Chief of Staff, Support, and related matters. The Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Bill 2002, which was published in January 2002 and which is sponsored by my Department, contains a proposal to amend section 114 of the Defence Act in relation to redress of wrongs-complaints submitted by serving members of the Defence Forces.In the circumstances, the Deputy will appreciate that amending the Defence Acts is a continuous and ongoing process in endeavouring to keep them up to date as far as is possible. My Department is in the process of preparing a draft Restatement of the Defence Acts 1954 — 98, which includes the Courts Martial Appeals Act 1983, and it is hoped this will be completed in the near future.In July 2001, the Deputy Chief of Staff, Support, convened a Military Law Review Board to review the current provisions of the Defence Act 1954, as amended, to ensure that the military law justice system is both expeditious and fair to the individual, contributes significantly to the maintenance of discipline within the Defence Forces and complies with the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights. The board report, together with legal advice from the Attorney General's office, is now under consideration within my Department with a view to deciding upon the most suitable approach to be taken to the recommendations, in light of the general legislative programme of the Government. As the Deputy will understand, in advance of a decision being taken with regard to these recommendations, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	799	I am confident that a target of between 10,000 and 12,000 hectares of planting for 2004 will be achieved.My Department currently has applications for planting in respect of some 17,000 hectares in the system of which the majority have been processed. The remainder are being processed as quickly as possible.As the Deputy will be aware, the Government Estimate for forestry in 2004 has been increased by some 30% above the 2003 Estimate, a clear indication of strong commitment by Government to the sector.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	801	In 2002 the father of the person named applied for additional milk quota under the 32 million litre scheme in the animal disease category. Applicants in this category were required to prove that more than 10% of the dairy herd was lost due to certain diseases in 1978, 1979 or 1980 and that milk deliveries in any of the years 1978, 1979 or 1980 were higher than the sum of initial 1984 quota allocation plus any allocations from the national reserve. As there was no evidence in this case that the deliveries exceeded that level in any of the years concerned, the applicant was not eligible for an allocation. In 2003, an appeal was received in this case but it did not provide sufficient additional evidence to show that the relevant conditions for an allocation were met and therefore it was not successful.Allocations of milk quota from the national reserve are granted on the basis of recommendations from the Milk Quota Appeals Tribunal. The tribunal is a body established to consider and advise on applications for additional quota from individual producers who have suffered severe hardship in the context of the milk quota system.

The tribunal is a body established to consider and advise on applications for additional quota from individual producers who have suffered severe hardship in the context of the milk quota system.The person named submitted an application for additional quota on the grounds of hardship in the current 2003-04 milk quota year. The tribunal examined his application in November 2003 but, unfortunately, it did not recommend making an allocation on that occasion. While every application to the tribunal is treated in a fair and sympathetic manner it has not been possible, within the constraints of the limited amount of quota available and the sizeable number of applications received, to meet the demands for quota from all applicants. The person named may apply again to the tribunal in the coming 2004-05 quota year when the application forms become available next autumn.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	805	The person named applied for an allocation of suckler cow quota from the 2004 suckler cow national reserve under category D, which catered for regular applicants under the suckler cow premium scheme who required extra quota to ensure the viability of their holdings.However, applicants under category A, first time applicants in 2004, category B, farmers with holdings on off shore islands, and category C, organic farmers registered with the Department, all have priority over category D applicants and this has resulted in only a relatively small amount of quota being available for category D applicants.In deciding how this limited quota should be allocated, the quota review group recommended, and I accepted their recommendation, that the quota under category D should be allocated to applicants with 60 LUS or under and commencing with those farmers with the lowest number of livestock units first, and then to continue to allocate, increasing the reference livestock unit by one, until all the quota was distributed.Livestock units are calculated with reference to the number of animals applied on under the suckler cow premium scheme 2003, ewe premium scheme 2003, special beef premium scheme 2002. The milk quota, off-farm income, every €270 equals one livestock unit, and any acreage used to produce cereal crops are also converted to livestock units.Using this criteria, all the available quota for category D applicants has been distributed to those applicants who have 22 or fewer livestock units. As the livestock units in respect of the person named are calculated at 67.86, I regret to say that he exceeded the 60 unit limit to enable him to qualify for an allocation and even if he had not exceeded this limit, there is insufficient quota available to allow an allocation to be made to him.He may consider buying or leasing quota in 2004 — the trading period runs from 2 January 2004 to 30 June 2004. As 2004 will be the final year during which suckler cow quotas will operate, it is expected that the trading value ofquotas will not be as high in 2004 as in previous years.

#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	808	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that married persons may choose from a number of options — joint assessment, separate assessment or separate treatment — the method of taxation that best suits their circumstances. Under joint assessment, tax law provides that one of the spouses is responsible for fulfilling the legal tax obligations of the couple and this is why tax documentation relating to the couple's tax obligations issues to that spouse. This spouse is known as the "assessable spouse". The other spouse is known as the "non-assessable spouse".A married couple jointly assessed for tax purposes may, subject to certain time limits in relation to a tax year, jointly elect as to which spouse is to be the "assessable spouse". In the absence of any such election, one spouse is deemed to be the "assessable spouse".However, not all tax documentation issues to the "assessable spouse". An example of where tax documentation may issue to the "non-assessable spouse" is the issue of a PAYE certificate of tax credits relating to that spouse. A further example is the issue of a tax refund cheque where that refund belongs clearly to the "non-assessable spouse".The current system has the advantage that the main tax correspondence issues to just one person. In addition, it provides clarity as to who is responsible for fulfilling the legal tax obligations of the couple.I am reluctant to put in place any legislative changes that might run the risk of weakening, or introducing ambiguity into, the legal tax obligations of married couples under joint assessment. That said, I am asking the Revenue Commissioners to consider whether it would be feasible to put administrative arrangements in place which recognise the position of both spouses in joint assessment cases.

Budget 2004 indicated that this would involve the transfer of 300 jobs but the figure of 300 was included in error. In fact, OSI has approximately 210 staff based in Dublin with a further 95 jobs approximately located in six regional centres. As I have already indicated, the relocation of the OSI to Dungarvan will not affect its existing regional offices. It is inevitable that some adjustments to the detailed provisions of the decentralisation programme will arise as part of the implementation process and the implementation committee will be addressing these in preparing its implementation plan.

Accordingly, there is no stamp duty liability for a married couple who wish to have ownership of the house transferred into their joint names where the title to the house has been held in the name of one of the spouses only.In regard to the other issues raised by the Deputy, I understand that a similar question has been submitted for reply to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.
#TomParlonPD	unknown-#TomParlonPD-party	unknown-#TomParlonPD-dob	unknown-#TomParlonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	811	I received a report from the Commissioners of Public Works on the Shannon flooding problem in January 2003. This report outlined the background and status of the River Shannon flood problem. The report noted that the last significant investigative work carried out for the River Shannon was the joint Electricity Supply Board, ESB, and OPW initiative in 1961. To assess the potential for flood relief under current conditions the 2003 report noted that a new study would be required, to reflect the changes that had occurred in the catchment in the intervening 40 years. Such a study would need to consider a variety of issues, for example conditions in, and competing uses of the river, perceived changed climate patterns, changed agricultural regulations and practices, different economic circumstances for agriculture and other industries, the higher values being placed on environmental and heritage assets, and tourism opportunities. The January 2003 report provided a basis for further study to pre-feasibility levelin order to provide an updated picture of the options for flood relief on the RiverShannon.Following consideration of this report, on 10 February 2003 I met with the IFA and a group of landowners affected by flooding from the Shannon. I decided to proceed with the pre-feasibility report so that accurate, up to date information is available on which to base decisions. A pre-feasibility report is an assessment of the flood risk at a particular location, potential mitigation options, and the potential economic viability of a flood relief scheme. In preparing this report, the OPW has engaged in extensive consultation with landowners and other stakeholders in the Shannon. I expect that the report will be complete in April 2004 and can assure the Deputy that it will be made available to all interested parties. Further action must await the findings of the report and the views of relevant stakeholders.

The division also deals with the financial services sector in its entirety.As well as monitoring compliance by these cases through audit and debt management programmes, the division is engaging directly with the companies and individuals concerned to encourage their commitment to observe an agreed framework of good tax compliance standards, supported by open lines of communication with Revenue.The idea of no surprises simply reflects the desirable objective of reaching a situation where taxpayers who are prepared to commit to, and maintain, these good compliance standards will be unlikely to be surprised by unforeseen tax liabilities when their tax returns are audited.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	813	I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that their staff have interviewed holders of bogus non-resident accounts on many occasions in regard to their incorrect returns and undeclared tax liabilities. No evidence has emerged from these meetings to date that financial institutions presented or promoted bogus non-resident accounts to their customers. The Revenue Commissioners will evaluate any evidence made available to them which might indicate that financial institutions presented or promoted bogus non-resident accounts.In 1999 and 2000 Revenue conducted and concluded on-site look back audits on 37 financial institutions. Payments amounting to €220 million, including penalties, were made to Revenue at the conclusion of this audit programme by the deposit taking financial institutions. Revenue made a report on the matter to the Committee of Public Accounts. This committee commented on the outcome of these audits, including the approach taken by Revenue in relation to dealing with deposit taking institutions, in its final report on the DIRT inquiry in April 2001.

Section 4 of the Act enables additional institutions that are identified as reformatory schools, industrial schools, orphanages, children's homes and special schools, in respect of which a public body had a regulatory or inspection function, to be added to the Schedule.My Department has received correspondence from both individuals and survivor groups identifying a number of additional institutions that may be eligible for inclusion in the Schedule. Discussions have taken place between my Department and other Departments that may have provided a regulatory function in the operation of these facilities in order to ascertain whether these institutions are in fact eligible for inclusion.It is my intention that a list of additional institutions will be brought before both Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as the verification process is completed.

This decision was a matter for the members in accordance with their memorandum and articles of association and relevant company law. I understand that a meeting of the executive committee of ITE on 5 December agreed a timetable for the appointment of a liquidator, who was subsequently appointed on 9 January 2004, and agreed to issue redundancy notices to staff in advance of this. I understand from the liquidator that he has now further extended the period of notice of redundancy for the staff to 27 February 2004. Officials from my Department met with all members of staff of ITE in December 2003. At the request of SIPTU, a further meeting was held on 28 January 2004 with that union and its staff representatives.My Department has given a commitment to provide every assistance to the company in giving effect to its decision, in partnership with the staff of the institute, and is now working closely with the liquidator in this regard. This includes exploring possible arrangements for the continuation of certain research activities previously carried out by the institute and, in the interests of assisting with an orderly wind-up, facilitating appropriate redeployment or other appropriate arrangements for staff in line with general public service policy in these matters and subject to agreement with the Department of Finance.Options that may be available in this context continue to be explored by my Department. In this regard staff will be kept appraised as developments occur. The entitlements of those employees for whom appropriate re-deployment arrangements are not made will be determined in accordance with the terms of their contracts.My Department is committed to ensuring that any arrangements for the future of the ITE library are made in a manner that recognises its wider academic and national policy importance. The Director of An Chomhairle Leabharlanna has agreed to assist the liquidator in this regard and is consulting widely with interested parties in forming recommendations for the future of the library. I have asked to be kept informed of progress in these matters.

Pilot initiatives will be implemented in targeted sectors where there are vulnerable workers, in partnership with trades unions."The adult literacy service is organised and delivered through the VEC adult literacy schemes throughout the country. The service is resourced and managed by the VECs through funding from my Department. The National Adult Literacy Agency receives funding from my Department to support policy initiatives, tutor training, development of materials etc. in the area of adult literacy. Specific funding has been provided for a course in workplace basic skills training for experienced group literacy tutors. This course is designed to familiarise literacy tutors with the key issues in basic skills training in the workplace and also identifies strategies for introducing and implementing programmes in this context. Joint initiatives are developed at local level through co-operation between VECs, FÁS, NALA and local employers.Programmes under way at national level include the return to education programme, a joint initiative between FÁS, VECs and NALA which provides an intensive literacy programme for community employment workers on FÁS community employment schemes. A focused workplace literacy programme is available nationwide for local authority outdoor staff. There are also successful workplace literacy programmes in two hospitals and in a trade union.The commitment and support of employers is a fundamental requirement for the successful implementation of workplace literacy programmes. In seeking to support and encourage employers to participate in such programmes, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has approved a project proposal from NALA to design and deliver a workplace basic education programme for SMEs. A pilot programme for the development of a certificate in workplace skills has also been approved by that Department under the ESF aided in-company training measure of the human resources development operational programme.There are no plans at present to establish a dedicated fund for workplace basic education. The matter will be considered jointly by my Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in the context of a review of the recommendations outlined in the NALA report, Workplace Basic Education Programmes in Ireland: Approaches and Models for Implementation.Further developments in this area are likely to be influenced by the recommendations of the adult basic skills initiative working group, which comprised representatives of six EU countries, including Ireland. The final report of this group is expected shortly.

I understand from my officials that the pupil in question is currently enrolled in a special class for autism in a mainstream school in north Dublin. This class has a pupil teacher ratio of 6:1 and has the support of two special needs assistants. I further understand that ten hours home tuition per week has been sanctioned for the pupil in question until the end of the current school year.My Department is actively considering an application from Saplings in Kildare for autistic provision in south County Dublin. My officials are liaising with my Department's inspectorate and the National Educational PsychologicalService, NEPS, in this regard. A response will issue to the applicants as quickly as possible.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	821	Responsibility for arranging insurance cover on school property and against public liability is a matter for the managerial authorities of primary and secondary schools, which are privately owned. Funding is provided to primary and secondary schools by way of per capita grants which afford schools considerable flexibility in the use of these resources to cater for the needs of their pupils. This is a preferable approach to putting in place grants for specific cost items such as insurance. I also hold the view that moving to a position where the Government covers the insurance costs of primary and secondary schools may encourage the insurance sector to keep increasing premia on the basis that the State would meet the cost and reduce the incentive for school management to reduce risks. It also would reduce the incentive for school managements to actively review and tender for insurance cover on an ongoing basis.I am committed to improving the funding position of primary and secondary schools in light of available resources. At a time of increased financial constraints, the recent announcement of further significant increases in the funding of primary and secondary schools is a clear demonstration of my commitment to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools. In the case of primary schools, the standard rate of capitation grant has been increased from €57 in 1997 to €121.58 per pupil from 1 January last, an increase of almost 113%. A measure of the increase in overall funding for secondary schools is that by comparison with 1997 a secondary school with 500 pupils now receives extra annual funding of up to €108,000 per annum.

I am informed that the company is taking the preparatory steps necessary in order to be in a position to offer the property for sale. I understand that discussions are ongoing between the port company and the fishermen regarding alternative facilities within the harbour for the fishing vessels currently docking at the north quay. This is a matter for the port company and the fishermen.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	829	In January 2003 I announced my intention to prohibit smoking in all places of work, including licensed premises. These new arrangements presented a major challenge to the health system in terms of the likely increase in the demand for smoking cessation services. My Department's health promotion unit recognised that it needed to ensure that there was an effective and consistent national response to smokers wishing toquit.A national steering committee with representatives from the health boards, the Health Boards Executive, the Irish Cancer Society, the Irish Heart Foundation, ASH Ireland, the Office of Tobacco Control, the Irish College of General Practice, the Irish Pharmaceutical Union and the Irish Dental Federation were charged with adopting a strategic and co-ordinated approach to supporting and delivering smoking cessation services nationally in the form of a national smoking cessation action plan.The specific objectives included developing a national network of partners in the area of smoking cessation, agreeing an approach that reflects evidence of best practice in the delivery of smoking cessation services and co-ordinating activity and materials by all partners in the area of smoking cessation.The Every Cigarette is Doing you Damage advertisement campaign, developed in Australia and now used by more than 50 countries worldwide, including Northern Ireland. The advertisement while graphic in its detail is factual in its approach. It serves as a reminder of the dangers from smoking and the actual affect smoking has on a smoker's body.The advertising campaign is hard hitting and had a high profile when it was transmitted on television, radio, print media and outdoor poster sites. It brought home the stark realities of smoking in a memorable and meaningful way. Balanced with this, the campaign advised people of the support they can access to quit smoking through the new national smokers quitline.I launched the national smokers quitline together with the media campaign on 30 October 2003. The service can be accessed every day between 8 a.m. and 10 p.m. Smokers who ring the call save number have the option of availing of on-line counselling by trained staff, being referred for professional help in their own local area or simply having an information pack sent to them by post.Regionally smoking cessation services were streamlined and co-ordinated to ensure that no matter where a client was calling from they could expect to access a smoking cessation service locally if required. To date the capacity in the boards has been more than adequate to cope with the demand. It is envisaged that when I announce the date of the ban a greater demand will be placed on smoking cessation services. I am confident that the enhanced services will cope with the increased demand.To date over 11,000 callers have used the quitline. Half of the callers have received a booklet that contains tips and information to encourage them to quit.An evaluation of the campaign established that 83% of the population have seen the advertisements. As much as 64% stated that they felt that they were very or extremely effective and 65% of the sample said the advertisements would prompt them to consider quitting.

Since the beginning of 2003 it has concentrated on the investigation of the post mortem policy, practice and procedure of the three main paediatric hospitals, such as the National Children's Hospital, Tallaght, the Children's University Hospital, Temple Street and Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin. Up to mid-October the inquiry had heard 56 hospital and non-hospital witnesses at oral hearings and had accumulated almost 3,500 pages of transcripts of oral evidence.The chairman has informed me that the inquiry has received considerable co-operation from the hospitals and its non-statutory nature has not thus far significantly hampered its substantive work. The chairman is mindful of the need to haveher report completed as soon as is reasonably practicable following the completion of oralevidence.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	831	The text is as follows:Letter of Determination 2003Mr Pat HarveyChief Executive OfficerNorth-Western Health BoardManorhamiltonCo Leitrim5th December 2002Determination of Health Expenditure for 2003Dear Mr Harvey1. IntroductionI am writing to advise you of the Minister's determination of health expenditure for your Board for 2003 under Section 5 of the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act, 1996 (referred to in this letter as the Act) and your Board's revised determination for 2002.2. Funding Arrangements 2003The Minister wishes to advise you that, as agreed by Government, there will be no consideration given to a Supplementary Estimate for Health and Children in 2003, without exception.Therefore, the funding advised to you in this letter, together with any additional funding which may be advised to you for specific issues during the year, will represent the total funding available for services in 2003. Your Board should provide an appropriate contingency sum to cover unexpected issues or pressures, which may arise during the year.It is essential that you inform agencies funded by your Board of these revised arrangements.3. Basic Funding for 2003It has been decided by Government that funding of the Health and Children services within 2003 Estimates reflects an Existing Level of Service (ELS) principle and not, as in the past, a No Policy Change principle.Under the ELS arrangement, funding will reflect the cost in 2003 of approved services put in place for 2002. It follows, therefore, that where the Board is operating in excess of approved levels or where higher levels of services cannot be sustained through efficiency measures, the ELS funding will not be capable of maintaining such service levels in 2003. It is essential that this factor is fully taken into account when developing your Board's service plan.Equally important is the need to align your Board's payroll and employment numbers with the ELS funding principle. Any corrective action required here should be put in train immediately in order to secure the proper base for 2003. These issues apply equally to agencies funded by your Board.4. Approved Expenditure Level for 2003The level of non-capital expenditure for 2003 (i.e. gross expenditure less minor income) determined for your Board is €431.037 million.When comparing this figure with your Board's net expenditure in 2002, account should be taken of the once-off expenditure in 2002.Your Board's revised level of non-capital expenditure for 2002 is €418.987 million (including the 2002 Supplementary Estimate).Outline details of the funding for services are set out at Appendix One. The approved expenditure level for 2003 notified to you above includes provision for technical adjustments of:Non-Pay inflation factor of 2.8%The full year cost of 4% final phase of PPFA reduction for the 1% lump sumYour Board's service plan should be drawn up within the parameters above for the year 2003.5. Funding of Initiatives Under Health Strategy Quality and Fairness
It is clear that the system faces a year which requires a co-operative approach across all professions and disciplines to maintain services and service quality. Nevertheless, there will be opportunities to continue to advance the Health Strategy in the context of the funding now available. Specifically, the Government has provided funding to commission the 709 beds announced in 2002, continue to respond to pressures in cancer services and fund the National Treatment Purchase Fund initiative at the 2002 original level of €30m. The Minister is confident that the ELS funding base for 2003 will continue to advance the Strategy objectives of a patient focused service, deliver greater equity in service provision and secure efficiency gains in the use of resources. In developing the service plan, your Board is requested to seek opportunities to advance the Strategy objectives as appropriate.6. Control of Expenditure and Management of Service PlanGiven the task facing Departments and their agencies in 2003 in managing the Exchequer spending and the uncertain economic climate, the Minister wishes to emphasise the critical importance of control on spending and in the management of the delivery of services. While the Minister is acutely aware of the responsibility of both the Board members and the Chief Executive Officer in this regard, he is equally conscious of the contribution to this vital task made by local budget holders and wishes that they too are made fully aware of the task ahead.Therefore, you are asked to ensure that throughout 2003 appropriate arrangements and structures are in place to ensure:—local accountability for and control of financial budgets, linked to realistic service delivery plans, with delegated authority to amend service operational plans and thereby spending when and where necessary;—that, in regard to acute hospitals, a monthly profile is provided in the Operational Plan setting down projected costs and activity by specialty in each hospital or by Department in hospitals if breakdown by specialty is not available—that this also be set down for care groups and the main programmes in the non-acute area; monthly reporting to the Board and to the Minister on the progress of spending, service plan delivery, employment controls, the impact of actions taken to address emerging difficulties and the affect of these actions on the service plan;—continuous controls on spending, including capital spending, cash and working capital;—similar controls and management arrangements are operated by agencies funded by the Board.7. Reporting on Expenditure and Service PlanThe Minister for Finance has introduced more stringent reporting arrangements on Ministers for 2003, in order that Government can be fully informed on the progress of spending, the issues giving rise to emerging pressures within the system and, in particular, the remedial action taken to correct the situation. In addition, the Minister for Finance intends to publish cash and expenditure profiles of Departments, as submitted, and to monitor these against actual results.In order to allow the Minister of Health and Children to be in a position to comply with the revised reporting arrangements, the following information sets and timeframes are to be put in place by your Board;—Cash Profile; you are requested to prepare a monthly cash profile, aligned to your service plan expenditure, taking fully into account the trends in expenditure and service delivery across the 12 months, consistent with the overall total cash advised. You should note that this profile will form the basis on which cash will be made available to you on a monthly basis throughout 2003. The profile must provide for the full release of funding included in your Board's determination for the GMS, including funding due in relation to 2002, if any. In addition, funding of voluntary and other agencies providing services to your Board must be fully included within the monthly profile.The cash profile must be submitted by 3rd January 2003 for review by the Department before submission to the Minister for Finance.—IMR; having regard to the circumstance facing the system in 2003 and the absolute necessity to support budget holders, the CEO and his management team with information to allow the system to respond speedily and effectively to emerging events, the provision of timely and accurate information, both financial and non-financial will be crucial to the successful management of resources throughout the year.In the first instance the IMR will allow the CEO and his management team and local management to take advantage of opportunities arising and where necessary provide the capability to address emerging difficulties at the earliest possible time.The IMR, together with the CEO's commentary and the quarterly PI reports, are equally important within the Department in that they inform service and support units on the progress of the service delivery and the specific pressures within the system as experienced by individual Boards/Authority. In turn, they allow the Minister to be informed regarding the services and to appraise his colleagues in Government regarding progress within the system overall. This is vitally important in the context of accountability for resources secured and to support the case for continued investment.In order to accelerate the use of the IMR at all levels as a management tool, it is essential that your Board make the necessary arrangements to provide the IMR with commentary to the Department by the 20th of the following month.8. Accountability of Chief Executive OfficerYou will be aware that section 9, Health (Amendment) No. 3 Act, [1996.] places specific responsibilities on a chief executive officer in regard to service plans and financial accountability. In that context it is important that the chief executive officer takes personal responsibility in regard to the reporting arrangements set out in this Letter of Determination on activity, personnel and financial information. It is critical that the process of reporting to the Department includes a clear statement by the chief executive officer of the immediate steps he is taking to manage emerging difficulties in these areas.Where a CEO delegates to an identified officer of the health board the authority, responsibility and accountability for specific services, the officer must be made explicitly aware by the CEO of what is being delegated. The CEO must take personal responsibility for ensuring that this is the case. However, this does not dilute, in any way, the CEO's functions under the 1996 Act, including those under Section 9. The parameters of control and reporting described in this Letter of Determination apply equally to the CEO and those other officers of the Board to whom authority, responsibility and accountability have been delegated. That delegation must ensure that the officers have the authority to act immediately to address problems which could adversely affect the budgetary position, including unfunded activity increases and unapproved increases in staffing numbers.9. Indebtedness LevelSection 8 of the Act requires the notification of the approved level of indebtedness, arising from this determination. This figure is €34.483 million for your Board in 2003. A more detailed letter on indebtedness and working capital requirements will issue shortly. The provisions of the Prompt Payment of Accounts Act, 1997 should be strictly adhered to.10. Service Plans10.1 Submission of Service PlanUnder the provisions of Section 6 of the Act, each health board must adopt and submit a service plan to the Minister. The service plan is the benchmark against which your Board's expenditure, output and progress will be assessed during the year. In accordance with sub-section (6) of this section of the Act, health boards are required to take account of the policies and objectives of the Minister, and of the Government.It will be necessary to complete all matters relating to your Board's service plan as a matter of urgency and, in any event, not later than 42 days after receipt of this letter.Under the provisions of Section 9 of the Act, the CEO is responsible for the implementation and where necessary, the amendment, of the Service Plan on behalf of the Board. In this regard, the Minister is anxious that this process is seen to be driven by each CEO and their management team, and where difficulties arise during the year, that immediate corrective action is taken to bring the Service Plan back into line.The Board service plan should be submitted in hard copy to the Minister. In addition, the plan should be e-mailed as one document (in PDF format) to the e-mail address: serviceplan@health.irlgov.ie.10.2 Format of Service PlanThe structure and format for the 2003 service plan should follow a similar template as in 2002. While referencing Strategy actions, the primary structure of the Service Plan should, as far as possible, deal with services on the basis of the care group structure used in the National set of Performance Indicators.The format of the Service Plan (in particular the associated financial tables) should lend itself to being reported on in the context of the monthly IMRs and the quarterly Performance Indicator reports. This is essential to allow for ongoing assessment of the service plan delivery10.3 Content of Service PlanIt is essential that your Service Plan is realistic and achievable. It should reflect and be grounded in the Strategy, referencing all relevant Strategy actions. If the body of the Service Plan is not stated in terms that address Strategy actions, a comprehensive appendix linking the Plan's contents to Strategy actions should form part of the Service Plan. You will be aware that the Minister will be required to report progress to the Cabinet Committee on the Health Strategy and the Service Plans and the above appendix will form the basis of this report in advance of the streamlining process outlined in 10.6.The available budget must clearly form the basis for the service plan submitted to the Minister. There must be a comprehensive match between resources available to the Boardover the course of the year and the performance/activity levels specified in the service plan to be delivered. This is essential if resources are to be effectively managed at corporate and operational level. However, within the broad policy objectives set by the Minister, your Board has the flexibility to determine its priorities in the Service Plan so as to ensure the optimal delivery of services commensurate with resource availability. It is on this basis that your Board's performance will be monitored and evaluated.In drawing up the Service Plan, emphasis should be placed on the planned service delivery from the core funding across care groups, programmes and sub-programmes.In accordance with section 10 of the Act, if your Board anticipates, on the basis of the information now available, incurring any excess or credit on expenditure in 2002, your Board's service plan must clearly include provision for charging the full amount of such excess or credit to the service plan for 2003. An excess expenditure in 2002 must be a first charge on the resources available for 2003. In the case of an excess, your Board should detail, as part of its service plan, how it proposes to recover the excess expenditure in full and bring current expenditure back into line. Any significant excess being brought to account at this stage will, inter alia, raise questions regarding the reliability of your Board's regulatory and reporting systems.10.4 Documents to accompany your Service PlanWhen your Board is submitting its Service Plan to the Minister, please also send a report to the Department setting out your Board's expected performance by reference to the agreed national set of PIs with appropriate commentary to put the PI-based information in the context of the Board's overall service plan. Targets should be stated in terms of the PIs where these are already set in existing policies (e.g. immunisation etc. and for all other PIs where such targeting is possible. This is essential for good monitoring and Plan evaluation.Please also submit whatever operational details you feel would be helpful in assessing your service plan together with an estimated position for the end of 2002 for your Board in relation to IMR information and also (where possible) PIs. Budgetary statements by care group should accompany or be part of the Service Plan as far as is practicable at this stage.10.5 Review of Service PlanWhilst it is intended that the Service Plan be used throughout the year along with IMR and PI reports as a basis to guide the monitoring and evaluation of service plan delivery (and help to identify emerging trends so that action can be taken at the earliest possible time), there will also be periodic formal Service Plan reviews as in 2002. For each review of 2003, a specific report will be required (to complement the IMR and PI returns) elaborating on the position and focusing in particular on bed capacity funding and core service delivery targeted in the Service Plan.10.6 Development of the Service Planning Process during 2003The Health Strategy recognises the Service Plan as one of the vital tools in the planning process at regional and national level. Its potential as a sophisticated tool for planning based on strategic objectives shared by all boards is identified. While some work has been usefully carried out in this area through HeBe during the summer, nevertheless a considerable body of work remains to be completed. In order to progress the Health Strategy actions on service planning, a joint Health Board/Department group has been established. During 2003, it is intended that this group will—Specify an agreed format, content and approach for Service Plans as per Health Strategy Action 70 ensuring most appropriate linkages to unite health strategy information requirements with service planning formats and performance indicators;—Specify an agreed format, content and approach for 3-5 year Implementation Plans as per Health Strategy Action 71 ensuring most appropriate linkages to service plans, strategies, other policy documents and annual reports;—Consider how the varied reporting mechanisms (including IMRs, Strategy Stocktaking Reports, PI Reports and New Development Reports) currently in place might best be best developed and streamlined to produce a seamless evidenced based process for monitoring services linking strategy through service plan to delivery.This conjoint effort will result in a revised service plan model for 2004.11. Performance IndicatorsThe Health Strategy emphasises the necessity for service planning and delivery to be based on high quality, reliable and timely information. In this context it is critical that as complete a PI report is submitted by the 20th of the month following on from each quarter together with the IMRs all signed off by the CEOs. The PI Reports should be sent in hard copy to the Secretary General of the Department and electronically to serviceplan@health.irlgov.ie using the agreed template. The PI data together with the IMRs will better enable monitoring and evaluation of the on-going position in relation to your Board's Service Plan. In addition, the commentary (which is essential and vital for plan monitoring) should cover areas where hard quantitative PI information is not available in full or where the quality of the information may not be optimal.The Department recognises the excellent work that has been carried out in developing and reporting on the national set of PIs and is conscious that these developments are still at a relatively early evolutionary phase and that much further work needs to be done in this regard. The PI reports will be used as an indicative picture of the Board's position in relation to the delivery of its Service Plan. This is to enable both the Department and the Board reach a better shared understanding of the position in monitoring and evaluating the attainment of service plan objectives by the Board in the light of the underlying position taken together with the IMR returns.12. VFM strategies12.1 New Technology AssessmentNew Technology Assessment has an increasingly central role to play in the use of VFM strategies. This is a complex area, particularly in relation to new drugs and new treatments incorporating new combinations of drugs where assessment information may not be readily accessible. You are asked that every effort be made to seek out assessments of new technologies to guide their introduction so that tighter targeting of the use of technologies, combined with appropriate protocols, will ensure that new technology is employed only for those cases where clear demonstrable benefits exist and resultant costs are justified. In this regard, it is proposed that the health boards and agencies, pending the establishment of the Health Information and Quality Authority, now commence the development of a common approach to the assessment of new technology under the auspices of HeBE.12.2 VFM TargetsThe attainment of better value-for-money through effective and efficient use of resources continues to be a critical objective for all health agencies. The draft IBM health sector procurement strategy report being considered by the CEOs should become central to the delivery of VFM in the non-pay area.The Government have decided that health boards and agencies must continue to pursue VFM during 2003 and your determination reflects an appropriate amount of a VFM target which is to apply across the boards to both pay and non-pay areas. In developing your approach to achieving that target, you should also take into account possibilities that will emerge from the Procurement Strategy for health services, which is being completed under the aegis of HeBE.The outcome of VFM initiatives will continue to be enhanced, by the extent to which health agencies work together to share best practice, to maximise joint procurement and materials management. It is critical that all health agencies use the skills and structures now in place to maximise co-operation and actively pursue value-for-money in materials management, particularly in the development of national protocols and contracts. Co-operation in this area is critical. The level of co-operation between boards to achieve greater VFM will be closely monitored by the Department throughout 2003.In addition, a separate PI report in relation to 2002 using the PIs already in use in this area should be submitted to the Department with the Service plan and quarterly thereafter (signed off and submitted as part of the IMRs for the relevant months). It is intended that the five most important PIs from the draft IBM report when signed off, will replace the existing PIs in this area during 2003. However, both sets of PIs are to be reported on up to and including the second quarterly 2003 Service Plan Review so as to provide continuity.13. Employment Control 2003There will be no addition to the employment ceiling currently approved for your Board, given the ELS allocation. In the context of the ELS allocation, your service plan should therefore confirm that employment levels associated with the activity levels set out in the Service Plan for your Board conform to this ceiling.A series of meetings have taken place with your Board since mid-year, following the results of the 2001 census, to strengthen arrangements for employment control in order to ensure compliance with the approved employment ceiling for 2002, taking account of the Government Decision last June and the review of service plans. The review of the census is now being concluded with the Department of Finance and you will be advised accordingly.You will be aware that the Minister for Finance indicated in his Budget Statement that a reduction of 5,000 is planned in the numbers employed in the public service over the next three years. Further information is awaited from the Department of Finance regarding the implications of this measure for the Health Service and details will be conveyed to you as soon as they are available. In the interim, the preparation of your Service Plan should be undertaken on the basis of the current authorised employment level.In 2003, no posts above the authorised ceiling may be filled. In these circumstances, the employment requirements of specific services, consistent with planned activity levels, should be met through the management of your approved employment complement. In order to expedite financial clearance, your service plan should clearly indicate and list medical consultant posts (new, replacement and / or restructured) for which you intend to seek financial clearance during 2003, before making application to Comhairle na nOspidéal.Revised arrangements are also being introduced in 2003 to strengthen overall central monitoring and control of employment levels. Yours Board's adherence throughout the year to its approved employment ceiling will require to be confirmed on a monthly basis through information furnished in the IMRs. Compliance by your Board with the employment control measures will be monitored by this Department through the IMRs and also by means of quarterly census returns.Arrangements for formally validating at CEO level the employment information supplied by your Board are those as set out in section 8 above.Your Board should also make adequate provision for pay costs in 2003, to be met within the existing allocation, having regard to:—the present numbers employed;—the appropriate balance between pay and non-pay costs;—the projected cost of minor claims expected to arise during the year.14. Development of Human Resource Management and Implementation of the Action Plan for People ManagementThe Service Plan for your Board should include details of the full range of measures which it is intended will be undertaken by your Board in 2003 to implement the specific actions detailed in the Action Plan for People Management (APPM) and to strengthen the capacity for more effective human resource management in the health service, in line with the objectives set out in the Health Strategy.15. Social InclusionYou will be aware of the importance accorded in the National Health Strategy to social inclusion, in particular to Action 18 which has deliverables relating to reducing health inequalities in line with the key targets set out by Government in its review of the National Anti-Poverty Strategy (Building an Inclusive Society Review of the National Anti-Poverty Strategy under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness).Social inclusion should be a major consideration in framing the Service Plan and the Plan should set out the way in which the various actions in it address this. Actions to develop services in line with RAPID and CLÁR proposals need to be seen to take effect in 2003. The Service Plan should therefore clearly indicate the actions which further the implementation of these programmes as well as the wider social inclusion agenda wherever possible.16. ConclusionTo assist your Board to complete the matters addressed in this letter quickly, senior officers of the Department will be available if there are any matters requiring clarification. These queries should, in the first instance, be referred to Dermot Magan, Helen Minogue and Paula Monks, Finance Unit, (01-6354254, 6354293, 6354513) who will co-ordinate the Department's response to all health boards/ERHA. However, it is essential that the cash profile is submitted by the date advised.The Minister would like to thank you, your Board, and all your Board's staff, for your contribution to the delivery of health care during 2002. He also asked me to acknowledge your co-operation and that of your management team in working closely with the Department, other health boards and other agencies in providing improved health and personal social services. In particular, the Minister would like to thank you and your staff for the support given to the Department during 2002 regarding the work carried out on the Health Strategy. The Minister looks forward to the further progress, which will be made in developing the health services during 2003.Yours sincerelyMichael KellySecretary GeneralAppendix to letterNorth Western Health BoardRevised 2002 DeterminationThe revised non-capital Determination for your Board for 2002 is €418.987 million.2003 Non-Capital DeterminationThe non-capital Determination for your Board for 2003 is€431.037 million.
Acute HospitalsAdditional revenue funding of €1.725m is being made available in 2003 to support the consolidation of acute hospital services in accordance with the principles outlined in the letter of Determination regarding the provision of existing levels of service.The detailed application and consequences of this funding should be clearly set out in your Board's Service Plan for 2003.Bed CapacityAdditional revenue funding (ongoing) of €0.737m is being provided to meet the additional cost in 2003 of 38 beds commissioned by end 2002 in the North Western Region under the Bed Capacity Initiative.Hospital / Laboratory AccreditationA sum of €0.033m is being provided to support the development of hospital and laboratory accreditation programmes in your Board's area.Renal ServicesAs part of a structured programme of investment in the development of renal services, additional funding of €0.100m is being made available to your Board in 2003.Pre-hospital/Ambulance ServicesRevenue funding of €0.900m is being allocated to the Health Board Executive (HEBE) in respect of the continuing provision by health agencies of pre-hospital emergency care/ambulance services. The application of this funding will be the subject of discussions between HEBE and this Department.Cancer ServicesAdditional revenue funding of €1.870m
    is being allocated to your Board from National Cancer Strategy funding to address service pressures as follows: €1.310m in relation to oncology/haematology services, including oncology drug treatments and €0.560m to ensure adherence to quality standards asset out in the Report of the Sub-Group of the National Cancer Forum on the Development of Services for Symptomatic BreastDisease.Waiting List InitiativeA sum of €1.800m has been allocated to your board to support the continuation of the Waiting List Initiative. The detailed application of this funding, including the proposed areas to be targeted and the net reductions in waiting lists and waiting times by specialty to be achieved, should be clearly set out in your Boards 2003 Service Plan and will be the subject of further discussion in this context. Particular emphasis should be placed on achieving the target reductions in waiting times for those patients waiting longest for treatment as set out in the Health Strategy. Your Board's plans in relation to the National Treatment Purchase Fund should be included in this context. Further Waiting List Initiative funding may be made available to those agencies who demonstrate the ability to significantly reduce waiting times.HIPE & CasemixCasemixCasemix analysis of costs and activity relating to the hospitals in your Board's area, which are participating in the National Casemix Programme, has resulted in an overall once off

With the launch of the Clinical Indemnity Scheme in 2002 the Department attaches a high priority to the development of comprehensive risk management programmes in Health Boards. It is essential, therefore, that the additional funds made available under the heading are applied to risk management. Funds not applied to risk management will berecovered and made available to other agencies.Development of Human Resource Management and Implementation of the Action Plan for People ManagementThe Service Plan for your Board should include details of the full range of measures which it is intended will be undertaken by your Board in 2003 to implement the specific actions detailed in the Action Plan for People Management (APPM) and to strengthen the capacity for more effective human resource management in the health service, in line with the objectives set out in the Health Strategy.In addition to the resources already in place, an allocation of €0.140m is also being provided to your Board in 2003 to support the development of human resources and for the implementation of the Action Plan.

IntroductionI am writing to advise you of the Minister's determination of health expenditure for your Board for 2004 under Section 5 of the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act, 1996 (referred to in this letter as the Act) and your Board's revised determination for 2003.As you are aware, following on the Government decision of 17 June last, preparations are underway for the introduction of new structures and governance arrangements for the health system. Transition to the new structures will require the enactment of new legislation. The planned date of transfer of responsibility to the new Health Service Executive is January 2005. The health boards and ERHA will therefore retain formal responsibility for managing the system within the existing legislative framework during 2004.2. 2004 FundingThe funding provided by Government for 2004 includes the Estimate for Health and Children as contained in the Abridged Estimates Volume 2004, together with the funding contained in the 2004 Budget figures. This funding should in overall terms support the broad range of services currently delivered, taking into account the impact of the increased charges and value for money targets as outlined. It is clear, therefore, that the task of managing services within approved parameters in 2004 will again be a challenging one. The experience of your Board during 2003 should provide a strong indication of the areas where pressures can be anticipated in 2004. In preparing the Service Plan and budget, all areas of activity and spend will need critical evaluation so that available resources are targeted at national priority areas and emerging needs as far as possible. Given the dominance of pay cost in overall spend, all staffing allocations and, in particular, premium pay elements should be critically reviewed in this process.The Minister, conscious of the extra demand placed on particular services in 2003, has taken the deliberate step of prioritising specific services so as to provide some additional protection in the Service Plan. Such services include cancer, renal and services for older people in the main and, together with the additional funding in the Budget for disability services, should add a measurable impact to the planned service provision in these areas in 2004. You are requested to indicate in your Service Plan the specific service volumes planned in these areas in 2004.3 Planning for 2004 SpendingAs in 2003, your Board is advised to set aside a contingency provision to deal with unexpected issues and service pressures arising in 2004. The Minister for Finance has again advised that Supplementary Estimates cannot be anticipated, and your Board will again be expected to manage items such as minor pay, pay related issues and demand-led services from within the notified determination.4. Approved Expenditure Level for 2004The level of non-capital expenditure for 2004 (i.e. gross expenditure less minor income) determined for your Board is €495.674m.When comparing this figure with your Board's net expenditure in 2003, account should be taken of the once-off expenditure in 2003.Your Board's revised level of non-capital expenditure for 2003 is €470.840m (including the 2003 Supplementary Estimate).Outline details of the funding for services are set out at Appendix One. The approved expenditure level for 2004 notified to you above includes provision for technical and other adjustments of:—Non-Pay inflation factor of 2.8%
—Sustaining Progress agreement in 2004
—Benchmarking, 50% of the award
—Parallel Benchmarking full year cost
—Patient charges, including A & E
—Drugs Payment Scheme increase in threshold
—VFM Targets
—Budget Day funding
Your Board's service plan should be drawn up within the parameters above for the year 2004.5. Funding of Initiatives Under Health Strategy — Quality and FairnessReference has already been made to the need to review all programme spending to secure efficiencies and improve effectiveness. Apart from the specific service priorities identified above, the overall policy framework which health boards/ERHA are asked to address in preparing Service Plans for 2004 is that set out in the Health Strategy. By continuing to shape services along the lines advocated in the Strategy, it should be possible in the context of an overall investment in excess of €10 billion in 2004 to make further progress towards the goals and objectives outlined in the Strategy. Further mention is made in paragraph 10.2 regarding reporting of Health Strategy actions by way of regular returns.6. Control of Expenditure and Management of Service PlanThe Minister, as in 2003, wishes to emphasise the critical need for and importance of an effective expenditure control framework and active management of Service Plan delivery. Both requirements put a particular onus on the role of local managers delivering services efficiently and within agreed budgets. Therefore, the structures operating in 2003 should be reviewed and, where appropriate, strengthened in order that the system is fully responsive and effective across all programmes and care groups. Similar systems should be in operation within agencies funded by your Board.7. Reporting on Expenditure and Service PlanThe arrangements introduced by the Minister for Finance in 2003 for reporting progress on expenditure will continue in 2004. The Minister for Finance will again publish cash and expenditure profiles as submitted by Departments, and monitor these against actualresults.To enable the Minister for Health and Children to comply with the Government reporting arrangements, the following information sets and timeframes will again be required from your Board:·Cash Profile: you are requested to prepare a monthly cash profile, aligned to your service plan expenditure, taking fully into account the trends in expenditure and the impact of delivery month by month, including the contingency element, consistent with the overall total cash advised. You should note that this profile will form the basis on which cash will be made available to you on a monthly basis throughout 2004. The profile must provide for the full release of funding included in your Board determination for the GMS, including funding due in relation to 2003, if any. In addition, funding of voluntary and other agencies providing services to your Board must be fully included within the monthly profile.The cash profile must be submitted by 5th January 2004 for review by the Department before submission to the Minister forFinance.· IMR: having regard to the circumstance facing the system in 2004 and the absolute necessity to support budget holders, the CEO and his management team, with information to allow the system to respond speedily and effectively to emerging events. The provision of timely and accurate information, both financial and non-financial will be crucial to the successful management of resources throughout the year.In the first instance the IMR will allow the CEO and his management team and local management to take advantage of opportunities arising and where necessary provide the capability to address emerging difficulties at the earliest possible time.The IMR, together with the CEO's commentary and the quarterly PI reports, are equally important within the Department in that they inform service and support units on trends in service delivery and specific pressures within the system experienced by individual Boards/Authority. In turn, they allow the Minister to be fully briefed and to appraise his colleagues in Government on performance overall. This is vitally important in the context of demonstrating accountability for resources secured and in supporting the case for continued investment.To accelerate the use of the IMR at all levels as a management tool you are requested to make the necessary arrangements to provide the IMR, with commentary, to the Department by the 20th of the following month. I appreciate that this places additional pressure on senior management but believe it is justified by the need for timely and accurate information if managers are to be successful in managing their budgets. Your Board and agencies under your direction are therefore asked to put arrangements in place immediately in order to comply with the revised timescales.8. Accountability of Chief Executive OfficerYou will be aware that section 9 of the Act places specific responsibilities on a chief executive officer in regard to service plans and financial accountability. In that context it is important that the chief executive officer takes personal responsibility in regard to the reporting arrangements set out in this Letter of Determination on activity, personnel and financial information. It is critical that the process of reporting to the Department includes a clear statement by the chief executive officer of the immediate steps he is taking to manage emerging difficulties in these areas.Where a CEO delegates to an identified officer of the Board the authority, accountability and responsibility for specific services, the officer must be made explicitly aware by the CEO of what is being delegated. The CEO must take personal responsibility for ensuring that this is the case. However, this does not dilute, in any way, the CEO's functions under the Act, including Section 9, and those functions therefore remain fully in place. The parameters of control and reporting described in this Letter of Determination apply equally to the CEO and those other officers of the Board to whom authority, accountability and responsibility have been delegated. That delegation must ensure that the officers have the authority to act immediately to address problems which could adversely affect the budgetary position, including any unfunded activity increases or unapproved increases in staffing numbers.9. Indebtedness LevelSection 8 of the Act requires the notification of the approved level of indebtedness, arising from this determination. This figure is €39.654m for your Board in 2004. A more detailed letter on indebtedness and working capital requirements will issue shortly. The provisions of the Prompt Payment of Accounts Act, 1997 should be strictly adhered to.10. Service Plans10.1 Submission of Service PlanUnder the provisions of Section 6 of the Act, each Board must adopt and submit a Service Plan to the Minister. The Service Plan is the benchmark against which your Board's expenditure, output and progress will be assessed during the year. In accordance with sub-section (6) of this section of the Act, the Board is required to take account of the policies and objectives of the Minister, and of the Government.It will be necessary to complete all matters relating to your Board's Service Plan as a matter of urgency and, in any event, not later than 42 days after receipt of this letter.The Department will be working with the HeBe project team to further develop the service planning process during 2004. In this context a standardised quarterly progress report format will be agreed to be used in 2004 in conjunction with PIs and IMRs to monitor Service Plan delivery in 2004.The Board's Service Plan should be submitted in hard copy to the Minister. In addition, the plan should be e-mailed as one document (in PDF format) to the e-mail address: serviceplan@health.irlgov.ie.10.2 Format and Content of Service PlanThe Department welcomes the CEOs' decision to adopt the standardised National Service Plan Template for the 2004 Service Plan. The template, which is based on best practice, will assist in the monitoring and evaluating of Service Plan delivery and is in keeping with the Government's Programme of Reform.It is essential that your Service Plan is realistic and achievable. It should reflect and be grounded in the Strategy, referencing all relevant Strategy actions. You will be aware that the Minister is required to report to the Cabinet Committee on the Health Strategy on a quarterly basis regarding ongoing progress in the implementation of the Strategy and the Health Service Reform Programme. The Service Plan and its associated periodic review reports and meetings are the primary reporting mechanism which facilitate the monitoring of progress in the implementation of the Strategy.In accordance with section 10 of the Act, if your Board anticipates, on the basis of the information now available, incurring any excess or credit on expenditure in 2003, your service plan must clearly include provision for charging the full amount of such excess or credit to the Service Plan for 2004. An excess expenditure in 2003 must be a first charge on the resources available for 2004. In the case of an excess, your Board should detail, as part of its service plan, how it proposes to recover the excess expenditure in full and bring current expenditure back into line. Any significant excess being brought to account at this stage will, inter alia, raise questions regarding the reliability of your Board's regulatory and reporting systems.10.3 Documents to accompany your Service PlanWhen your Board is submitting its Service Plan to the Minister, please also submit whatever operational details you feel would be helpful in assessing your Service Plan, together with an estimated position at the end of 2003 for your Board in relation to IMR information, the completed Health Strategy PI reporting template referred to in paragraph 11, and also (where possible) PIs. Budgetary statements by care group should accompany or be part of the Service Plan as far as is practicable at thisstage.10.4 Review of Service PlanWhilst it is intended that the Service Plan be used throughout the year along with IMR and PI reports as a basis to guide the monitoring and evaluation of Service Plan delivery (and help to identify emerging trends so that action can be taken at the earliest possible time), there will also be periodic formal Service Plan reviews during 2004. For each review of 2004, a specific report will be required (to complement the IMR and PI returns) elaborating on the position regarding the implementation of new developments as well as on core service delivery targeted in the Service Plan.11. Performance IndicatorsThe Health Strategy emphasises the necessity for service planning and delivery to be based on high quality, reliable and timely information. In this context it is critical that PI reports are submitted by the 20th of the month following on from each quarter. The PI Reports should be sent in hard copy to the Secretary General of the Department and electronically to serviceplan@health.irlgov.ie using the agreed template. The PI data together with the IMRs will better enable monitoring and evaluation of the on-going position in relation to your Board's Service Plan. Commentary should cover areas where hard quantitative PI information is not available in full or where the quality of the information may not be optimal. With regard to PIs for Materials Management, you should note that as for 2003, the five most important PIs from the IBM report should be reported on during 2004.The Minister wishes to acknowledge the good work that has been achieved to date in developing and reporting on the national set of PIs and welcomes the CEOs' decision to share PI data. You will be aware that the PI reports will assist in monitoring progress of the Health Strategy and in reporting on progress to the Cabinet Committee. It is critical that the quarterly reports are as complete as possible and that the quality of the data is maintained.A number of Strategy actions fall outside the National PI set as they do not readily adapt to this form of measurement. A separate reporting template, which was forwarded to your Board on 17th November 2003, has been devised to facilitate the monitoring of progress in the implementation of these actions. Your Board is required to submit the completed template for 2004 with your Service Plan.12. VFM strategies12.1 New Technology AssessmentNew Technology Assessment has an increasingly central role to play in the use of VFM strategies and you are asked that every effort continues to be made to seek out assessments of new technologies to guide their introduction so that tighter targeting of the use of technologies, combined with appropriate protocols, will ensure that new technology is employed only for those cases where clear demonstrable benefits exist and resultant costs are justified. In this regard, it is proposed that the health boards and agencies, pending the establishment of the Health Information and Quality Authority, should continue the development of a common approach to the assessment of new technology under the auspices of HeBE.12.2 VFM TargetsThe attainment of better value-for-money through effective and efficient use of resources continues to be a critical objective for all health agencies. The Government have decided that health boards and agencies must continue to pursue VFM during 2004 andyour determination reflects an appropriate amount of a VFM target which is to apply across the boards to both pay and non-pay areas. In developing your approach to achieving that target, you should also take into account possibilities that will emerge from the Procurement Strategy for health services, which is being completed under the aegis of HeBE.It is critical that all health agencies use the skills and structures now in place to maximise co-operation and actively pursue value-for-money in materials management, particularly in the development of national protocols and contracts. The level of co-operation between boards to achieve greater VFM will be closely monitored by the Department throughout 2004.13. Health Service Modernisation Programme under Sustaining ProgressThe Department is concerned to ensure that the many positive results now being achieved at pilot stage in addressing the specific modernisation objectives set for the health services under Sustaining Progress will be translated into a more positive general impact on the health system overall. At a recent meeting of the Health Service National Joint Council, the trade union side gave a commitment to maintaining the momentum for change and modernisation and to moving the changes being piloted towards more widespread adoption. Both sides accepted the need for a more readily transparent assessment and verification process.It is essential that clearly defined targets, against which further progress can be incrementally measured, be set over the remaining phases of the agreement. Accordingly, your Board should include in its service plan, specific targets in relation to Sustaining Progress under the following fiveheadings:— Customer Service;— Industrial Relations Stability;— Performance Management;— Reform; and— Value for Money.These are the five priority areas in which the Health Service Performance Verification Group (PVG) requires health agencies to achieve real and verifiable progress between now and 1 June 2005.The Health Service National Partnership Forum will provide guidance to health boards in relation to this matter.14. Pay Recommendations of the Public Service Benchmarking BodyFunding is being allocated to your Board in respect of the second (50%) phase of the of the pay awards recommended by the Public Service Benchmarking Body (PSBB) and due for payment under Sustaining Progress for payment from 1 January 2004. Consistent with standard practice, this funding is inclusive of the general pay round increases agreed in Sustaining Progress.The allocation for benchmarking is based strictly on the funding allocated to your Board for payment of the first phase of the PSBB's recommendations earlier this year. In line with the recommendations of the Commission on Financial Management and Control Systems in the Health Service, the Department will in 2004 be updating the costing model for the Health Service developed collaboratively with the health boards for benchmarking. The information requirements arising in this context will be communicated to your Board in due course.As you are aware, payment of the benchmarking awards is strictly conditional on the successful completion of the performance verification process detailed in Sustaining Progress. In accordance with section 26.5 (x) of the agreement, the Health Service Performance Verification Group has recently informed me of its conclusions in relation to whether the level of progress achieved since 1 July 2003 in relation to the commitments set out in Sustaining Progress warrants the payment of the relevant pay increase(s). Sanction arrangements arising in respect of payments due from 1 January next will be communicated to your Board very shortly.15. Parallel BenchmarkingFunding is being allocated to your Board on an ongoing basis in respect of the pay awards from the first two phases of the parallel benchmarking process for craft and non-nursing grades (including pensioners) employed in the health service (and also eligible personnel employed in Section 65 agencies. The funding is also inclusive of general round increases agreed under Sustaining Progress for 2004.The allocation is based on: the costings recently submitted to the Department by your Board; the increases in basic pay set out in the revised pay scales for the grades; information on gross pay (i.e. overtime/premiums) supplied for the benchmarking costing model; and employment levels in wholetime equivalent (WTE) terms recorded in the Health Service Personnel Census. Arising from this process, a number of issues remain to be clarified with some agencies.A letter of sanction will issue to you very shortly in respect of the first (25%) phase of the awards due for payment with effect from 1 December 2001.I understand that the implementation protocol setting out the conduct of the performance verification process for these grades in respect of the second (50%) phase of the awards was recently furnished to your Board by the Health Service Employers Agency.16. Employment Control 2004Continued strict adherence is required to the current framework for employment control in your Board as detailed in the Department of Health and Children Circular No. 6/2003 issued in January 2003.You will be aware that the Minister for Finance indicated in his Budget Statement in December 2002 that a reduction of 5,000 is planned in the numbers employed in the public service over the period to end-2005. In this regard, you have already been notified of the contribution of your Board to the overall reduction in numbers to be achieved in the health service by end-2003. A further reduction of 200 posts in the national employment ceiling is to be achieved by end 2004, in respect of which the contribution of your Board will be on the same basis as the 2003 adjustment. Your service plan should take into account this further reduction in the authorised ceiling.The reduction in the regional employment level in 2004 is to be achieved by maximising the benefit of natural wastage, through detailed scrutiny of replacement recruitment in the health service and non-filling of any non-essential posts with specific emphasis on posts that are not directly involved in the delivery of front-line services. It is intended that this approach will, as much as possible, minimise any adverse impact on existing levels of service to the public in key areas.It is essential that the implementation of the arrangements outlined above are undertaken in a manner consistent with agreed protocols for consultation with staff representatives at local level, and in conformity with the provisions set out in Sustaining Progress for the maintenance of a stable industrial relations environment.The implementation of the reduction in public service employment levels in the health service will be monitored on a quarterly basis. Accordingly, the quarterly employment report submitted to the Department should also identify the specific posts and the location of those posts that have not been filled in order to accommodate the required adjustment in the regional employment ceiling.In the context of the Determination for 2004, your Service Plan should therefore confirm that employment levels associated with the activity levels set out in the Service Plan for your Board will conform to ceiling requirements.In 2004, no posts above the authorised ceiling may be filled. In these circumstances, the employment requirements of specific services, consistent with planned activity levels, should be met through the management of your approved employment complement, including the appropriate staffing mix and the precise grades of staff employed in the approved workforce.To expedite financial clearance, your service plan should clearly indicate and list medical consultant posts (new, replacement and/or restructured) for which you intend to seek financial clearance during 2004, before making application to Comhairle na nOspidéal.Your Board's adherence throughout the year to its approved employment ceiling will require to be confirmed on a monthly basis through information furnished in the IMR. The Department through the IMR and also by means of the quarterly employment reports will monitor compliance by your Board with the employment control measures. Hence, it is essential that the quarterly employment report is comprehensive and accurate and submitted to the Department on a timely basis.Arrangements for formally validating at CEO level the employment information supplied by your Board continue to be those as set out in [section 8] above.17. Pay CostsYour Board should also, having regard to the totality of pay resources available, make adequate provision for pay costs in 2004, to be met within the existing allocation, having regard to:— the present numbers employed;— the appropriate balance between pay and non-pay costs;— the projected cost of minor claims expected to arise during the year.18. National Projects PPARS/FISPSignificant resources, both capital and revenue, have been made available to allow for the development and full implementation of the National PPARS projects and for the commencement of the FISP project. The Minister recognises the importance of these projects in the effective management of resources across the healthcare system. You are asked to ensure that the projects are given the full commitment required in terms of funding and appropriate staffing to ensure that the implementation timescales are met and that the full benefit of this significant investment is achieved. A significant increase in the Capital IT funding is available for rollout of both of these major projects.19. Development of Human Resource Management and Implementation of the Action Plan for People ManagementThe Service Plan for your Board should include details of the full range of measures which it is intended will be undertaken by your Board in 2004 to implement the specific actions detailed in the Action Plan for People Management (APPM) and to strengthen the capacity for more effective human resource management in the health service, in line with the objectives set out in the Health Strategy.20. Social InclusionYou will be aware of the importance accorded in the National Health Strategy to social inclusion, in particular to Action 18 which has deliverables relating to reducing health inequalities in line with the key targets set out by Government in its review of the National Anti-Poverty Strategy (Building an Inclusive Society: Review of the National Anti-Poverty Strategy under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness).
Social inclusion should be a major consideration in framing the Service Plan and the Plan should set out the way in which the various actions in it address this. Actions to develop services in line with RAPID and CLÁR proposals must continue to be prioritised in 2004. The Service Plan should therefore clearly indicate the actions which further the implementation of these programmes as well as the wider social inclusion agenda wherever possible. RAPID and CLÁR projects should be clearly described as such. The boards should include clear statements as to the arrangements being put in place to ensure maximum coordination with other public service agencies involved and details of health agency participation in relevant management structures (for example in relation to City/County Development Boards and related bodies).21. ConclusionTo assist your Board to complete the matters addressed in this letter quickly, senior officers of the Department will be available if there are any matters requiring clarification. These queries should, in the first instance, be referred to Dermot Magan, Helen Minogue and Paula Monks, Finance Unit, (01-6354254, 6354293, 6354513) who will co-ordinate the Department's response to all health boards/ERHA. You are reminded to submit the cash profile by the date advised.I wish to acknowledge the significant effort and commitment given by Chief Executive Officers and all other levels of management to the successful delivery of services and budget plans in 2003. I recognise that the management of Service Plans within approved parameters has proved challenging and has demanded consistent effort and commitment over the course of the year. Given the transitional nature of the period we are going through and the equally challenging budgetary position in 2004, I look forward to your continuing support and co-operation in providing leadership and managing the system to an equally successful outcome in the coming year.Yours sincerelyMichael KellySecretary-GeneralAppendix to letterNorth Western Health BoardRevised 2003 DeterminationThe revised non-capital Determination for your Board for 2003 is €470.840 million.2004 Non-Capital DeterminationThe non-capital Determination for your Board for 2004 is €495.674 million.Acute HospitalsWaiting Lists:The Minister has decided to give a significant lead role to the National Treatment Purchase Fund in targeting reductions in waiting times for patients. In this regard Waiting List Initiative funding will no longer be allocated to health agencies on a once-off basis each year as previously had been the custom.Over the period of the WLI the Department has given financial clearance to individual health boards to convert some long-term temporary consultant posts to permanent status which have been funded on a continuing basis through the WLI. The Minister has decided to put this element of WLI funding into base funding for the health agencies concerned beginning in 2004.In this regard, the sum of €1.750m has been allocated to your board in 2004 in respect of those permanent consultant posts and associated support costs which are in place and will now become part of your base funding for 2004 and subsequent years.Health agencies have identified staff and services which have been in place to support WLI activity and which have been funded by the WLI. The Department will be critically examining the information supplied by health agencies and a further communication will issue early in 2004 in this regard.Health agencies should work closely with the National Treatment Purchase Fund in 2004 to ensure that waiting times for elective treatment are reduced.Cost of Blood and Blood ProductsThere has been a significant reduction in the cost of clotting factor concentrate products used in the treatment of haemophilia. This, together with a projected decrease in the use of blood and blood products and the application in 2004 of the non-pay inflator to base allocations, should offset the proposed increase by the IBTS in the cost of platelets and red blood cells. Any board with net savings from these price adjustments should prioritise these savings to meet costs that may arise in implementing the EU Directive on setting standards of quality and safety for blood and blood products (2002/98/EC).Civil Registration ModernisationAdditional funding of€0.069m is being made available on an ongoing basis to meet additional costs associated with your Board's revised Civil Registration staffing structure, as provisionally agreed and subject to the submission of a satisfactory service development plan, acceptable to An tArd-Chláraitheoir.Winter InitiativeAdditional funding of€0.660m is being set aside to meet the cost of recruiting the remaining 2 A and E consultants approved in your area under the Winter Initiative. This funding is based on your Board's estimate of the likely costs to be incurred in 2004 under this initiative. Drawdown of funding will be approved by the Department on receipt of confirmation from your Board that the additional consultants have been appointed.Renal Dialysis ServicesAs part of a structured programme of investment in the development of renal services, additional funding of€0.250m is being made available to your Board in 2004.Cancer ServicesAdditional revenue funding of€0.600m is being allocated to your Board from National Cancer Strategy funding to address service pressures in oncology/haematology, including oncology drug treatments.HIPE & CasemixCasemix:Casemix analsis of costs and activity relating to the hospitals in your Board's area, which are participating in the National Casemix Programme, has resulted in an overall once-off positive adjustment of €1.065m as follows:Hospitals€mLetterkenny0.999Sligo0.066TOTAL Once-off1.065The Casemix Unit of the department will be writing directly to you shortly with full details of the adjustment.Adjustments should be applied to the hospitals from which the adjustment arises and these details should be clearly identified in your Service Plan.HIPE/Casemix Staffing:No resources for HIPE/Casemix staffing are being allocated to hospitals within your Board this year, as Boards who gain funding within Casemix may reallocate a portion of that funding, as appropriate, for Casemix Staffing. Casemix Unit will be writing to you directly in this matter.Health (Amendment) Act, 1996 (Services for Persons with Hepatitis C)A sum of €0.105m is being made available to your Board in 2004, on a once-off basis, in respect of the cost of providing primary healthcare services to those persons who hold a health service card under the Health (Amendment) Act, 1996, including provision for increased activity, services and costs.Services for Older PeopleA sum of €0.833m will be available to your Board as follows:€Nursing Home Subvention Scheme0.238Personal Care Packages0.125Home Help Service0.250Elder Abuse Programme0.075Palliative Care Services0.145Mental Health ServicesFunding in the amount of €0.050m is being allocated on a once-of basis to your Board in 2004, to:S.T.E.E.R Ireland,Community House,2 Errigal Road,Woodlawn,Leterkenny,Co Donegal.Services to Persons with an Intellectual Disability and Those with AutismThe work of your Board to date in the detailed examination of the financial and governance arrangements of the major voluntary service providers in the physical/sensory disability sector is greatly appreciated. The review of outstanding issues relating to deficit funding claims by these organisations will be concluded in 2004. In the interest of greater equity and accountability, it is expected that your Board will exercise similar diligence in relation to the funding of voluntary organisations in the intellectual disability sector. Where significant funding is being made available to a voluntary organisation providing intellectual, physical or sensory disability services, this should be subject to the signing of an appropriate service agreement.National Intellectual Disability DatabaseThe National Intellectual Disability Database has a vital role in the planning and monitoring of service provision. The timetable for the provision of updated information in 2004 has been notified to each Health Board/Authority and it is vital, as stated in 2003, that this timetable is complied with in order to enable the Health Research Board to complete the necessary validation work and have data available for the Department in the autumn of 2004.In addition to the need to adhere to the timetable as outlined above, health boards are requested to emphasise to the services responsible for the provision of information forthe database at local level the necessity to ensure that the information provided is accurate and reflects current service provision and where appropriate, future needs for each individual.Total additional funding of €0.787m is being made available in 2004 for services to persons with intellectual disability and those with autism as follows:€0.677m to meet the full year cost of the provision of residential services for emergency cases which arose during 2003 and day places;€0.110m to meet the full year cost of residential and day services as per this Department's letter of 9th September 2003.Budget Day PackageAdditional funding as set out below is being provided to your Board in 2004 in respect of the provision of services to people with intellectual disability and those with autism.Additional revenue funding amounting to €0.883m is being provided as follows;€0.550m to meet costs associated with the provision of emergency placements in 2004;€0.333m to provide additional day services, with particular reference to the provision of day places, including rehabilitative training places, for those young adults who will be leaving school in June 2004.A detailed account of the expenditure of this funding, including the National Intellectual Disability Database Personal Identification Number of each person placed in these services and the costs associated with each placement, must be submitted to this Department.The Department will be in contact with your Board in relation to the full year cost implications of these services.Services for People with Physical / Sensory DisabilitiesA sum of €0.603m is being made available to your Board in 2004 towards core funding of these services as follows:Agency/Service€mPriority service pressures as identified at local level (to include respite, home supports, services for people with significant disabilities, support services for children with disabilities, aids & appliances etc)0.170Alleviation of the under resourcing of the voluntary organisations0.156Continued roll-out of the NPSDD (including the introduction of a management structure for the NPSDD and the NIDD) — once-off funding0.257Cheshire Ireland Sick Pay Scheme0.020Total0.603Child Care ServicesAdditional funding of €0.478m is being provided for the Child Care Services.

It is a matter for the board, in consultation with my Department, to determine the priority that should be accorded to service developments, taking into account available funding.The need for an additional consultant geriatrician post for the Limerick area was identified by the board in 2002. Originally my Department allocated €89,000 for the development of a consultant-led team for Limerick. Unfortunately, the board has been unable to further advance the filling of the post from within its allocation. The appointment must also have regard to the board's employment control ceiling. My Department will continue to liaise with it to fill the post.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	833	I propose to take Questions Nos. 269 and 271 together.Last October I launched a report entitled The Development of Radiation Oncology Services in Ireland. It provides a detailed plan for the further development of radiation oncology services here. The Government accepted its recommendations.The report recommends that patients be treated at Cork University Hospital and in the "Eastern Region (South)." To date I have approved the purchase of two additional linear accelerators for the Cork centre and the necessary capital investment amounting to €4 million to commission the service as rapidly as possible. In 2004 a sum of €1 million in ongoing revenue will be made available for the development of these services at Cork University Hospital. I will also provide for the appointment of two additional consultant radiation oncologists in the Cork unit. This means a doubling of the consultant manpower at that unit. At present discussions are taking place between Cork University Hospital and representatives of the SEHB to finalise sessional commitments to the board of the additional consultant radiation oncologists.I have also approved the appointment of a project team to prepare a brief for the rapid expansion of the current capacity at Cork University Hospital from four to eight linear accelerators. Next week the project team will meet for the first time. These developments will have significant benefits for patients from the region.With regard to the eastern region, the report recommended that there should be two treatment centres, one serving the southern part of the region and adjacent catchment areas and one serving the northern part of the region and adjacent catchment areas. I have asked my Department's chief medical officer to advise on the optimum location of radiation treatment facilities in Dublin. A request for proposals will issue shortly in this regard.I intend to develop a national integrated network of radiation oncology. The twin objectives of equitable access regardless of location and an effective national quality assurance programme need to be supported by a co-ordinating mechanism, as recommended in the report. I have established a national radiation oncology co-ordinating group. Recently it held its first meeting. It is comprised of clinical, technical, managerial, academic and nursing expertise from different geographic regions. The group's remit encompasses measures to facilitate improved access to existing and planned services, including transport and accommodation. I expect it will develop proposals in these important areas.The Government has also decided that in the future development of services consideration should be given to developing satellite centres at Waterford, Limerick and the north-west. Such consideration will take into account the international evaluation of satellite centres, the efficacy of providing this model and the need to ensure quality standards of care.

A copy of this question has been forwarded to the CEO of the Mid-Western Health Board with a request that he examine the issues raised and reply directly to the Deputy, as a matter of urgency.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	837	The provision of orthodontic services is the statutory responsibility of the health boards-authority.My Department aims to develop the treatment capacity of orthodontics — both nationally and in the MWHB — in a sustainable way in the long term. Given the potential level of demand for orthodontic services, their provision will continue to be based on prioritisation of cases based on treatment need — as happens under the existing guidelines.The guidelines are intended to enable health boards to identify in a consistent way those in greatest need and to commence timely treatment for them. Patients in category A require immediate treatment. They include those with congenital abnormalities of the jaws such as cleft lip and palate, and patients with major skeletal discrepancies between the sizes of the jaws. Patients in category B have less severe problems than category A patients and are placed on the orthodontic treatment waiting list. The number of cases treated by the board is dependent on the level of resources available, in terms of qualified staff, in the area and this is reflected in the treatment waiting list. At present the provision of orthodontic services is severely restricted due to the limited availability of trained specialist clinical staff to assess and treat patients and accordingly boards do not normally maintain category C waiting lists. I have taken a number of measures to address the shortage of specialists and so increase the treatment capacity of the orthodontic service.The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. In 2003 my Department and the health boards funded 13 dentists from various health boards for the qualification in Ireland. They were trained here and at three separate universities in the United Kingdom. They are trainees for the public orthodontic service and are additional to the six dentists that commenced training in 2001. There is an aggregate of 19 dentists in specialist training for orthodontics. These measures will compliment the other structural changes being introduced into the service, including the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area.Furthermore, the commitment of the Department to training development is manifested in the funding provided to both the training of specialist clinical staff and the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics for the Cork Dental School. The appointment will facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to a specialist qualification in orthodontics. The SHB's chief executive officer has reported that the professor commenced duty on 1 December. In recognition of the importance of the post my Department has approved, in principle, a proposal from the school to further improve its training facilities for orthodontics. The project should see the construction of a large orthodontic unit and support facilities. It will ultimately support an enhanced teaching and treatment service to the wider region, including the MWHB, under the leadership of the professor of orthodontics.In June 2002 my Department provided additional funding of €5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health boards specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. It enabled boards to provide additional sessions for existing staff and to purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners. The MWHB was allocated an additional €0.451 million from the fund for the treatment of cases in this way.The chief executive officer of the MWHB has informed my Department that at the end of the September quarter 2003 there were 1,863 children receiving orthodontic treatment in the board's region. The CEOs of the health boards-authority have also informed my Department that at the end of the September quarter 2003 there were 20,784 children receiving orthodontic treatment in the public orthodontic service. Therefore, over twice as many children receive orthodontic treatment as are waiting for treatment and nearly 3,500 extra children have received treatment from the health boards since the end of 2001.

#IvorCallely	unknown-#IvorCallely-party	unknown-#IvorCallely-dob	unknown-#IvorCallely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	840	As the Deputy may be aware, articles 9.1 and 9.2 of the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations 1993 allowed health boards to assess the ability of the adult sons and-or daughters of older people who applied for nursing home subvention to contribute towards the cost of their parent(s) nursing home care. The assessment of the capacity of sons and-or daughters to contribute towards the cost of nursing home care for their parent(s) was discontinued on 1 January 1999.Although legal advice received from the Office of the Attorney General indicated that there was no legal liability on the State to make retrospective payments, the Minister decided that moneys should be paid, without prejudice, to those who were adversely affected by these provisions. Payments have been made on an ex gratia basis and, consequently, costs associated with the taking out of letters of administration or a grant of probate cannot be refunded.The health boards have endeavoured to identify cases, which would warrant reimbursement as a result of the discontinuance of articles 9.1 and 9.2. To date the vast majority of those involved have been paid. In a small number of cases the boards have been unable to make an ex gratia payment because they have been unable to contact the next-of-kin or some people have refused to take out letters of administration or a grant of probate.

The Commission for Aviation Regulation contacted the company regarding concerns it had about the financial situation and asked the company to improve its balance sheet position. Jetmagic subsequently confirmed to the Commission for Aviation Regulation that it had received additional investment from some of its shareholders. However, it is now clear that those additional funds were not sufficient for the ongoing viability of the company.As soon as Jetmagic took the decision to suspend operations, it immediately put a comprehensive action plan into place. It made every effort to contact its passengers abroad by telephone or by e-mail, to inform them of the situation and to give them information about alternative ways to get home. The airline put emergency helplines in place, which provided full information about all available flight options back to Ireland from the airports that Jetmagic serves. That information was also available at each airport for passengers as they arrived. Those helplines have received more than 3,000 calls since they opened on Wednesday of last week, mostly from people who had advance bookings. Jetmagic has advised that no one has called in serious distress.Aer Lingus immediately offered to take any Jetmagic passengers home for a flat fee of €50 plus taxes, from any airport that Aer Lingus serves in Europe. Jetmagic also contacted other airlines, and British Airways, CSA Czech Airlines, and Aer Arann all offered help. I am satisfied that Jetmagic has done all it can in its difficult circumstances to get people home.FÁS, the national training and employment authority, has contacted Jetmagic, and will make available its full range of support services including skills analysis, jobs placement, guidance and counselling interviews, identification of training needs and suitable training courses to assist the staff of Jetmagic to find suitable alternative employment, should the company actually close down.European airlines operate under a package of European law, known as the "third air package", dating from 1992. Under that legislation, airlines are free to commence operations as long as they meet economic and safety criteria, and to compete on any routes they wish without recourse to any authorities for approval. While Jetmagic has stated that there was strong competition on its routes, there have been no allegations of unfair competition.Regarding the third air package, the European Commission is currently reviewing that package of legislation, but has not yet put forward any proposals for change. I am satisfied that the unfortunate collapse of Jetmagic is not due to any deficiency in the licensing arrangements. Moreover, I am not convinced that it would be necessary or appropriate to provide for a bonding mechanism in respect of the purchase of airline tickets.

The purpose of the initiative is to provide as wide a range of experience as possible in the provision of transport services in rural Ireland, including services for older people.The RTI is now operational in almost all counties and some 2,500 transport services are being provided on approximately 380 new rural routes established under the initiative with 20,000 people now using the RTI transport services every month. The free travel scheme of the Department of Social and Family Affairs was extended to the RTI in July 2003.

This represents a 21% increase on 2002 applications. However, indications are that applications have now fallen to normally expected levels. The annual capacity of the driver testing service, inclusive of normal overtime, is in the region of 200,000 tests. I anticipate that the current waiting times will improve over the coming year.Sanction for a bonus scheme for driver testers was obtained from the Department of Finance in May 2003. Under the terms of the scheme set out by the Department of Finance, the bonus scheme terminated in November 2003. I have requested my officials to examine the potential for initiating a further bonus scheme similar to that which terminated last November in order to address the backlog.In addition to the bonus scheme, eight retired driver testers were re-employed with effect from 13 October 2003. Driver testers continue to deliver additional tests by working overtime on Saturdays and at lunchtime.Preparation of legislation to establish a Driver Testing and Standards Authority, which will take on responsibility for conducting driving tests and will have more flexibility to respond to variations in demand, is at an advanced stage.

I am further informed that a recent multidisciplinary case conference was held to consider whether the hostel in question was a suitable placement in the short term as an alternative to a continued remand in custody, pending the availability of a place at a unit specialising in cases of this type, in the UK. Following further deliberations, the management committee at the hostel decided that it was not in a position to offer a further placement, even temporarily, to the young man in question.This young man is currently on remand in custody to Clover Hill Prison and I understand that this case is listed for further hearing today, 4 February 2004.

On completion of the assessment process, applications are considered by the programme appraisal committee, chaired by my Department, for a recommendation before I make a final decision.There has been considerable demand from community based groups for capital grant assistance under the programme and every county has benefited from significant grant commitments to provide new and enhanced community based child care facilities.My Department is currently carrying out an extensive review of the programme's capital commitments to date to ensure that those grant commitments previously entered into will in fact be realised by the groups on the ground. At the same time, it is also reviewing the different budget lines under the capital programme to ensure that the most effective use is made of all remaining capital funding in accordance with the objectives of the programme.All applications for capital grant assistance are appraised in accordance with the programme criteria to ensure that those projects which best meet the aims and objectives of the programme receive the capital grant assistance which will enable them to provide quality child care in areas where there are service deficits.It would be premature of me to comment further on specific applications for capital grant assistance at this time.

The grant was awarded over one year to enable the group deliver a child care service and to prepare and submit a development plan, which would show that the service has a clear focus on disadvantage.I have been advised that the group submitted an application for further funding towards their staffing costs, which was received in my Department on 22 December 2003. The application was forwarded to Area Development Management Limited which carries out a thorough assessment of each project proposal on behalf of my Department. On completion of the assessment process, the application will be considered by the programme appraisal committee, chaired by my Department, which makes a funding recommendation to me.I would like to advise the Deputy that support towards staffing costs under the programme is only available to community based child care projects which meet the programme criteria, show that they are addressing disadvantage and are supporting the child care needs of disadvantaged parents who are in employment, education or training.In the interim, it would be premature of me to comment further on this application for a staffing grant application.

I will shortly issue planning guidelines elaborating on that policy framework in regard to rural housing.I have no plans at present to review the Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Residential Density. These guidelines emphasise that higher residential densities must be coupled with the highest standards of residential environment. The guidelines indicate that in existing residential areas whose character has been established by their current density or architectural form, a balance must be struck between the protection of the amenities and privacy of adjoining dwellings, the protection of established characterand the need to provide new residential development.The Strategic Planning Guidelines for the Greater Dublin Area, published in 1999, are currently being reviewed by the Dublin and mid-east regional authorities. New draft Regional Planning Guidelines for the Greater Dublin Area were published jointly by the two regional authorities on 19 December 2003.

Negotiation on a number of proposals in the areas of air quality, waste management, climate change, chemicals and nature conservation is ongoing or planned with a view to maximising progress at the Council of Environment Ministers meetings on 2 March and 28-29 June. A second area is preparation of the environmental input to the annual review of the Lisbon Agenda by the European Council at its spring meeting in March. Finalisation of the environmental input will be a priority for the Environment Council meeting on 2 March. The third area is effective participation by the EU in wider international fora. My main priority is to lead EU participation in a number of significant international meetings in the first half of 2004, including the seventh Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity, incorporating the first meeting of the parties to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, to be held in Malaysia this month.An informal meeting of the Environment Council will be held in Waterford on 14 to 16 May, and will address future policy development on the sustainable use of natural resources and the recovery and recycling of waste.In addition, my Department is organising or involved in a number of events to be held in Ireland during the Presidency. These include: a Conference on Emissions Trading in February; a meeting of the European Forum for Architectural Policies in April; a Conference on Sustainable Development in April; and a stakeholder Conference on implementation of the EU Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plans in May.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	880	As outlined in the 1998 policy statement Changing our Ways, overall Government policy on waste management is based on the internationally recognised waste hierarchy which prioritises prevention, minimisation, reuse, recycling, energy recovery and environmentally sound disposal of waste which cannot be prevented or recovered.Changing our Ways sets ambitious targets to be achieved over a 15 year timescale including: a diversion of 50% of household waste from landfill; a minimum 65% reduction in biodegradable waste consigned to landfill; the development of composting and other biological treatment facilities capable of treating up to 300,000 tonnes of biodegradable waste per annum; recycling of 35% of municipal waste; and recycling of at least 50% of construction and demolition, C& , waste within a five year period, with a progressive increase to at least 85% over 15 years.The Government's priorities in relation to waste management are now heavily focused on implementation. Having regard to the targets set in Changing Our Ways, the local and regional waste management plans now being implemented provide for: household segregation and separate collection of organic waste and dry recyclables in urban areas, approximately 500,000 households nationally are already served by segregated household collection of recyclables; an extended network of bring facilities, approximately 1,800 bring banks currently in place compared to around 400 in 1995; an increased network of civic amenity recycling centres and waste transfer stations, there are now approximately 50 civic amenity sites or recycling sites around the country accepting a wide range of materials for recycling; and a range of centralised composting and biological treatment facilities.I will also be announcing shortly implementation details of additional commitments contained in the Delivering Change policy statement published in 2002 which include: a national waste prevention programme, within the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, which has as its core objective ensuring a reduction in the amount of waste produced; a market development programme to ensure that end markets exist for the materials which are collected for recycling; a national strategy on biodegradable waste which will set out measures to progressively divert biodegradable municipal waste away from landfill in accordance with agreed targets over a 15 year period. It is also intended to establish a recycling consultative forum.In relation to deposit and refund schemes, these generally refer to systems where a payment, or deposit, is made when a product is purchased and is fully or partially refunded when the product is returned to an authorised point of collection. Deposit and refund schemes introduced to date internationally have generally targeted beverage containers, plastic containers, glass bottles or drink cans, to encourage their return for reuse or recycling. The high cost of storage and the associated demands of operating a deposit-return system are issues that would have to be taken into account in assessing such an approach.In Ireland packaging waste recycling, including beverage containers, is organised mainly through a collective industry based scheme operated by Repak. This scheme is working successfully and in 2001 met the target of 25% recycling required under EU Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste. Repak is on course to meet the higher target set for end 2005. In these circumstances, there is no proposal to introduce a deposit and refund scheme for beverage containers in Ireland. However, my Department is currently in discussions with local authorities, Repak and industry stakeholders with a view to increasing the recovery and recycling of plastic beverage containers and proposals to tackle this waste stream are being developed.In addition to packaging my Department is currently: working on expanding the number and range of other producer responsibility initiatives, PRIs, are being developed for specific waste streams — end-of-life vehicles, waste electrical and electronic equipment, WEEE, newsprint; priority is being given to implementation of these identified waste streams; and I will be making announcements in relation to end-of-life vehicles and the implementation of the EU WEEE directive shortly.

It was expected that final agreement would be reached at a meeting of this working group, which was held on 23 January 2004, but this did not prove possible. Agreement would have allowed farmers, other than those who opt for the REP scheme, to be compensated by my Department for actual costs and losses arising from implementation of management prescriptions. My Department is maintaining contact with the farming representatives to see how agreement might be reached.

As pointed out in the national spatial strategy, in many rural areas, the combination of a high dependency on a changing agricultural base, a scarcity of employment opportunities and resultant out-migration, has weakened demographic, economic, social and physical structure. Several policy responses are required as a result.The aim of the CLÁR programme is to alleviate the economic and social disadvantage suffered by those living in areas of low population density. This disadvantage is manifested in weak infrastructure and slower delivery of services than more populated areas. The measures I have introduced under the programme aim to redress this imbalance and encompass the priorities highlighted by the communities in the selected areas whom I consulted at the outset. These measures support physical, economic and social infrastructure across a variety of measures such as electricity conversion, roads, water and sewerage, village enhancement, health, broadband and sports projects. Through these supports, setting up enterprises in the CLÁR areas is more attractive and viable.As a consequence, more employment should be available thus maintaining or increasing the numbers living and working in these areas. In addition, an EU Community initiative for rural development provides approved local action groups with public funding, to implement multi-sectoral business plans for the development of their own areas. This is delivered via two programmes the EU initiative, Leader+ and the Leader national rural development programme. There is public funding of €150 million allocated to the programmes over the period to the end of 2006.In September 2003 I announced that Fitzpatrick Associates, economic consultants, had been appointed to carry out a review of enterprise support in rural areas. This review was to analyse official enterprise support, including tourism enterprise, already available in rural areas. The greater Dublin area, as well as gateways, hubs and their areas of influence were excluded from the analysis to ensure that the focus remained on regions that have not benefited from urban-generated economic growth.I hope that this report will be finalised later this month. In the light of the foregoing measures real progress is being made to counter depopulation and strengthen rural communities.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	885	In July 2003, when I launched the 2002 annual report of the Western Development Commission, I asked the commission to co-ordinate a strategy to develop towns on radial routes in the seven counties that comprise the western region. A critical objective is to maximise the benefit to the west of the national spatial strategy, major roads investment, the strategic rail review and decentralisation. At that time I said it was vital that infrastructure and development go together — each should make the other happen — and the commission was ideally placed to spearhead such an initiative. The overriding objective has been to enable local and regional authorities in these counties to plan a co-ordinated approach, to maximise the development potential of the region.Jobs for Towns is a detailed and valuable report to appear in such a relatively short time. The commission consulted with the various local authorities and the regional authorities to compile and assemble this report. It identified 20 towns with populations in excess of 1,500 and analysed their potential for development by reference to a wide range of criteria such as road, rail and air access, remoteness and physical and social infrastructure. I was particularly pleased that account was also taken of towns proximity to a CLÁR area. Western Development Commission reports have consistently pointed out the need for an emphasis on smaller towns as part of the strategic development of the western region. In addition to the findings of the recent report, the commission intends to continue research into the development of small towns in the region. The national spatial strategy also reiterated the Government's commitment to balanced regional development, including the development of towns outside gateways and hubs, and rural regeneration. Many of the findings of this report are relevant to the recent Government decision on decentralisation, the implementation of which will be greatly assisted by the data and analysis contained in this report.The report also deals with the issue of rail links and infrastructural development. The WDC wrote to the four local authorities on the route of the western rail corridor to establish if towns in each county have been prioritised for growth in part because of their positioning on the corridor. The local authorities have referred to this in their draft or current development plans.The research undertaken for this report will be immensely valuable not only to local and regional authorities but to national organisations including Departments such as mine. I intend to use the findings in promoting development in the west in co-operation with my colleagues in Government. In this context, the decentralisation programme, coupled with infrastructural development, will contribute significantly to enhancing economic and social activity across the towns in the west.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	886	The conclusion of the mid-term review of the Common Agriculture Policy in 2003 was the clearest signal possible from the European Union that the second pillar of the CAP or, more commonly, rural development policy is now regarded as central to the future of an enlarged Community. People are the lifeblood of rural areas. As is all too evident here and elsewhere, the greatest threat to the survival of rural Europe is the continued decline of rural populations particularly in poorer and peripheral areas. The single most serious challenge facing rural development policy-makers is the need to provide a rural infrastructure capable of delivering a sufficient standard of living and employment opportunity to sustain vibrant rural communities.It has been clear for some time now to those involved that farming alone can no longer sustain rural populations. Rural dwellers expect and demand a standard of living comparable with that of urban dwellers and will rightly settle for nothing less. Therefore, new ways must be found to address the needs of rural dwellers. I attended a conference on rural development hosted by the European Commission in Salzburg last November. The conclusions of the conference provide some guidance for future policy: investment in the broader rural economy to generate the employment and living conditions necessary to maintain rural populations, especially young people and women. Policy should be implemented in partnership between public and private organisations. Development must encompass the social, educational, health, cultural, sporting and economic needs of communities. Rural development policy should apply to all rural areas of the EU.Ireland must take a proactive part in shaping the European agenda towards rural development. Future policy should include: recognition that rural areas must have multi-dimensional development policies and recognition that total dependence on agriculture will not sustain the population in rural areas; clear spatial strategies, ensuring the continued maintenance and growth of rural populations; targeted funding for rural areas is essential to ensure that infrastructure deficits in roads, telecommunications, water, public transport etc., do not inhibit rural growth, these funds in particular need to be targeted on declining and peripheral areas; provision that EU competition law does not operate in such a way that the provision of essential services becomes prohibitively expensive in rural areas; and recognition that enterprise support mechanisms need to ensure rural areas can compete for enterprise development.My Department is already delivering on some of these broad multi-sectoral policies. It implements a regeneration programme, CLÁR, targeted at areas of specific population decline. This programme co-ordinates existing sources of public and private finance and provides additional stimulus funding for the provision of small scale economic and social infrastructure to help rural communities overcome local difficulties, and access a range of essential services such as water supply, sewerage, road access, broadband communication, community and economic infrastructure, etc. This programme has vividly demonstrated that small amounts of public funding specifically targeted can have an significant impact on disadvantaged rural areas experiencing low or declining populations. Many farmers cannot generate an adequate income from farming and are often under-employed. To counter this problem I am establishing a rural social scheme to enable them to participate in work programmes and provide community-based rural services while farming normally. This can secure a reasonable income and an enhanced rural, social and physical environment for them. Such an integrated approach to rural development could be central to future EU rural development proposals.Rural communities also continue to receive support through current programmes such as Leader+ and the national Leader rural development programme as well as initiatives I have launched for rural enterprise and small food producers. We are about to enter a critical period in the formation of long-term rural development policy in the EU. The publication of the financial perspectives containing proposals on budget headings for rural development measures post-2006 is expected soon as are the Commission proposals for a future rural development programme. In bilateral meetings in Dublin Castle under the aegis of the Irish Presidency of the EU with the EU Commissioners responsible for rural affairs and regional policy I have made clear that my Department will take an active part in the discussions on future proposals for the direction of EU rural development policy. MEPs responded warmly to my vision for the future of rural Europe when I addressed the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in the European Parliament.To welcome the new member states to the EU family and at the same time open real debate on the living conditions of rural dwellers in rural Europe, my Department as part of Ireland's EU Presidency will host a conference entitled Improving Living Conditions and Quality of Life in Rural Europe from 31 May to 1 June 2004. The foregoing demonstrates that I have been productive in advancing an enhanced role for rural development at EU and national levels.

This funding is provided by way of grant aid to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme. These arrangements give a key role to voluntary organisations, create opportunities for them to develop links with older people in their areas and allow for a more flexible response to individual needs than a statutory delivery mechanism might allow. Voluntary or community-based groups seeking funding under the scheme must satisfy the defined criteria of the scheme, comply with Government tax clearance procedures and provide satisfactory accounts in respect of previously paid grants. I am anxious that this scheme continue to operate in a way that benefits the most vulnerable older people in our society. My Department is reviewing the administrative procedures which apply to the scheme in order to ensure that the needs of beneficiaries are met in a targeted and responsive manner. However, I have no plans to involve the Department in the direct administration of the scheme. The scheme for 2004 will be advertised in the national and provincial newspapers in a few months.

Rural development policy is set out in the White Paper on Rural Development which is being implemented primarily through the national development plan. As pointed out in the national spatial strategy, in many rural areas, the combination of a high dependency on a changing agricultural base, a scarcity of employment opportunities and resultant out-migration, has weakened demographic, economic, social and physical structure.The national spatial strategy adequately addresses my concerns about rural housing. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is finalising rural housing guidelines. The aim of the CLÁR programme is to alleviate the economic and social disadvantage suffered by those living in areas of low population density. This disadvantage is manifested in weak infrastructure and slower delivery of services than in more populated areas.

As regards decentralisation, I am working with my colleagues in Government to ensure that the ambitious programme announced on budget day is implemented on time and on target. I have initiated a small food producers' forum which has met several times to address the concerns of that sector. This will remain a priority for me in 2004.On 29 January, I announced the establishment of a countryside council and I am making up to €40,000 available this year to provide related research and supports. Since the commencement of Ireland's EU Presidency, I have held bilateral meetings in Dublin Castle with the EU Commissioners with responsibility for rural affairs and regional policy. I have also addressed the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in the European Parliament.In 2003 in response to similar questions from Deputies, I outlined my Department's activities in respect of Ireland's EU Presidency as including a conference on territorial cohesion in Galway from 25 to 27 May and a conference on rural development in Westport from 30 May to 1 June.

It also has responsibility for the work of the 14 local drugs task forces which were established in 1997 in the areas experiencing the worst levels of drug, particularly heroin, misuse. To date over €65 million has been allocated or spent on implementing the various projects contained in the two rounds of plans of the task forces; a further €11 million has been allocated to projects under the premises initiative which is designed to meet the accommodation needs of community-based drugs projects; and approximately €68 million has been allocated or spent under the first round of funding from the young people's facilities and services fund. Projects submitted under the second round plans are being assessed and I hope to be in a position to make allocations soon.Under the National Drugs Strategy 2001-08, regional drugs task forces have been established in the ten health board regions throughout the country. The task forces are mapping out the patterns of drug misuse in their areas — as well as the range and level of existing services — with a view to better co-ordination and addressing gaps in the overall provision.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	893	The purpose of the scheme, community support for older people is to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. Funding can be provided for small-scale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and locks and security lighting, the once-off cost of installing socially monitored alarm systems such as the "panic button" pendant which is worn around the neck or wrist and operated via the telephone. Funding is not provided for burglar or smoke alarms.To qualify for assistance under the scheme, people aged 65 or over must be living alone or in households made up exclusively of older people, or of older and other people who are dependent and vulnerable and be unable to install or purchase the security equipment or alarm system themselves. This funding is provided by way of grant aid to voluntary groups and organisations that have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme. Any voluntary or community-based organisation working with, or providing support for, vulnerable older people can apply. Grants are not made to individuals under this scheme. Details of all organisations funded under the 2003 scheme of community support for older people are available on the Department's website, www.pobail.ie. Individual applicants may contact any of these groups who will apply on their behalf to the Department for a grant. The scheme for 2004 will be advertised in the national and provincial newspapers soon.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	894	My Department was established to produce a co-ordinated engagement by the State with communities around the country, as they pursue their own development. A key challenge facing the Department in this regard is the number and complexity of structures involved in the delivery of local and community development programmes. Following the completion of the review of local and community development structures, I recently brought forward proposals, which Government has now agreed, designed to improve cohesion and focus across various measures. This included a recommendation, on the basis of maximising recourse to existing structures, that there should be no further expansion of the community development support programmes, after the completion of the current programme.Partnership 2000 committed the Government to identifying 30 priority areas for inclusion in the community development support programme. Community development projects were established in 15 of these areas last September. Apart from the remaining 15 actively targeted areas, it is not now intended, in light of the outcome of the review, to establish any further community development projects. Accordingly, as the project to which the Deputy refers is not one of the priority areas identified for a community development project under Partnership 2000, it will not be possible to fund it in the foreseeable future.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-04 00:00:00	Prelude	895	I understand the Deputy is referring to the rate of unemployment benefit payable to a person following participation on a community employment programme. Since 1996, community employment participants pay class A contributions on their community employment earnings. Workers who are unemployed following completion of a community employment scheme may therefore qualify or re-qualify for unemployment benefit by virtue of having paid class A PRSI contributions. Alternatively, where a person was in receipt of long-term unemployment assistance prior to commencing community employment and returns to the live register after any period on community employment he or she retains entitlement to long-term unemployment assistance including secondary benefits such as fuel allowance.From January 2004, unemployment benefit is paid at the full personal rate of €134.80 where a person's reckonable weekly earnings are €150 or more. If the reckonable weekly earnings are less than €150, the personal and qualified adult rates of payment are paid at reduced rates. A person who does not qualify for unemployment benefit, or is entitled to it at a reduced rate, may instead qualify for unemployment assistance, subject to a means assessment. The maximum personal rate of unemployment assistance payable is the same as full rate unemployment benefit, weekly €134.80.
